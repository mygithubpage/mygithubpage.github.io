      <li>Study vocabulary lists. “The Gruber GRE 3,400-Word List” begins on page 379.</li>
      <li>Learn those Latin and Greek roots, prefixes, and suffixes that make up many English words. It has been estimated that more than half of all English words come from Latin and Greek. “The Gruber Prefix-Root-Suffix List” begins on page 368. Also learn the “Hot Prefixes and Roots” in Appendix A beginning on page 719.</li>
      <li>Have a dictionary at home or look up meanings of words online. When you are on the move, you can use a dictionary app on your phone.</li>
      <li>Read—read—read. By reading a great deal, you will encounter new and valuable words. You will learn the meanings of many of these words by context—that is, you will perceive a clear connection between a new word and the words that surround that word. In this way, you will learn the meaning of that new word.</li>
      <li>Listen to what is worth listening to. Listen to good radio and TV programs. Listen to people who speak well. Go to selected movies and plays. Just as you will increase your vocabulary by reading widely, you will increase your vocabulary by listening to English that is spoken well.</li>
      <li>Play word games like crossword puzzles, anagrams, and Scrabble.</li>
      <li>Take vocabulary tests. “100 Tests to Strengthen Your Vocabulary” begins on page 428.</li>
