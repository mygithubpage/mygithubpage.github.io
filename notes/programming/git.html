          <h3>First-Time Git Setup</h3>
          <p>Git comes with a tool called <code>git config</code> that lets you get and set configuration variables that control all aspects of how Git looks and operates.</p>

          <section>
            <h4>Config Location</h4>
            Configuration variables can be stored in three different places:
            <ol>
              <li>
                /etc/gitconfig file: Contains values applied to every user on the system and all their repositories. If you pass the option --system to git config, it reads and writes from this file specifically. (Because this is a system configuration file, you would need administrative or superuser privilege to make changes to it.)
              </li>

              <li>
                ~/.gitconfig or ~/.config/git/config file: Values specific personally to you, the user. You can make Git read and write to this file specifically by passing the --global option, and this affects all of the repositories you work with on your system.
              </li>

              <li>
                config file in the Git directory (that is, .git/config) of whatever repository you’re currently using: Specific to that single repository.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <pre><code class="shell my-code">
              $ git config --global user.name "decisact"
              $ git config --global user.email decisact@example.com
            </code></pre>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h4>Your Identity</h4>
            <p>This is important because every Git commit uses this information. Again, you need to do this only once if you pass the <code class="shell">--global</code> option, because then Git will always use that information for anything you do on that system. If you want to override this with a different name or email address for specific projects, you can run the command without the <code class="shell">--global</code> option when you’re in that project.</p>
            <pre><code class="shell my-code">
              $ git config --global user.name "decisact"
              $ git config --global user.email decisact@example.com
            </code></pre>
