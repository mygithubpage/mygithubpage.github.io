The professor is discussing advertising strategies.</p><p>Professor (female): In advertising various strategies are used to persuade people to buy products. In order to sell more products, advertisers will often try to make us believe that a product will meet our needs or desires perfectly, even if it's not true. The strategies that they use can be subtle, friendly forms of persuasion that are sometimes hard to recognize.</p><p>In a lot of ads, repetition is a key strategy. Research shows that repeated exposure to a message, even something meaningless or untrue, is enough to make people accept it or see it in a positive light. You've all seen the car commercials on TV like, uh, the one that refers to its roomy cars over and over again. You know which one I mean. This guy is driving around and keeps stopping to pick up different people. He picks up three or four people. And each time, the narrator says, "Plenty of room for friends, plenty of room for family, plenty of room for everybody." The same message is repeated several times in the course of the commercial. Now the car, the car actually looks kind of small, it's not a big car at all, but you get the sense that it's pretty spacious. You'd think the viewer would reach the logical conclusion that the slogan miss-represents the product, instead, what usually happens is that when the statement "plenty of room" is repeated often enough, people are actually convinced it's true.</p><p>Um, another strategy they use is to get a celebrity to advertise a product. It turns out that we're more likely to accept an advertisement claim made by somebody famous, a person we admire and find appealing. We tend to think they're trustworthy. So, uh, you might have a car commercial that features a well-known race car driver. Now, it may not be a very fast car, uh, it could even be an inexpensive vehicle with a low performance rating. But if a popular race car driver is shown driving it and saying, "I like my cars fast!" Then people would believe the car is impressive with its speed. </p></article><section id="question"><h4>Question</h4><p>Using the examples from the talk, explain how persuasive strategies are used in advertising.</p></section><section><h5>Important Points</h5><p>Advertisers persuade people to buy their products by using persuasive strategies. One strategy is repetition of information (which may not be true information), such as when an advertisement for a small car keeps repeating that it has plenty of room. Another strategy is to use celebrities, because people trust them. For example, a famous race car driver might be used in an advertisement for a car (to give the impression the car is fast, even if it is not). </p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><article><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>The professor talks about two kinds of persuasive strategies in advertising. The first strategy is repetition. When a slogan is repeated enough times, we tend to believe what the slogan says. The example is a car commercial. A guy is driving around and keeps stopping to pick up different people, each time a narrative says "Plenty of room for friends", "Plenty of room for family" and so on. If we hear the slogan so many times, we tend to believe the car is spacious even if it's not. The second strategy is using celebrities. We believe celebrities are trustworthy. For example, in a car commercial, If a famous race-car driver is shown in a car and says "I like my car fast.", people will believe the car is fast even if it's actually not a very fast car.</p></article><h4>Notes: </h4><p><b>1.</b> two persuasive strategies used in advertising. <b>2.</b> repetition is a key strategy. repeated exposure to a message, even something meaningless or untrue, is enough to make people accept it. <b>3.</b> it's not a big car at all, but you get the sense that it's pretty spacious. <b>4.</b> when the statement "plenty of room" is repeated often enough, people are actually convinced it's true. <b>5.</b> get a celebrity to advertise a product.

First one is repetition. If a message appear many times, even it is true, people would it is right. For example, in a car commercial, the car looks very small but a slogan "plenty of rooms" appear many times and people would be convincing the car is spacious instead of thinking the slogan is wrong. Another strategy is using celebrity. people often consider celebrity is trustworthy. For instance, a race car driver driving car and says "I like the speed the car" in a car commercial. Even the car is slow. people would be impressed by the speed of the car.</p></article></div><div><p><b>Play Audio Track 102 to hear a high-level response for Question 6.</b></p><p><audio src="test_3_102.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></p><p><b>Rater’s Comments</b></p><p>The speaker conveys all of the main and supporting points from the lecture. His speech is clear and fluid, and although he does not pronounce subtle correctly, this is a minor error that does not interfere with overall understanding of his speech. His pacing slows down at times as he attempts to recall information, but it is still easy to follow what he is saying. He also uses a variety of advanced-level vocabulary and grammatical constructions with good control.</p><p><b>Play Audio Track 103 to hear a mid-level response for Question 6.</b></p><p><audio src="test_3_103.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></p><p><b>Rater’s Comments</b></p><p>This speaker discusses both advertising strategies described in the lecture, but in a vague way that is sometimes difficult to understand. For instance, he never mentions that the first example refers to a car advertisement, so it is unclear what he means when he says the message that lots of your friends have space in it is repeated. His pronunciation is easy to understand, but he pauses frequently throughout his response and demonstrates only a limited vocabulary range and control of grammar. </p></div></main></body></html>
