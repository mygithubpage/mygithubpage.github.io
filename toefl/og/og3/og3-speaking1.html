Explain why these characteristics are important to you.</p></section><section><h5>Important Points</h5><p>If you say being <b>patient</b> helps make someone a good parent, you could explain why by adding "<b>Children make a lot of mistakes as they learn and grow, and parents who are patient don't make their children nervous or fearful about making mistakes from time to time and that helps them grow into more confident adults</b>. You should be careful to avoid vague responses such as "Parents should be patient because this is good for children." Such statements do not make it clear why it is important for parents to be patient. </p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>I think a good parent should be patient. Because children are always confused with the things around them, they ask questions every now and then. A good parent should be patient enough to give them answers. When I was very young, I always asked questions like "Why can airplanes fly?" and "Why the earth is a globe?". My parents answered these questions patiently and if they couldn't, they would buy books that have the answers to my questions. I also think a good parent should be open-minded. In other words, they should respect their children's decisions when their kids are growing up. My parents always show their respect to my decisions. My major in the college is software engineering, but I decided to be an English teacher after graduation. My parents respected my decision and allow me to pursue my own interest. Thanks to my parents, I am patient and I respect other people.</p></article><article class="response"><h4>My Response</h4><p>Expressions: <b>Being Strict</b>, child follow parent's lead and set example for the child, parent will be a person the child to look up to; <b>Being Loving</b>, help child succeed and believe themselves. <b>Children make a lot of mistakes as they learn and grow, and parents who are patient don't make their children nervous or fearful about making mistakes from time to time and that helps them grow into more confident adults</b>.</p><p>I think a good parent need to have these 3 characteristics. First, parents need to trust their children, because trust can build a firm relationship between parents and children which could give the children more confidence. Second, parents need to listen to the children, children may have many questions or problem due  to their immaturity. So the parents need to listen to their question or problem and teach the children how to solve them. thus the children might gain the ability to solve the question or problem and being more mature. Third, parents need to communicate with their children, since children might be fearful for the mistake they made, in this situation, parents need to talk to their children and assist them to overcome the fear and face the mistake so the children could learn to be more tough.</p></article></div><div><p><b>Play Audio Track 92 to hear a high-level response for Question 1.</b></p><p><audio src="test_3_092.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></p><p><b>Rater’s Comments</b></p><p>The speaker's pronunciation is clear and her delivery is fluent. She chooses two characteristics—being strict and being loving—and supports each one, though she develops the first one in more detail. She uses a variety of appropriate vocab- ulary and phrases, such as follow the parents' lead and to look up to. She is also able to use appropriate word forms, such as strict and strictness, correctly and without hesitation.</p><p><b>Play Audio Track 93 to hear a mid-level response for Question 1.</b></p><p><audio src="test_3_093.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></p><p><b>Rater’s Comments</b></p><p>This speaker talks about three things good parents do: trust their children, listen to their children, and communicate with their children. However, the support for her ideas is vague and unclear; for example, she only says trust is very important but does not explain why. While her pronunciation is easy to understand, she pauses frequently in order to choose the next word, which makes her answer somewhat difficult to follow. Her basic grammar is adequate, but she is unable to use very advanced grammatical constructions; for example, she says children may be better understand, rather than better understood, by the parents. </p></div></main></body></html>
