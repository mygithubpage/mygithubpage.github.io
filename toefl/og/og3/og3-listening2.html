<span class="time" data-times="5.24" data-time="104.45">[01:44.45]</span>So hummingbirds have to <span class="highlight">rely</span> on plants in their natural <span class="highlight">habitat</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.95" data-time="109.69">[01:49.69]</span>And it goes without saying, but... well, the <span class="highlight">opposite</span> is true as well. <span class="time" data-times="2.39" data-time="114.64">[01:54.64]</span>Plants <span class="highlight">depend</span> on hummingbirds too. <span class="time" data-times="4.09" data-time="117.03">[01:57.03]</span>There are some flowers that can only be pollinated by the <span class="highlight">hummingbird</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.64" data-time="121.12">[02:01.12]</span>Without it stopping to feed and spreading <span class="highlight">pollen</span> from flower to flower, these plants would <span class="highlight">cease</span> to exist!</p><p><span class="time" data-times="17.59" data-time="128.76">[02:08.76]</span>But the problem, well... as natural <span class="highlight">habitat</span><span class="highlight">along</span> these <span class="highlight">migration</span> routes is developed by humans for housing or <span class="highlight">agriculture</span>, or, um, cleared for raising <span class="highlight">cattle</span>, for <span class="highlight">instance</span> ... there's less food <span class="highlight">available</span> for migrating hummingbirds. <span class="time" data-times="5.62" data-time="146.35">[02:26.35]</span>Their nesting sites are affected, too ... the same ... by the same sorts of human activities. <span class="time" data-times="5.37" data-time="151.97">[02:31.97]</span>And all of these activities <span class="highlight">pose</span> a real threat to the <span class="highlight">hummingbird</span><span class="highlight">population</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="18.11" data-time="157.34">[02:37.34]</span>So, to help them <span class="highlight">survive</span>, we need to <span class="highlight">preserve</span> their habitats ... And one of the <span class="highlight">concrete</span> ways people have been doing this is by cleaning up polluted <span class="highlight">habitat</span> areas and then replanting flowers, uh, replanting native flowers that hummingbirds feed on.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.52" data-time="175.45">[02:55.45]</span>Promoting <span class="highlight">ecological</span> tourism is another way to help <span class="highlight">save</span> their <span class="highlight">habitat</span>. <span class="time" data-times="10.91" data-time="180.97">[03:00.97]</span>As the number of visitors-ecotourists who come to <span class="highlight">hummingbird</span> habitats to watch the birds-the more the number of visitors grows, the more <span class="highlight">local</span> businesses profit. <span class="time" data-times="3.2" data-time="191.88">[03:11.88]</span>So <span class="highlight">ecological</span> tourism can bring <span class="highlight">financial</span> rewards. <span class="time" data-times="4.47" data-time="195.08">[03:15.08]</span>All the more <span class="highlight">reason</span> to value these beautiful little creatures and their <span class="highlight">habitat</span>, right?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="15.27" data-time="199.55">[03:19.55]</span>But to understand more about how to protect and support hummingbirds the best we can, we've gotta learn more about their <span class="highlight">breeding</span> ...nesting ... sites and, uh, <span class="highlight">migration</span> routes-and also about the natural habitats we find there. <span class="time" data-times="4.65" data-time="214.82">[03:34.82]</span>That should help us <span class="highlight">determine</span> how to prevent further <span class="highlight">decline</span> in the <span class="highlight">population</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.76" data-time="219.47">[03:39.47]</span>A good research <span class="highlight">method</span> ... a good way to learn more ... is by, um, running a banding study. <span class="time" data-times="4" data-time="226.23">[03:46.23]</span>Banding the birds allows us to <span class="highlight">track</span> them over their lifetime. <span class="time" data-times="2.66" data-time="230.23">[03:50.23]</span>It's a practice that's been used by researchers for years. <span class="time" data-times="19.06" data-time="232.89">[03:52.89]</span>In fact, most of what we know about hummingbirds comes from banding studies ... where we, uh, <span class="highlight">capture</span> a <span class="highlight">hummingbird</span> and make sure all the information about it-like ... its weight and, um, age and length-are all recorded ... put into international... an international information database. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="9.91" data-time="251.95">[04:11.95]</span>And, then we place an extremely lightweight <span class="highlight">band</span> around one of its legs ... well, what looks like a leg-although, technically it's considered part of the bird's foot.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.82" data-time="261.86">[04:21.86]</span>Anyway, these bands are perfectly safe. <span class="time" data-times="4.46" data-time="264.68">[04:24.68]</span>And some hummingbirds have worn them for years with no <span class="highlight">evidence</span> of any problems. <span class="time" data-times="10.52" data-time="269.14">[04:29.14]</span>The <span class="highlight">band</span> is labeled with a tracking number ...oh, and there's a phone number on the <span class="highlight">band</span> for people to call, for free, to <span class="highlight">report</span> a banded bird they've found or recaptured.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="10" data-time="279.66">[04:39.66]</span>So when a banded bird is recaptured and reported, we learn about its <span class="highlight">migration</span><span class="highlight">route</span>, its growth ... and how long it's been alive ... its life <span class="highlight">span</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.69" data-time="289.66">[04:49.66]</span>One recaptured bird had been banded almost 12 years earlier! <span class="time" data-times="2.55" data-time="294.35">[04:54.35]</span>She's one of the oldest hummingbirds on <span class="highlight">record</span>. <span class="time" data-times="11.67" data-time="296.9">[04:56.90]</span>Another interesting thing we've learned is ... that some hummingbirds, uh, they no longer use a certain <span class="highlight">route</span>; they travel by a different <span class="highlight">route</span> to <span class="highlight">reach</span> their <span class="highlight">destination</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="308.57">[05:08.57]</span>And findings like these have been of <span class="highlight">interest</span> to biologists and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> scientists in a number of countries, who are trying to understand the complexities of how changes in a <span class="highlight">habitat</span>... <span class="highlight">affect</span> the <span class="highlight">species</span> in it-species like the hummingbirds.</p></p></article></section><div id="question"><div id="question1"><p>What does the professor mainly discuss?</p><label class="my-label"><span>A.
