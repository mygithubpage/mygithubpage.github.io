Major changes in the migratory patterns of hummingbirds</p><p>B. The adaptation of hummingbirds to urban environments</p><p>C. Concern about the reduction of hummingbird habitat</p><p>D. The impact of ecotourism on hummingbird populations</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The content after But is today's theme. Option B does not match the facts in the article. The A option seems to be confused but the emphasis on impact and habitat loss leads to a reduction in their number, not change. Although there is mention of migratory, it is only to explain that it needs to consume a lot of energy during the migration, not to discuss the changes of their migration route....</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor imply might cause a decrease in the hummingbird population?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. An increase in the ecotourism industry</p><p>B. An increase in the use of land to raise crops and cattle</p><p>C. A decrease in banding studies</p><p>D. A decrease in the distance traveled during migration</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>This sentence clearly refers to the development of human agriculture and battle is the main cause of the reduction of habitat and the number of hummingbirds. A is contrary to the fact that the purpose of the ecotourism industry is to help protect hummingbirds. C, banding studies will not affect the number of hummingbirds. The distance of the migration in D showed no decrease in the professor's speech....</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor say people have done to help hummingbirds survive?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They have built a series of hummingbird feeding stations.</p><p>B. They have supported new laws that punish polluters of wildlife habitats.</p><p>C. They have replanted native flowers in once polluted areas.</p><p>D. They have learned to identify various hummingbird species.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>From the corresponding text, we can see that the professor mentioned how to help the hummingbird survive, that is, the contents of the C option. A, B did not mention that D does not help hummingbirds to survive....</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What way of collecting information about migrating hummingbirds does the professor mention?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Receiving radio signals from electronic tracking devices</p><p>B. Being contacted by people who recapture banded birds</p><p>C. Counting the birds that return to the same region every year</p><p>D. Comparing old and young birds' migration routes</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The message that can be drawn after the comprehension is to have a free phone call on the band where the hummingbirds are found, and to tell the researchers what they have observed. Then after induction, it is found in answer B. The radio signals in A cannot be used for tracking. C did not mention that D did not allow researchers to obtain data on specific hummingbirds....</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor imply researchers have learned while studying hummingbird migration?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Hummingbirds have totally disappeared from some countries due to recent habitat destruction.</p><p>B. Programs to replant flowers native to hummingbird habitats are not succeeding.</p><p>C. Some groups of hummingbirds have changed their migration patterns.</p><p>D. Some plant species pollinated by hummingbirds have become extinct.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Although the professor listed a lot of information for the collected information, but only this sentence is directly related to the hummingbird migration route. From no longer use a certain route it was seen that the hummingbirds changed their migration path. None of A.B.D mentioned it....</p></div></div><div class="replay" id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor imply when she says this?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. There is disagreement about the idea she has presented.</p><p>B. She does not plan to discuss all the details.</p><p>C. Her next point may seem to contradict what she has just said.</p><p>D. The point she will make next should be obvious to the students.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>It goes without saying that the professor fully believes what she will say next is very clear to the student. Obviously she does not want to correct or negate the previous idea, nor does it mean that she does not intend to say details. She discussed the details in the following statement....</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
