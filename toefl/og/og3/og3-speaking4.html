These contradictions can cause a kind of mental discomfort known as cognitive dissonance. People experiencing cognitive dissonance often do not want to change the way they are acting, so they resolve the contradictory situation in another way; they change their interpretation of the situation in a way that minimizes the contradiction between what they are doing and what they believe they should be doing.</p></article><div><audio src="og3-speaking4.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></div><article id="listening-passage" class="passage"><h3>Listening Text</h3><p>Now listen to part of a lecture about this topic in a Sociology class.</p><p>Professor (male) : This is a true story from my own life. In my first year in high school, I was addicted to video games. I played them all the time and I wasn't studying enough. I was failing Chemistry that was my hardest class.

So I asked myself if I wanted to be a sociologist. So I told myself my chemistry class didn't matter, because sociologist don't need to know chemistry. In other words, I changed my understanding of what it meant to do well in school. I reinterpreted my situation. I used to think that doing well in school meant doing well in all my classes.

People deal with cognitive dissonance by changing their interpretation of the situation. For example, the professor could not stop playing video games even though he believed it was causing him to fail chemistry. He then told himself that since he wanted to be a sociologist, he did not need to do well in chemistry. </p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><article><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>Cognitive Dissonance is a kind of mental discomfort people feel when they experience contradictions between their actions and their beliefs. The professor uses his own experience to illustrate this phenomenon. When he was in high school, he was addicted to video games. He didn't do well in study and even failed in chemistry. He knew he should study well in order to find good jobs and have a good career. But he just couldn't give up video games. And this was his conflict. His solution was to change his perspective. Chemistry was the only class he did badly. He was pretty sure that he wanted to be a sociologist and being a sociologist doesn't need to be well in chemistry. So he reinterpreted his understanding of doing well in school. Initially, he thought he should do well in all subjects to be successful in school. But then, he thought he should only do well in the subjects that are directly related to his future career. So he changed his belief to eliminate the conflict.</p></article><h4>Notes</h4><p>Reading: Contradiction between their actions and their beliefs, known as cognitive dissonance, People experiencing cognitive dissonance often do not want to change the way they are acting, they change their interpretation of the situation in a way that minimizes the contradiction.</p><p><b>Expressions:</b>The professor uses his own experience to illustrate this phenomenon.</p><p>Listening: <b>1.</b> story from my own life. <b>2.</b> in high school, addicted to video games. failing Chemistry. <b>3.</b> conflict for me because I wanted a good job when I grew up and I knew, that if you want a good career you gotta do well in school. <b>4.</b> But I just couldn't give up video games! <b>5.</b> change my perspective. <b>6.</b> chemistry class didn't matter, because sociologist don't need to know chemistry.

Her speech is fluid, and she uses intonation and stress effectively to convey emphasis and meaning—for example, by stressing the words actions and interpretation as a contrast to demonstrate how people deal with cognitive dissonance (by changing their interpretation of a situation rather than their actions). She uses advanced- level vocabulary with accuracy and ease. </p><p><b>Play Audio Track 99 to hear a mid-level response for Question 4.</b></p><p><audio src="test_3_099.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></p><p><b>Rater’s Comments</b></p><p>In this response, the speaker conveys the relevant information in the task, but not always with precision. For instance, when describing the professor's example, instead of saying the professor changed his interpretation of the situation, she says he began to make up his own opinion. Her pronunciation is clear, but her speech is marked by many pauses and hesitations. </p></div></main></body></html>
