Ecologists use the <span class="highlight">term</span> "<span class="highlight">succession</span>" to <span class="highlight">refer</span> to the changes that happen in plant communities and ecosystems over time. The first <span class="highlight">community</span> in a <span class="highlight">succession</span> is called a <span class="highlight">pioneer</span><span class="highlight">community</span>, while the long-lived <span class="highlight">community</span> at the end of <span class="highlight">succession</span> is called a <span class="highlight">climax</span><span class="highlight">community</span>. <span class="highlight">Pioneer</span> and successional plant communities are said to change over periods from 1 to 500 years. These changes-in plant numbers and the mix of <span class="highlight">species</span>-are <span class="highlight">cumulative</span>. <span class="highlight">Climax</span> communities themselves change but over periods of time greater than about 500 years.</p><p>An ecologist who studies a pond today may well find it <span class="highlight">relatively</span> unchanged in a year's time. <span class="highlight">Individual</span> fish may be replaced, but the number of fish will <span class="highlight">tend</span> to be the same from one year to the next. We can say that the properties of an <span class="highlight">ecosystem</span> are more <span class="highlight">stable</span> than the <span class="highlight">individual</span> organisms that <span class="highlight">compose</span> the <span class="highlight">ecosystem</span>.</p><p>At one time, ecologists believed that <span class="highlight">species</span><span class="highlight">diversity</span> made ecosystems <span class="highlight">stable</span>. They believed that the greater the <span class="highlight">diversity</span> the more <span class="highlight">stable</span> the <span class="highlight">ecosystem</span>. Support for this idea came from the <span class="highlight">observation</span> that long-lasting <span class="highlight">climax</span> communities usually have more <span class="highlight">complex</span> food webs and more <span class="highlight">species</span><span class="highlight">diversity</span> than <span class="highlight">pioneer</span> communities. Ecologists concluded that the <span class="highlight">apparent</span><span class="highlight">stability</span> of <span class="highlight">climax</span> ecosystems depended on their <span class="highlight">complexity</span>. To take an <span class="highlight">extreme</span> example, farmlands dominated by a single crop are so unstable that one year of bad weather or the <span class="highlight">invasion</span> of a single <span class="highlight">pest</span> can destroy the entire crop. In <span class="highlight">contrast</span>, a <span class="highlight">complex</span><span class="highlight">climax</span><span class="highlight">community</span>, such as a <span class="highlight">temperate</span> forest, will <span class="highlight">tolerate</span><span class="highlight">considerable</span> damage from weather to pests.</p><p>The question of <span class="highlight">ecosystem</span><span class="highlight">stability</span> is <span class="highlight">complicated</span>, however. The first problem is that ecologists do not all agree what "<span class="highlight">stability</span>" means. <span class="highlight">Stability</span> can be defined as <span class="highlight">simply</span><span class="highlight">lack</span> of change. In that case, the <span class="highlight">climax</span><span class="highlight">community</span> would be considered the most <span class="highlight">stable</span>, since, by <span class="highlight">definition</span>, it changes the <span class="highlight">least</span> over time. Alternatively, <span class="highlight">stability</span> can be defined as the speed with which an <span class="highlight">ecosystem</span> returns to a <span class="highlight">particular</span> form following a <span class="highlight">major</span><span class="highlight">disturbance</span>, such as a fire. This kind of <span class="highlight">stability</span> is also called <span class="highlight">resilience</span>. In that case, <span class="highlight">climax</span> communities would be the most <span class="highlight">fragile</span> and the <span class="highlight">least</span><span class="highlight">stable</span>, since they can <span class="highlight">require</span> hundreds of years to return to the <span class="highlight">climax</span><span class="highlight">state</span>.</p><p><span class="highlight">Even</span> the kind of <span class="highlight">stability</span> defined as simple <span class="highlight">lack</span> of change is not always <span class="highlight">associated</span> with <span class="highlight">maximum</span><span class="highlight">diversity</span>. At <span class="highlight">least</span> in <span class="highlight">temperate</span> zones, <span class="highlight">maximum</span><span class="highlight">diversity</span> is often found in mid-successional stages, not in the <span class="highlight">climax</span><span class="highlight">community</span>. Once a redwood forest matures, for example, the kinds of <span class="highlight">species</span> and the number of individuals growing on the forest floor are reduced. In general, <span class="highlight">diversity</span>, by itself, does not ensure <span class="highlight">stability</span>. Mathematical models of ecosystems <span class="highlight">likewise</span> suggest that <span class="highlight">diversity</span> does not <span class="highlight"><span class="question8">guarantee</span></span><span class="highlight">ecosystem</span><span class="highlight">stability</span>-just the <span class="highlight">opposite</span>, in fact. A more <span class="highlight">complicated</span> system is, in general, more likely than a simple system to <span class="highlight">break</span> down. A fifteen-speed racing bicycle is more likely to <span class="highlight">break</span> down than a child's tricycle.</p><p><span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>Ecologists are especially interested to know what factors <span class="highlight">contribute</span> to the <span class="highlight">resilience</span> of communities because <span class="highlight">climax</span> communities all over the world are being <span class="highlight">severely</span> damaged or destroyed by human activities. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>The <span class="highlight">destruction</span> caused by the <span class="highlight">volcanic</span><span class="highlight">explosion</span> of <span class="highlight">Mount</span> St.Helens, in the northwestern United States, for example, <span class="question10">pales</span> in <span class="highlight">comparison</span> to the <span class="highlight">destruction</span> caused by humans. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>We need to know what aspects of a <span class="highlight">community</span> are most important to the <span class="highlight">community</span>'s <span class="highlight">resistance</span> to <span class="highlight">destruction</span>, as well as its recovery. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p><p><span class="question11">Many ecologists now think that the <span class="highlight">relative</span> long-term <span class="highlight">stability</span> of <span class="highlight">climax</span> communities comes not from <span class="highlight">diversity</span> but from the "patchiness" of the environment, an environment that varies from place to place supports more kinds of organisms than an environment that is <span class="highlight">uniform</span>.</span> A <span class="highlight">local</span><span class="highlight">population</span> that goes <span class="highlight">extinct</span> is quickly replaced by immigrants from an <span class="highlight"><span class="question12">adjacent</span></span><span class="highlight">community</span>. <span class="highlight">Even</span> if the new <span class="highlight">population</span> is of a different <span class="highlight">species</span>, it can <span class="highlight">approximately</span> fill the <span class="highlight">niche</span> vacated by the <span class="highlight">extinct</span><span class="highlight">population</span> and keep the food web <span class="highlight">intact</span>.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">particular</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

They occur at the end of a succession.</p><p>B. They last longer than any other type of community.</p><p>C. The numbers of plants in them and the mix of species do not change.</p><p>D. They remain stable for at least 500 years at a time.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The penultimate sentence of the paragraph "These changes ï¿½ in plant numbers and the mix of species ï¿½ are cumulative" means that these changes in plant numbers and species mix are cumulative. So option C is wrong. The third sentence of the paragraph "The first community in a succession is called a pioneer community, while the long-lived community at the end of succession is called a climax community." means: The first community in the evolution is called the pioneer community, and then The longest lasting evolution is called the summit community. So options A, B are right. The last sentence of the paragraph "Climax communities themselves change but over periods of time greater than about 500 years." means that the top community is to be changed, but it is in a period of more than 500 years. So option D is right....</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 2, which of the following principles of ecosystems can be learned by studying a pond?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

Individual organisms are stable from one year to the next.</p><p>D. A change in the members of an organism does not affect an ecosystem's properties</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The last sentence of the paragraph "We can say that the properties of an ecosystem are more stable than the individual organisms that compose the ecosystem." means: We can say that the nature of an ecosystem is more stable than the nature of individual organisms that make up the system. . So Option A is actually a synonym for this sentence....</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 3, ecologists once believed that which of the following illustrated the most stable ecosystems?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Pioneer communities</p><p>B. Climax communities</p><p>C. Single-crop farmlands</p><p>D. Successional plant communities</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The phrase "At one time, ecologists believed that species diversity made ecosystems stable." means "Earlier, ecologists believe that species diversity makes the ecosystem stable." The next sentence "The believed that the greater the diversity the more stable "The ecosystem." Means: They believe that the greater the diversity of species, the more stable the ecosystem. The largest species diversity in the options is the climax communities....</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, why is the question of ecosystem stability complicated?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The reasons for ecosystem change are not always clear.</p><p>B. Ecologists often confuse the word "stability" with the word "resilience."</p><p>C. The exact meaning of the word "stability" is debated by ecologists.</p><p>D. There are many different answers to ecological questions.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The first two sentences of the paragraph "The question of an ecosystem stability is complicated, however. The first problem is that ecologist do not all agree what "stability" means." means that the problem of ecosystem stability is very complicated. The first problem is that ecologists do not agree with the meaning of "stability." So option C is correct....</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, which of the following is true of climax communities?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They are more resilient than pioneer communities.</p><p>B. They can be considered both the most and the least stable communities.</p><p>C. They are stable because they recover quickly after major disturbances.</p><p>D. They are the most resilient communities because they change the least over time.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The third sentence and fourth sentence of the paragraph "Stability can be defined as simply lack of change. In that case, the climax community would be considered the most stable, since, by definition, it changes the least over time." means: Sex can be simply defined as lack of change. In this case, the top community is considered to be the most stable, because by definition, the peak community changes the least with time. Paragraphs 5, 6, and 7 of the paragraph "Alternatively, stability can be defined as the speed with which an ecosystem returns to a particular form following a major disturbance, such as a fire. This kind of stability is also called resilience. In that case, "Climax communities would be the most fragile and the least stable, since they can require hundreds of years to return to the climax state." Means: On the other side, stability can be defined as that an ecosystem is suffering a major disturbance (such as a fire After returning to a specific form of speed. This kind of stability is also called elasticity. In this case, the summit community is the most vulnerable and unstable, because it may take several hundred years to return to its peak state....</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the following can be inferred from paragraph 5 about redwood forests?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.
