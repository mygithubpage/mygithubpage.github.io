            <b>The Long-term Stability of Ecosystems</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>Plant communities <span class="underline">assemble</span> themselves flexibly, and their <span class="light"><span class="underline">particular</span></span> structure depends on the <span class="underline">specific</span><span class="underline">history</span> of the area. Ecologists use the <span class="underline">term</span> "<span class="underline">succession</span>" to <span class="underline">refer</span> to the changes that happen in plant communities and ecosystems over time. The first <span class="underline">community</span> in a <span class="underline">succession</span> is called a <span class="underline">pioneer</span><span class="underline">community</span>, while the long-lived <span class="underline">community</span> at the end of <span class="underline">succession</span> is called a <span class="underline">climax</span><span class="underline">community</span>. <span class="underline">Pioneer</span> and successional plant communities are said to change over periods from 1 to 500 years. These changes-in plant numbers and the mix of <span class="underline">species</span>-are <span class="underline">cumulative</span>. <span class="underline">Climax</span> communities themselves change but over periods of time greater than about 500 years.</p>
          <p>An ecologist who studies a pond today may well find it <span class="underline">relatively</span> unchanged in a year's time. <span class="underline">Individual</span> fish may be replaced, but the number of fish will <span class="underline">tend</span> to be the same from one year to the next. We can say that the properties of an <span class="underline">ecosystem</span> are more <span class="underline">stable</span> than the <span class="underline">individual</span> organisms that <span class="underline">compose</span> the <span class="underline">ecosystem</span>.</p>
          <p>At one time, ecologists believed that <span class="underline">species</span><span class="underline">diversity</span> made ecosystems <span class="underline">stable</span>. They believed that the greater the <span class="underline">diversity</span> the more <span class="underline">stable</span> the <span class="underline">ecosystem</span>. Support for this idea came from the <span class="underline">observation</span> that long-lasting <span class="underline">climax</span> communities usually have more <span class="underline">complex</span> food webs and more <span class="underline">species</span><span class="underline">diversity</span> than <span class="underline">pioneer</span> communities. Ecologists concluded that the <span class="underline">apparent</span><span class="underline">stability</span> of <span class="underline">climax</span> ecosystems depended on their <span class="underline">complexity</span>. To take an <span class="underline">extreme</span> example, farmlands dominated by a single crop are so unstable that one year of bad weather or the <span class="underline">invasion</span> of a single <span class="underline">pest</span> can destroy the entire crop. In <span class="underline">contrast</span>, a <span class="underline">complex</span><span class="underline">climax</span><span class="underline">community</span>, such as a <span class="underline">temperate</span> forest, will <span class="underline">tolerate</span><span class="underline">considerable</span> damage from weather to pests.</p>
          <p>The question of <span class="underline">ecosystem</span><span class="underline">stability</span> is <span class="underline">complicated</span>, however. The first problem is that ecologists do not all agree what "<span class="underline">stability</span>" means. <span class="underline">Stability</span> can be defined as <span class="underline">simply</span><span class="underline">lack</span> of change. In that case, the <span class="underline">climax</span><span class="underline">community</span> would be considered the most <span class="underline">stable</span>, since, by <span class="underline">definition</span>, it changes the <span class="underline">least</span> over time. Alternatively, <span class="underline">stability</span> can be defined as the speed with which an <span class="underline">ecosystem</span> returns to a <span class="underline">particular</span> form following a <span class="underline">major</span><span class="underline">disturbance</span>, such as a fire. This kind of <span class="underline">stability</span> is also called <span class="underline">resilience</span>. In that case, <span class="underline">climax</span> communities would be the most <span class="underline">fragile</span> and the <span class="underline">least</span><span class="underline">stable</span>, since they can <span class="underline">require</span> hundreds of years to return to the <span class="underline">climax</span><span class="underline">state</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="underline">Even</span> the kind of <span class="underline">stability</span> defined as simple <span class="underline">lack</span> of change is not always <span class="underline">associated</span> with <span class="underline">maximum</span><span class="underline">diversity</span>. At <span class="underline">least</span> in <span class="underline">temperate</span> zones, <span class="underline">maximum</span><span class="underline">diversity</span> is often found in mid-successional stages, not in the <span class="underline">climax</span><span class="underline">community</span>. Once a redwood forest matures, for example, the kinds of <span class="underline">species</span> and the number of individuals growing on the forest floor are reduced. In general, <span class="underline">diversity</span>, by itself, does not ensure <span class="underline">stability</span>. Mathematical models of ecosystems <span class="underline">likewise</span> suggest that <span class="underline">diversity</span> does not <span class="underline">guarantee</span><span class="underline">ecosystem</span><span class="underline">stability</span>-just the <span class="underline">opposite</span>, in fact. A more <span class="underline">complicated</span> system is, in general, more likely than a simple system to <span class="underline">break</span> down. A fifteen-speed racing bicycle is more likely to <span class="underline">break</span> down than a child's tricycle.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A">
            </span>Ecologists are especially interested to know what factors <span class="underline">contribute</span> to the <span class="underline">resilience</span> of communities because <span class="underline">climax</span> communities all over the world are being <span class="underline">severely</span> damaged or destroyed by human activities. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>The <span class="underline">destruction</span> caused by the <span class="underline">volcanic</span><span class="underline">explosion</span> of <span class="underline">Mount</span> St.Helens, in the northwestern United States, for example, pales in <span class="underline">comparison</span> to the <span class="underline">destruction</span> caused by humans. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>We need to know what aspects of a <span class="underline">community</span> are most important to the <span class="underline">community</span>'s <span class="underline">resistance</span> to <span class="underline">destruction</span>, as well as its recovery. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p>
          <p>Many ecologists now think that the <span class="underline">relative</span> long-term <span class="underline">stability</span> of <span class="underline">climax</span> communities comes not from <span class="underline">diversity</span> but from the "patchiness" of the environment, an environment that varies from place to place supports more kinds of organisms than an environment that is <span class="underline">uniform</span>. A <span class="underline">local</span><span class="underline">population</span> that goes <span class="underline">extinct</span> is quickly replaced by immigrants from an <span class="underline">adjacent</span><span class="underline">community</span>. <span class="underline">Even</span> if the new <span class="underline">population</span> is of a different <span class="underline">species</span>, it can <span class="underline">approximately</span> fill the <span class="underline">niche</span> vacated by the <span class="underline">extinct</span><span class="underline">population</span> and keep the food web <span class="underline">intact</span>.</p>
