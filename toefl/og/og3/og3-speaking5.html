        <article>Listen to a conversation between two students.
(man) Hey, Marni, what's wrong?
(woman) Oh, I'm just struggling about what to do. I won an award from the Creative Writing Institute for a story I wrote and ...
(man) That doesn't sound like anything's wrong.
(woman) Well, it's a huge honor to win and there's an award ceremony they've invited me to attend which I'm so excited about, but, and here's what's frustrating: I've got a Biology exam that's scheduled for the same time.
(man) Uh oh, well, have you talked to your professor about this?
(woman) Yeah, she said I could write a five-page paper instead, and I have lots of ideas and know I could do a good job, but...
(man) But what?
(woman) Well, writing a paper would take up so much time, a lot more than studying for and taking the exam. I have lots of other school work to deal with.
(man) Oh! Or you could have someone else to receive the award for you. I mean, go in your place and accept on your behalf.
(woman) Maybe, I'll still get the award and the money that way.
(man) Oooh, you won money too?
(woman) Yeah, pretty cool, huh? But anyways, my parents were really looking forward to coming and seeing me on stage shaking hands with the Institute's president Knoff. I hate to disappoint them.
(man) True, I'm sure they are really proud.
(woman) Like I said, I'm still struggling about what to do.</article>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>

The woman won an award and is invited to attend the award ceremony. But her biology exam is scheduled at the same time. So she is struggling about what to do. There are two possible solutions. The first one is that she could write a 5-page paper instead of taking the exam. But she thinks writing a paper will take more time than preparing for and taking an exam. She's got many other things to do. The second solution is that she could ask someone else to receive the award on her behalf. But her parents were really looking forward to seeing her on the stage. Still, she's struggling. Well, I would recommend her to choose the first solution. Since she doesn't want to disappoint her parents, she has to try harder to win the time to attend the ceremony even though it'll take her more time to write the paper. It's the trade-off.</article>
