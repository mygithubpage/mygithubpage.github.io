I won an award from the Creative Writing Institute for a story I wrote and ...</p><p>(man) That doesn't sound like anything's wrong.</p><p>(woman) Well, it's a huge honor to win and there's an award ceremony they've invited me to attend which I'm so excited about, but, and here's what's frustrating: I've got a Biology exam that's scheduled for the same time.</p><p>(man) Uh oh, well, have you talked to your professor about this?</p><p>(woman) Yeah, she said I could write a five-page paper instead, and I have lots of ideas and know I could do a good job, but...</p><p>(man) But what?</p><p>(woman) Well, writing a paper would take up so much time, a lot more than studying for and taking the exam. I have lots of other school work to deal with.</p><p>(man) Oh! Or you could have someone else to receive the award for you. I mean, go in your place and accept on your behalf.</p><p>(woman) Maybe, I'll still get the award and the money that way.</p><p>(man) Oooh, you won money too?</p><p>(woman) Yeah, pretty cool, huh? But anyways, my parents were really looking forward to coming and seeing me on stage shaking hands with the Institute's president Knoff. I hate to disappoint them.</p><p>(man) True, I'm sure they are really proud.</p><p>(woman) Like I said, I'm still struggling about what to do. </p></article><section id="question"><h4>Question</h4><p>The speakers discuss two possible solutions to the woman's problem. Briefly summarize the problem. Then state which of the solutions you recommend and explain why. </p></section><section><h4>Important Points</h4><p>The woman won an award, but the ceremony to accept the award is at the same time as her biology exam. If you agree with the first solution, you would say that you think she should write a paper instead of taking the exam. You could support your choice by saying, for example, that even though this would take a lot of time, it would allow her to attend the ceremony, which is important because her parents would like to watch her get the award. If you choose the second solution, you would say that you think she should have someone else go to the ceremony and accept the award in her place. You could support your choice by saying, for example, that writing the paper would take too much time from studying for her other classes, which are important for her success as a student, and that her parents would surely understand and support that decision. </p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><article><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>The woman won an award and is invited to attend the award ceremony. But her biology exam is scheduled at the same time. So she is struggling about what to do. There are two possible solutions. The first one is that she could write a 5-page paper instead of taking the exam. But she thinks writing a paper will take more time than preparing for and taking an exam. She's got many other things to do. The second solution is that she could ask someone else to receive the award on her behalf. But her parents were really looking forward to seeing her on the stage. Still, she's struggling. Well, I would recommend her to choose the first solution. Since she doesn't want to disappoint her parents, she has to try harder to win the time to attend the ceremony even though it'll take her more time to write the paper. It's the trade-off.</p></article><h4>My Response</h4><p>The woman was invited to attend an award ceremony, but she also has biology exam scheduled at the same time. there are 2 solutions for this problem. she can write a 5-page paper instead of taking the exam or she could ask someone to receive the award for her. I prefer the second solution. writing the paper will take her more time than prepare for the exam and she has other school work need to finish. besides even she didn't show up on the award ceremony, her parents would not disappoint. since they understand what is more important their daughter.</p></article></div><div><p><b>Play Audio Track 100 to hear a high-level response for Question 5.</b></p><p><audio src="test_3_100.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></p><p><b>Rater’s Comments</b></p><p>This speaker is very fluent and conveys a great deal of information in the time allotted. Although she needed to state and support only the solution she is recommending, she chose to describe both solutions in her answer before recommending one. Because she is so fluent, describing both did not cause her to run out of time before she finished her response. She fully supported her recommendation. Her speech is easy to understand and well paced. She also demonstrates good control of both basic and more advanced grammar and vocabulary.</p><p><b>Play Audio Track 101 to hear a mid-level response for Question 5.</b></p><p><audio src="test_3_101.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></p><p><b>Rater’s Comments</b></p><p>The speaker runs out of time before she can fully support the solution she is recommending, which is to write the five-page paper. She also does not explain the problem very clearly at the beginning, never saying that the exam and award ceremony are at the same time. Her pronunciation is quite clear, and her pacing is good at the beginning but then becomes slower and choppy by the end of her response. </p></div></main></body></html>
