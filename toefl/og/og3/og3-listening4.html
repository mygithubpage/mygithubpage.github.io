            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.12" data-time="4.47">[00:04.47]</span>Student: Hi, Professor Archer, you know how in class last week you said that you were looking for students who are interested in volunteering for your archeology <span class="underline">project</span>?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.96" data-time="12.59">[00:12.59]</span>Professor: Of <span class="underline">course</span>, are you volunteering?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="0.93" data-time="14.55">[00:14.55]</span>Student: Yes, I am. <span class="time" data-times="5.97" data-time="15.48">[00:15.48]</span>It sounds really interesting, but um... do I need to have any experience for these kinds of projects?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.31" data-time="21.45">[00:21.45]</span>Professor: No, not really.<span class="time" data-times="8.31" data-time="22.76">[00:22.76]</span>I <span class="underline">assume</span> that most students taking the <span class="underline">introductory</span> <span class="underline">level</span> class would have little or no experience with archeological research, but that's ok.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.01" data-time="31.07">[00:31.07]</span>Student: Oh, good, that's a <span class="underline">relief</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.42" data-time="33.08">[00:33.08]</span>Actually, that's why I'm volunteering for the <span class="underline">project</span> - to get experience. <span class="time" data-times="1.66" data-time="37.5">[00:37.50]</span>What kind of work is it?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.63" data-time="39.16">[00:39.16]</span>Professor: Well, as you know, we're studying the <span class="underline">history</span> of the <span class="underline">campus</span> this <span class="underline">semester</span>. <span class="time" data-times="10.88" data-time="43.79">[00:43.79]</span>This used to be an agricultural area and we already know that where the main lecture hall now stands, there once were farm house and <span class="underline">barn</span> that were erected in the late 1700s. <span class="time" data-times="9.82" data-time="54.67">[00:54.67]</span>We are excavating near the lecture hall to see what types of artifacts we find, you know, things people used in the past that got buried when the <span class="underline">campus</span> was constructed. <span class="time" data-times="7.24" data-time="64.49">[01:04.49]</span>We've already begun to find some very interesting items, like old bottles, buttons, pieces of <span class="underline">clay</span> <span class="underline">pottery</span>.</p>

              <span class="time" data-times="1.5" data-time="71.73">[01:11.73]</span>Student: Buttons and <span class="underline">clay</span> <span class="underline">pottery</span>? <span class="time" data-times="4.85" data-time="73.23">[01:13.23]</span>Did the old owners leave in such a <span class="underline">hurry</span> that they left their clothes and dishes behind?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.15" data-time="78.08">[01:18.08]</span>Professor: Hmmm... that's just one of the questions we hope to answer with this <span class="underline">project</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.39" data-time="82.23">[01:22.23]</span>Student: Wow, and it's all right here on <span class="underline">campus</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.47" data-time="84.62">[01:24.62]</span>Professor: That's right, no traveling involved. <span class="time" data-times="4.59" data-time="87.09">[01:27.09]</span>I wouldn't <span class="underline">expect</span> volunteers to travel to a site, especially in the middle of the <span class="underline">semester</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.47" data-time="91.68">[01:31.68]</span>We <span class="underline">expect</span> to find many more things, but we do need more people to help.</p>

              <span class="time" data-times="3.92" data-time="96.15">[01:36.15]</span>Student: So... how many student volunteers are you looking for?</p>

              <span class="time" data-times="1.75" data-time="100.07">[01:40.07]</span>Professor: I'm hoping to get five or six. <span class="time" data-times="4.33" data-time="101.82">[01:41.82]</span>I've asked for volunteers in all of the classes I teach, but no one has responded. <span class="time" data-times="2.08" data-time="106.15">[01:46.15]</span>You are the first person to express <span class="underline">interest</span>.</p>

              <span class="time" data-times="2.64" data-time="108.23">[01:48.23]</span>Student: Sounds like it could be a lot of work. <span class="time" data-times="5.25" data-time="110.87">[01:50.87]</span>Is there um... is there any way I can use the experience to get some <span class="underline">extra</span> <span class="underline">credit</span> in class? <span class="time" data-times="2.22" data-time="116.12">[01:56.12]</span>I mean, can I write a paper about it?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.76" data-time="118.34">[01:58.34]</span>Professor: I think it'll <span class="underline">depend</span> on what type of work you do in the <span class="underline">excavation</span>, but I imagine we can <span class="underline">arrange</span> something. <span class="time" data-times="6.76" data-time="125.1">[02:05.10]</span>Actually I've been considering offering <span class="underline">extra</span> <span class="underline">credit</span> for class because I've been having a <span class="underline">tough</span> time getting volunteers. <span class="time" data-times="3.58" data-time="131.86">[02:11.86]</span> <span class="underline">Extra</span> <span class="underline">credit</span> is always a good <span class="underline">incentive</span> for students.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.36" data-time="135.44">[02:15.44]</span>Student: And how often would you want the volunteers to work?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.21" data-time="138.8">[02:18.80]</span>Professor: We're asking for three or four hours per week, depending on your <span class="underline">schedule</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.57" data-time="143.01">[02:23.01]</span>A <span class="underline">senior</span> researcher, I think you know John Franklin, my <span class="underline">assistant</span>, is on site every day.</p>

              <span class="time" data-times="9.35" data-time="153.02">[02:33.02]</span>Professor: Yes, er... I want to wait till Friday to see how many students <span class="underline">volunteer</span>, and then I'll <span class="underline">schedule</span> a training class next week at a time that's <span class="underline">convenient</span> for everyone.</p>
