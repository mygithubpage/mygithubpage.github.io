            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.01" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Listen to part of a lecture in an <span class="underline">astronomy</span> class.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.4" data-time="4.01">[00:04.01]</span>Professor: Now <span class="underline">astronomy</span> didn't really <span class="underline">bloom</span> into the science it is today until the <span class="underline">development</span> of spectroscopy.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.39" data-time="11.41">[00:11.41]</span>Spectroscopy is basically the study of spectra and spectral lines of light, and <span class="underline">specifically</span> for us, the light from stars. <span class="time" data-times="4.05" data-time="19.8">[00:19.80]</span>It makes it possible to <span class="underline">analyze</span> the light emitted from stars. <span class="time" data-times="9.26" data-time="23.85">[00:23.85]</span>When you <span class="underline">analyze</span> this light, you can <span class="underline">figure</span> out their distance from the Earth, and <span class="underline">identify</span> what they are made of, <span class="underline">determine</span> their chemical <span class="underline">composition</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.75" data-time="33.11">[00:33.11]</span>Before we get into that though, it's probably a good thing to back up a bit. <span class="time" data-times="10.37" data-time="37.86">[00:37.86]</span>You all know how when you take a <span class="underline">crystal</span> prism and pass a <span class="underline">beam</span> of sunlight <span class="underline">through</span> it, you get a <span class="underline">spectrum</span>, which looks like a <span class="underline">continuous</span> <span class="underline">band</span> of <span class="underline">rainbow</span> colors. <span class="time" data-times="8.22" data-time="48.23">[00:48.23]</span>The light that we see with our human eyes as a <span class="underline">band</span> of <span class="underline">rainbow</span> color falls in the <span class="underline">range</span> of what's called <span class="underline">visible</span> light. <span class="time" data-times="6.14" data-time="56.45">[00:56.45]</span>And <span class="underline">visible</span> light spectroscopy is probably the most important kind of spectroscopy.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.42" data-time="62.59">[01:02.59]</span>Anyone want to take a stab at the <span class="underline">scientific</span> <span class="underline">term</span> for <span class="underline">visible</span> light? <span class="time" data-times="4.58" data-time="67.01">[01:07.01]</span>And I'm sure all of you know this because you all did the reading for today.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.36" data-time="71.59">[01:11.59]</span>Student: <span class="underline">Optical</span> <span class="underline">radiation</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.05" data-time="73.95">[01:13.95]</span>But I thought being <span class="underline">exposed</span> to <span class="underline">radiation</span> is dangerous.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.69" data-time="78">[01:18.00]</span>Professor: Yes, and no. <span class="time" data-times="5.94" data-time="79.69">[01:19.69]</span>If you are talking about <span class="underline">radiation</span>, like in the <span class="underline">element</span> Uranium, yeah, that's dangerous. <span class="time" data-times="6.73" data-time="85.63">[01:25.63]</span>But <span class="underline">radiation</span> as a general <span class="underline">term</span> actually refers to anything that spreads away from its <span class="underline">source</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.97" data-time="92.36">[01:32.36]</span>So <span class="underline">optical</span> <span class="underline">radiation</span> is just <span class="underline">visible</span> light energy spreading out.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.61" data-time="97.33">[01:37.33]</span>OK, so we've got a <span class="underline">spectrum</span> of a <span class="underline">beam</span> of sunlight and it looks like the colors bleed into each other. <span class="time" data-times="7.81" data-time="103.94">[01:43.94]</span>There are no interruptions, just a <span class="underline">band</span> flowing from violet to green, to yellow, to... you get the idea. <span class="time" data-times="4.13" data-time="111.75">[01:51.75]</span>Well, what happens if the sunlight's <span class="underline">spectrum</span> is magnified? <span class="time" data-times="3.02" data-time="115.88">[01:55.88]</span>Maybe you all didn't do the reading. <span class="time" data-times="1.93" data-time="118.9">[01:58.90]</span>Well, here's what you'd see. <span class="time" data-times="5.65" data-time="120.83">[02:00.83]</span>I want you to notice that this <span class="underline">spectrum</span> is interrupted by dark lines called spectral lines. <span class="time" data-times="6.8" data-time="126.48">[02:06.48]</span>If you really <span class="underline">magnify</span> the <span class="underline">spectrum</span> of the sunlight, you could <span class="underline">identify</span> more than 100,000 of them. <span class="time" data-times="6.08" data-time="133.28">[02:13.28]</span>They may look like kind of randomly placed, but they actually form many <span class="underline">distinct</span> patterns. <span class="time" data-times="6.43" data-time="139.36">[02:19.36]</span>And if you were looking at the <span class="underline">spectrum</span> of some other star, the colors would be the same. <span class="time" data-times="5.7" data-time="145.79">[02:25.79]</span>But the spectral lines would <span class="underline">break</span> it up at different places, making different patterns. <span class="time" data-times="10.81" data-time="151.49">[02:31.49]</span>Each <span class="underline">pattern</span> stands for a <span class="underline">distinct</span> chemical <span class="underline">element</span>, and so different sets or patterns of spectral lines mean that the star has a different chemical <span class="underline">composition</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.58" data-time="162.3">[02:42.30]</span>Student: So how do we know which spectral patterns <span class="underline">match</span> up with which elements?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.5" data-time="166.88">[02:46.88]</span>Professor: Well, a kind of spectroscopic library of elements was compiled using <span class="underline">flame</span> tests. <span class="time" data-times="6.62" data-time="172.38">[02:52.38]</span>A known <span class="underline">element</span>, say a piece of iron for example, is heated in a <span class="underline">pure</span> gas <span class="underline">flame</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.24" data-time="179">[02:59.00]</span>The iron <span class="underline">eventually</span> heats to the point that it radiates light. <span class="time" data-times="4.68" data-time="183.24">[03:03.24]</span>This light is passed <span class="underline">through</span> a prism, which breaks it up into a <span class="underline">spectrum</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.77" data-time="187.92">[03:07.92]</span>And a <span class="underline">unique</span> <span class="underline">pattern</span>, kind of like a chemical fingerprint of spectral lines for that <span class="underline">element</span> appears. <span class="time" data-times="14.15" data-time="194.69">[03:14.69]</span>This <span class="underline">process</span> was repeated over and over again for many different elements, so we can <span class="underline">figure</span> out the chemical makeup of another star by comparing the spectral <span class="underline">pattern</span> it has to the <span class="underline">pattern</span> of the elements in the library.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.62" data-time="208.84">[03:28.84]</span>Oh, an interesting story about how one of the elements was discovered <span class="underline">through</span> spectroscopy. <span class="time" data-times="6.53" data-time="215.46">[03:35.46]</span>There was a <span class="underline">pretty</span> <span class="underline">extensive</span> library of spectral <span class="underline">line</span> patterns of elements <span class="underline">even</span> by the 1860s. <span class="time" data-times="9.76" data-time="221.99">[03:41.99]</span>A British <span class="underline">astronomer</span> was analyzing a spectrograph of sunlight, and he noticed a <span class="underline">particular</span> <span class="underline">pattern</span> of spectral lines that didn't <span class="underline">match</span> anything in the library. <span class="time" data-times="7.87" data-time="231.75">[03:51.75]</span>So he put two and two together, and decided there was an <span class="underline">element</span> in the sun that hadn't been discovered here on the earth yet.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.52" data-time="239.62">[03:59.62]</span>Any guesses about what that <span class="underline">element</span> is? <span class="time" data-times="4.33" data-time="242.14">[04:02.14]</span>It actually turned out to be <span class="underline">pretty</span> <span class="underline">common</span> and I'm sure all of you know it.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.48" data-time="246.47">[04:06.47]</span>OK. <span class="time" data-times="1.74" data-time="248.95">[04:08.95]</span>Let's try something else. <span class="time" data-times="5.36" data-time="250.69">[04:10.69]</span>Any of you happened to be <span class="underline">familiar</span> with the Greek word for "sun" by <span class="underline">chance</span>?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.36" data-time="256.05">[04:16.05]</span>Student: Something like "Helius" or something like that. <span class="time" data-times="1.59" data-time="259.41">[04:19.41]</span>Oh, it must be "Helium". <span class="time" data-times="3.34" data-time="261">[04:21.00]</span>So you are saying that Helium was discovered on the sun first.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="264.34">[04:24.34]</span>Professor: Yes, and this is a good example of how important spectroscopy is in <span class="underline">astronomy</span>.</p>
