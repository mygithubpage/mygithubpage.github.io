It is defined incorrectly in the textbook.</p><p>B. It was first used in the nineteenth century.</p><p>C. It is rarely used by astronomers.</p><p>D. It does not refer only to harmful energy.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>Students believe that exposure to radiation is dangerous, but in the case of light radiation, radiation like uranium is dangerous, but light radiation is emitted from a visible light source, so it is not dangerous.

The stars are probably of the same size.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The spectral lines of each star are composed of different patterns. Each pattern represents a different chemical element. In the text, if the patterns are different, it means that the chemical compositions of the two stars are different, and in turn, the reasoning is the same. The two stars have the same chemical composition....</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor, what is the purpose of heating an element in a spectroscopic flame test?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.
