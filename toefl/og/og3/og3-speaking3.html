            <b>Hot Breakfasts Eliminated</b>
          </h4>
          <p>Beginning next month, Dining Services will no longer serve hot breakfast foods at university dining halls. Instead, students will be offered a wide assortment of cold breakfast items in the morning. These cold breakfast foods, such as breads, fruit, and yogurt, are healthier than many of the hot breakfast items that we will stop serving, so health-conscious students should welcome this change. Students will benefit in another way as well, because limiting the breakfast selection to cold food items will save money and allow us to keep our meal plans affordable.</p>

          <p>Now listen to two students discussing the announcement.</p>
          <p>(woman) Do you believe any of this? It's ridiculous.</p>
          <p>(man) What do you mean? It is important to eat healthy foods.</p>
          <p>(woman) Sure it is! But they are saying a yogurt is better for you than an omelet or than hot cereal? I mean, whether something is hot or cold, that shouldn't be the issue. Let's say maybe on a cold morning, in that case, which is going to be better for you, a bowl of cold cereal or a nice warm omelet? It's obvious. There's no question.</p>
          <p>(man) I'm not gonna argue with you there.</p>
          <p>(woman) And this whole thing about saving money.</p>
          <p>(man) What about it?</p>
          <p>(woman) Well, they are actually going to make things worse for us, not better. Cause if they start to cutting back and we can't get what we want here on campus, well, we are going to going off campus and pay off-campus prices. And you know what? That'll be expensive. Even if it's only two or three mornings a week, it can add up. </p>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>Dining services will not serve hot breakfast food anymore. They only serve cold breakfast food.The woman in the conversation thinks the change is ridiculous. First of all,she thinks whether something is hot or cold doesn't necessarily mean it is healthy. She says that in a really cold morning, a nice warm omelet is obviously better than a bowl of cold cereal. Secondly, she thinks the change will not help save money. Because if the students can't get what they want from dining hall, they will go off-campus. Then they have to pay off-campus price,which is more expensive. So this change will not help save money but actually end up costing more.</p>
