Instead, students will be offered a wide assortment of cold breakfast items in the morning. These cold breakfast foods, such as breads, fruit, and yogurt, are healthier than many of the hot breakfast items that we will stop serving, so health-conscious students should welcome this change. Students will benefit in another way as well, because limiting the breakfast selection to cold food items will save money and allow us to keep our meal plans affordable.</p></article><div><audio src="og3-speaking3.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></div><article id="listening-passage" class="passage"><h3>Listening Text</h3><p>Now listen to two students discussing the announcement.</p><p>(woman) Do you believe any of this? It's ridiculous.</p><p>(man) What do you mean? It is important to eat healthy foods.</p><p>(woman) Sure it is! But they are saying a yogurt is better for you than an omelet or than hot cereal? I mean, whether something is hot or cold, that shouldn't be the issue. Let's say maybe on a cold morning, in that case, which is going to be better for you, a bowl of cold cereal or a nice warm omelet? It's obvious. There's no question.</p><p>(man) I'm not gonna argue with you there.</p><p>(woman) And this whole thing about saving money.</p><p>(man) What about it?</p><p>(woman) Well, they are actually going to make things worse for us, not better. Cause if they start to cutting back and we can't get what we want here on campus, well, we are going to going off campus and pay off-campus prices. And you know what? That'll be expensive. Even if it's only two or three mornings a week, it can add up. </p></article><section id="question"><h4>Question</h4><p>The woman expresses her opinion of the change that has been announced. State her opinion and explain her reasons for holding that opinion. </p></section><section><h4>Important Points</h4><p>The woman does not think that Dining Services should stop providing hot breakfast foods. She says that for health, the temperature of the food is not the issue (except on cold days, when warm food is better). She also says that the change will not make breakfasts more affordable, but rather will make them more expensive, since students will have to go off campus (where the prices are higher) to buy the food they want. </p></section><div><p><b>Play Audio Track 96 to hear a high-level response for Question 3.</b></p><p><audio src="test_3_096.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></p><p><b>Rater’s Comments</b></p><p>This response covers all the key points of the article and conversation with great clarity and supporting details.

They only serve cold breakfast food.The woman in the conversation thinks the change is ridiculous. First of all,she thinks whether something is hot or cold doesn't necessarily mean it is healthy. She says that in a really cold morning, a nice warm omelet is obviously better than a bowl of cold cereal. Secondly, she thinks the change will not help save money. Because if the students can't get what they want from dining hall, they will go off-campus. Then they have to pay off-campus price,which is more expensive. So this change will not help save money but actually end up costing more.</p></article><h4>Expressions:</h4><p><b>The woman in the conversation thinks</b>, there is no chance to save money</p></article><article class="response"><h4>My Response</h4><p>I think a good parent need to have these 3 characteristics. First, parents need to trust their children, because trust can build a firm relationship between parents and children which could give the children more confidence. Second, parents need to listen to the children, children may have many questions or problem due  to their immaturity. So the parents need to listen to their question or problem and teach the children how to solve them. thus the children might gain the ability to solve the question or problem and being more mature. Third, parents need to communicate with their children, since children might be fearful for the mistake they made, in this situation, parents need to talk to their children and assist them to overcome the fear and face the mistake so the children could learn to be more tough.</p></article></div><div><p><b>Play Audio Track 96 to hear a high-level response for Question 3.</b></p><p><audio src="test_3_096.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></p><p><b>Rater’s Comments</b></p><p>This response covers all the key points of the article and conversation with great clarity and supporting details.
