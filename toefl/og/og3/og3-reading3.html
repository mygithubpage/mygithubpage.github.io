This <span class="highlight">region</span> has a <span class="highlight">semiarid</span><span class="highlight">climate</span>, and for 50 years after its <span class="highlight">settlement</span>, it supported a low-intensity agricultural <span class="highlight">economy</span> of <span class="highlight">cattle</span> ranching and wheat farming. In the early twentieth <span class="highlight">century</span>, however, it was discovered that much of the High Plains was underlain by a huge <span class="highlight">aquifer</span> (a rock <span class="highlight">layer</span> containing large quantities of <span class="highlight">groundwater</span>). This <span class="highlight">aquifer</span> was named the Ogallala <span class="highlight">aquifer</span> after the Ogallala Sioux Indians, who once inhabited the <span class="highlight">region</span>.</p><p>The Ogallala <span class="highlight">aquifer</span> is a sandstone <span class="highlight">formation</span> that underlies some 583,000 <span class="highlight">square</span> kilometers of land extending from northwestern Texas to southern South Dakota. Water from rains and <span class="highlight">melting</span> snows has been accumulating in the Ogallala for the past 30,000 years. <span class="question3">Estimates <span class="highlight">indicate</span> that the <span class="highlight">aquifer</span> contains enough water to fill Lake Huron, but <span class="highlight">unfortunately</span>, under the <span class="highlight">semiarid</span><span class="highlight">climatic</span> conditions that presently exist in the <span class="highlight">region</span>, rates of <span class="highlight">addition</span> to the <span class="highlight">aquifer</span> are <span class="highlight">minimal</span>, amounting to about half a centimeter a year.</span></p><p>The first wells were drilled into the Ogallala during the <span class="highlight">drought</span> years of the early 1930's. The <span class="question4">ensuing</span> rapid <span class="highlight">expansion</span> of <span class="highlight">irrigation</span><span class="highlight">agriculture</span>, especially from the 1950's onward, transformed the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the <span class="highlight">region</span>. More than 100,000 wells now tap the Ogallala. Modern <span class="highlight">irrigation</span> devices, each <span class="highlight">capable</span> of spraying 4.5 million liters of water a day, have produced a <span class="highlight">landscape</span> dominated by geometric patterns of <span class="highlight">circular</span> green islands of crops. Ogallala water has enabled the High Plains <span class="highlight">region</span> to <span class="highlight">supply</span><span class="highlight">significant</span> amounts of the cotton, sorghum, wheat, and corn grown in the United States. In <span class="highlight">addition</span>, 40 percent of American grain-fed beef <span class="highlight">cattle</span> are fattened here.</p><p>This <span class="highlight"><span class="question6">unprecedented</span></span><span class="highlight">development</span> of a <span class="highlight">finite</span><span class="highlight">groundwater</span><span class="highlight">resource</span> with an almost <span class="highlight">negligible</span> natural <span class="highlight">recharge</span><span class="highlight">rate</span>-that is, <span class="highlight"><span class="question7">virtually</span></span> no natural water <span class="highlight">source</span> to <span class="highlight">replenish</span> the water <span class="highlight">supply</span>-has caused water tables in the <span class="highlight">region</span> to fall <span class="highlight">drastically</span>. In the 1930's, wells encountered <span class="highlight">plentiful</span> water at a depth of about 15 meters; currently, they must be dug to depths of 45 to 60 meters or more. In places, the water table is declining at a <span class="highlight">rate</span> of a meter a year, necessitating the <span class="highlight">periodic</span> deepening of wells and the use of ever-more-powerful pumps. It is estimated that at <span class="highlight">current</span> withdrawal rates, much of the <span class="highlight">aquifer</span> will run dry <span class="highlight">within</span> 40 years. The situation is most <span class="highlight">critical</span> in Texas, where the <span class="highlight">climate</span> is driest, the greatest <span class="highlight">amount</span> of water is being pumped, and the <span class="highlight">aquifer</span> contains the <span class="highlight">least</span> water. It is projected that the <span class="highlight">remaining</span> Ogallala water will, by the year 2030, support only 35 to 40 percent of the irrigated <span class="highlight">acreage</span> in Texas that is supported in 1980.</p><p>The <span class="highlight">reaction</span> of farmers to the <span class="highlight"><span class="question10">inevitable</span></span> depletion of the Ogallala varies. Many have been attempting to <span class="highlight">conserve</span> water by irrigating less frequently or by switching to crops that <span class="highlight">require</span> less water. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>Other, however, have adopted the <span class="highlight">philosophy</span> that it is best to use the water while it is still <span class="highlight">economically</span><span class="highlight">profitable</span> to do so and to <span class="highlight">concentrate</span> on high-value crops such as cotton. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>The <span class="highlight">incentive</span> of the farmers who wish to <span class="highlight">conserve</span> water is reduced by their knowledge that many of their neighbors are profiting by using great amounts of water, and in the <span class="highlight">process</span> are drawing down the entire <span class="highlight">region</span>'s water supplies. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span></p><p>In the face of the upcoming water <span class="highlight">supply</span> crisis, a number of grandiose schemes have been developed to <span class="highlight">transport</span><span class="highlight">vast</span> quantities of water by <span class="highlight">canal</span> or pipeline from the Mississippi, the Missouri, or the Arkansas rivers. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span><span class="highlight">Unfortunately</span>, the <span class="highlight">cost</span> of water obtained <span class="highlight">through</span> any of these schemes would increase pumping costs at <span class="highlight">least</span> tenfold, making the <span class="highlight">cost</span> of irrigated agricultural products from the <span class="highlight">region</span> uncompetitive on the national and international markets. <span class="highlight">Somewhat</span> more <span class="highlight">promising</span> have been recent experiments for releasing capillary water (water in the soil) above the water table by injecting compressed <span class="highlight">air</span> into the ground. <span class="highlight">Even</span> if this <span class="highlight">process</span> proves successful, however, it would almost triple water costs. Genetic <span class="highlight">engineering</span> also may provide a <span class="highlight">partial</span><span class="highlight">solution</span>, as new strains of drought-resistant crops continue to be developed. Whatever the final answer to the water crisis may be, it is <span class="highlight">evident</span> that <span class="highlight">within</span> the High Plains, <span class="highlight">irrigation</span> water will never again be the <span class="highlight">abundant</span>, inexpensive <span class="highlight">resource</span> it was during the agricultural <span class="highlight">boom</span> years of the mid-twentieth <span class="highlight">century</span>.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 1, which of the following statements about the High Plains is true?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Until farmers and ranchers settled there in the 1880's, the High Plains had never been inhabited.</p><p>B. The climate of the High Plains is characterized by higher-than-average temperatures.</p><p>C. The large aquifer that lies underneath the High Plains was discovered by the Ogallala Sioux Indians.</p><p>D. Before the early 1900's there was only a small amount of farming and ranching in the High Plains.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The original sentence "The vast grasslands of the High Plains...were settled by farmers and ranchers in the 1880's." 1880's lived. Looking back, "This region has a semiarid climate, and for 50 years after its settlement, it supported low-intensity agricultural economy of cattle ranching and wheat farming." Option A is wrong. The original mentions the Indians. Although it is not said before or after, it must be earlier than the farmer and the rancher. Option B is wrong, the original did not talk about temperature. Option C was wrong. It was not discovered by the Indians. It was in their name....</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 2, all of the following statements about the Ogallala aquifer are true EXCEPT:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The aquifer stretches from South Dakota to Texas.</p><p>B. The aquifer's water comes from underground springs.</p><p>C. Water has been gathering in the aquifer for 30,000 years.</p><p>D. The aquifer's water is stored in a layer of sandstone.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The second sentence of the paragraph "Water from rains and melting snows has been accumulating in the Ogallala for the past 30,000 years." means that water in rain and snow melt accumulated in Ogallala for 30,000 years. So Option B is wrong. The first sentence of the article "The Ogallala Aquifer is a sandstone formation that underlies some 583,000 square kilometers of land extending from northwestern Texas to southern South Dakota." means: The Ogallala aquifer is a sandstone structure with a total length of 583,000 square kilometers. From northwestern Texas to southern South Dakota....</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Despite the current impressive size of the Ogallala aquifer, the region's climate keeps the rates of water addition very small</p><p>B. Although the aquifer has been adding water at the rate of only half a centimeter a year, it will eventually accumulate enough water of fill Lake Huron.</p><p>C. Because of the region's present climatic conditions, water is being added each year to the aquifer.</p><p>D. Even when the region experiences unfortunate climatic conditions, the rates of addition of water continue to increase.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The bright sentence means: We estimate that the aquifer has accumulated enough water to fill Huron Lake, but unfortunately, in the semi-arid climate of this region, the aquifer storage rate is very low, only one year. Can accumulate half a centimeter of water. Option A correctly describes the main meaning of this sentence, correct. Option B is wrong in that "it can still be filled with Lake Huron". The meaning of the original sentence is that it can be full, but due to climatic reasons, the speed of water storage is very slow; Option C is wrong in the omission of "slow water storage". This key message; Option D is wrong in "The water storage rate is increasing." This is the information not mentioned in the original text....</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question4">ensuing</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

To suggest that crop cultivation is not the most important part of the economy of the High Plains</p><p>B. To indicate that not all economic activity in the High Plains is dependent on irrigation</p><p>C. To provide another example of how water from the Ogallala has transformed the economy of the High Plains</p><p>D. To contrast cattle-fattening practices in the High Plains with those used in other region of the United States</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>"In addition, 40 percent of American grain-fed beef cattle are fattened here." means "In addition, 40% of U.S. cattle are fattened in High Plains." Going forward to read "Ogallala water has enabled the High Plains region to supply significant amounts of the cotton, sorghum, wheat, and corn grown in the United States." means: Ogallala water makes the High Plains area sufficient to supply cotton grown in the United States. Highlights wheat and corn. So these two sentences are all about how Ogallala water affects the U.S. economy....</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question6">unprecedented</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

The recharge rate of the aquifer is decreasing.</p><p>B. Water tables in the region are becoming increasingly lower.</p><p>C. Wells now have to be dug to much greater depths than before.</p><p>D. Increasingly powerful pumps are needed to draw water from the aquifer.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The first sentence of the paragraph "This <span class="question6">unprecedented</span> development of a finite groundwater resource .....has caused water tables in the region to fall drastically."means: an <span class="question6">unprecedented</span> development of limited underground resources; plus a negligible natural replenishment rate ( That is, almost no water will supplement the water supply, leading to a sharp drop in the water level in this area. So option B is right; the next sentence "In the 1930's, wells encountered plentiful water at a depth of about 15 meters; currently, they must be dug to depths of 45 to 60 meters or more." means: in the 1930s, Wells reach a depth of 15 meters will encounter sufficient water; now they are dug to 45 to 60 meters or even deeper. So option C is right; look at the next sentence "In places, the water table is declining at a rate of a meter a year, necessitating the periodic deepening of wells and the use of ever-more-powerful pumps." means: some places The water level drops at a rate of one meter per year, prompting the wells to periodically deepen and use stronger water pumps. So option D is right. The paragraph did not address the problem of the drop in the rate of replenishment, so the option was wrong....</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, compared with all other states that use Ogallala water for irrigation, Texas</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.
