          <h4 class="w3-center">Depletion of the Ogallala Aquifer</h4>
          <p>The <span class="highlight">vast</span> grasslands of the High Plains in the central United States were settled by farmers and ranchers in the 1880's. This <span class="highlight">region</span> has a <span class="highlight">semiarid</span> <span class="highlight">climate</span>, and for 50 years after its <span class="highlight">settlement</span>, it supported a low-intensity agricultural <span class="highlight">economy</span> of <span class="highlight">cattle</span> ranching and wheat farming. In the early twentieth <span class="highlight">century</span>, however, it was discovered that much of the High Plains was underlain by a huge <span class="highlight">aquifer</span> (a rock <span class="highlight">layer</span> containing large quantities of <span class="highlight">groundwater</span>). This <span class="highlight">aquifer</span> was named the Ogallala <span class="highlight">aquifer</span> after the Ogallala Sioux Indians, who once inhabited the <span class="highlight">region</span>.</p>
          <p>The Ogallala <span class="highlight">aquifer</span> is a sandstone <span class="highlight">formation</span> that underlies some 583,000 <span class="highlight">square</span> kilometers of land extending from northwestern Texas to southern South Dakota. Water from rains and <span class="highlight">melting</span> snows has been accumulating in the Ogallala for the past 30,000 years. <span class="question3">Estimates <span class="highlight">indicate</span> that the <span class="highlight">aquifer</span> contains enough water to fill Lake Huron, but <span class="highlight">unfortunately</span>, under the <span class="highlight">semiarid</span> <span class="highlight">climatic</span> conditions that presently exist in the <span class="highlight">region</span>, rates of <span class="highlight">addition</span> to the <span class="highlight">aquifer</span> are <span class="highlight">minimal</span>, amounting to about half a centimeter a year.</span></p>
          <p>The first wells were drilled into the Ogallala during the <span class="highlight">drought</span> years of the early 1930's. The <span class="question4">ensuing</span> rapid <span class="highlight">expansion</span> of <span class="highlight">irrigation</span> <span class="highlight">agriculture</span>, especially from the 1950's onward, transformed the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the <span class="highlight">region</span>. More than 100,000 wells now tap the Ogallala. Modern <span class="highlight">irrigation</span> devices, each <span class="highlight">capable</span> of spraying 4.5 million liters of water a day, have produced a <span class="highlight">landscape</span> dominated by geometric patterns of <span class="highlight">circular</span> green islands of crops. Ogallala water has enabled the High Plains <span class="highlight">region</span> to <span class="highlight">supply</span> <span class="highlight">significant</span> amounts of the cotton, sorghum, wheat, and corn grown in the United States. In <span class="highlight">addition</span>, 40 percent of American grain-fed beef <span class="highlight">cattle</span> are fattened here.</p>
          <p>This <span class="highlight"><span class="question6">unprecedented</span></span> <span class="highlight">development</span> of a <span class="highlight">finite</span> <span class="highlight">groundwater</span> <span class="highlight">resource</span> with an almost <span class="highlight">negligible</span> natural <span class="highlight">recharge</span> <span class="highlight">rate</span>-that is, <span class="highlight"><span class="question7">virtually</span></span> no natural water <span class="highlight">source</span> to <span class="highlight">replenish</span> the water <span class="highlight">supply</span>-has caused water tables in the <span class="highlight">region</span> to fall <span class="highlight">drastically</span>. In the 1930's, wells encountered <span class="highlight">plentiful</span> water at a depth of about 15 meters; currently, they must be dug to depths of 45 to 60 meters or more. In places, the water table is declining at a <span class="highlight">rate</span> of a meter a year, necessitating the <span class="highlight">periodic</span> deepening of wells and the use of ever-more-powerful pumps. It is estimated that at <span class="highlight">current</span> withdrawal rates, much of the <span class="highlight">aquifer</span> will run dry <span class="highlight">within</span> 40 years. The situation is most <span class="highlight">critical</span> in Texas, where the <span class="highlight">climate</span> is driest, the greatest <span class="highlight">amount</span> of water is being pumped, and the <span class="highlight">aquifer</span> contains the <span class="highlight">least</span> water. It is projected that the <span class="highlight">remaining</span> Ogallala water will, by the year 2030, support only 35 to 40 percent of the irrigated <span class="highlight">acreage</span> in Texas that is supported in 1980.</p>
          <p>The <span class="highlight">reaction</span> of farmers to the <span class="highlight"><span class="question10">inevitable</span></span> depletion of the Ogallala varies. Many have been attempting to <span class="highlight">conserve</span> water by irrigating less frequently or by switching to crops that <span class="highlight">require</span> less water. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>Other, however, have adopted the <span class="highlight">philosophy</span> that it is best to use the water while it is still <span class="highlight">economically</span> <span class="highlight">profitable</span> to do so and to <span class="highlight">concentrate</span> on high-value crops such as cotton. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>The <span class="highlight">incentive</span> of the farmers who wish to <span class="highlight">conserve</span> water is reduced by their knowledge that many of their neighbors are profiting by using great amounts of water, and in the <span class="highlight">process</span> are drawing down the entire <span class="highlight">region</span>'s water supplies. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span></p>
          <p>In the face of the upcoming water <span class="highlight">supply</span> crisis, a number of grandiose schemes have been developed to <span class="highlight">transport</span> <span class="highlight">vast</span> quantities of water by <span class="highlight">canal</span> or pipeline from the Mississippi, the Missouri, or the Arkansas rivers. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span> <span class="highlight">Unfortunately</span>, the <span class="highlight">cost</span> of water obtained <span class="highlight">through</span> any of these schemes would increase pumping costs at <span class="highlight">least</span> tenfold, making the <span class="highlight">cost</span> of irrigated agricultural products from the <span class="highlight">region</span> uncompetitive on the national and international markets. <span class="highlight">Somewhat</span> more <span class="highlight">promising</span> have been recent experiments for releasing capillary water (water in the soil) above the water table by injecting compressed <span class="highlight">air</span> into the ground. <span class="highlight">Even</span> if this <span class="highlight">process</span> proves successful, however, it would almost triple water costs. Genetic <span class="highlight">engineering</span> also may provide a <span class="highlight">partial</span> <span class="highlight">solution</span>, as new strains of drought-resistant crops continue to be developed. Whatever the final answer to the water crisis may be, it is <span class="highlight">evident</span> that <span class="highlight">within</span> the High Plains, <span class="highlight">irrigation</span> water will never again be the <span class="highlight">abundant</span>, inexpensive <span class="highlight">resource</span> it was during the agricultural <span class="highlight">boom</span> years of the mid-twentieth <span class="highlight">century</span>.</p>

              <p>The first sentence of the paragraph "This <span class="question6">unprecedented</span> development of a finite groundwater resource .....has caused water tables in the region to fall drastically."means: an <span class="question6">unprecedented</span> development of limited underground resources; plus a negligible natural replenishment rate ( That is, almost no water will supplement the water supply, leading to a sharp drop in the water level in this area. So option B is right; the next sentence "In the 1930's, wells encountered plentiful water at a depth of about 15 meters; currently, they must be dug to depths of 45 to 60 meters or more." means: in the 1930s, Wells reach a depth of 15 meters will encounter sufficient water; now they are dug to 45 to 60 meters or even deeper. So option C is right; look at the next sentence "In places, the water table is declining at a rate of a meter a year, necessitating the periodic deepening of wells and the use of ever-more-powerful pumps." means: some places The water level drops at a rate of one meter per year, prompting the wells to periodically deepen and use stronger water pumps. So option D is right. The paragraph did not address the problem of the drop in the rate of replenishment, so the option was wrong....</p>
