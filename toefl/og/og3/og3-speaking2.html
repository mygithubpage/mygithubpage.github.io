Others believe it is better to work in a group. Which do you prefer? Explain why.</p></section><section id="sample-response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><article><p>I prefer to work on assignments individually. There are two reasons. The first is that I like to be in a quiet place while studying. If I study in a group, I will always be interrupted by group members who talk about irrelevant things. Then it's possible that I can't even finish the assignments. Once, I attended a group discussion. Many people were not even discussing. They were just talking about NBA games. When it ended, I got nothing from it. The second reason is that I'd like to think independently. Studying individually gives me enough time to develop my own ideas. When studying in a group, I will always be distracted by other's opinions and thoughts. So sometimes many assignments are not done by myself but by other group members. Like last week, I worked in a group to solve math problems. It turned out that many problems were solved by others not by myself. I felt very unhappy about it.</p></article></section></main></body></html>
