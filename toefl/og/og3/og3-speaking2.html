Others believe it is better to work in a group. Which do you prefer? Explain why.</p></section><h4>Sample Response</h4><div id="responses"><article class="response"><section><h5>Important Points</h5><p>You should not simply give a list of reasons, such as "I prefer to work in groups because it is more interesting plus many people help and also you can learn from other people It is better if you develop one or two reasons fully. For example, if you prefer to work in groups, you could say, "I prefer working in groups because usually in group work, different people know different things about the topic, and because of that, you get a deeper understanding of the assignment. For example, there was a student from Venezuela in a group assignment I had, and we were supposed to describe how crude oil prices are set. She helped us understand problems in oil production in a much deeper way because her parents worked in oil production.</p></section><p><b>Play Audio Track 94 to hear a high-level response for Question 2.</b></p><p><audio src="test_3_094.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></p><p><b>Rater’s Comments</b></p><p>This is a fully developed response to the question. She gives two reasons for preferring to work by herself—having strong opinions and managing time well—and gives a clear explanation of why each is more suitable for working alone. Her speech is fluent, and she uses appropriate intonation and stress on certain words (such as "I" in the way I see them) to convey meaning. She uses advanced-level vocabulary, such as a structured approach, and high-level grammatical constructions with ease.</p><p><b>Play Audio Track 95 to hear a low-level response for Question 2.</b></p><p><audio src="test_3_095.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></p><p><b>Rater’s Comments</b></p><p>While her pronunciation is clear, this speaker struggles and often fails to come up with words to express her meaning, such as using good things rather than the more appropriate and specific advantages or benefits. Since she spends time trying to describe benefits of both group work and working alone, she ran out of time before she could support her true preference for working alone, other than saying it allows more independence. Her answer is very choppy and vague. She does not demonstrate that she has command of grammar beyond a very basic level. </p></article></div><article><p>I prefer to work on assignments individually. There are two reasons. The first is that I like to be in a quiet place while studying. If I study in a group, I will always be interrupted by group members who talk about irrelevant things. Then it's possible that I can't even finish the assignments. Once, I attended a group discussion. Many people were not even discussing. They were just talking about other stuff. When it ended, I got nothing from it. The second reason is that I'd like to think independently. Studying individually gives me enough time to develop my own ideas. When studying in a group, I will always be distracted by other's opinions and thoughts. So sometimes many assignments are not done by myself but by other group members. Like last week, I worked in a group to solve math problems. It turned out that many problems were solved by others not by myself. I felt very unhappy about it.</p></article></main></body></html>
