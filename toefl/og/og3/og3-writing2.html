        <p>In a lifetime, we are bound to meet many people, we get on well with some of them and they become our friends. As we grow up we meet new people and make new friends but it does not imply that they will replace our old ones. That is why I disagree with people who think that keeping old friends is more important than making new friends.</p>
        <p>I think that there is no matter of more importance. Since old friends and new friends do not bring us the same things, we can not compare them. Indeed old friends are the ones we can count on; we trust them, they know us well, we have complicity and real friendship is just wondrful. When I feel sad or when I need to talk to someone about a serious problem, Igo to see my old friends because they are reliable and I know that they will understand me more than anyone else. My old friends are very important to me and I agree with the fact that it is important to keep them and make efforts to keep contact.</p>
        <p>However, I must admit that we are bound to lose some of our old friends some times. For example, I had a very good friend a few years ago but we do not see each other anymore since I moved in an other town. I guess that we also grew up and took a different way and there is no use to keep old friends when you realize that you have nothing left in common.</p>
        <p>Therefore, it is also very important to make new friends. That is a way to learn, to change and they bring us different things. Making new friends makes us more open-minded, and in this way we can discover new personalities. For my part I enjoy making new friends, at school, at work, on holidays. I am conscious not to have close relationships with them at first but I need to be with other people and have fun. Sometimes they just remain acquaintances but they can also become good friends who could become old friends one day. For instance, I met a german girl on holiday two years ago and we got on very well, sowe kept in touch and I went to visit her in Germany twice. She belongs to this kind of people who you know that they will be important in your life, and who you know you can have a long and strong friendship with.</p>
        <p>As a conclusion I would say that everybody need to have a at least few real and strong friendship.</p>

        <p>This level 5 essay effectively responds to the question by arguing the importance of having both old and new friends. The essay is organized logically, beginning with an introductory paragraph that states a clear thesis and continuing with three body paragraphs that develop distinct reasons that support the thesis. Each of the writer's points is well developed with appropriate details and exam ples. The first point, that old friends are reliable and understanding, is supported by the idea that old friends can help with serious problems. This is followed in the third paragraph by the idea that it is sometimes possible to lose old friend ships. Here, the writer gives the example of losing a friend because ofa move and no longer having anything in common. This third paragraph provides a nice connection between the ideas of wanting to keep old friends in the second para graph and needing to make new friends in the fourth paragraph. This cohesion is also accomplished by using effective transitions ("However, I must admit," "Therefore, it is also very important to make new friends."). The final point, that it is important to make new friends, is also well supported by details about learning new things. The essay is rounded out by a personal example that shows that new friends can become old friends. Overall, this essay has nice progression and displays consistently strong language. The few language errors ("moved in an other town," "She belongs to this kind of people who you know ) that do exist do not interfere with meaning and are not prevalent enough to lower the essay's score.</p>

        <p>In the following essay I would like to express my opinion in regard to the thesis “It is more important to keep your old friends than it is to make new friends”.</p>
        <p>On the one hand, you could always say that making new friends is a lot more entertaining than keeping in touch with the old ones. There are new topics to talk about, new activities to do together, new personality traits to discover... Additionally, you also get to meet the persons who are close to your new friends. And maybe you will even receive a whole group of new friends by making one new friend.</p>
        <p> However, you could also say that it makes much more sense to keep in touch with your old friends since they are your true friends. Firstly, you already know how they react to certain situations and therefore you know how to treat them to get along well. Secondly, I am of the conviction that it is certain that in a bit more peculiar and maybe a bit unpleasant situations it is a lot more likely that your old friends will help you out than that someone you have met barely a week ago would do the same.</p>
        <p>I have to admit that I personally came to the conclusion that I need my old friends as well as my new friends. For me they are both equally important. I adore keeping in touch with my old friends and knowing how they will react in most situations. Of course, over the years some sort of bond and a special kind of trust has developed with my long-time friends.</p>
        <p>However, I immensely enjoy making new friends as well. I enjoy trying out new activities and making new friends there. Furthermore, I like making friends from all kinds of different cultures and countries. And I am certain that this kind of attitude makes life much more interesting. Plus, I believe that new friends will also broaden your horizon because their beliefs may differ from your own.</p>
        <p>Personally, I am convinced that nobody has to decide between old friends and new friends since the possibily of keeping the old friends and making new ones always exists. Therefore as a final statement I would like to say “Cherish you old friends and enjoy making new ones as well”.</p>
        <h5>Rater Comments</h5>
        <p>This essay effectively addresses the topic with clear language and appropriate details, earning it a score of 5. The writer gradually develops the idea that it is not necessary to choose between having old or new friends. Initially, the writer examines both sides of the issue: the benefits of making new friends in paragraph 2 and of keeping old friends in paragraph 3. These are treated with equal value and logically lead to the author’s opinion in paragraph 4 that both old and new friends are equally important. This is well supported by details such as the importance of trust in old friendships and the excitement of new experiences in new friendships. This leads to an effective concluding paragraph that states the thesis and makes the writer’s overall intent clear. The language throughout the essay is strong, with only minor weaknesses or possibly just slipups in typing (“than that someone you have met barely a week ago would do the same”) that do not detract from the quality of the writing. The use of transitions throughout the response generally helps the essay to progress and adds to the effectiveness of the writing.</p>

        <p>My personal experience showed me that both keeping old friends and making new ones is important: it depends on the different needs of life.</p>
        <p>When I left my country to move in France for studing I tried to keep in contact with all my Italian friends in order to feel less far from home and to keep in mind where I am from, expecially in some moments of lonelyness. After several mounths nearly all the persons I considered as ‘’friends’’ keeped less and less in contact with me, making me understand that we were experiencing different stages of our life and therefore it was difficult to keep the same relationship we had before because everyone was growing in a different way.</p>
        <p>In the meanwhile I found new friends at university and I started to discover new kinds of relationships, sometimes very different from the ones I was habitued to. For exemple at the beginning I found very strange the fact that French young people use to see each others in the ‘’cafe`’’ and spend their time and their money there smooking, chatting and drinking. With my Italian friends we use to see each other outside, near the seaside for a volleyball match indeed or at someones`s home in the evening to make a pizza party togheter, without spending too much money.</p>
        <p>These different habits make me think about how different could be one culture compare to another and how difficult would have been for me to keep the same relationship with both types of friends.</p>
        <p>On one side I prefered the way I behaved with my old friends and I missed them, but on the other side, I realized the necessity of seeking for new friends, so I tried to agree to their habits and I experienced something else.</p>
        <p>Today I can say that this kind of experience has been very usefull for me. Last summer, coming back home for holidays I organized a party to my house nearbye the mountains and I invited both French new friends and my Italians old ones. The result was that with the new ones I experienced something they have never done before, and this strenthned our friendship, wherease with the old ones I felt home like everytime, as I had never left, as our friendship had never been changed.</p>
        <p>To conclude, I think both old and new friends are very importants, because trough them we can learn about our self and our changes in anytime; sometimes they are the mirror of what we were and what we become.</p>

        <p>The writer of this level 4 essay addresses the topic well and fully develops his or her point of view through sharing personal experiences. The essay begins with a clear statement of the thesis, that “keeping old friends and making new ones is important,” depending on a person’s needs. The writer then uses the experience of moving to another country to appropriately explain how old friends helped him or her to feel less lonely and to retain a sense of his or her native culture, and how new friends helped him or her adjust to a new culture. This example effectively leads to the conclusion that both old and new friends are helpful through life’s changes. While the points in this response are well developed and organized, the essay cannot earn a score of 5 because of multiple language errors that occur throughout. Errors in both grammar (“keeped less and less in contact,” “how different could be one culture”) and word choice (“I was habitued”) often do not obscure meaning but are frequent enough to lower the essay’s score to 4. </p>

        <p>In today’s society, life is becoming more impersonal and invidualist. That’s why having friends, it’s for me very important. But, I have a mix view when it comes to friends because it’s not so easy. I don’t think that one of the statement is more important than another one. I need both.</p>
        <p>First, keeping old friends is for me the most important. If you have a friend for a long time, that’s mean that he knows you very well and he can help you when you need it. For instance, if you have a problem or a decision to make, an old friend will be able to help you and give you good advices. On the contrary a new friend may not do it very well.</p>
        <p>Second, with old friends you can share everything. You will not feel any shame because you know that he has already saw you in ridiculous situations for example.</p>
        <p>Lastly, when you have a huge problem, it is common to say that best friends are always with you. They never let you alone and they don’t care in what people think.</p>
        <p>Although I really believe that it is very important to keep your old friends, I also think that it’s necessary to make new friends. In your daily life, you’re always evolving and changing; that’s why sometimes you can’t share everything with old friends because they just can’t understand exactly your new way of thinking. With a new friend, it could be easiest to evolve ant see the things differently.</p>
        <p>It’s also important to have a large relationship with different people. Like that you will be open-minded. In this way, new friends can make you discover new things such as a new place to visit or a new sport activity. For example, I lived in Barcelone for two years and I made new friends, actually, spanih friends. It was very interesting for me to meet new people. I was alone, without my old friends, and my new friends made me feel good. I could enjoy visiting the country and going out. I also changed my mind being with them. They helped me to think in another way, because they made me share a new culture, their culture.</p>
        <p>For all these reasons, I think that both are important. You need to keep your old friends, they will be there for everything but you also need new friends to evolve.</p>

        <p>While this essay responds to the question appropriately, it earns a score of 4 because of minor language errors and underdevelopment of the main points presented. Although the language used is generally clear and easy to understand, minor errors (“that’s mean that,” “he has already saw you”) occur more frequently than they would in a level 5 essay. The introduction to the essay is weak. The thesis statement (“I don’t think that one of the statement is more important than another one. I need both.”) does not sufficiently introduce the topic, and a reader not already familiar with the topic may struggle to identify the purpose of the essay. Despite this, the essay is generally well organized. The writer makes three points to support the need for old friends and two points to support the need for new friends. Each point is clearly stated in a distinct paragraph. Some of these points (that old friends can help in times of need in the second paragraph and that new friends can help people to be open-minded in the sixth paragraph) are very well developed with details and personal examples. Other points (that you can share everything with old friends in the third paragraph and that old friends never leave you alone in the fourth paragraph) are merely stated without any supporting details. These issues lower an otherwise clear response to a score of 4.</p>

        <p>One of the most important thing in life is to spend time with the person you consider to be your best friend, in my opinion. </p>
        <p>Firstable, nobody cannot know you better than an old friend does. </p>
        <p>Your old friend can really guess you before you begin to speak. You do not have to explain all of your feelings he knows you too much for that. This feeling of understanding is incredibly good. It is like you are not alone anymore. </p>
        <p>Secondly, keeping your old friends is the best way to have a link between your past and your life. It is a excellent pattern to know if you have changed well or not. It helps to keep your personnality and your personnal interests throught your life. </p>
        <p>In addition, Old friends continue to be friends because they helps each other with the life difficulties. </p>
        <p>The kind of helps creates a really deep love and friendship and it is why we say friends forever. It is too deep to give up. Consequently, friends become part of the family after many years. For example, I have had the same best friend since 1990. I know her and she knows me perfectly. I am closer to her than my own sister. We have share everything and we could be separate more than one month. I like her advices and our complementarity. </p>
        <p>To clarify my opinion, I would say that for me it is also good to make new friends and to change your routine. Everybody needs that to progress and to fell good. But when I am thinking about the most importamt thing my choice is clear I really need more my old friend that the new I have met. </p>
        <p>To conclude, Keep your old friends cloth to you and enjoy</p>
        <h5>Rater Comments</h5>
        <p>While this essay generally addresses the topic clearly, it earns a score of 3 because it features flaws in the development of some of its ideas and in overall structure. The writer lists three points to support the idea that old friends are important. The first two points, that old friends understand each other’s feelings and that they provide a link to a person’s past, are clearly expressed but only somewhat developed with vague explanations. The third point, that old friends can help each other through difficult times, is entirely unsupported. In addition, some elements in the response interrupt the progression of the essay. It is not clear how the sixth paragraph, which discusses the writer’s best friend, supports any of the three points mentioned earlier in the essay. The first sentence in the seventh paragraph (“To clarify my opinion, I would say that for me it is also good to make new friends and to change your routine.”) is also out of place and suggests that a new topic will be discussed, although the focus of the essay remains on the importance of old friends. These flaws, along with minor language errors (“they helps each other with the life difficulties,” “I really need more my old friends that the new I have met.”), earn this essay a score of 3.</p>

        <p>Both old friends and new friends are important for a person’s social life. Old friends give you security but new friends give you the bigger advantage: to make new experiences.</p>
        <p>For my own, I keep my new friends as more important as my old friends. That has many reasons. A person changes in the course of time in his behaviour and in his way of thinking. So, it is normal if you also change the persons which are arround of you and can talk to about your problems. It is true that an old friend know you much better and so he can maybe handle better with you when you need help but it is also true that an old friend know you too good so his advices are maybe not useful anymore for you. An old friend has often the same point of view as you, a normal conseguence of a long friendship. So a new friend might it make possible to have access to new points of view and can help you more. He does not have yet a fixed opinion about you not knowing so much about your family backround, for example. An old friend which knows you since your childhood and knows your whole family is not yet in a neutral position. That makes it difficult to give you neutral advices, especially if the problems you have concerns your familiy. But not only when you have problems, a friend is useful but also in other situation in which I prefer again new friends. I know new people and with them new life styles. So I can learn a lot for my own life. As a conclusion, new friends show you new prospectives of life and help you to konw the world better.</p>
        <h5>Rater Comments</h5>
        <p>This essay earns a score of 3 primarily because of lack of organization and development of its main ideas. The writer takes the position that new friends are more important than old friends. The reasons supporting this idea, however, are not a seasy to distinguish as they might have been if developed in separate paragraphs.Instead, multiple ideas are briefly mentioned in the second paragraph (that new friends accommodate changes in life, that they can offer neutral advice, and that they help build new ideas), making it a little difficult for a reader to follow the writer’s logic. The writer does, however, offer some good support for the ideathat new friends can offer neutral advice because they are not familiar with the friend’s past and family. The response might also have been scored higher hadit further developed the topic introduced at the end about new friends showing new perspectives and helping you know the world better. If these ideas had been developed with a few details or examples, this response would have been more highly rated. Most of the language used is also clear, although many minor language errors (“For my own,” “neutral advices”) that generally do not affect meaning do exist.</p>
