          <p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.88" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Listen to part of a lecture in an Art <span class="underline">History</span> class. <span class="time" data-times="3.74" data-time="3.88">[00:03.88]</span>The professor has been discussing the origins of art.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.18" data-time="7.62">[00:07.62]</span>Professor: Some of the world's oldest preserved art is the cave art of Europe, most of it in Spain and France. <span class="time" data-times="9.06" data-time="14.8">[00:14.80]</span>And the earliest cave paintings found to <span class="underline">date</span> are those of the Chauvet Cave in France discovered in 1994.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="11.36" data-time="23.86">[00:23.86]</span>And you know, I remember when I heard about the results of the dating of the Chauvet paintings, I said to my wife, "Can you believe these paintings are over 30,000 years old?"<span class="time" data-times="5.74" data-time="35.22">[00:35.22]</span>And my 3-year-old daughter piped up and said, "Is that older than my great-grandmother?" <span class="time" data-times="3.5" data-time="40.96">[00:40.96]</span>That was the oldest age she knew. <span class="time" data-times="1.98" data-time="44.46">[00:44.46]</span>And you know, come to think of it. <span class="time" data-times="4.96" data-time="46.44">[00:46.44]</span>It's <span class="underline">pretty</span> hard for me to really understand how long 30,000 years is too. <span class="time" data-times="5.73" data-time="51.4">[00:51.40]</span>I mean, we <span class="underline">tend</span> to think that people who lived at that time must have been <span class="underline">pretty</span> <span class="underline">primitive</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.69" data-time="57.13">[00:57.13]</span>But I'm <span class="underline">gonna</span> show you some slides in a few minutes and I think you will agree with me that this art is anything but <span class="underline">primitive</span>. <span class="time" data-times="1.9" data-time="64.82">[01:04.82]</span>They are masterpieces. <span class="time" data-times="7.44" data-time="66.72">[01:06.72]</span>And they look so real, so alive that it's very hard to imagine that they are so very old.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.93" data-time="74.16">[01:14.16]</span>Now, not everyone agrees on exactly how old. <span class="time" data-times="6.82" data-time="78.09">[01:18.09]</span>A number of the Chauvet paintings have been <span class="underline">dated</span> by a lab to 30,000 or more years ago.<span class="time" data-times="11.56" data-time="84.91">[01:24.91]</span>That would make them not just older than any other cave art, but about twice as old as the art in the caves at Altamira or Lascaux, which you may have heard of.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="14.58" data-time="96.47">[01:36.47]</span>Some people find it hard to believe Chauvet is so much older than Altamira and Lascaux, and they <span class="underline">noted</span> that only one lab did the dating for Chauvet, without <span class="underline">independent</span> confirmation from any other lab. <span class="time" data-times="13.6" data-time="111.05">[01:51.05]</span>But be that as it may, whatever the <span class="underline">exact</span> <span class="underline">date</span>, whether it's 15,000, 20,000 or 30,000 years ago, the Chauvet paintings are from the <span class="underline">dawn</span> of art. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.07" data-time="124.65">[02:04.65]</span>So they are a good place to start our discussion of cave painting.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.57" data-time="128.72">[02:08.72]</span>Now, one thing you've got to remember is the <span class="underline">context</span> of these paintings. <span class="time" data-times="20.83" data-time="134.29">[02:14.29]</span> <span class="underline">Paleolithic</span> humans - that's the period we are talking about here, the <span class="underline">Paleolithic</span>, the early stone age, not too long after humans first arrived in Europe - the <span class="underline">climate</span> was <span class="underline">significantly</span> colder then, and so rock shelters, <span class="underline">shallow</span> caves were valued as homes protected from the wind and rain. <span class="time" data-times="5.43" data-time="155.12">[02:35.12]</span>And in some cases at <span class="underline">least</span>, artists drew on the walls of their homes.<span class="time" data-times="6.69" data-time="160.55">[02:40.55]</span>But many of the truly great cave art sites like Chauvet were never inhabited. <span class="time" data-times="7.69" data-time="167.24">[02:47.24]</span>These paintings were made deep inside a dark cave, where no natural light can <span class="underline">penetrate</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.98" data-time="174.93">[02:54.93]</span>There's no <span class="underline">evidence</span> of people ever living here. <span class="time" data-times="3.38" data-time="177.91">[02:57.91]</span>Cave bears, yes, but not humans. <span class="time" data-times="6.9" data-time="181.29">[03:01.29]</span>You would have had to make a <span class="underline">special</span> <span class="underline">trip</span> into the cave to make the paintings, and a <span class="underline">special</span> <span class="underline">trip</span> to go see it. <span class="time" data-times="5.02" data-time="188.19">[03:08.19]</span>And each time you'd have to bring <span class="underline">along</span> torches to light your way. <span class="time" data-times="3.17" data-time="193.21">[03:13.21]</span>And people did go see the art. <span class="time" data-times="8.27" data-time="196.38">[03:16.38]</span>There's <span class="underline">charcoal</span> marks from their torches on the cave walls clearly dating from thousands of years after the paintings were made. <span class="time" data-times="2.46" data-time="204.65">[03:24.65]</span>So we can tell people went there. <span class="time" data-times="3.05" data-time="207.11">[03:27.11]</span>They came but they didn't stay. <span class="time" data-times="6.39" data-time="210.16">[03:30.16]</span>Deep inside a cave like that is not really a place you'd want to stay, so, why? <span class="time" data-times="7.2" data-time="216.55">[03:36.55]</span>What inspired the <span class="underline">Paleolithic</span> artists to make such beautiful art in such <span class="underline">inaccessible</span> places? <span class="time" data-times="4.65" data-time="223.75">[03:43.75]</span>We'll never really know of <span class="underline">course</span>, though it's interesting to <span class="underline">speculate</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.4" data-time="228.4">[03:48.40]</span>But, um, getting to the paintings themselves, <span class="underline">virtually</span> all <span class="underline">Paleolithic</span> cave art represents animals, and Chauvet is no <span class="underline">exception</span>. <span class="time" data-times="14.74" data-time="238.8">[03:58.80]</span>The artists were highly skilled at using, or <span class="underline">even</span> enhancing, the natural <span class="underline">shape</span> of the cave walls to give depth and perspectives to their drawings, the <span class="underline">sense</span> of <span class="underline">motion</span> and <span class="underline">vitality</span> in these animals. <span class="time" data-times="2.22" data-time="253.54">[04:13.54]</span>Well, wait till I show you the slides. <span class="time" data-times="5.82" data-time="255.76">[04:15.76]</span>Anyway, most <span class="underline">Paleolithic</span> cave art depicts large herbivores. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.65" data-time="261.58">[04:21.58]</span>Horses are most <span class="underline">common</span> <span class="underline">overall</span> with deer and bison <span class="underline">pretty</span> <span class="underline">common</span> too, probably animals they hunted.<span class="time" data-times="10.69" data-time="269.23">[04:29.23]</span>But earlier at Chauvet, there is a <span class="underline">significant</span> <span class="underline">interest</span> in large dangerous animals, lots of <span class="underline">rhinoceros</span>, lions, <span class="underline">mammoth</span>, bears. <span class="time" data-times="8.38" data-time="279.92">[04:39.92]</span>Remember that the ranges of many animal <span class="underline">species</span> were different back then, so all these animals actually lived in the <span class="underline">region</span> at that time. <span class="time" data-times="4.91" data-time="288.3">[04:48.30]</span>But the Chauvet artists didn't paint people. <span class="time" data-times="8.71" data-time="293.21">[04:53.21]</span>There is a half-man-half-bison creature and there is outlines of human hands but no depiction of a full human.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.84" data-time="301.92">[05:01.92]</span>So, why these <span class="underline">precise</span> animals? <span class="time" data-times="2.95" data-time="305.76">[05:05.76]</span>Why not birds, fish, snakes? <span class="time" data-times="3.79" data-time="308.71">[05:08.71]</span>Was it for their <span class="underline">religion</span>, magic or <span class="underline">sheer</span> beauty? <span class="time" data-times="1.46" data-time="312.5">[05:12.50]</span>We don't know.<span class="time" data-times="9.98" data-time="313.96">[05:13.96]</span>But whatever it was, it was <span class="underline">worth</span> it to them to spend hours deep inside a cave with just a torch between them and <span class="underline">utter</span> darkness. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="323.94">[05:23.94]</span>So, on that note, let's <span class="underline">dim</span> the lights, so we can see these slides and actually look at the techniques they used.</p>
