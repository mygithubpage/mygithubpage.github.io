To discuss the style of an early filmmaker</p><p>B. To describe different types of filmmaking in the 1930s</p><p>C. To discuss the emergence of the documentary film</p><p>D. To describe Painleve's influence on today's science-fiction films</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The title is the subject of the content. The correct answer is A. At the beginning of the lecture, the professor briefly reviewed the contents of the previous lesson and reviewed the film styles of the 19th and 1930s. Next, the professor began to focus on a movie producer Jean Painleve and his movie, and this is the main content of this lecture, so the A option is correct. The B and D options are all partial and the C option is irrelevant, so they are all wrong....</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why are Painleve's films typical of the films of the 1920s and 1930s?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They do not have sound.</p><p>B. They are filmed underwater.</p><p>C. They are easy to understand.</p><p>D. They are difficult to categorize.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>From the description of this sentence, we can see that P's film style is unique and mixed style at the time or now and cannot be classified. A is a common feature of the era of silent movies. In B's words, there are others who shoot underwater movies and can be classified as documentaries. C. Films that are contrary to the facts are difficult to understand....</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor, how did Painleve's films confuse the audience?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They show animals out of their natural habitat.</p><p>B. They depict animals as having both human and animal characteristics.</p><p>C. The narration is scientific and difficult to understand.</p><p>D. The audiences of the 1920s and 1930s were not used to films shot underwater.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>A is inconsistent with the facts and is still being photographed in animal habitats. C is mentioned in the text but does not answer this question, and his film was started with scientific content and then changed. D also had other underwater filmmakers at the time....</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor mention sea horses?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To explain that they were difficult to film in the 1930s</p><p>B. To point out that Cousteau made documentaries about them</p><p>C. To illustrate Painleve's fascination with unusual animals</p><p>D. To explain why Painleve's underwater films were not successful</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>First say that P likes something different, then says one of his favorite sea animals was the seahorse. Obviously seahorse is an example of what he likes to do different things. A, B, D are not relevant....</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor compare the film styles of Jacques Cousteau and Jean Painleve?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To explain how Painleve influenced Cousteau</p><p>B. To emphasize the uniqueness of Painleve's filming style</p><p>C. To emphasize the artistic value of Cousteau's documentary films</p><p>D. To demonstrate the superiority of Painlev's filmmaking equipment</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>A series of comparisons is to show that P's style is unique and unique. C is an integral part of the P features. D is wrong. The text emphasizes Cousteau's equipment. A is not mentioned....</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the student imply when he says this?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. He does not like Jean Painleve's films.</p><p>B. He thinks that the professor should spend more time discussing Jacques Cousteau's films.</p><p>C. He believes that high-quality filmmakers are usually well known.</p><p>D. He believes that Jean Painleve's films have been unfairly overlooked.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>From the post-professor's answer, it can be shown that the students' question of P comes from the fact that P does not have C, which reflects the students' belief that good filmmakers should be well-known. A is too subjective. Obviously students do not understand and do not like it. B, D is not mentioned....</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
