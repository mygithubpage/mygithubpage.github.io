              <span class="time" data-times="12.65" data-time="4.3">[00:04.30]</span>Professor: Okay, we've been discussing films in the 1920s and 30s, and how back then <span class="highlight">film</span> categories, as we know them today, had not yet been established. <span class="time" data-times="16.05" data-time="16.95">[00:16.95]</span>We said that by today's standards, many of the films of the 20s and 30s would be considered hybrids, that is, a mixture of styles that wouldn't exactly fit into any of today's categories. <span class="time" data-times="9.96" data-time="33">[00:33.00]</span>And in that <span class="highlight">context</span>, today we are going to talk about a film-maker who began making very <span class="highlight">unique</span> films in the late 1920s. <span class="time" data-times="4.89" data-time="42.96">[00:42.96]</span>He was French, and his name was Jean Painlevé.<span class="time" data-times="3.67" data-time="47.85">[00:47.85]</span>Jean Painlevé was born in 1902.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.47" data-time="51.52">[00:51.52]</span>He made his first <span class="highlight">film</span> in 1928. <span class="time" data-times="13.16" data-time="54.99">[00:54.99]</span>Now in a way, Painlevé's films <span class="highlight">conform</span> to norms of the 20s and 30s, that is, they don't fit very neatly into the categories we use to <span class="highlight">classify</span> films today. <span class="time" data-times="10" data-time="68.15">[01:08.15]</span>That said, <span class="highlight">even</span> by the standards of the 20s and 30s, Painlevé's films were a <span class="highlight">unique</span> hybrid of styles. <span class="time" data-times="8.63" data-time="78.15">[01:18.15]</span>He had a <span class="highlight">special</span> way of fusing, or some people might say, confusing, science and <span class="highlight">fiction</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.02" data-time="86.78">[01:26.78]</span>His films begin with facts, but then they become more and more fictional. <span class="time" data-times="4.65" data-time="93.8">[01:33.80]</span>They <span class="highlight">gradually</span> add more and more fictional elements. <span class="time" data-times="6.25" data-time="98.45">[01:38.45]</span>In fact, Painlevé was known for saying that science is <span class="highlight">fiction</span>.<span class="time" data-times="8.95" data-time="104.7">[01:44.70]</span>Painlevé was a <span class="highlight">pioneer</span> in underwater film-making, and a lot of his short films focused on the <span class="highlight">aquatic</span> animal world. <span class="time" data-times="11.73" data-time="113.65">[01:53.65]</span>He liked to show small underwater creatures, displaying what seemed like <span class="highlight">familiar</span> human characteristics - what we think of as <span class="highlight">unique</span> to humans.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.34" data-time="125.38">[02:05.38]</span>He might take a clip of a <span class="highlight">mollusk</span> going up and down in the water and set it to music. <span class="time" data-times="6.88" data-time="131.72">[02:11.72]</span>You know, to make it look as if the <span class="highlight">mollusk</span> were dancing to the music like a human being - that <span class="highlight">sort</span> of thing.<span class="time" data-times="9.64" data-time="138.6">[02:18.60]</span>But then he suddenly changed the <span class="highlight">image</span> or narration to <span class="highlight">remind</span> us how different the animals are, how unlike humans. <span class="time" data-times="10.68" data-time="148.24">[02:28.24]</span>He <span class="highlight">confused</span> his <span class="highlight">audience</span> in the way he portrayed the animals he filmed, mixing up our notions of the categories human and animal.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.46" data-time="158.92">[02:38.92]</span>The films make us a little uncomfortable at times because we are uncertain about what we are seeing.<span class="time" data-times="9.77" data-time="165.38">[02:45.38]</span>It gives him films an uncanny feature: the <span class="highlight">familiar</span> made unfamiliar, the normal made suspicious.<span class="time" data-times="3.89" data-time="175.15">[02:55.15]</span>He liked twists, he liked the unusual. <span class="time" data-times="13.46" data-time="179.04">[02:59.04]</span>In fact, one of his favorite sea animals was the seahorse because with seahorses, it's the <span class="highlight">male</span> that gets pregnant, it's the <span class="highlight">male</span> that carries the babies, and he thought that was great. <span class="time" data-times="4.8" data-time="192.5">[03:12.50]</span>His first and most <span class="highlight">celebrated</span> underwater <span class="highlight">film</span> is about the seahorse.<span class="time" data-times="1.94" data-time="197.3">[03:17.30]</span>Susan, you have a question?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.23" data-time="199.24">[03:19.24]</span>Student 1: But underwater film-making wasn't that unusual, was it? <span class="time" data-times="3.4" data-time="203.47">[03:23.47]</span>I mean, weren't there other people making movies underwater?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.02" data-time="206.87">[03:26.87]</span>Professor: Well, actually, it was <span class="highlight">pretty</span> <span class="highlight">rare</span> at that time. <span class="time" data-times="3.4" data-time="210.89">[03:30.89]</span>I mean, we are talking the early 1930s here.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.23" data-time="214.29">[03:34.29]</span>Student 1: But what about Jacques Cousteau? <span class="time" data-times="4.45" data-time="216.52">[03:36.52]</span>Was he like an innovator, you know, with underwater <span class="highlight">photography</span> too?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.4" data-time="220.97">[03:40.97]</span>Professor: Ah, Jacques Cousteau. <span class="time" data-times="8.19" data-time="223.37">[03:43.37]</span>Well, Painlevé and Cousteau did both <span class="highlight">film</span> underwater, and they were both innovators, so you are right in that <span class="highlight">sense</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.17" data-time="231.56">[03:51.56]</span>But that's <span class="highlight">pretty</span> much where the similarities end. <span class="time" data-times="4.45" data-time="234.73">[03:54.73]</span>First of all, Painlevé was about 20 years ahead of Cousteau. <span class="time" data-times="12.5" data-time="239.18">[03:59.18]</span>And Cousteau's adventures were high-tech, with lots of <span class="highlight">fancy</span> equipment, whereas Painlevé kind of patchedequipment together as he needed it. <span class="time" data-times="12.54" data-time="251.68">[04:11.68]</span>Cousteau usually filmed large animals, usually in the open sea, whereas Painlevé generally filmed smaller animals, and he liked to <span class="highlight">film</span> in <span class="highlight">shallow</span> water.<span class="time" data-times="1.57" data-time="264.22">[04:24.22]</span>Uh, what else?<span class="time" data-times="8.18" data-time="265.79">[04:25.79]</span>Oh well, the main <span class="highlight">difference</span> was that Cousteau <span class="highlight">simply</span> investigated and presented the facts - he didn't mix in <span class="highlight">fiction</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.78" data-time="273.97">[04:33.97]</span>He was a <span class="highlight">strict</span> documentarist.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.31" data-time="276.75">[04:36.75]</span>He set the <span class="highlight">standard</span> really for the nature <span class="highlight">documentary</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.88" data-time="281.06">[04:41.06]</span>Painlevé, on the other hand, as we said before, mixed in elements of <span class="highlight">fiction</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.02" data-time="286.94">[04:46.94]</span>And his films are much more <span class="highlight">artistic</span>, incorporating music as an important <span class="highlight">element</span>.<span class="time" data-times="1.81" data-time="292.96">[04:52.96]</span>John, you have a question?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="11.78" data-time="294.77">[04:54.77]</span>Student 2: Well, maybe I shouldn't be asking this, but if Painlevé's films are so <span class="highlight">special</span>, so good, why <span class="highlight">haven</span>'t we ever heard of them? <span class="time" data-times="2.62" data-time="306.55">[05:06.55]</span>I mean, everyone's heard of Jacques Cousteau.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.49" data-time="309.17">[05:09.17]</span>Professor: Well, that's a <span class="highlight">fair</span> question. <span class="time" data-times="7.79" data-time="311.66">[05:11.66]</span>Uh, the short answer is that Painlevé's style just never caught on with the general public. <span class="time" data-times="20.05" data-time="319.45">[05:19.45]</span>I mean, it probably goes back at <span class="highlight">least</span> in part to what we mentioned earlier, that people didn't know what to make of his films - they were <span class="highlight">confused</span> by them, whereas Cousteau's documentaries were very <span class="highlight">straightforward</span>, met people's expectations more than Painlevé's films did. <span class="time" data-times="4.76" data-time="339.5">[05:39.50]</span>But you true <span class="highlight">film</span> <span class="highlight">history</span> buffs know about him. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="344.26">[05:44.26]</span>And Painlevé is still highly respected in many circles.</p>
