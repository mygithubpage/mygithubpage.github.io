            <b>Feeding Habits of East African Herbivres</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>
            <span class="underline">Buffalo</span>, zebras, wildebeests, topi, and Thomson's gazelles live in huge groups that together make up some 90 percent of the total weight of mammals living on the Serengeti <span class="underline">Plain</span> of East Africa. They are all herbivores (plant-eating animals), and they all <span class="underline">appear</span> to be living on the same <span class="underline">diet</span> of grasses, herbs, and small bushes. This <span class="underline">appearance</span>, however, is <span class="light">illusory</span> When biologist Richard Bell and his colleagues analyzed the stomach contents of four of the five <span class="underline">species</span> (they did not study <span class="underline">buffalo</span>), they found that each <span class="underline">species</span> was living on a different part of the <span class="underline">vegetation</span>. The different vegetational parts differ in their food qualities: <span class="underline">lower</span> down, there are succulent, nutritious leaves; higher up are the harder stems. There are also sparsely distributed, highly nutritious fruits, and Bell found that only the Thomson's gazelles eat much of these. The other three <span class="underline">species</span> differ in the <span class="underline">proportion</span> of <span class="underline">lower</span> leaves and higher stems that they eat: zebras eat the most <span class="underline">stem</span> matter, wildebeests eat the most leaves, and topi are <span class="underline">intermediate</span>.</p>
          <p>How are we to understand their different feeding preferences? The answer lies in two <span class="underline">associated</span> differences among the <span class="underline">species</span>, in their <span class="underline">digestive</span> systems and body sizes. According to their <span class="underline">digestive</span> systems, these herbivores can be divided into two categories: the nonruminants (such as the zebra, which has a <span class="underline">digestive</span> system like a horse) and the ruminants (such as the <span class="underline">wildebeest</span>, topi, and <span class="underline">gazelle</span>, which are like the cow). Nonruminants cannot <span class="underline">extract</span> much energy from the hard parts of a plant; however, this is more than made up for by the fast speed at which food passes <span class="underline">through</span> their guts. Thus, when there is only a short <span class="underline">supply</span> of poor-quality food, the <span class="underline">wildebeest</span>, topi, and <span class="underline">gazelle</span> enjoy an <span class="underline">advantage</span>. They are ruminants and have a <span class="underline">special</span> structure (the <span class="underline">rumen</span>) in their stomachs, which contains microorganisms that can <span class="underline">break</span> down the hard parts of plants. Food passes only slowly <span class="underline">through</span> the ruminant's <span class="underline">gut</span> because ruminating-digesting the hard parts-takes time. The ruminant continually regurgitates food from its stomach back to its mouth to <span class="underline">chew</span> it up further (that is what a cow is doing when "chewing cud"). Only when it has been chewed up and digested almost to a <span class="underline">liquid</span> can the food pass <span class="underline">through</span> the <span class="underline">rumen</span> and on <span class="underline">through</span> the <span class="underline">gut</span>. Larger particles cannot pass <span class="underline">through</span> until they have been chewed down to size. <span class="underline">Therefore</span>, when food is in short <span class="underline">supply</span>, a ruminant can last longer than a nonruminant because it can <span class="underline">derive</span> more energy out of the same food. The <span class="underline">difference</span> can <span class="underline">partially</span> explain the eating habits of the Serengeti herbivores. The zebra chooses areas where there is more low-quality food. It migrates first to unexploited areas and chomps the <span class="underline">abundant</span> low-quality stems before moving on. It is a fast-in/fast-out feeder, relying on a high <span class="underline">output</span> of incompletely digested food. By the time the wildebeests (and other ruminants) arrive, the <span class="underline">grazing</span> and trampling of the zebras will have worn the <span class="underline">vegetation</span> down. As the ruminants then set to work, they eat down to the <span class="underline">lower</span>, leafier parts of the <span class="underline">vegetation</span>. All of this fits in with the differences in stomach contents with which we began.</p>
          <p>The other part of the explanation is body size. Larger animals <span class="underline">require</span> more food than smaller animals, but smaller animals have a higher <span class="underline">metabolic</span> <span class="underline">rate</span>. Smaller animals can <span class="underline">therefore</span> live where there is less food, provided that such food is of high energy <span class="underline">content</span>. That is why the smallest of the herbivores, Thomson's <span class="underline">gazelle</span>, lives on fruit that is very nutritious but too thin on the ground to support a larger animal. By <span class="underline">contrast</span>, the large zebra lives on the masses of low-quality <span class="underline">stem</span> <span class="underline">material</span>.</p>
          <p>The differences in feeding preferences <span class="underline">lead</span>, in turn, to differences in <span class="underline">migratory</span> habits. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>The wildebeests follow, in their <span class="underline">migration</span>, the <span class="underline">pattern</span> of <span class="underline">local</span> <span class="underline">rainfall</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>The other <span class="underline">species</span> do <span class="underline">likewise</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>But when a new area is fueled by rain, the mammals <span class="underline">migrate</span> toward it in a set order to <span class="underline">exploit</span> it. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>The larger, less fastidious feeders, the zebras, move in first; the choosier, smaller wildebeests come later; and the smallest <span class="underline">species</span> of all, Thomson's <span class="underline">gazelle</span>, arrives last. The later <span class="underline">species</span> all <span class="underline">depend</span> on the preparations of the earlier one, for the actions of the zebra <span class="underline">alter</span> the <span class="underline">vegetation</span> to suit the stomachs of the <span class="underline">wildebeest</span>, topi, and <span class="underline">gazelle</span>.</p>
