          <h4 class="w3-center">Feeding Habits of East African Herbivres</h4>
          <p>
            <span class="highlight">Buffalo</span>, zebras, wildebeests, topi, and Thomson's gazelles live in huge groups that together make up some 90 percent of the total weight of mammals living on the Serengeti <span class="highlight">Plain</span> of East Africa. They are all herbivores (plant-eating animals), and they all <span class="highlight">appear</span> to be living on the same <span class="highlight">diet</span> of grasses, herbs, and small bushes. This <span class="highlight">appearance</span>, however, is <span class="highlight question1">illusory</span> When biologist Richard Bell and his colleagues analyzed the stomach contents of four of the five <span class="highlight">species</span> (they did not study <span class="highlight">buffalo</span>), they found that each <span class="highlight">species</span> was living on a different part of the <span class="highlight">vegetation</span>. The different vegetational parts differ in their food qualities: <span class="highlight">lower</span> down, there are succulent, nutritious leaves; higher up are the harder stems. There are also <span class="question2">sparsely</span> distributed, highly nutritious fruits, and Bell found that only the Thomson's gazelles eat much of these. The other three <span class="highlight">species</span> differ in the <span class="highlight">proportion</span> of <span class="highlight">lower</span> leaves and higher stems that they eat: zebras eat the most <span class="highlight">stem</span> matter, wildebeests eat the most leaves, and topi are <span class="highlight">intermediate</span>.</p>
          <p>How are we to understand their different feeding preferences? The answer lies in two <span class="highlight"><span class="question4">associated</span></span> differences among the <span class="highlight">species</span>, in their <span class="highlight">digestive</span> systems and body sizes. According to their <span class="highlight">digestive</span> systems, these herbivores can be divided into two categories: the nonruminants (such as the zebra, which has a <span class="highlight">digestive</span> system like a horse) and the ruminants (such as the <span class="highlight">wildebeest</span>, topi, and <span class="highlight">gazelle</span>, which are like the cow). Nonruminants cannot <span class="highlight">extract</span> much energy from the hard parts of a plant; however, this is more than made up for by the fast speed at which food passes <span class="highlight">through</span> their guts. Thus, when there is only a short <span class="highlight">supply</span> of poor-quality food, the <span class="highlight">wildebeest</span>, topi, and <span class="highlight">gazelle</span> enjoy an <span class="highlight">advantage</span>. They are ruminants and have a <span class="highlight">special</span> structure (the <span class="highlight">rumen</span>) in their stomachs, which contains microorganisms that can <span class="highlight">break</span> down the hard parts of plants. Food passes only slowly <span class="highlight">through</span> the ruminant's <span class="highlight">gut</span> because ruminating-digesting the hard parts-takes time. The ruminant continually regurgitates food from its stomach back to its mouth to <span class="highlight">chew</span> it up further (that is what a cow is doing when "chewing cud"). Only when it has been chewed up and digested almost to a <span class="highlight">liquid</span> can the food pass <span class="highlight">through</span> the <span class="highlight">rumen</span> and on <span class="highlight">through</span> the <span class="highlight">gut</span>. Larger particles cannot pass <span class="highlight">through</span> until they have been chewed down to size. <span class="highlight">Therefore</span>, when food is in short <span class="highlight">supply</span>, a ruminant can last longer than a nonruminant because it can <span class="highlight">derive</span> more energy out of the same food. The <span class="highlight">difference</span> can <span class="highlight">partially</span> explain the eating habits of the Serengeti herbivores. The zebra chooses areas where there is more low-quality food. It migrates first to unexploited areas and chomps the <span class="highlight">abundant</span> low-quality stems before moving on. It is a fast-in/fast-out feeder, relying on a high <span class="highlight">output</span> of incompletely digested food. By the time the wildebeests (and other ruminants) arrive, the <span class="highlight">grazing</span> and trampling of the zebras will have worn the <span class="highlight">vegetation</span> down. As the ruminants then set to work, they eat down to the <span class="highlight">lower</span>, leafier parts of the <span class="highlight">vegetation</span>. All of this fits in with the differences in stomach contents with which we began.</p>
          <p>The other part of the explanation is body size. Larger animals <span class="highlight">require</span> more food than smaller animals, but smaller animals have a higher <span class="highlight">metabolic</span> <span class="highlight">rate</span>. Smaller animals can <span class="highlight">therefore</span> live where there is less food, <span class="question9">provided that</span> such food is of high energy <span class="highlight">content</span>. That is why the smallest of the herbivores, Thomson's <span class="highlight">gazelle</span>, lives on fruit that is very nutritious but too thin on the ground to support a larger animal. By <span class="highlight">contrast</span>, the large zebra lives on the masses of low-quality <span class="highlight">stem</span> <span class="highlight">material</span>.</p>
          <p>The differences in feeding preferences <span class="highlight">lead</span>, in turn, to differences in <span class="highlight">migratory</span> habits. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>The wildebeests follow, in their <span class="highlight">migration</span>, the <span class="highlight">pattern</span> of <span class="highlight">local</span> <span class="highlight">rainfall</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>The other <span class="highlight">species</span> do <span class="highlight">likewise</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>But when a new area is fueled by rain, the mammals <span class="highlight">migrate</span> toward it in a set order to <span class="highlight">exploit</span> it. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>The larger, less <span class="question10">fastidious</span> feeders, the zebras, move in first; the choosier, smaller wildebeests come later; and the smallest <span class="highlight">species</span> of all, Thomson's <span class="highlight">gazelle</span>, arrives last. The later <span class="highlight">species</span> all <span class="highlight">depend</span> on the preparations of the earlier one, for the actions of the zebra <span class="highlight">alter</span> the <span class="highlight">vegetation</span> to suit the stomachs of the <span class="highlight">wildebeest</span>, topi, and <span class="highlight">gazelle</span>.</p>

              <p>Option B is correct. Because gazelles are ruminants, the stomach has a special structure that contains microorganisms. "They are ruminants and have a special structure(the rumen) in their stomachs, which contains the microorganism that ...." Option C is right, they are trying to ruminate because the food is chewed to near liquid state. "Only when it has been chewed up and digested almost to a liquid can the food pass through the rumen and on through the gut." Option D is right, because they can get more energy from food. "Therefore, when food is in short supply, a ruminant ....derive more energy out of the same food."</p>
