            <span class="highlight">Female</span> Student: Well, they <span class="highlight">seem</span> to <span class="highlight">mention</span> water a lot, which kinda surprised me, as I have this picture in my head that Mars is dry ... sorta dry and dead.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.61" data-time="39.16">[00:39.16]</span>Professor: You're not the only one. <span class="time" data-times="15.4" data-time="40.77">[00:40.77]</span>You know, for centuries, most of our knowledge of the <span class="highlight">planet</span> came from what we saw <span class="highlight">through</span> telescopes, so, <span class="highlight">obviously</span>, it was <span class="highlight">pretty</span> limited-and our views of the <span class="highlight">planet</span> were formed as much by writers ... as they were by serious scientists. <span class="time" data-times="7.21" data-time="56.17">[00:56.17]</span>When the first science-fiction stories came out, Mars was described as being a lot like Earth except</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.29" data-time="63.38">[01:03.38]</span>
            <span class="highlight">Male</span> Student: I know: the <span class="highlight">planet</span> was red and, uh, the people were green. <span class="time" data-times="2.22" data-time="67.67">[01:07.67]</span>I've seen some of those old movies, <span class="time" data-times="1.28" data-time="69.89">[01:09.89]</span>what were they thinking? <span class="time" data-times="1.41" data-time="71.17">[01:11.17]</span>I mean really ... they...</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="8.86" data-time="72.58">[01:12.58]</span>Professor: Well, it seems silly to us now, but those ideas were quite imaginative and, occasionally, scary in their time. <span class="time" data-times="9.99" data-time="81.44">[01:21.44]</span>Anyway, we began to rethink our <span class="highlight">image</span> of Mars when the first <span class="highlight">spacecraft</span> flew by the <span class="highlight">planet</span> in 1965 and sent pictures back to Earth. <span class="time" data-times="8.18" data-time="91.43">[01:31.43]</span>Those pictures showed a <span class="highlight">planet</span> that looked a lot more like our Moon than Earth-lots of craters and not much else. <span class="time" data-times="8.54" data-time="99.61">[01:39.61]</span>It was bitterly cold, it had a very thin <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span>, and that <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span> was mostly <span class="highlight">carbon</span> <span class="highlight">dioxide</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.43" data-time="108.15">[01:48.15]</span>So the view of Mars after this first flyby <span class="highlight">mission</span> was that dry, dead <span class="highlight">planet</span> that Lisa mentioned.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="10.19" data-time="115.58">[01:55.58]</span>But, then there were more visits to the <span class="highlight">planet</span> in the 1970s-and this time the <span class="highlight">spacecraft</span> didn't just fly by; they orbited ... or landed. <span class="time" data-times="8.11" data-time="125.77">[02:05.77]</span>This allowed us to receive much more detailed images of the <span class="highlight">planet</span> and it turned out to be a <span class="highlight">pretty</span> interesting place. <span class="time" data-times="9.13" data-time="133.88">[02:13.88]</span>Mars had ... has a lot more than craters-it has <span class="highlight">giant</span> volcanoes and deep canyons. <span class="time" data-times="6.34" data-time="143.01">[02:23.01]</span>It also showed signs of dried-up riverbeds and plains that had been formed by <span class="highlight">massive</span> floods. <span class="time" data-times="6.83" data-time="149.35">[02:29.35]</span>So we concluded that there must have been water on the <span class="highlight">planet</span> at one time-billions of years ago. <span class="time" data-times="4" data-time="156.18">[02:36.18]</span>Now, what does it take for water to exist?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.42" data-time="160.18">[02:40.18]</span>
            <span class="highlight">Male</span> Student: You need to have a warm-enough <span class="highlight">temperature</span> so that it doesn't <span class="highlight">freeze</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="9.13" data-time="163.6">[02:43.60]</span>Professor: That's one thing-and the other is that you need enough <span class="highlight">atmospheric</span> <span class="highlight">pressure</span>, thick-enough <span class="highlight">air</span> so that the water doesn't <span class="highlight">instantly</span> <span class="highlight">vaporize</span>. <span class="time" data-times="20.62" data-time="172.73">[02:52.73]</span>The Mars we see today doesn't have either of those conditions-it is too cold and the <span class="highlight">air</span> is too thin-but a long time ago, there may have been a thicker <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span> that created a greenhouse effect that raised temperatures-and maybe that <span class="highlight">combination</span> produced water on the surface of the <span class="highlight">planet</span>. <span class="time" data-times="13.12" data-time="193.35">[03:13.35]</span>So maybe Mars wasn't just a dead, boring rock; maybe, it was, uh, a <span class="highlight">fascinating</span> <span class="highlight">fossil</span> that was once alive and dynamic-worthy of <span class="highlight">exploration</span>, <span class="time" data-times="10.57" data-time="206.47">[03:26.47]</span>Now let's jump <span class="highlight">forward</span> a few decades to the beginning of this <span class="highlight">century</span>, and a new <span class="highlight">generation</span> of orbiters and landers that have been sent to Mars. <span class="time" data-times="10.71" data-time="217.04">[03:37.04]</span>Of <span class="highlight">course</span>, the <span class="highlight">scientific</span> instruments now surveying Mars are far more <span class="highlight">sophisticated</span> than the instruments of the '70s, so we're getting all kinds of new <span class="highlight">data</span> for <span class="highlight">analysis</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.1" data-time="227.75">[03:47.75]</span>And, not surprisingly, that <span class="highlight">data</span> is challenging our notions of what Mars is like. <span class="time" data-times="7.33" data-time="233.85">[03:53.85]</span>Lisa, you mentioned that a lot of the news reports talked about water-do you remember any of the details?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="7.81" data-time="241.18">[04:01.18]</span>
            <span class="highlight">Female</span> Student: Well, they were showing these pictures of these long, uh, cuts in the ground, which would be gullies here; I mean on Earth. <span class="time" data-times="12.29" data-time="248.99">[04:08.99]</span>They say that since, uh, gullies are usually formed by water, it seems like they might be <span class="highlight">evidence</span> that water still exists on Mars, but I didn't get how that worked.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.56" data-time="261.28">[04:21.28]</span>Professor: I'm not surprised. <span class="time" data-times="8.95" data-time="262.84">[04:22.84]</span>There're a lot of theories ...a lot of speculation ...and some <span class="highlight">argue</span> the formations aren't caused by water at all. <span class="time" data-times="10.34" data-time="271.79">[04:31.79]</span>But there're some <span class="highlight">ingenious</span> theories that <span class="highlight">assume</span> that there's a lot of water right under the <span class="highlight">planet</span>'s surface that somehow is causing the gullies to form. <span class="time" data-times="6.84" data-time="282.13">[04:42.13]</span>If we could only get a lander there... but the gullies aren't in places where we can send landers yet. <span class="time" data-times="18.7" data-time="288.97">[04:48.97]</span>Anyway, if there is some kind of water <span class="highlight">activity</span>, it may change our view of the <span class="highlight">planet</span> once again ... to something that's not dead, not <span class="highlight">even</span> a <span class="highlight">fossil</span>, but rather a <span class="highlight">planet</span> like Earth that undergoes cycles-think of our ice ages-over long periods of time. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="307.67">[05:07.67]</span>Maybe Mars could <span class="highlight">sustain</span> water again at some <span class="highlight">distant</span> <span class="highlight">date</span>.</p>
