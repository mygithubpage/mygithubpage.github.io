Why it has been difficult to obtain information about Mars</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The professor first used the large amount of data in the latest news to make a big difference to the image of Mars.

It had few geological features of interest.</p><p>B. It was similar to Earth but colder.</p><p>C. It had at one time supported life.</p><p>D. It had water under its surface.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The professor said that the images that were returned in 1965 suggest that Mars is more like the moon than the Earth, and that the cold air is also thin mainly carbon dioxide.

Large floods were shaping the planet's surface.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="BD"><p>The 1970 image shows that the surface of Mars is not only a crater, but also a river bed and a plain. It is likely to be formed by a huge flood. D is consistent. Then in order to ensure the existence of water, the professor inferred that there must be enough atmospheric water to evaporate, but a long time ago may be the existence of a thicker atmosphere and the resulting high temperature, and these two conditions may make water production. ....</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the possible significance of the gullies found on Mars in recent years?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They may indicate current volcanic activity on Mars.</p><p>B. They may indicate that the surface of Mars is becoming increasingly drier.</p><p>C. They may indicate the current existence of water on Mars.</p><p>D. They may hold fossils of organisms that once existed on Mars.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Many creative theories believe that because a lot of groundwater produces surface trenches, it is possible that Mars now has water, which is not on the ground but underground....</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor say this?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To stress that Mars is no longer interesting to explore</p><p>B. To describe items that the spacecraft brought back from Mars</p><p>C. To share his interest in the study of fossils</p><p>D. To show how much the view of Mars changed based on new evidence</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>According to the latest evidence, Mars may not be a lifeless planet.

To express his approval</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Here is a mockery of the student's mockery of previous filmmakers who did not describe Mars realistically.
