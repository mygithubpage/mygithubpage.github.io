          <h5>Important Points</h5>
          <p>You could say you prefer to live with a roommate and then explain one or two reasons, such as having someone to discuss problems with, being able to share the cooking and cleaning, or avoiding loneliness. If you want to talk about the advantages or disadvantages of both options and say they are equally good, that is permissible. However, it might be more difficult for you to finish discussing both options in the time allowed. </p>

          <p>This speaker's response presents a clear progression of ideas. He chooses to discuss an advantage of living with a roommate before he describes the disadvantages, which, to him, are stronger than the advantage. He gives an example of how a roommate might be a problem, then states his preference—living alone—and relates it to his personal experience. His pronunciation is easy to understand, and he speaks very fluently. A few of his word choices are not precise, but this would not prevent a listener from understanding his ideas.</p>

          <p>For the first part of his response, the speaker is only reading the question aloud and not actually answering it. His pronunciation is strongly affected by his first language, so the listener must make a great effort to try to understand what he is saying. His response is marked by long pauses as he tries to think of the next word to say, indicating that he possesses a very limited English vocabulary. The lowest level of the rubric describes the characteristics of this response. </p>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>Personally, I prefer to live alone for the following reasons. First, I want to have my own privacy. I can't imagine that 5 or 6 people stick together. I don't want my roommates to know whom I'm calling or dating, what books I'm reading or what movies I'm watching. Also, I'm crazy about rock music, so I don't want to bother others. In turn, I don't want to be bothered by others as well. Meanwhile, I like cooking greatly. And that calls for private space. The process of cooking may be complicated and takes a lot time. In short, I prefer to live alone in any event.</p>
