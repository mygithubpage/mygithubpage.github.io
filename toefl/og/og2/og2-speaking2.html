        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>Personally, I prefer to live alone for the following reasons. First, I want to have my own privacy. I can't imagine that 5 or 6 people stick together. I don't want my roommates to know whom I'm calling or dating, what books I'm reading or what movies I'm watching. Also, I'm crazy about rock music, so I don't want to bother others. In turn, I don't want to be bothered by others as well. Meanwhile, I like cooking greatly. And that calls for private space. The process of cooking may be complicated and takes a lot time. In short, I prefer to live alone in any event.</p>
