            <b>Green Icebergs</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>Icebergs are <span class="highlight">massive</span> blocks of ice, <span class="highlight">irregular</span> in <span class="highlight">shape</span>; they <span class="highlight">float</span> with only about 12 percent of their <span class="highlight">mass</span> above the sea surface. They are formed by glaciers-large rivers of ice that begin inland in the snows of Greenland, <span class="highlight">Antarctica</span>, and Alaska-and move slowly toward the sea. The <span class="highlight">forward</span> movement, the <span class="highlight">melting</span> at the <span class="highlight">base</span> of the <span class="highlight">glacier</span> where it meets the ocean, and waves and <span class="highlight">tidal</span> <span class="highlight">action</span> cause blocks of ice to <span class="highlight">break</span> off and <span class="highlight">float</span> out to sea.</p>
          <p>Icebergs are ordinarily blue to white, although they sometimes <span class="highlight">appear</span> dark or <span class="highlight">opaque</span> because they carry <span class="highlight">gravel</span> and bits of rock. They may change color with changing light conditions and cloud cover, glowing pink or gold in the morning or evening light, but this color change is generally related to the low <span class="highlight">angle</span> of the Sun above the <span class="highlight">horizon</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>However, travelers to <span class="highlight">Antarctica</span> have repeatedly reported seeing green icebergs in the Weddell Sea and, more commonly, close to the Amery Ice Shelf in East <span class="highlight">Antarctica</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B">
            </span><span class="question3">One explanation for green icebergs attributes their color to an <span class="highlight">optical</span> <span class="highlight">illusion</span> when blue ice is illuminated by a near-horizon red Sun, but green icebergs stand out among white and blue icebergs under a great <span class="highlight">variety</span> of light conditions. </span><span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>Another suggestion is that the color might be related to ice with high levels of <span class="highlight">metallic</span> compounds, including <span class="highlight">copper</span> and iron. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>Recent expeditions have taken ice samples from green icebergs and ice cores-<span class="highlight">vertical</span>, cylindrical ice samples reaching down to great depths-from the <span class="highlight">glacial</span> ice shelves <span class="highlight">along</span> the <span class="highlight">Antarctic</span> <span class="highlight">continent</span>. Analyses of these cores and samples provide a different <span class="highlight">solution</span> to the problem.</p>
          <p>The ice shelf cores, with a total length of 215 meters (705 feet), were long enough to <span class="highlight"><span class="question4">penetrate</span> <span class="highlight"></span>through</span> <span class="highlight">glacial</span> ice-which is formed from the compaction of snow and contains <span class="highlight">air</span> bubbles-and to continue into the <span class="highlight">clear</span>, bubble-free ice formed from seawater that freezes onto the bottom of the <span class="highlight">glacial</span> ice. The properties of this <span class="highlight">clear</span> sea ice were very <span class="highlight">similar</span> to the ice from the green <span class="highlight">iceberg</span>. The scientists concluded that green icebergs form when a two-layer <span class="highlight">block</span> of shelf ice breaks away and capsizes (turns upside down), exposing the bubble-free shelf ice that was formed from seawater.</p>
          <p>A green <span class="highlight">iceberg</span> that stranded just west of the Amery Ice Shelf showed two <span class="highlight">distinct</span> layers: bubbly blue-white ice and bubble-free green ice separated by a one-meter- long ice <span class="highlight">layer</span> containing sediments. <span class="question7">The green ice <span class="highlight">portion</span> was textured by seawater <span class="highlight">erosion</span>. </span>Where cracks were present, the color was light green because of light scattering; where no cracks were present, the color was dark green. No <span class="highlight">air</span> bubbles were present in the green ice, suggesting that the ice was not formed from the compression of snow but <span class="highlight">instead</span> from the freezing of seawater. Large concentrations of single-celled organisms with green pigments (coloring substances) <span class="highlight">occur</span> <span class="highlight">along</span> the edges of the ice shelves in this <span class="highlight">region</span>, and the seawater is rich in their decomposing <span class="highlight">organic</span> <span class="highlight">material</span>. The green <span class="highlight">iceberg</span> did not <span class="highlight">contain</span> large amounts of particles from these organisms, but the ice had <span class="question8">accumulated </span>dissolved <span class="highlight">organic</span> matter from the seawater. It appears that unlike salt, dissolved <span class="highlight">organic</span> substances are not <span class="question9">excluded </span>from the ice in the freezing <span class="highlight">process</span>. <span class="highlight">Analysis</span> shows that the dissolved <span class="highlight">organic</span> <span class="highlight">material</span> absorbs enough blue wavelengths from <span class="highlight">solar</span> light to make the ice <span class="highlight">appear</span> green.</p>
          <p>Chemical <span class="highlight">evidence</span> shows that platelets (<span class="highlight">minute</span> <span class="highlight">flat</span> portions) of ice form in the water and then <span class="question10">accrete </span>and <span class="highlight">stick</span> to the bottom of the ice shelf to form a slush (<span class="highlight">partially</span> melted snow). The slush is compacted by an unknown <span class="highlight">mechanism</span>, and <span class="highlight">solid</span>, bubblefree ice is formed from water high in <span class="highlight">soluble</span> <span class="highlight">organic</span> substances. When an <span class="highlight">iceberg</span> separates from the ice shelf and capsizes, the green ice is <span class="highlight">exposed</span>.</p>
          <p>The Amery Ice Shelf appears to be uniquely suited to the production of green icebergs. Once detached from the ice shelf, these bergs <span class="highlight">drift</span> in the currents and wind systems surrounding <span class="highlight">Antarctica</span> and can be found <span class="highlight">scattered</span> among <span class="highlight">Antarctica</span>'s less colorful icebergs.</p>
