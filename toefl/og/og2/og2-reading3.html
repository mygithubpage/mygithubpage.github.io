They are formed by glaciers-large rivers of ice that begin inland in the snows of Greenland, <span class="highlight">Antarctica</span>, and Alaska-and move slowly toward the sea. The <span class="highlight">forward</span> movement, the <span class="highlight">melting</span> at the <span class="highlight">base</span> of the <span class="highlight">glacier</span> where it meets the ocean, and waves and <span class="highlight">tidal</span><span class="highlight">action</span> cause blocks of ice to <span class="highlight">break</span> off and <span class="highlight">float</span> out to sea.</p><p>Icebergs are ordinarily blue to white, although they sometimes <span class="highlight">appear</span> dark or <span class="highlight">opaque</span> because they carry <span class="highlight">gravel</span> and bits of rock. They may change color with changing light conditions and cloud cover, glowing pink or gold in the morning or evening light, but this color change is generally related to the low <span class="highlight">angle</span> of the Sun above the <span class="highlight">horizon</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>However, travelers to <span class="highlight">Antarctica</span> have repeatedly reported seeing green icebergs in the Weddell Sea and, more commonly, close to the Amery Ice Shelf in East <span class="highlight">Antarctica</span>.</p><p><span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span><span class="question3">One explanation for green icebergs attributes their color to an <span class="highlight">optical</span><span class="highlight">illusion</span> when blue ice is illuminated by a near-horizon red Sun, but green icebergs stand out among white and blue icebergs under a great <span class="highlight">variety</span> of light conditions.</span><span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>Another suggestion is that the color might be related to ice with high levels of <span class="highlight">metallic</span> compounds, including <span class="highlight">copper</span> and iron. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>Recent expeditions have taken ice samples from green icebergs and ice cores-<span class="highlight">vertical</span>, cylindrical ice samples reaching down to great depths-from the <span class="highlight">glacial</span> ice shelves <span class="highlight">along</span> the <span class="highlight">Antarctic</span><span class="highlight">continent</span>. Analyses of these cores and samples provide a different <span class="highlight">solution</span> to the problem.</p><p>The ice shelf cores, with a total length of 215 meters (705 feet), were long enough to <span class="highlight"><span class="question4">penetrate</span></span><span class="highlight">through</span><span class="highlight">glacial</span> ice-which is formed from the compaction of snow and contains <span class="highlight">air</span> bubbles-and to continue into the <span class="highlight">clear</span>, bubble-free ice formed from seawater that freezes onto the bottom of the <span class="highlight">glacial</span> ice. The properties of this <span class="highlight">clear</span> sea ice were very <span class="highlight">similar</span> to the ice from the green <span class="highlight">iceberg</span>. The scientists concluded that green icebergs form when a two-layer <span class="highlight">block</span> of shelf ice breaks away and capsizes (turns upside down), exposing the bubble-free shelf ice that was formed from seawater.</p><p>A green <span class="highlight">iceberg</span> that stranded just west of the Amery Ice Shelf showed two <span class="highlight">distinct</span> layers: bubbly blue-white ice and bubble-free green ice separated by a one-meter- long ice <span class="highlight">layer</span> containing sediments. <span class="question7">The green ice <span class="highlight">portion</span> was textured by seawater <span class="highlight">erosion</span>.</span> Where cracks were present, the color was light green because of light scattering; where no cracks were present, the color was dark green. No <span class="highlight">air</span> bubbles were present in the green ice, suggesting that the ice was not formed from the compression of snow but <span class="highlight">instead</span> from the freezing of seawater. Large concentrations of single-celled organisms with green pigments (coloring substances) <span class="highlight">occur</span><span class="highlight">along</span> the edges of the ice shelves in this <span class="highlight">region</span>, and the seawater is rich in their decomposing <span class="highlight">organic</span><span class="highlight">material</span>. The green <span class="highlight">iceberg</span> did not <span class="highlight">contain</span> large amounts of particles from these organisms, but the ice had <span class="question8">accumulated</span> dissolved <span class="highlight">organic</span> matter from the seawater. It appears that unlike salt, dissolved <span class="highlight">organic</span> substances are not <span class="question9">excluded</span> from the ice in the freezing <span class="highlight">process</span>. <span class="highlight">Analysis</span> shows that the dissolved <span class="highlight">organic</span><span class="highlight">material</span> absorbs enough blue wavelengths from <span class="highlight">solar</span> light to make the ice <span class="highlight">appear</span> green.</p><p>Chemical <span class="highlight">evidence</span> shows that platelets (<span class="highlight">minute</span><span class="highlight">flat</span> portions) of ice form in the water and then <span class="question10">accrete</span> and <span class="highlight">stick</span> to the bottom of the ice shelf to form a slush (<span class="highlight">partially</span> melted snow). The slush is compacted by an unknown <span class="highlight">mechanism</span>, and <span class="highlight">solid</span>, bubblefree ice is formed from water high in <span class="highlight">soluble</span><span class="highlight">organic</span> substances. When an <span class="highlight">iceberg</span> separates from the ice shelf and capsizes, the green ice is <span class="highlight">exposed</span>.</p><p>The Amery Ice Shelf appears to be uniquely suited to the production of green icebergs. Once detached from the ice shelf, these bergs <span class="highlight">drift</span> in the currents and wind systems surrounding <span class="highlight">Antarctica</span> and can be found <span class="highlight">scattered</span> among <span class="highlight">Antarctica</span>'s less colorful icebergs.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 1, all of the following are true of icebergs EXCEPT:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They do not have a regular shape.</p><p>B. They are formed where glaciers meet the ocean.</p><p>C. Most of their mass is above the sea surface.</p><p>D. Waves and tides cause them to break off glaciers.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The text "The float with only about 12 percent of their mass above the sea surface." means that only 12 percent of their volume is on the surface of the sea. Option C is wrong. The first sentence "Icebergs are massive blocks of ice, irregular in shape,....", so option A is right; the last sentence, "The forward movement, the melting at the base of the glacier where it meets the ocean, and waves and Tidal action cause blocks of ice to break off and float out to sea.ï¿½ so option B, D is right</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 2, what causes icebergs to sometimes appear dark or opaque?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. A heavy cloud cover</p><p>B. The presence of gravel or bits of rock</p><p>C. The low angle of the Sun above the horizon</p><p>D. The presence of large cracks in their surface</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The original words "Icebergs are ordinarily blue to white, although they sometimes appear dark or opaque because they carried gravel and bits of rock." Mean: The iceberg is generally blue to white, although sometimes it is because of carrying gravel and small rocks. It turns black or opaque.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. One explanation notes that green icebergs stand out among other icebergs under a great variety of light conditions, but this is attributed to an optical illusion.</p><p>B. One explanation for the color of green icebergs attributes their color to an optical illusion that occurs when the light from a near-horizon red Sun shines on a blue iceberg.</p><p>C. One explanation for green icebergs attributes their color to a great variety of light conditions, but green icebergs stand out best among other icebergs when illumiï¿½nated by a near-horizon red Sun.</p><p>D. One explanation attributes the color of green icebergs to an optical illusion under special light conditions, but green icebergs appear distinct from other icebergs under a great variety of light conditions.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The sentence should pay attention to the meaning of but before and after. Two-layer meaning, namely green color is due to an optical illusion, and green icebergs stand out. Option A is a causal link. Option B is an incorrect association. Option C is to reverse the mashup original sentence. Option D is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question4">penetrate</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. collect</p><p>B. pierce</p><p>C. melt</p><p>D. endure</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>Penetrate v. penetration, penetration Select B.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, how is glacial ice formed?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. By the compaction of snow</p><p>B. By the freezing of seawater on the bottom of ice shelves</p><p>C. By breaking away from the ice shelf</p><p>D. By the capsizing of a two-layer block of shelf ice</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>According to the text "The ice shelf cores, ....<span class="question4">penetrate</span> through glacial ice ï¿½ which is formed from the compaction of snow and contains air bubble- ...."</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, ice shelf cores helped scientists explain the formation of green icebergs by showing that</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Because new building materials are hard to find, construction techniques have changed very little from past generations.</p><p>B. The availability of suitable building materials no longer limits the types of structures that may be built.</p><p>C. The primary building materials that are available today are wood, stone, and brick.</p><p>D. Architects in earlier times did not have enough building materials to enclose large spaces.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The second sentence ï¿½The properties of this clear sea ice were very similar to the ice from the green iceberg.ï¿½ means: The nature of this clean sea ice is very similar to that of green iceberg ice. Because of the similarity of this nature, the scientists concluded that the inverted upside-down of two layers of ice cubes reveals the bubble-free ice formed by the bottom formed seawater. Option A is wrong. The original does not say that the ice at the bottom of the green iceberg is formed by seawater and has no bubbles; option B is wrong, and the bubble without ice is formed at the top of the ice shelf but formed at the bottom; Option C is wrong, the article is not This comparison.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the author mention that "<span class="highlight">The green ice portion was textured by seawater erosion</span>"?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To explain why cracks in the iceberg appeared light green instead of dark green</p><p>B. To suggest that green ice is more easily eroded by seawater than white ice is</p><p>C. To support the idea that the green ice had been the bottom layer before capsizing</p><p>D. To explain how the air bubbles had been removed from the green ice</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="The green ice portion was textured by seawater erosion C"><p>Going back to the paragraph and seeing the first sentence "a green iceberg that stranded just west of the Amery Ice Shelf showed two distinct layers:..." is an example. It means that there are two layers of green ice on the Amery Ice Shelf. The layer is soaked in blue, a layer of bubble-free green. Looking further ahead, the last sentence of the last paragraph, ï¿½The scientists concluded that...ï¿½ means: Scientists have concluded that the green iceberg is detached from the two shelves and turned upside down. The ice shelf is exposed. The reason why the texture of the green ice is eroded by seawater is to indicate that the green ice is the ice formed by seawater on the seabed. So it is to demonstrate the conclusions scientists made in the previous paragraph. Then Option 3 is right. Option A was wrong. The article did not say that the rift was light green, but only that the rift was pale green. Option B is wrong. There is no comparison in the article. Option D is wrong. The article did not say that the air bubble was removed.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question8">accumulated</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. collected</p><p>B. frozen</p><p>C. released</p><p>D. covered</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" A"><p>Accumulate v.

Why green icebergs are commonly produced in some parts of Antarctica</p><p>D. Why green icebergs contain large amounts of dissolved organic pigments</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Question A has an explanation. The last sentence of the first paragraph is "...waves and tidal action cause blocks of ice to break off...". There is an explanation for question C. In the last paragraph, Amery Ice Shelf is particularly suitable for the production of green icebergs. There is an explanation for question D. The fifth sentence of the fifth paragraph "Large concentrations of single-celled organisms with green pigments occur along the edges of the ice shelves in this region, and the seawater is rich in their decomposing organic material. It is only mentioned in the last sentence of the fourth paragraph.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The passage supports which of the following statements about the Amery Ice Shelf?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The Amery Ice Shelf produces only green icebergs.</p><p>B. The Amery Ice Shelf produces green icebergs because its ice contains high levels of metallic compounds such as copper and iron.</p><p>C. The Amery Ice Shelf produces green icebergs because the seawater is rich in a particular kind of soluble organic material.</p><p>D. No green icebergs are found far from the Amery Ice Shelf.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The second sentence in the paragraph "The slush is compacted by an unknown mechanism, and solid, bubble-free ice is formed from water high in soluble organic substances." Option A "only" is wrong; Option B is wrong, and options C is contradictory; Option D is wrong, and the last paragraph says "these bergs drift in the currents and wind systems surrounding Antarctica and can be found scattered among Antarctica's less colorful icebergs."</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Scientists have differed as to whether icebergs appear green as a result of light conditions or because of something in the ice itself..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>There are two possible reasons for being inserted into the sentence.

This explanation is the second of the two explanations presented in the third paragraph but it is not correct. Option B is wrong. The article did not say that all ice shelves will produce green icebergs. Option C pairs, the last sentence of the fourth paragraph and the fifth paragraph all talk about this explanation. Option D, also mentioned in the fourth and fifth paragraphs, the ice formed by the sea ice at the bottom of the ice shelf is bubble-free, and the upper layer is covered with bubbles. The green iceberg is the two layers of ice that fall off and then it is inverted. Option E is wrong. The text did not mention what color the iceberg was before it turned green. Option F is right. This is described in the fifth paragraph. From the fifth sentence, "Large concentrations of single-celled organisms with green pigments...." all describe soluble organic substances.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
