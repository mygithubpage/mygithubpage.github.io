          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.9" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Listen to part of a lecture in a <span class="underline">biology</span> class.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.23" data-time="3.9">[00:03.90]</span>Professor: We've been discussing animal communication. <span class="time" data-times="2.98" data-time="7.13">[00:07.13]</span>Um, today we're going to talk about dolphins. <span class="time" data-times="16.65" data-time="10.11">[00:10.11]</span>Now, dolphins make a wide <span class="underline">range</span> of communicative sounds and also <span class="underline">display</span> something called <span class="underline">vocal</span> learning, which is the <span class="underline">ability</span> of an animal to <span class="underline">modify</span> its vocalizations based on its experience with other animals.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.56" data-time="26.76">[00:26.76]</span>Ah, there are many types of <span class="underline">dolphin</span> vocalizations. <span class="time" data-times="14.09" data-time="30.32">[00:30.32]</span>We, we still don't know their <span class="underline">precise</span> meanings?<span class="underline">partly</span>, I <span class="underline">suppose</span>, because we haven't really tried that hard to <span class="underline">figure</span> out their <span class="underline">precise</span> meanings-but we do know that dolphins use vocalizations as a way of communicating with one another. <span class="time" data-times="7.56" data-time="44.41">[00:44.41]</span>And we've categorized their vocalizations into three types: whistles, clicks, and burst pulses. <span class="time" data-times="6.9" data-time="51.97">[00:51.97]</span>The <span class="underline">dolphin</span> whistles are very high-frequency sounds, ah, <span class="underline">partially</span> above the <span class="underline">range</span> of human hearing. <span class="time" data-times="8.01" data-time="58.87">[00:58.87]</span>What's <span class="underline">fascinating</span> is, each <span class="underline">dolphin</span> has a signature <span class="underline">whistle</span>, which is <span class="underline">unique</span> to each <span class="underline">individual</span> <span class="underline">dolphin</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.43" data-time="66.88">[01:06.88]</span>It allows them to call to and <span class="underline">identify</span> each other, <span class="time" data-times="1.54" data-time="71.31">[01:11.31]</span>Jennifer?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.53" data-time="72.85">[01:12.85]</span>
            <span class="underline">Female</span> Student: Kind of like learning someone's name? <span class="time" data-times="4.07" data-time="75.38">[01:15.38]</span>So ... do <span class="underline">dolphin</span> parents choose names for their children?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="7.66" data-time="79.45">[01:19.45]</span>Professor: Well, again that's something we don't know, but we do know that no two signature whistles <span class="underline">sound</span> <span class="underline">identical</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.82" data-time="87.11">[01:27.11]</span>And, members of the same family, their signature whistles have <span class="underline">similar</span> elements. <span class="time" data-times="7.11" data-time="92.93">[01:32.93]</span>Dolphins use them as <span class="underline">contact</span> calls-ah, they they call to each other while traveling and foraging. <span class="time" data-times="5.15" data-time="100.04">[01:40.04]</span>It helps keep the group together, and helps mothers and children find each other. <span class="time" data-times="12.76" data-time="105.19">[01:45.19]</span>Think of it like ... ah, if you were traveling in the forest with one other person who was just out of sight, you'd call out, "Are you there?" and the other person would <span class="underline">respond</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.24" data-time="117.95">[01:57.95]</span>But if there were several people in the forest, you would have to call that person's name to call to them.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="7.13" data-time="124.19">[02:04.19]</span>In, in <span class="underline">addition</span> to whistles, dolphins produce clicks, which are actually sonar or <span class="underline">sound</span> waves. <span class="time" data-times="6.09" data-time="131.32">[02:11.32]</span>They use the clicks to <span class="underline">communicate</span>, but, more importantly, to <span class="underline">navigate</span> and hunt. <span class="time" data-times="13.24" data-time="137.41">[02:17.41]</span>How? Well, the sonar clicks <span class="underline">bounce</span> off objects, and then the dolphins <span class="underline">convert</span> the <span class="underline">incoming</span> signals into a three-dimensional picture ... a, a <span class="underline">mental</span> map ... of what's around them. <span class="time" data-times="3.49" data-time="150.65">[02:30.65]</span>The clicks are extremely <span class="underline">sensitive</span> and <span class="underline">accurate</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.53" data-time="154.14">[02:34.14]</span>The sonar clicks are also very strong. <span class="time" data-times="8.58" data-time="156.67">[02:36.67]</span>And there's this <span class="underline">theory</span> that one <span class="underline">reason</span> dolphins swim side by side is to <span class="underline">avoid</span> interference from each other's sonar clicks. <span class="time" data-times="6.29" data-time="165.25">[02:45.25]</span>Interference would be confusing ... it would prevent them from getting an <span class="underline">accurate</span> picture of their surroundings. <span class="time" data-times="7.18" data-time="171.54">[02:51.54]</span>Ah, and what's interesting is, dolphins will turn off their sonar when another <span class="underline">dolphin</span> passes in front.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.37" data-time="178.72">[02:58.72]</span>Ah, the third <span class="underline">category</span> of <span class="underline">dolphin</span> vocalizations is burst pulses. <span class="time" data-times="8.36" data-time="185.09">[03:05.09]</span>These are all this other sounds the <span class="underline">dolphin</span> makes-squawks, squeals, barks, groans, and so on. <span class="time" data-times="6.99" data-time="193.45">[03:13.45]</span>Burst pulses are used to <span class="underline">display</span> <span class="underline">aggression</span>, show dominance, and <span class="underline">attract</span> a <span class="underline">mate</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.08" data-time="200.44">[03:20.44]</span>But whistles, clicks, and burst pulses aren't the only ways dolphins <span class="underline">communicate</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.16" data-time="205.52">[03:25.52]</span>Um, does anyone remember any other ways?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.66" data-time="208.68">[03:28.68]</span>
            <span class="underline">Male</span> Student: In the book, it said that they also slap their tails against the water. <span class="time" data-times="4.76" data-time="212.34">[03:32.34]</span>Oh, and ... the <span class="underline">air</span> that comes out when they breathe or <span class="underline">whistle</span> ... the ... ah ... the <span class="underline">bubble</span> streams? <span class="time" data-times="2.51" data-time="217.1">[03:37.10]</span>They can control how the <span class="underline">air</span> bubbles come out. <span class="time" data-times="1.67" data-time="219.61">[03:39.61]</span>I thought that was really interesting.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.5" data-time="221.28">[03:41.28]</span>Professor: Yes ... the <span class="underline">bubble</span> streams are very interesting. <span class="time" data-times="10.98" data-time="224.78">[03:44.78]</span>Dolphins can <span class="underline">identify</span> and <span class="underline">locate</span> each other by their <span class="underline">bubble</span> streams, and they can <span class="underline">imitate</span> the <span class="underline">bubble</span> <span class="underline">stream</span> patterns of other dolphins . .. <span class="underline">sort</span> of like saying hello. <span class="time" data-times="7.39" data-time="235.76">[03:55.76]</span>So as you can see, dolphins use many different sounds and behaviors to <span class="underline">convey</span> messages to each other.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="8.44" data-time="243.15">[04:03.15]</span>I'd like to tell you about when I was a graduate student... and ... I spent one summer on a boat in the Atlantic Ocean studying <span class="underline">marine</span> life. <span class="time" data-times="4.99" data-time="251.59">[04:11.59]</span>One morning there were about 25 dolphins swimming with the boat. <span class="time" data-times="3.72" data-time="256.58">[04:16.58]</span>We could hear their clicks and whistles as they called to each other. <span class="time" data-times="13.3" data-time="260.3">[04:20.30]</span>Now, we were there as <span class="underline">impartial</span> scientists, to do research, but...how could we not notice the beauty as the <span class="underline">bubble</span> streams made patterns in the water and the dolphins appeared to dance and play? <span class="time" data-times="5.75" data-time="273.6">[04:33.60]</span>It's wonderful when you do fieldwork and actually experience something you've been studying in a classroom. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="279.35">[04:39.35]</span>So if you ever have the <span class="underline">opportunity</span> ... go for it.</p>
