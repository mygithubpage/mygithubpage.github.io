            <b>Loie Fuller</b>
          </h4>
          <p>The United States dancer Loie Fuller (1862–1928) found theatrical dance in the late nineteenth <span class="highlight">century</span> artistically unfulfilling. She considered herself an artist rather than a <span class="highlight">mere</span> entertainer, and she, in turn, attracted the notice of other artists.</p>
          <p>Fuller devised a type of dance that focused on the shifting play of lights and colors on the voluminous skirts or draperies she wore, which she kept in <span class="highlight">constant</span> <span class="highlight">motion</span> <span class="highlight">principally</span> <span class="highlight">through</span> movements of her arms, sometimes extended with wands concealed under her costumes. She rejected the <span class="highlight">technical</span> virtuosity of movement in ballet, the most <span class="highlight question3">prestigious</span> form of theatrical dance at that time, perhaps because her <span class="highlight">formal</span> dance training was <span class="highlight">minimal</span>. <span class="question4">Although her early theatrical <span class="highlight">career</span> had included stints as an actress, she was not <span class="highlight">primarily</span> interested in storytelling or expressing emotions <span class="highlight">through</span> dance; the drama of her dancing emanated from her <span class="highlight">visual</span> effects.</span></p>
          <p>Although she discovered and introduced her art in the United States, she achieved her greatest glory in Paris, where she was <span class="question5">engaged</span> by the Folies Bergère in 1892 and soon became "La Loie," the darling of Parisian audiences. Many of her dances represented elements or natural objects-Fire, the Lily, the Butterfly, and so on-and thus accorded well with the <span class="highlight">fashionable</span> Art <span class="highlight">Nouveau</span> style, which emphasized nature imagery and <span class="highlight">fluid</span>, <span class="highlight">sinuous</span> lines. Her dancing also attracted the <span class="highlight">attention</span> of French poets and painters of the period, for it appealed to their liking for mystery, their belief in art for art's <span class="highlight">sake</span>, a nineteenth-century idea that art is <span class="highlight">valuable</span> in itself rather than because it may have some <span class="highlight">moral</span> or educational <span class="highlight">benefit</span>, and their efforts to <span class="highlight question6">synthesize</span> form and <span class="highlight">content</span>.</p>
          <p>Fuller had <span class="highlight">scientific</span> leanings and <span class="highlight">constantly</span> experimented with electrical lighting (which was then in its <span class="highlight">infancy</span>), colored gels, <span class="highlight">slide</span> projections, and other aspects of <span class="highlight">stage</span> technology. She invented and patented <span class="highlight">special</span> arrangements of mirrors and concocted chemical dyes for her draperies. Her <span class="highlight">interest</span> in color and light paralleled the research of several artists of the period, <span class="highlight">notably</span> the painter Seurat, famed for his Pointillist <span class="highlight">technique</span> of creating a <span class="highlight">sense</span> of shapes and light on <span class="highlight">canvas</span> by applying extremely small dots of color rather than by painting lines. One of Fuller's <span class="highlight">major</span> inventions was underlighting, in which she stood on a pane of frosted glass illuminated from <span class="highlight">underneath</span>. This was particularly <span class="highlight">effective</span> in her Fire Dance (1895), performed to the music of Richard Wagner's "Ride of the Valkyries." The dance caught the eye of artist Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, who depicted it in a lithograph.</p>
          <p>As her <span class="highlight">technological</span> <span class="highlight">expertise</span> grew more <span class="highlight">sophisticated</span>, so did the other aspects of her dances. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>Although she gave little thought to music in her earliest dances, she later used scores by Gluck, Beethoven, Schubert, Chopin, and Wagner, <span class="highlight">eventually</span> graduating to Stravinsky, Fauré, Debussy, and Mussorgsky, composers who were then considered <span class="highlight">progressive</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>She began to <span class="highlight">address</span> more <span class="highlight">ambitious</span> themes in her dances such as The Sea, in which her dancers invisibly <span class="question10">agitated</span> a huge expanse of silk, played upon by colored lights. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>Always open to <span class="highlight">scientific</span> and <span class="highlight">technological</span> innovations, she befriended the scientists Marie and Pierre Curie upon their discovery of radium and created a Radium Dance, which simulated the <span class="highlight">phosphorescence</span> of that <span class="highlight">element</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>She both appeared in films-then in an early <span class="highlight">stage</span> of <span class="highlight">development</span>-and made them herself; the hero of her fairy-tale <span class="highlight">film</span> Le Lys de la Vie (1919) was played by René Clair, later a <span class="highlight">leading</span> French <span class="highlight">film</span> <span class="highlight">director</span>.</p>
          <p>At the Paris <span class="highlight">Exposition</span> in 1900, she had her own theater, where, in <span class="highlight">addition</span> to her own dances, she presented pantomimes by the Japanese actress Sada Yocco. She assembled an all-female <span class="highlight">company</span> at this time and established a school around 1908, but neither survived her. Although she is remembered today <span class="highlight">chiefly</span> for her innovations in <span class="highlight">stage</span> lighting, her activities also touched Isadora Duncan and Ruth St.Denis, two other United States dancers who were experimenting with new types of dance. She <span class="highlight">sponsored</span> Duncan's first <span class="highlight">appearance</span> in Europe. Her theater at the Paris <span class="highlight">Exposition</span> was visited by St.Denis, who found new ideas about stagecraft in Fuller's work and fresh sources for her art in Sada Yocco's plays. In 1924 St.Denis paid <span class="highlight">tribute</span> to Fuller with the duet Valse à la Loie.</p>
