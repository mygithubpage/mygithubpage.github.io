She considered herself an artist rather than a <span class="highlight">mere</span> entertainer, and she, in turn, attracted the notice of other artists.</p><p>Fuller devised a type of dance that focused on the shifting play of lights and colors on the voluminous skirts or draperies she wore, which she kept in <span class="highlight">constant</span><span class="highlight">motion</span><span class="highlight">principally</span><span class="highlight">through</span> movements of her arms, sometimes extended with wands concealed under her costumes. She rejected the <span class="highlight">technical</span> virtuosity of movement in ballet, the most <span class="highlight"><span class="question3">prestigious</span></span> form of theatrical dance at that time, perhaps because her <span class="highlight">formal</span> dance training was <span class="highlight">minimal</span>. <span class="question4">Although her early theatrical <span class="highlight">career</span> had included stints as an actress, she was not <span class="highlight">primarily</span> interested in storytelling or expressing emotions <span class="highlight">through</span> dance; the drama of her dancing emanated from her <span class="highlight">visual</span> effects.</span></p><p>Although she discovered and introduced her art in the United States, she achieved her greatest glory in Paris, where she was <span class="question5">engaged</span> by the Folies Bergï¿½re in 1892 and soon became "La Loie," the darling of Parisian audiences. Many of her dances represented elements or natural objects-Fire, the Lily, the Butterfly, and so on-and thus accorded well with the <span class="highlight">fashionable</span> Art <span class="highlight">Nouveau</span> style, which emphasized nature imagery and <span class="highlight">fluid</span>, <span class="highlight">sinuous</span> lines. Her dancing also attracted the <span class="highlight">attention</span> of French poets and painters of the period, for it appealed to their liking for mystery, their belief in art for art's <span class="highlight">sake</span>, a nineteenth-century idea that art is <span class="highlight">valuable</span> in itself rather than because it may have some <span class="highlight">moral</span> or educational <span class="highlight">benefit</span>, and their efforts to <span class="highlight"><span class="question6">synthesize</span></span> form and <span class="highlight">content</span>.</p><p>Fuller had <span class="highlight">scientific</span> leanings and <span class="highlight">constantly</span> experimented with electrical lighting (which was then in its <span class="highlight">infancy</span>), colored gels, <span class="highlight">slide</span> projections, and other aspects of <span class="highlight">stage</span> technology. She invented and patented <span class="highlight">special</span> arrangements of mirrors and concocted chemical dyes for her draperies. Her <span class="highlight">interest</span> in color and light paralleled the research of several artists of the period, <span class="highlight">notably</span> the painter Seurat, famed for his Pointillist <span class="highlight">technique</span> of creating a <span class="highlight">sense</span> of shapes and light on <span class="highlight">canvas</span> by applying extremely small dots of color rather than by painting lines. One of Fuller's <span class="highlight">major</span> inventions was underlighting, in which she stood on a pane of frosted glass illuminated from <span class="highlight">underneath</span>. This was particularly <span class="highlight">effective</span> in her Fire Dance (1895), performed to the music of Richard Wagner's "Ride of the Valkyries." The dance caught the eye of artist Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, who depicted it in a lithograph.</p><p>As her <span class="highlight">technological</span><span class="highlight">expertise</span> grew more <span class="highlight">sophisticated</span>, so did the other aspects of her dances. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>Although she gave little thought to music in her earliest dances, she later used scores by Gluck, Beethoven, Schubert, Chopin, and Wagner, <span class="highlight">eventually</span> graduating to Stravinsky, Faurï¿½, Debussy, and Mussorgsky, composers who were then considered <span class="highlight">progressive</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>She began to <span class="highlight">address</span> more <span class="highlight">ambitious</span> themes in her dances such as The Sea, in which her dancers invisibly <span class="question10">agitated</span> a huge expanse of silk, played upon by colored lights. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>Always open to <span class="highlight">scientific</span> and <span class="highlight">technological</span> innovations, she befriended the scientists Marie and Pierre Curie upon their discovery of radium and created a Radium Dance, which simulated the <span class="highlight">phosphorescence</span> of that <span class="highlight">element</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>She both appeared in films-then in an early <span class="highlight">stage</span> of <span class="highlight">development</span>-and made them herself; the hero of her fairy-tale <span class="highlight">film</span> Le Lys de la Vie (1919) was played by Renï¿½ Clair, later a <span class="highlight">leading</span> French <span class="highlight">film</span><span class="highlight">director</span>.</p><p>At the Paris <span class="highlight">Exposition</span> in 1900, she had her own theater, where, in <span class="highlight">addition</span> to her own dances, she presented pantomimes by the Japanese actress Sada Yocco. She assembled an all-female <span class="highlight">company</span> at this time and established a school around 1908, but neither survived her. Although she is remembered today <span class="highlight">chiefly</span> for her innovations in <span class="highlight">stage</span> lighting, her activities also touched Isadora Duncan and Ruth St.Denis, two other United States dancers who were experimenting with new types of dance. She <span class="highlight">sponsored</span> Duncan's first <span class="highlight">appearance</span> in Europe. Her theater at the Paris <span class="highlight">Exposition</span> was visited by St.Denis, who found new ideas about stagecraft in Fuller's work and fresh sources for her art in Sada Yocco's plays. In 1924 St.Denis paid <span class="highlight">tribute</span> to Fuller with the duet Valse ï¿½ la Loie.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What can be inferred from paragraph 1 about theatrical dance in the late nineteenth century?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

In the second sentence, she considers herself an artist, not an entertainer. Therefore reasoning can conclude that option C is correct. Option A is wrong. The original text just said that it attracted other artists and did not speak outside of the dance field. Option B is wrong and did not make this comparison.

Means: Fuller invented a new type of dance that focuses on the transformation of light and color in the large skirts she wears. She keeps the costume in constant movement, mainly through her arms. Sometimes the arm is hidden by a stick hidden under her costume. Through this sentence to determine the options ABC are mentioned.

The latter two examples are all about the development of other aspects of her dance. So choose C.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question10">agitated</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. emerged from beneath</p><p>B. created movement in</p><p>C. arranged themselves in</p><p>D. pretended to be</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>Agitate: Turn, stir.
