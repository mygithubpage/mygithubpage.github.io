Young children and art. Research suggests that learning art skills can benefit a young child's development. Umm . . . two of the ways it can do this is by providing a platform to express complex emotions and by encouraging persistence. </p><p>Now, what do I mean when I say "a platform to express complex emotions"? Young children have limited vocabulary. So how would 1hey communicate the feeling of pride, for example? A drawing, though, making a drawing of feeling proud ... this is something a young child could do. So a little girl might draw herself jumping up in the air next to her bike. In the drawing, her arms are raised up in the air and she^ smiling. Children can communicate their emotions, whether positive or negative, through the drawing  mm  better than they could with words. </p><p>And encouraging persistence? Art skills can help children to develop patience and concentration to persist in an activity... the willingness to keep trying to reach a goal. So suppose there's a little boy who wants to mold a lump of clay into the shape of a car. The first attempt doesn't look too much like a car. He's disappointed but wants to try again. The second, third, fourth try still don't look quite right, but there's improvement with every attempt. So, after some time, he gets to the point where he's satisfied with his creation. The newly shaped clay car is an instant reminder of an accomplishment - a success resulting from his persistence. The boy may be able to transfer this lesson toward other situations and activities because, well, he's had the experience of successfully accomplishing a goal through hard work. </p></article><section id="question"><h4>Question</h4><p>Using points and examples from the talk, explain how learning art can impact a child's development. </p></section><section><h5>Important Points</h5><p>Learning art skills can have an important impact on the emotional development of young children in two ways. One is by helping them to express complex emotions. Drawing can, for example, help children express emotions that they cannot express in words. The little girl expressed pride when she drew a picture of herself looking proud of learning to ride a bike. The second way art can help young children is by teaching them persistence. After spending time perfecting an art piece—such as the little boy sculpting a car out of clay—they can see their success. </p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>In the listening passage, the speaker explains how learning art can influence a child's development. Two ways can be used to achieve this goal. One is to provide a platform to express complex emotions. Another is to encourage persistence. She gives two corresponding examples. In the first example, children can express their emotions by make a drawing of feeling proud. For instance, a little girl may draw herself jumping up in the air next to her bike. The speaker also gives an example to show how to encourage persistence. A little boy wants to mold some clay into the shape of a car. The first time it doesn't look like a car. The boy may become disappointed but still wants to try again. There is improvement along with his every new attempt. Finally, the product he makes looks like a car. Then the boy may realize that his success comes from persistent trying.</p></article></div><div><p><b>Play Audio Track 72 to hear a high-level response for Question 6.</b></p><p><audio src="test_2_072.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></p><p><b>Rater’s Comments</b></p><p>This speaker efficiently summarizes the key points from the lecture in order to explain how learning art skills can influence a child's development. His speech is highly intelligible and fluid, though there are a few minor lapses in flow, His response also demonstrates good control of both basic and more complex grammatical structures as used in spoken language.</p><p><b>Play Audio Track 73 to hear a mid-level response for Question 6.</b></p><p><audio src="test_2_073.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></p><p><b>Rater’s Comments</b></p><p>The speaker makes major errors in content as he attempts to summarize the lecture. He does not mention the second point—that learning the value of persistence is one of the ways that art can help children's emotional development. Also, his summary of the first point is inaccurate; he confuses the example for the second point with the example for the first point (helping children express emotions). His pronunciation is generally clear, but his response lacks full coherence; it is not always easy to see how one idea connects to the next. </p></div></main></body></html>
