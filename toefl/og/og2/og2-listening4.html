            <span class="time" data-times="12.7" data-time="98.77">[01:38.77]</span>Student: Well, to tell you the truth, she's been after me to take a class like this for a while, but I'm double-majoring in art and <span class="underline">journalism</span> and so my schedule's been really tight with all the classes I gotta take, so somehow I never...</p>
