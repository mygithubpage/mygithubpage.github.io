          <h4 class="w3-center">University May Build New Student Apartments Off Campus</h4>The Department of Student Housing is considering whether to build new student housing off campus in a residential area of town. Two of the major factors influencing the decision will be parking and space. Those who support building off campus argue that building new housing on campus would further increase the number of cars on and around campus and consume space that could be better used for future projects that the entire university community could benefit from. Supporters also say that students might even have a richer college experience by being connected to the local community and patronizing stores and other businesses in town.</article>

          <p>Now listen to two students discussing the article. </p>
          <p>Woman: I can't believe these plans. It just doesn't make sense to me.</p>
          <p>Man: Really? Seemed OK to me, especially the argument about the cars.</p>
          <p>Woman: Yeah, I know. But the thing is, it doesn't matter where students live 'cause they still have to get to class somehow, right? At least if they built new dorms on campus, students would use campus transportation ...</p>
          <p>Man: [interrupting]... instead of their cars. I see what you're getting at. If they live off campus, they're still going to have to drive and park on campus. Might even create more traffic.</p>
          <p>Woman: Exactly.</p>
          <p>Man: OK. Still, though ... the point about students interacting more with people in the community: that doesn't seem to be a bad thing, does it?</p>
          <p>Woman: But the more time spent off campus, in town, the less time spent on campus. What about all the clubs, shows, discussions, a-all the campus happenings that just kind of ...happen? It's important to be on campus to really take advantage of these things. Having a different living experience shouldn't be given up at the expense of not being as much a part of the university community. </p>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>In the listening passage, the woman does not like the university's plan to build new student apartment off campus. She believes it doesn't make any sense. The woman gives two reasons to illustrate her point. Firstly, if the students live off campus, they still have to drive and park on campus. This will create more traffic problems in the university. Secondly, more time spent off campus means less time spent on campus. According to the woman, it is important to live on campus to take advantage of all the teaching and learning facilities. She will miss all the clubs, shows and discussions. She thinks the students should be more closely related to the university community instead of the local community.</p>
