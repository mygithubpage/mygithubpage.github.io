Two of the major factors influencing the decision will be parking and space. Those who support building off campus argue that building new housing on campus would further increase the number of cars on and around campus and consume space that could be better used for future projects that the entire university community could benefit from. Supporters also say that students might even have a richer college experience by being connected to the local community and patronizing stores and other businesses in town.</p></article><div><audio src="og2-speaking3.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></div><article id="listening-passage" class="passage"><h3>Listening Text</h3><p>Now listen to two students discussing the article. </p><p>Woman: I can't believe these plans. It just doesn't make sense to me.</p><p>Man: Really? Seemed OK to me, especially the argument about the cars.</p><p>Woman: Yeah, I know. But the thing is, it doesn't matter where students live 'cause they still have to get to class somehow, right? At least if they built new dorms on campus, students would use campus transportation ...</p><p>Man: [interrupting]... instead of their cars. I see what you're getting at. If they live off campus, they're still going to have to drive and park on campus. Might even create more traffic.</p><p>Woman: Exactly.</p><p>Man: OK. Still, though ... the point about students interacting more with people in the community: that doesn't seem to be a bad thing, does it?</p><p>Woman: But the more time spent off campus, in town, the less time spent on campus. What about all the clubs, shows, discussions, a-all the campus happenings that just kind of ...happen? It's important to be on campus to really take advantage of these things. Having a different living experience shouldn't be given up at the expense of not being as much a part of the university community. </p></article><section id="question"><h4>Question</h4><p>The woman expresses her opinion of the university's plan. State her opinion and explain the reasons she gives for holding that opinion. </p></section><section><h5>Important Points</h5><p>The woman disagrees with the housing department's plan to build new student housing off campus. She thinks students will still have to drive to campus to get to class, so there will not be any decrease in the number of cars around cam pus. She also thinks students will miss opportunities to be involved in on-campus activities, which are just as important as the experience of living in town. </p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>In the listening passage, the woman does not like the university's plan to build new student apartment off campus. She believes it doesn't make any sense. The woman gives two reasons to illustrate her point. Firstly, if the students live off campus, they still have to drive and park on campus. This will create more traffic problems in the university. Secondly, more time spent off campus means less time spent on campus. According to the woman, it is important to live on campus to take advantage of all the teaching and learning facilities. She will miss all the clubs, shows and discussions. She thinks the students should be more closely related to the university community instead of the local community.</p></article></div><div><p><b>Play Audio Track 66 to hear a high-level response for Question 3.</b></p><p><audio src="test_2_066.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></p><p><b>Rater’s Comments</b></p><p>The speaker gives a sustained, coherent response that accurately and efficiently explains the woman's opinion of the main points of the newspaper article. He did not waste time by including unimportant details from the conversation or reading. His pacing is fluid, and he demonstrates good control of a variety of grammatical structures and vocabulary. His pronunciation is exceptionally clear.</p><p><b>Play Audio Track 67 to hear a mid-level response for Question 3.</b></p><p><audio src="test_2_067.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></p><p><b>Rater’s Comments</b></p><p>This speaker covers all the important points of the woman's opinion. However, the speaker never states what the university plan is, so she does not make it entirely clear what, in general, the woman in the conversation is disagreeing with. Her response contains some minor errors in word choice, such as assist rather than attend, but overall she demonstrates good control of both vocabulary and grammar. Her pacing is usually steady, though with a number of hesitations that require listener effort at times.</p></div></main></body></html>
