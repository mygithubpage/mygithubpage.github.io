For one thing, I can find articles of different styles in the same magazine. Some of them are lyrical, some are sentimental, some are sarcastic. Also, I could enjoy the beauty of English language. I am particularly fond of short poems published on the magazine. As the saying goes, simple is elegance. Those beautiful yet concise poems always teach me how to view life positively. Finally, it is so convenient to get the latest issue of my favorite magazine. I can buy it in a bookstore, a supermarket, or even a roadside newspaper kiosk.</p></article></section></main></body></html>
