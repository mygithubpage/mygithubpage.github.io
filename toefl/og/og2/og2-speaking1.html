          <h5>Important Points</h5>
          <p>A more developed response might begin "I like to read news magazines because they provide more detailed information about current events than television news shows or newspapers can," and then continue on to explain how the added details in news magazines are interesting or beneficial. Note that raters are only going to consider how well you explain your interest, not make judgments about what you read. It does not matter whether your favorite reading materials are physics journals or comic books!</p>

          <p><b>Rater’s Comments</b></p>
          <p>The speaker identifies her preferred reading material—plays—and gives a very well-developed explanation for why she enjoys them. She uses plenty of supporting details and examples in her response. As her answer progresses, she identifies one author, Shakespeare, whose plays she especially enjoys reading, then further explains why his plays are meaningful to her. She uses a wide range of vocabulary and grammatical constructions with ease, and while her pronunciation is not perfect, it is easy to understand.</p>

          <p><b>Rater’s Comments</b></p>
          <p>The speaker states what kind of reading material he likes, but he does not develop his answer with much detail. He could have developed his answer better if he had chosen only one type of material—books or novels. For example, he could have explained what sport he likes to read about in magazines, why he is interested in that sport, and how magazines help him maintain his interest. His speech is easy to understand, but he has minor problems with pacing, often pausing to think of the next word to say. His vocabulary range is somewhat narrow. </p>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>I love reading English magazines in my spare time, and "Reader's Digest" is my favorite. For one thing, I can find articles of different styles in the same magazine. Some of them are lyrical, some are sentimental, some are sarcastic. Also, I could enjoy the beauty of English language. I am particularly fond of short poems published on the magazine. As the saying goes, simple is elegance. Those beautiful yet concise poems always teach me how to view life positively. Finally, it is so convenient to get the latest issue of my favorite magazine. I can buy it in a bookstore, a supermarket, or even a roadside newspaper kiosk.</p>
