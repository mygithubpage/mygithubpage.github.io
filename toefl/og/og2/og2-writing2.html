      <h5>Topic Notes</h5>
      <p>If you agree with this statement, you should present examples and reasons. For example, young people may tend to go out more and participate in fun activities while older people may tend to stay at home more. Another reason that older people may enjoy life less is because they have more responsibilities and pressure from work, family, and money than young people. A third reason might be that young people are more physically fit and able to enjoy more activities than older people.</p>
      <p>If you disagree with this statement in your response, you should present examples and reasons that older people enjoy life more. For example, older people may better know what satisfies them and makes them happy than young people do.</p>
      <p>Some good responses explain that the group that enjoys life more depends on where they live. All of these approaches can be developed into a good response.</p>

        <p>People often complain about seing themselves becoming older too quickly. But does that mean that they are enjoying their lives less than they did before? Personally, I rather disagree with this statement. It would probably be more accurate to say that every time of a person’s life is worth being lived and enjoyed.</p>
        <p>There is no denying that young people have far less responsibilities with, for instance, family and work. Thus, they can spend more time on their hobbies than people who are working all day long and who have to care about their children at night when they come home. But one cannot overlook that having a family to care about can be considered as a satisfying pleasure in itself. Besides, many people find fullfillment in their work and enjoy spending most of their time on it.</p>
        <p>Moreover, it is customary to say that older people tend to have more health problems than teenagers or students do. However, it is well worth noticing that this assertion cannot be taken as a general rule, as also many young people develop painfull illnesses. A striking example of a disease which tends to affect more and more teenagers is back ache, because they are sitting for too long periods of time and doing too little sport to compensate. Consequently, the argument supporting that good health makes life more enjoyable when you are young may be called into question.</p>
        <p>In addition to that, one should not forget that today’s teenagers are expected to take important decisions about their future at an early age, and that they have to cope with heavy responsibilities even before getting their first school degree. As it becomes more and more difficult to find a job these days, young people have to worry about what to study and they even often have to fix priorities according to what the job market offers, and not according to their personal preferences.</p>
        <p>Last but not least, one cannot forget that after working hard for long years, people retire and are then given the chance to concentrate on their centers of interest and hobbies again. Up to a certain point, when taking into account the arguments of the previous paragraph concerning the early responsibilities teenagers have to assume, pensioners are even more free to enjoy their lives without thinking of potential problems of the future.</p>
        <p>To put it in a nutshell, that all amounts to saying that there is no period of time in a person’s life which is more prone to hapiness than the others. People only have to learn to make the best of every situation and of what they have . . . even if it is easier said than done!</p>

        <p>This well-structured essay meets all the criteria needed to earn a score of 5. It takes issue with the statement presented. It first develops its points somewhat inductively. In paragraph 2, it presents reasons why younger people may enjoy life more (fewer responsibilities) but ends by explaining why these same responsibilities can be fulfilling for older people. Paragraph 3 advances the claim that older people have more health problems and goes on to explain that young people can have health issues as well. The last point developed in paragraphs 4 and 5 discusses how younger people have to worry about their studies and their future, while older people who are retired are free to enjoy their lives—their hobbies and interests. Sentence structures are varied and complex, and the response displays good vocabulary choice; these allow the writer to convey meaning accurately. There is a minor organizational issue: the writer makes the statement in the introductory paragraph, “It would probably be more accurate to say that every time of a person’s life is worth being lived and enjoyed,” and also concludes with this same notion. This is a bit misleading because the focus of the body paragraphs is not on enjoyment at all stages of life—much is discussed about things that are not so pleasant at particular times of life. However, this misleading statement is not a major issue, and the bulk of the essay is a well-organized, coherent discussion of why it cannot be said that younger people enjoy life more than older people do. </p>

        <h5>Score 5 Essay—Sample 2</h5>
        <p>Personally I agree to the statement “young people enjoy life more than older people do”, in that I believe the younger you are, the more possibilities you have of entertainment. The latter is a way to enjoy life, however it is not the only way. But depending on one’s age, there are different ways of having fun experiences and interests.</p>
        <p>Life can be enjoyed on an intellectual level by achieving more and more knowledge about the world, the human behaviour, past cultures and works of art. In order to learn more about the world, one must study. Studying is made easier for younger people in our society in that universities and colleges and most likely to accept a high school graduate rather than a retired man. Therefore it becomes harder for older people to have the opportunity to enjoy the privileges of studying and of acquiring knowledge. This however does not mean it cannot be done. In fact there are specific study programs designed for older people, either online or in special universities.</p>
        <p>By certain individuals, enjoying life means to be involved in the society and to have fun. Unfortunately our society tends to alienate the old in that they are considered “less active”. This is a mistake of the community. It is true that the older one gets the harder it is for him or her to be an active part in the society physically. However, the general term of “having fun” and being involved in society can be analysed at different levels and under many diverse points of views. Older people may have fun playing cards, while the younger ones finds fun in attending rave parties. Once again there are more opportunities for younger people to be involved in social events such as parties and sports related happenings. But it doesn’t mean there are NO opportunities for older people.</p>
        <p>The older population is more limited also due to a physical factor that prevents their capability of performing and resistance. Therefore a younger person may enjoy life by practicing a certain sport, while an older person may have difficulties playing a sport and being of actual competition in it. But older people can still get great joy from watching sports.</p>
        <p>Younger people have more access, freedom and possibilities to attend social events. Furthermore they tend to have less responsabilites such as a family. A younger person may have less responsabilites in that perhaps he or she is not yet married. This becomes an advantage in “having fun”, being that more time can be dedicated to theirselves rather than to their families. But for older people their fun is exactly the satifying they get from raising families so it’s just a different fun again.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, I believe that younger people are given more chances by society and their physical status to “enjoy life”. They have more possibilities of attending mundane events, of studying and of playing sports. Furthermore younger people tend to have more time to dedicate to theirselves and to their enjoyment of life, and less responsabilites. However an older person may also enjoy life, in a different way as I have explained.</p>
        <h5>Rater Comments</h5>
        <p>This essay meets all the requirements for a score of 5 by using well-developed examples that are relevant to the topic and by using highly varied vocabulary. The introductory paragraph clearly states the writer’s position that although younger people may have more opportunities to enjoy life, older people can enjoy it as well, but just differently. This is followed by the first point that society makes it easier for younger people to study and gain knowledge but that programs for older people also exist. The point is well developed and supports the writer’s objective. In the third and fourth paragraphs, the writer discusses how society may alienate older people because of their level of physical ability but then explains that older people may enjoy less physical activities that younger people may not enjoy, such as playing card games. This writer’s final point in paragraph 5, that younger people have fewer responsibilities, is also clear. All the points in the essay are developed in great detail, and the writer draws logical conclusions from each example. The advanced vocabulary used also adds to the essay’s high score. The essay does present some errors in usage (“I agree to the statement,” “By certain individuals”), but these errors do not interfere with the meaning and effectiveness of the writing.</p>

        <p>Yes, I agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do.</p>
        <p>Life is full of joy and happiness when one is young and full of energy, when one does not have any care for anyone and does not have much knowledge or experience of bitterness and sorrow of life.</p>
        <p>Young people can enjoy life because they are usually free of many diseases the older people suffer from. They can easily run, jump and do many things which is not possible for many olders. Thus physical fitness allow them to enjoy the life.</p>
        <p>They can enjoy life because they do not need to care for earning, for rent and pay other utilities bills. Finacial difficulties does not impress their young heart as much as doest to the adults. They usually deopend on their gardians for money. Therefore, they do not need to face the stresses concerning earning and maintaining daily livelihood.</p>
        <p>Unlike older people they are never alone. At home they are accompanied by either parents or other family members. at the streets they have their friends. If they do not have friends in a new community, they can make them very easily which could not be said about adults. In order to communicate with the other children they do not feel any barrier or complexity.</p>
        <p>Being young they do not face many problems of life which adults do. They do not have enough knowledge about life which can make them unhappy. They seldom think about aging and death. They think that they would never grow old and die.</p>
        <p>Therefore, there are many things in youth like young age, company, lack of care for money and lack of knowledg about the dark sides of life make them to feel happy and enjoy their life more than older people.</p>
        <h5>Rater Comments</h5>
        <p>This essay contains four points that address the topic and support the writer’s opinion that younger people enjoy life more than older people do. The points are generally well developed, distinct from each other, and introduced with clear topic sentences in each body paragraph. The writer uses a nice range of vocabulary and strives to make the essay flow by using appropriate transitions and sentence structures (“Therefore, they do not need to face the stresses . . .”). Along with slightly less than full elaboration of points, errors in word choice (“. . . they do not need to care for earning”) and grammar (“things which is not possible for many olders,” “Finacial difficulties does not . . .,” “there are many things . . . make them to feel happy”) do not interfere with meaning but are frequent enough to earn this essay a score of 4. </p>

        <p>Although young peolpe are more outgoing than older people, I do not agree with this statement. Older people are mostly retired and have much more time and money to go on trips and travel to other countrys. Younger people on the other hand have to learn often and do not have that much money to travel a lot. But they are more interested in discovering new countrys and make new experiences. In comparison, older people already have a lot of experience and they often, just want to visite places where they have been before rather than go on exiting trips. </p>
        <p>However, older peole often have problems with their health and therefore they are not as ﬂexible as young people are. Young people can do whatever they want, whithout thinking about their health. Older people therefore are more interested in their own family, which is often the most important topic in their lifes. And to my opinion it is far better to see your own grantchildren growing up than going into discos and stay up all night, what a lot of younger people do. </p>
        <p>To sum up the main points, I do not think that younger people enjoy their life more than older people do, because there are so many things that older people can do which younger can not do. To my opinion older people enjoy their lifes different than younger people do, but there is no better way. </p>
        <h5>Rater Comments</h5>
        <p>This essay presents a fairly well-developed argument against the idea that younger people enjoy life more than older people do. The writer discusses two main points—that older people beneﬁt more from the ability to travel and enjoy family time than younger people do—with a good amount of detail. While the overall meaning of the essay is clear, some of the ideas and connections are disjointed. In the second paragraph, for example, it is not clear how “therefore” connects the idea that older people may be more interested in family because younger people can do whatever they want without concern for their health. This minor structural ﬂaw obscures the writer’s intentions. A few errors in usage (“make new experiences,” “what a lot of younger people do”) that do not interfere with meaning also contribute to earning this essay a score of 4.

        <p>Nowadays, young people have a lot of opportunities to enjoy life, more than older people have known when they were young. Thought, values especially in the way to bring up children have changed. I think that young people enjoy life more than older people do for that reason and for several others. Young people are usually in good health, so they have more envy to live their life, more than older people who may have health problems or do not want to have too much activities. It is obvious that young people have time to enjoy their life, they are still on studies so they can have several activities, they have the possibility to do a lot of new experiences. Older people usually have a job and a family to look after, thet cannot do what they want, they have to give stability to them and their family. Nomad people are often single, it is difﬁcult to enjoy your life free when you have assignements. </p>
        <p>Moreover, when you are young you are very curious, interested by all you may learn. It is the exemple of the young child who wants to discover his environment. Generally, older people have already done a lot of things in their life such as sports, travels... </p>
        <p>Young people want to learn others things, they like to meet with friends to go to cinema or to museum. The best way to discover other cultures is obviously to travel to foreign countries and meet locals to understand their culturs without judgments. I think the best way to discover other countries is to travel to them or to study during a year in them. Study abroad is a very exciting experience during which you can learn a lot, especially on yourself. I think it makes you grow up. You have to be adaptive, to ask you questions . . . </p>
        <p>Finally, young people are incitated to move, to enjoy their lives through media, who help them to wide their mind to discovers and to other cultures. It is fundamental to young to discover all the world and open them to others, it should be a way to give them the possibility to continue to enjoy their life when they will be older.</p>
        <h5>Rater Comments</h5>
        <p>This essay earns a score of 3 because it lacks development of its key points. The writer lists a number of reasons to support the idea that younger people enjoy life more than older people do. Some of these reasons are fairly clear, but they are not substantiated by concrete examples that can be readily understood as supporting the overall idea the writer presents in the ﬁrst two sentences. It is not clear how the example of nomadic people relates to the idea that older people have more responsibilities. The most developed paragraph, about meeting friends and traveling abroad, has a number of ideas relevant to the question asked, but it is fairly difﬁcult to understand how the ideas within the paragraph are connected. It is also difﬁcult to see how all of the information is related to the topic or the writer’s opinion overall. For example, the writer does not explain how the statements that older people may have missed opportunities when they were young ties into the writer’s point. While much of the essay’s meaning is clear, this response is marked by some errors in grammar and word choice (“incitated to move,” “wide their mind”), and some of these are very difﬁcult to understand (“more envy to live”). These types of errors limit the essay to a score of 3.</p>

        <p>Life is a long travel that everybody can enjoyed. As young people discover new things everydays, older can use their own experiences to get more entertainment. The way, people, young or old, live their life is something that can not be discussed untill they do not hurt anybody.</p>
        <p>In one hand, when you are a young people, you can learn, and ﬁnd new things everydays. You meet lot of people in your primary school, your High School and your College. The young part of the life is done to enjoy every moments that will be cut of the future adult life. Futhermore, the fact that you are a young people allow you to communicate easily and to gain experiences fastly from your errors. Although, you also need advices from older peolpe who have certainly lived what you have to ask.</p>
        <p>In the other hand, older peolple have all the information that make life pleasant to live. Therefor peolple can think that, they will not enjoy life.In fact, if you already have all the advice you need to live, you can do something more exciting. Something like travel all around the world or take a new job because you have learned everything you thought you have to know. Moreover you also can interest to things that you have left behing. I mean when you were a student. It is not possible to take every courses you want to. But when you have done lot of things you can come back to the ﬁeld that passionated you. </p>
        <p>In short, I would say that if you do not enjoy your life when you are young you can not enjoy life when you are older. Therby, it is really important to take every moments as a single one and to enjoy it as if it was the only one you have.</p>
        <h5>Rater Comments</h5>
        <p>This essay cannot earn a score higher than a 3 for a number of reasons. It displays numerous errors in word choice and expression (“something that can not be discussed until they do not hurt anybody,” “you also can interest to things”) and grammar (“discover new things everydays,” “the ﬁeld that passionated you”) that are either distracting to the reader or occasionally obscure meaning. The writer promises in the introductory paragraph to elaborate on two main points— that younger people can discover new things and that older people can use their experience to enjoy life. However, these ideas are at best somewhat developed in paragraphs 2 and 3, though at times, the connections within each of these two paragraphs is a little unclear. Especially in the third paragraph, it is difﬁcult to know exactly what the point is that the writer is trying to make until the end of the paragraph. Finally, the statement “if you do not enjoy life when you are young you can not enjoy life when you are older” is used as a conclusion, but this is a new idea that is not expressed or developed earlier in the body of the essay. </p>
