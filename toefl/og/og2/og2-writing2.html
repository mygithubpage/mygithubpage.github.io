        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>People often complain about seeing themselves becoming older too quickly. But does that mean that they are enjoying their lives less than they did before? Personally, I'd rather disagree with this statement. It would probably be more accurate to say that every time of a person's life is worth being lived and enjoyed. There is no denying that young people have far less responsibilities with, for instance, family and work. Thus, they can spend more time on their hobbies than people who are working all day long and who have to care about their children at night when they come home. But one cannot overlook that having a family to care about can be considered as a satisfying pleasure in itself. Besides, many people find fulfillment in their work and enjoy spending most of their time on it. Moreover, it is customary to say that older people tend to have more health problems than teenagers or students do. However, it is well worth noticing that this assertion cannot be taken as a general rule, as also many young people develop painful illnesses. A striking example of a disease which tends to affect more and more teenagers is back ache, because they are sitting for too long periods of time and doing too little sport to compensate. Consequently, the argument supporting that good health makes life more enjoyable when you are young may be called into question. In addition to that, one should not forget that today's teenagers are expected to take important decisions about their future at an early age, and that they have to cope with heavy responsibilities even before getting their first school degree. As it becomes more and more difficult to find a job these days, young people have to worry about what to study and they even often have to fix priorities according to what the job market offers, and not according to their personal preferences. Last but not least, one cannot forget that after working hard for long years, people retire and are then given the chance to concentrate on their centers of interest and hobbies again. Up to a certain point, when taking into account the arguments of the previous paragraph concerning the early responsibilities teenagers have to assume, pensioners are even more free to enjoy their lives without thinking of potential problems of the future. To put it in a nutshell, that all amounts to saying that there is no period of time in a person's life which is more prone to happiness than the others. People only have to learn to make the best of every situation and of what they have . . . even if it is easier said than done!</article>
