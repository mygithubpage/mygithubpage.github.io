            <span class="time" data-times="4.12" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Listen to part of a lecture in an <span class="underline">anthropology</span> class.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.12" data-time="4.12">[00:04.12]</span>Professor: OK, I, I want to begin today by talking about calendars, <span class="time" data-times="5.51" data-time="9.24">[00:09.24]</span>I know, some of you are thinking it's not all that <span class="underline">fascinating</span>, right? <span class="time" data-times="6.6" data-time="14.75">[00:14.75]</span>But listen, the next time you look at a <span class="underline">calendar</span>, I want you to keep something in <span class="underline">mind</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9.99" data-time="21.35">[00:21.35]</span>There are at <span class="underline">least</span> three natural ways of measuring the ... the <span class="underline">passage</span> of time-by day, by month, and by year. <span class="time" data-times="3.08" data-time="31.34">[00:31.34]</span>And these are all <span class="underline">pretty</span> easy to see, right? <span class="time" data-times="3.83" data-time="34.42">[00:34.42]</span>I mean a day is based on one <span class="underline">rotation</span> of Earth. <span class="time" data-times="4.74" data-time="38.25">[00:38.25]</span>A month is how long the Moon takes to move around the Earth. <span class="time" data-times="4.87" data-time="42.99">[00:42.99]</span>And a year is the time it takes for Earth to move around the Sun, right? <span class="time" data-times="2.96" data-time="47.86">[00:47.86]</span>So they're all based on natural events. <span class="time" data-times="15.86" data-time="50.82">[00:50.82]</span>But the natural clocks of Earth, the Moon, and the Sun run on different times, and you can't divide any one of these time periods by another one without having some messy <span class="underline">fraction</span> left over. <span class="time" data-times="12.19" data-time="66.68">[01:06.68]</span>I mean one <span class="underline">lunar</span> month -that's the time it takes for the Moon to go around Earth-one month is about 29 and a half days ... not really a nice round number. <span class="time" data-times="5.69" data-time="78.87">[01:18.87]</span>And one year is a little more than 365 days. <span class="time" data-times="4.92" data-time="84.56">[01:24.56]</span>So these are <span class="underline">obviously</span> numbers that don't divide into each other very neatly. <span class="time" data-times="6.08" data-time="89.48">[01:29.48]</span>And this makes it <span class="underline">pretty</span> difficult to create some <span class="underline">sort</span> of tidy <span class="underline">calendar</span> that really works.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.83" data-time="95.56">[01:35.56]</span>Not that different cultures haven't tried. <span class="time" data-times="3.39" data-time="98.39">[01:38.39]</span>Have any of you ever been to Stonehenge? <span class="time" data-times="5.58" data-time="101.78">[01:41.78]</span>No ... you know, that amazing circle of <span class="underline">giant</span> stones in England? <span class="time" data-times="11.3" data-time="107.36">[01:47.36]</span>Well, if you ever go, and find yourself wondering why this <span class="underline">culture</span> way back in <span class="underline">prehistoric</span> England would go to so much work to <span class="underline">construct</span> this <span class="underline">monumental</span> ring of <span class="underline">enormous</span> stones,... <span class="time" data-times="13.78" data-time="118.66">[01:58.66]</span>well, keep in <span class="underline">mind</span> that a lot of us think it was designed, at <span class="underline">least</span> <span class="underline">partially</span>, as a calendar-to mark when the seasons of the year begin, according to the <span class="underline">exact</span> day when the Sun comes up from a <span class="underline">particular</span> direction. <span class="time" data-times="14.9" data-time="132.44">[02:12.44]</span>I have colleagues who <span class="underline">insist</span> it's a <span class="underline">temple</span>, maybe, or a tomb ... but they can't <span class="underline">deny</span> that it was also used as a <span class="underline">calendar</span> ...probably to help <span class="underline">figure</span> out, for example, when farmers should begin their planting each year.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.2" data-time="147.34">[02:27.34]</span>The Mayans, in Central America, also invented a <span class="underline">calendar</span>, but for a different purpose. <span class="time" data-times="14.43" data-time="153.54">[02:33.54]</span>The Mayans, especially the royalty and priests, <span class="underline">wanted</span> to look at long cycles of history-so the <span class="underline">calendar</span> they used had to be able to <span class="underline">count</span> far into the future as well as far into the past. <span class="time" data-times="12.78" data-time="167.97">[02:47.97]</span>And not only were the Mayans keeping <span class="underline">track</span> of the natural time - keepers we mentioned before-Earth, the Moon, and the Sun-but another natural timekeeper: the <span class="underline">planet</span> <span class="underline">Venus</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="11.03" data-time="180.75">[03:00.75]</span>
            <span class="underline">Venus</span> rises in the sky as the morning star every 584 days, and the <span class="underline">Venus</span> <span class="underline">cycle</span> was incorporated in the Mayan <span class="underline">calendar</span>. <span class="time" data-times="10.95" data-time="191.78">[03:11.78]</span>So the Mayans kept <span class="underline">track</span> of long periods of time, and they did it so accurately, in fact, that their <span class="underline">calendar</span> is considered about as <span class="underline">complicated</span> and <span class="underline">sophisticated</span> as any in the world.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="11.89" data-time="202.73">[03:22.73]</span>Now, the <span class="underline">ancient</span> Chinese believed very strongly in astrology?the idea that you can <span class="underline">predict</span> future events based on the positions of the stars and planets like, say, <span class="underline">Jupiter</span>. <span class="time" data-times="15.06" data-time="214.62">[03:34.62]</span>Incidentally, the whole Chinese system of astrology was based on the fact that the <span class="underline">planet</span> <span class="underline">Jupiter</span> goes around the Sun once every 12 years, so one <span class="underline">orbit</span> of <span class="underline">Jupiter</span> lasts 12 of our Earth years. <span class="time" data-times="4.98" data-time="229.68">[03:49.68]</span>Apparently, that's why the Chinese <span class="underline">calendar</span> has a <span class="underline">cycle</span> of 12 years. <span class="time" data-times="10.52" data-time="234.66">[03:54.66]</span>You know, like, "The Year of the Dragon," "The Year of the Tiger," and so on ...all parts of a 12-year <span class="underline">astrological</span> <span class="underline">cycle</span>, that we get from the <span class="underline">orbit</span> of <span class="underline">Jupiter</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="8.92" data-time="245.18">[04:05.18]</span>Calendars based on the orbits of other planets, though, are a lot less <span class="underline">common</span> than those based on the <span class="underline">cycle</span> of the Moon-the <span class="underline">lunar</span> month. <span class="time" data-times="8.5" data-time="254.1">[04:14.10]</span>I could <span class="underline">mention</span> any number of important cultures around the world that have depended on <span class="underline">lunar</span> calendars, but there really isn't time. <span class="time" data-times="10.05" data-time="262.6">[04:22.60]</span>So let's go right to the <span class="underline">calendar</span> that's now used <span class="underline">throughout</span> most of the world-a <span class="underline">solar</span> calendar-based on the number of days in a year. <span class="time" data-times="7.34" data-time="272.65">[04:32.65]</span>This <span class="underline">calendar</span>'s mainly derived from the one the <span class="underline">ancient</span> Romans devised a <span class="underline">couple</span> thousand years ago. <span class="time" data-times="9.96" data-time="279.99">[04:39.99]</span>I mean the Romans-with more than a little help from the Greeks?realized that a year actually lasts about 365 and one-quarter days. <span class="time" data-times="8.83" data-time="289.95">[04:49.95]</span>And so they decided to round off most years to 365 days but make every fourth year into a <span class="underline">leap</span> year. <span class="time" data-times="9.62" data-time="298.78">[04:58.78]</span>I mean, somehow, you have to <span class="underline">account</span> for that <span class="underline">extra</span> one-fourth of a day each year, so every four years, they made the <span class="underline">calendar</span> one day longer. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="308.4">[05:08.40]</span>By adding the <span class="underline">leap</span> year, the Romans were able to make a <span class="underline">calendar</span> that worked so well -that, with a few <span class="underline">minor</span> adjustments, this <span class="underline">calendar</span> is still widely used today.</p>
