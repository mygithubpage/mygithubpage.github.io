Actually, I've got a problem.</p><p>Advisor: Oh?</p><p>Student: Yeah, well, I still need to take an American literature course; it's required for graduation. But I've been putting it off. But since my next term is my last...</p><p>Advisor: Yeah, you can't put it off any longer!</p><p>Student: Right. The thing is, though ... it's not offered next term.</p><p>Advisor: I see. Hmm. Ah, how about... ah, taking the course at another university?</p><p>Student: I thought about that. It's offered at City College, but ... that's so far away. Commuting back and forth would take me a couple of hours, you know, a big chunk of time with all my other studies and everything.</p><p>Advisor: True, but it's been done. Or... ah, there are a couple of graduate courses in American literature. Why not take one of those?</p><p>Student: Yeah, but... wouldn't that be hard, though? I mean ... it's a graduate course; that'd be pretty intense.</p><p>Advisor: Yeah, it'd probably mean more studying than you're used to, but I'm sure it's not beyond your abilities. </p></article><section id="question"><h4>Question</h4><p>The speakers discuss two possible solutions to the woman's problem. Briefly summarize the problem. Then state which solution you prefer and why. </p></section><section><h5>Important Points</h5><p>The student's problem is that she must take a course to graduate, but the course is not being offered next term, and she is supposed to graduate at the end of next term. If you agree with the first solution, you would say that you think she should take the course at another university. You could support your choice by saying, for example, that although she would have to commute back and forth, the course would be easier than a graduate course, and it might be a good experience for her to meet students from another university. If you choose the second solution, you would say that you think she should take the graduate version of the course at her university. You could support your choice by saying, for example, that this way she would not have to waste time commuting, and even if the graduate-level course is more difficult, she would probably learn more, and it would look impressive in her academic record. </p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>In the listening passage, the woman has a problem. She still needs to take an American literature course. Next term is her last term, so she can not put if off any longer. The professor offers her two solutions. One is to take the course at another university. The second option is to take graduate courses. As far as I'm concerned, I would choose the second solution. Although graduate course in American literature seems to be pretty intense, it will be good for her studies in the long run. It is difficult, but it is not beyond her abilities if she works hard enough. If she chooses to take the course at another university, she will have to commute back and forth a couple of hours. It's so time-consuming.</p></article></div><div><p><b>Play Audio Track 70 to hear a high-level response for Question 5.</b></p><p><audio src="test_2_070.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></p><p><b>Rater’s Comments</b></p><p>The speaker fulfills the task by summarizing the problem and explaining her preferred solution. She refers to relevant points from the conversation with a coherent progression of ideas. She has chosen to describe both solutions, which the question does not require, but since she is a fluent speaker, she is able to do this as well as support her recommendation within the time limit. Her pronunciation is clear, and although her pace varies at times, it does not require listener effort to follow what she is saying.</p><p><b>Play Audio Track 71 to hear a mid-level response for Question 5.</b></p><p><audio src="test_2_071.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></p><p><b>Rater’s Comments</b></p><p>The speaker does not demonstrate a high level of fluency. She pauses after every two or three words, which requires the listener to make some effort to follow her ideas. She does explain the problem and gives her preferred solution, although she does not really support her preference for the second solution. Her lack of fluency prevents her from giving a full answer in the time allotted. </p></div></main></body></html>
