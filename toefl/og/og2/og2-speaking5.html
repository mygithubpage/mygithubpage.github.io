        <h3>Listening Text</h3>
        <article>Now listen to part of a conversation between a student and her advisor.
Advisor: OK, Becky, so ...you've chosen all your courses for next term?
Student: Well, not really, professor. Actually, I've got a problem.
Advisor: Oh?
Student: Yeah, well, I still need to take an American literature course; it's required for graduation. But I've been putting it off. But since my next term is my last...
Advisor: Yeah, you can't put it off any longer!
Student: Right. The thing is, though ... it's not offered next term.
Advisor: I see. Hmm. Ah, how about... ah, taking the course at another university?
Student: I thought about that. It's offered at City College, but ... that's so far away. Commuting back and forth would take me a couple of hours, you know, a big chunk of time with all my other studies and everything.
Advisor: True, but it's been done. Or... ah, there are a couple of graduate courses in American literature. Why not take one of those?
Student: Yeah, but... wouldn't that be hard, though? I mean ... it's a graduate course; that'd be pretty intense.
Advisor: Yeah, it'd probably mean more studying than you're used to, but I'm sure it's not beyond your abilities.</article>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
In the listening passage, the woman has a problem. She still needs to take an American literature course. Next term is her last term, so she can not put if off any longer. The professor offers her two solutions. One is to take the course at another university. The second option is to take graduate courses. As far as I'm concerned, I would choose the second solution. Although graduate course in American literature seems to be pretty intense, it will be good for her studies in the long run. It is difficult, but it is not beyond her abilities if she works hard enough. If she chooses to take the course at another university, she will have to commute back and forth a couple of hours. It's so time-consuming.</article>
