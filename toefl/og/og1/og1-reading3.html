            <b>Geology and Landscape</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>Most people <span class="underline">consider</span> the <span class="underline">landscape</span> to be unchanging, but Earth is a <span class="underline">dynamic</span> body, and its surface is continually altering-slowly on the human time <span class="underline">scale</span>, but <span class="underline">relatively</span> rapidly when compared to the great age of Earth (about 4,500 billion years). There are two <span class="underline">principal</span> influences that <span class="underline">shape</span> the terrain: <span class="underline">constructive</span> processes such as uplift, which create new <span class="underline">landscape</span> features, and <span class="underline">destructive</span> forces such as <span class="underline">erosion</span>, which <span class="underline">gradually</span> <span class="underline">wear</span> away <span class="underline">exposed</span> landforms.</p>
          <p>Hills and mountains are often regarded as the epitome of <span class="underline">permanence</span>, successfully resisting the <span class="underline">destructive</span> forces of nature, but in fact they <span class="underline">tend</span> to be <span class="underline">relatively</span> short-lived in geological terms. As a general rule, the higher a mountain is, the more recently it was formed; for example, the high mountains of the Himalayas are only about 50 million years old. <span class="underline">Lower</span> mountains <span class="underline">tend</span> to be older, and are often the eroded relics of much higher mountain chains. About 400 million years ago, when the present-day continents of North America and Europe were joined, the Caledonian mountain <span class="underline">chain</span> was the same size as the modern Himalayas. Today, however, the relics of the Caledonian orogeny (mountain-building period) exist as the <span class="underline">comparatively</span> low mountains of Greenland, the northern Appalachians in the United States, the Scottish Highlands, and the Norwegian coastal <span class="underline">plateau</span>.</p>
          <p>The Earth's <span class="underline">crust</span> is thought to be divided into huge, movable segments, called plates, which <span class="underline">float</span> on a <span class="underline">soft</span> <span class="underline">plastic</span> <span class="underline">layer</span> of rock. Some mountains were formed as a result of these plates crashing into each other and forcing up the rock at the <span class="underline">plate</span> margins. In this <span class="underline">process</span>, <span class="underline">sedimentary</span> rocks that originally formed on the seabed may be folded upwards to altitudes of more than 26,000 feet. Other mountains may be raised by earthquakes, which <span class="underline">fracture</span> the Earth's <span class="underline">crust</span> and can <span class="underline">displace</span> enough rock to produce <span class="underline">block</span> mountains. A third type of mountain may be formed as a result of <span class="underline">volcanic</span> <span class="underline">activity</span> which occurs in regions of active <span class="underline">fold</span> mountain belts, such as in the <span class="underline">Cascade</span> <span class="underline">Range</span> of western North America. The Cascades are made up of lavas and <span class="underline">volcanic</span> materials. Many of the peaks are <span class="underline">extinct</span> volcanoes.</p>
          <p>Whatever the <span class="underline">reason</span> for mountain <span class="underline">formation</span>, as soon as land rises above sea <span class="underline">level</span> it is subjected to <span class="underline">destructive</span> forces. The <span class="underline">exposed</span> rocks are attacked by the various weather processes and <span class="underline">gradually</span> broken down into fragments, which are then carried away and later deposited as sediments. Thus, any <span class="underline">landscape</span> represents only a <span class="underline">temporary</span> <span class="underline">stage</span> in the <span class="underline">continuous</span> battle between the forces of uplift and those of <span class="underline">erosion</span>.</p>
          <p>The weather, in its many forms, is the main agent of <span class="underline">erosion</span>. Rain washes away <span class="underline">loose</span> soil and penetrates cracks in the rocks. Carbon <span class="underline">dioxide</span> in the <span class="underline">air</span> reacts with the rainwater, forming a weak <span class="underline">acid</span> (<span class="underline">carbonic</span> <span class="underline">acid</span>) that may chemically attack the rocks. The rain seeps <span class="underline">underground</span> and the water may reappear later as springs. These springs are the sources of streams and rivers, which cut <span class="underline">through</span> the rocks and carry away <span class="underline">debris</span> from the mountains to the lowlands.</p>
          <p>Under very cold conditions, rocks can be shattered by ice and <span class="underline">frost</span>. Glaciers may form in permanently cold areas, and these slowly moving masses of ice cut out valleys, carrying with them huge quantities of eroded rock <span class="underline">debris</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>In dry areas the wind is the <span class="underline">principal</span> agent of <span class="underline">erosion</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> It carries fine particles of sand, which bombard <span class="underline">exposed</span> rock surfaces, <span class="underline">thereby</span> wearing them into yet more sand. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span> <span class="underline">Even</span> living things <span class="underline">contribute</span> to the <span class="underline">formation</span> of landscapes. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span> Tree roots force their way into cracks in rocks and, in so doing, speed their splitting. In <span class="underline">contrast</span>, the roots of grasses and other small plants may help to hold <span class="underline">loose</span> soil fragments together, <span class="underline">thereby</span> helping to prevent <span class="underline">erosion</span> by the wind.</p>
