      <h4 class="w3-center">Geology and Landscape</h4>
      <p>Most people <span class="highlight">consider</span> the <span class="highlight">landscape</span> to be unchanging, but Earth is a <span class="highlight">dynamic</span> body, and its surface is continually altering-slowly on the human time <span class="highlight">scale</span>, but <span class="highlight"><span class="question2">relatively</span></span> rapidly when compared to the great age of Earth (about 4,500 billion years). There are two <span class="highlight">principal</span> influences that <span class="highlight">shape</span> the terrain: <span class="highlight">constructive</span> processes such as uplift, which create new <span class="highlight">landscape</span> features, and <span class="highlight">destructive</span> forces such as <span class="highlight">erosion</span>, which <span class="highlight">gradually</span><span class="highlight">wear</span> away <span class="highlight">exposed</span> landforms.</p>
      <p><span class="question3">Hills and mountains are often regarded as the epitome of <span class="highlight">permanence</span>, successfully resisting the <span class="highlight">destructive</span> forces of nature, but in fact they <span class="highlight">tend</span> to be <span class="highlight">relatively</span> short-lived in geological terms.</span> As a general rule, the higher a mountain is, the more recently it was formed; for example, the high mountains of the Himalayas are only about 50 million years old. <span class="highlight">Lower</span> mountains <span class="highlight">tend</span> to be older, and are often the eroded <span class="question5">relics</span> of much higher mountain chains. About 400 million years ago, when the present-day continents of North America and Europe were joined, the Caledonian mountain <span class="highlight">chain</span> was the same size as the modern Himalayas. Today, however, the relics of the Caledonian orogeny (mountain-building period) exist as the <span class="highlight">comparatively</span> low mountains of Greenland, the northern Appalachians in the United States, the Scottish Highlands, and the Norwegian coastal <span class="highlight">plateau</span>.</p>
      <p>The Earth's <span class="highlight">crust</span> is thought to be divided into huge, movable segments, called plates, which <span class="highlight">float</span> on a <span class="highlight">soft</span><span class="highlight">plastic</span><span class="highlight">layer</span> of rock. Some mountains were formed as a result of these plates crashing into each other and forcing up the rock at the <span class="highlight">plate</span> margins. In this <span class="highlight">process</span>, <span class="highlight">sedimentary</span> rocks that originally formed on the seabed may be folded upwards to altitudes of more than 26,000 feet. Other mountains may be raised by earthquakes, which <span class="highlight">fracture</span> the Earth's <span class="highlight">crust</span> and can <span class="highlight">displace</span> enough rock to produce <span class="highlight">block</span> mountains. A third type of mountain may be formed as a result of <span class="highlight">volcanic</span><span class="highlight">activity</span> which occurs in regions of active <span class="highlight">fold</span> mountain belts, such as in the <span class="highlight">Cascade</span><span class="highlight">Range</span> of western North America. The Cascades are made up of lavas and <span class="highlight">volcanic</span> materials. Many of the peaks are <span class="highlight">extinct</span> volcanoes.</p>
      <p>Whatever the <span class="highlight">reason</span> for mountain <span class="highlight">formation</span>, as soon as land rises above sea <span class="highlight">level</span> it is subjected to <span class="highlight">destructive</span> forces. The <span class="highlight">exposed</span> rocks are attacked by the various weather processes and <span class="highlight">gradually</span> broken down into fragments, which are then carried away and later deposited as sediments. Thus, any <span class="highlight">landscape</span> represents only a <span class="highlight">temporary</span><span class="highlight">stage</span> in the <span class="highlight">continuous</span> battle between the forces of uplift and those of <span class="highlight">erosion</span>.</p>
      <p>The weather, in its many forms, is the main agent of <span class="highlight">erosion</span>. Rain washes away <span class="highlight">loose</span> soil and penetrates cracks in the rocks. Carbon <span class="highlight">dioxide</span> in the <span class="highlight">air</span> reacts with the rainwater, forming a weak <span class="highlight">acid</span> (<span class="highlight">carbonic</span><span class="highlight">acid</span>) that may chemically attack the rocks. The rain <span class="question8">seeps</span><span class="highlight">underground</span> and the water may reappear later as springs. These springs are the sources of streams and rivers, which cut <span class="highlight">through</span> the rocks and carry away <span class="highlight">debris</span> from the mountains to the lowlands.</p>
      <p>Under very cold conditions, rocks can be shattered by ice and <span class="highlight">frost</span>. Glaciers may form in permanently cold areas, and these slowly moving masses of ice cut out valleys, carrying with <span class="question9">them</span> huge quantities of eroded rock <span class="highlight">debris</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>In dry areas the wind is the <span class="highlight">principal</span> agent of <span class="highlight">erosion</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> It carries fine particles of sand, which bombard <span class="highlight">exposed</span> rock surfaces, <span class="highlight">thereby</span> wearing them into yet more sand. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span><span class="highlight">Even</span> living things <span class="highlight">contribute</span> to the <span class="highlight">formation</span> of landscapes. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span> Tree roots force their way into cracks in rocks and, in so doing, speed their splitting. In <span class="highlight">contrast</span>, the roots of grasses and other small plants may help to hold <span class="highlight">loose</span> soil fragments together, <span class="highlight">thereby</span> helping to prevent <span class="highlight">erosion</span> by the wind.</p>

          <p>According to the article, the higher the mountain range the younger, so A is wrong. The Himalayas is only 50million years old, so Option C is wrong; now the Himalayas are as high as the Caledonian Mountains before 400million years ago, so Option D is wrong. Option B is correct.

          <p>According to the first paragraph of the text, it was learned that the constructive process was to create new terrain, such as the terrain becoming higher. According to the third paragraph of the text, it can be concluded that there are three types of mountain ranges, which correspond exactly to options 1, 5, and 6. Similarly, according to the first paragraph, the destructive process refers mainly to the erosion. According to the fifth paragraph of the text, erosion is mainly an option. 3 and 7.</p>
