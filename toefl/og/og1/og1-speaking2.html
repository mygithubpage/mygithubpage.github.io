Others choose to focus on a single subject area in order to have a deeper understanding of that area. Which approach to course selection do you think is better for students and why? </p></section><section><h5>Important Points</h5><p>You may choose both options, but you must support both of them with reasons that are detailed. If you think taking a variety of courses is better, make sure you explain in detail what your reasons are for having that opinion. Here is an example: “Taking a variety of courses is better because it gives you an opportunity to learn about subjects outside of your field of study. Because so many fields of study are related, you never know when knowledge from one area will be helpful in another.” This kind of response clearly shows which option was chosen and includes a detailed reason why it was chosen.</p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>Well, I think taking a wide variety of courses is better for students. Firstly, undergraduate study is meant for broadness, so it's better for undergraduate students to broaden their horizon and prevent themselves from being  narrow-minded. Secondly, before students find their favorite fields, I mean, the subject they really want to dig into, they should probably extend their study field and taste different subjects as various as possible. Take myself as an example, my major is tourism administration in the college, but I read a lot of books and went to other lectures of other departments. Then I found out that I was more interested in language learning than in tourism administration. So I spent lots of time to learn language. But if I didn't choose to take other courses, I wouldn't find my interest, and I would waste my lifetime on the field I dislike. </p></article><article class="response"><h4>My Response</h4><p>Category: <b>Learn</b>, Expressions: </p><p>For this topic, I would like talk the caffe near my house, since it is a very important place to me. As soon as I step into the caffe for the first time, I instantly fall in love with the place. There are some quiet music playing in the caffe which is good to me. Because they sound very comfortable and restful. In addition. People don't chat very much and even they talk, their voice was very low. The caffe offers me with such a great environment where I can forget all my stress. So the caffe is best place to get a leisure time. </p></article></div><div><p><b>Play Audio Track 33 to hear a high-level response for Question 2.</b></p><p><audio src="test_1_033.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></p><p><b>Rater’s Comments</b></p><p>The speaker gives a thoughtful, sustained answer with ideas and reasons that progress logically. He speaks fluently and demonstrates good control of grammar and vocabulary, with only minor errors that do not obscure the meaning of his ideas. The speaker very clearly states his opinion that the answer depends on whether you are an undergraduate or graduate student. He continues by giving a detailed reason that supports each perspective.</p><p><b>Play Audio Track 34 to hear a low-level response for Question 2.</b></p><p><audio src="test_1_034.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></p><p><b>Rater’s Comments</b></p><p>Although the speaker’s pronunciation is clear, his pace is <b>slow and irregular</b>. The clearest parts of his speech are words that he has taken from the prompt of the question. He demonstrates very <b>limited vocabulary</b>. His thoughts are understandable at the sentence level, but there are very <b>few connections between sentences</b>. Such connections would help listeners to understand what is being said or enable them to predict what will likely come next. The opinion is stated in the beginning. However, he frequently uses words from the prompt and <b>repeats the same idea</b> throughout the response.</p></div></main></body></html>
