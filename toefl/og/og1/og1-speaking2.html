Others choose to focus on a single subject area in order to have a deeper understanding of that area. Which approach to course selection do you think is better for students and why? </p></section><section id="sample-response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><article><p>Well, I think taking a wide variety of courses is better for students. Firstly, undergraduate study is meant for broadness, so it's better for undergraduate students to broaden their horizon and prevent themselves from being  narrow-minded. Secondly, before students find their favorite fields, I mean, the subject they really want to dig into, they should probably extend their study field and taste different subjects as various as possible. Take myself as an example, my major is tourism administration in the college, but I read a lot of books and went to other lectures of other departments. Then I found out that I was more interested in language learning than in tourism administration. So I spent lots of time to learn language. But if I didn'tchoose to take other courses, I wouldn't find my interest, and I would waste my lifetime on the field I dislike. </p></article></section></main></body></html>
