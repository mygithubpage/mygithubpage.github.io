Professor Jensen. </p><p>Man: Listen, I know it's a short notice...and maybe you've already made plans for spring break... but...one of my students just dropped out of the field trip to the Smithson River Caves. You're next on the waiting list, so now there's room for you to come along. </p><p>Woman:You're kidding! I didn't think there was a chance... and... Well it's a three-day trip, right? I agreed to spend next week helping Professor Clark set up the new museum exhibition. I think she's really counting on me. </p><p>Man:Yeah, three days. But you know... if you'd rather come on the field trip, why not speak with her and see if she has anyone to replace you? </p><p>Woman:Yeah, I'd hate to miss out on the caves. I'll definitely ask Professor Clark if there's someone else who could help her. </p><p>Man You know... we don't leave until Wednesday. If you still have to help out, any chance you could get the museum set up done before then? </p><p>Woman:Oh yeah... not until Wednesday... so then yeah... maybe that's possible too. </p></article><section id="question"><h4>Question</h4><p>The speakers discuss two possible solutions to the woman's problem. Describe the problem and the two solutions. Then explain what the woman should do and why. </p></section><section><h5>Important Points</h5><p>The problem the student faces is a conflict between an earlier commitment to help with a museum exhibition setup and a more recent opportunity to go on a field trip led by one of her professors. She could talk to Dr. Clark about finding a replacement to help with setting up the museum exhibition. As an alternative, since the field trip doesn’t start until later in the week, the student could try to finish setting up the exhibit before the field trip. You could say that you think the student should stay to set up the museum exhibit because she should honor the commitment she made to Dr. Clark.</p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>The response is generally understandable. The speaker sustains speech throughout the response time. However, the sense of hesitation in the way the response is delivered requires some listener effort. The choppy delivery sometimes makes it difficult to know when one sentence or idea ends and when others begin. The speaker makes a number of errors with simple grammatical structures (very like to, let her to take, make somebody to replace her). Overall meaning, though, is not greatly affected by these errors. The speaker identifies the problem and describes the two solutions. A higher-level vocabulary would have been helpful to more effi- ciently summarize the situation. The problems and two solutions are summarized with too much detail, which prevents the speaker from having time to state her preferred solution and give a reason for it.</p></article><article class="response"><h4>My Response</h4><p>Category: <b>Sociology</b>, Expressions: </p><p>The principle of audience effects is that individuals' performance is affected by the knowledge that others are watching them. The professor use two example illustrate the term audience effect. In first example, two groups of students are asked to type their shoes, one group know they were being observed. other group don't. the group <b>are aware of</b> being watched type their shoes faster than other group. In the second example, when we learn to type, we will increase our speed if we are not alone. however, we also make more mistakes. that's say, we type faster when we are conscious of being observed and make more mistakes.</p></article></div><div><p><b>Play Audio Track 39 to hear a high-level response for Question 5.</b></p><p><audio src="test_1_039.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></p><p><b>Rater’s Comments</b></p><p>There are minor pronunciation and intonation errors, but they do not prevent the speaker’s response from being understood. She uses connecting words to mark the progression of ideas. Her control of grammar and vocabulary is evident in the way she efficiently summarizes the situation from the listening. The speaker clearly identifies the problem and both solutions. She organizes her response, so it is easy to follow her ideas from one to the next. She indicates her opinion of what the student should do. Although she runs out of time before she can explain why she holds that opinion, it is clear that she understands the task.</p><p><b>Play Audio Track 40 to hear a mid-level response for Question 5.</b></p><p><audio src="test_1_040.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></p><p><b>Rater’s Comments</b></p><p>The speaker sustains his response throughout. His pronunciation and intonation is affected by his first language. These pronunciation errors make it hard to know what he means. The speaker identifies the concept and the two examples, but with inaccuracies. Instead of summarizing each experiment, he combines the summary of both experiments. This causes him to incorrectly conclude that you make more mistakes when you are being watched while tying your shoes. Additionally, the speaker sometimes stumbles when trying to form basic words (slowlier), which shows a moderate control of grammar and vocabulary.</p></div></main></body></html>
