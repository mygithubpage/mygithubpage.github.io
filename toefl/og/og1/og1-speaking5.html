Professor Jensen. </p><p>Man: Listen, I know it's a short notice...and maybe you've already made plans for spring break... but...one of my students just dropped out of the field trip to the Smithson River Caves. You're next on the waiting list, so now there's room for you to come along. </p><p>Woman:You're kidding! I didn't think there was a chance... and... Well it's a three-day trip, right? I agreed to spend next week helping Professor Clark set up the new museum exhibition. I think she's really counting on me. </p><p>Man:Yeah, three days. But you know... if you'd rather come on the field trip, why not speak with her and see if she has anyone to replace you? </p><p>Woman:Yeah, I'd hate to miss out on the caves. I'll definitely ask Professor Clark if there's someone else who could help her. </p><p>Man You know... we don't leave until Wednesday. If you still have to help out, any chance you could get the museum set up done before then? </p><p>Woman:Oh yeah... not until Wednesday... so then yeah... maybe that's possible too. </p></article></section><section id="question"><h4>Question</h4><p>The speakers discuss two possible solutions to the woman's problem. Describe the problem and the two solutions. Then explain what the woman should do and why. </p></section><section id="sample-response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><article><p>The problem of the woman is that the professor asks her to attend a field trip, but she has already promised another professor to help set up a museum exhibition next week.The professor offers two possible solutions. The first is that she can talk to the other professor to see if there is someone else who can replace the woman to help set up the museum exhibition. The second is to set up the museum before they set out the field trip. Actually, I think the woman should choose the second solution, because she has already agreed to help the other professor and the other professor is counting on her. It's possible that there is no one else who can take her place. So she'd better finish the task first before she goes to the field trip.</p></article></section></main></body></html>
