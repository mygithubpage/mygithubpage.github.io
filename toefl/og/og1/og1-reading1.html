      <h4 class="w3-center">Nineteen-century Politics in the United States</h4>
      <p>The <span class="highlight">development</span> of the modern <span class="highlight">presidency</span> in the United States began with Andrew Jackson who swept to power in 1829 at the head of the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Party and served until 1837. During his <span class="highlight">administration</span>, he <span class="highlight question1">immeasurably</span> enlarged the power of the <span class="highlight">presidency</span>. "The <span class="highlight">President</span> is the direct <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the American people," he lectured the <span class="highlight">Senate</span> when it <span class="highlight">opposed</span> him. "He was elected by the people, and is <span class="highlight">responsible</span> to them." With this <span class="highlight">declaration</span>, Jackson redefined the <span class="highlight">character</span> of the <span class="highlight">presidential</span> office and its relationship to the people.</p>
      <p>During Jackson's <span class="highlight">second</span><span class="highlight">term</span>, his opponents had <span class="highlight">gradually</span> come together to form the Whig party. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>Whigs and Democrats held different attitudes toward the changes brought about by the <span class="highlight">market</span>, banks, and <span class="highlight">commerce</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>The Democrats tended to view society as a continuing <span class="highlight">conflict</span> between "the people"-farmers, planters, and workers-and a set of <span class="highlight">greedy</span> aristocrats. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>This "paper money aristocracy" of bankers and investors manipulated the banking system for their own profit, Democrats claimed, and sapped the nation's <span class="highlight">virtue</span> by encouraging speculation and the <span class="highlight">desire</span> for sudden, unearned wealth. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>The Democrats <span class="highlight">wanted</span> the rewards of the <span class="highlight">market</span> without sacrificing the features of a simple <span class="highlight">agrarian</span><span class="highlight">republic</span>. They <span class="highlight">wanted</span> the wealth that the <span class="highlight">market</span> offered without the <span class="highlight">competitive</span>, changing society; the <span class="highlight">complex</span> dealing; the dominance of <span class="highlight">urban</span> centers; and the loss of independence that came with it.</p>
      <p>Whigs, on the other hand, were more comfortable with the <span class="highlight">market</span>. For them, <span class="highlight">commerce</span> and <span class="highlight">economic</span><span class="highlight">development</span> were agents of <span class="highlight">civilization</span>. Nor did the Whigs <span class="highlight">envision</span> any <span class="highlight">conflict</span> in society between farmers and workers on the one hand and businesspeople and bankers on the other. <span class="highlight">Economic</span> growth would <span class="highlight">benefit</span> everyone by raising national income and expanding <span class="highlight">opportunity</span>. The <span class="highlight">government</span>'s responsibility was to provide a well-regulated <span class="highlight">economy</span> that guaranteed <span class="highlight">opportunity</span> for citizens of <span class="highlight">ability</span>.</p>
      <p>Whigs and Democrats differed not only in their attitudes toward the <span class="highlight">market</span> but also about how active the central <span class="highlight">government</span> should be in people's lives. Despite Andrew Jackson's <span class="highlight"><span class="question6">inclination</span></span> to be a strong <span class="highlight">President</span>, Democrats as a rule believed in limited <span class="highlight">government</span>. <span class="highlight">Government</span>'s role in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> was to <span class="highlight">promote</span> competition by destroying monopolies' and <span class="highlight">special</span> privileges. In keeping with this <span class="highlight">philosophy</span> of limited <span class="highlight">government</span>, Democrats also rejected the idea that <span class="highlight">moral</span> beliefs were the <span class="highlight">proper</span><span class="highlight">sphere</span> of <span class="highlight">government</span><span class="highlight">action</span>. <span class="highlight">Religion</span> and <span class="highlight">politics</span>, they believed, should be kept clearly <span class="highlight">separate</span>, and they generally <span class="highlight">opposed</span><span class="highlight">humanitarian</span><span class="highlight">legislation</span>.</p>
      <p>The Whigs, in <span class="highlight">contrast</span>, viewed <span class="highlight">government</span> power positively. They believed that it should be used to protect <span class="highlight">individual</span> rights and public <span class="highlight">liberty</span>, and that it had a <span class="highlight">special</span> role where <span class="highlight">individual</span> effort was ineffective. By regulating the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and competition, the <span class="highlight">government</span> could ensure <span class="highlight">equal</span><span class="highlight">opportunity</span>. Indeed, for Whigs the <span class="highlight"><span class="question8">concept</span></span> of <span class="highlight">government</span> promoting the general <span class="highlight">welfare</span> went beyond the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. In <span class="highlight">particular</span>, Whigs in the northern sections of the United States also believed that <span class="highlight">government</span> power should be used to <span class="highlight">foster</span> the <span class="highlight">moral</span><span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the country. They were much more likely to <span class="highlight">favor</span> social-reform <span class="highlight">legislation</span> and aid to education.</p>
      <p>In some ways the social makeup of the two parties was <span class="highlight">similar</span>. To be <span class="highlight">competitive</span> in winning votes, Whigs and Democrats both had to have <span class="highlight">significant</span> support among farmers, the largest group in society, and workers. Neither party could win an election by <span class="highlight">appealing</span><span class="highlight">exclusively</span> to the rich or the poor. The Whigs, however, enjoyed <span class="highlight">disproportionate</span> strength among the business and <span class="highlight">commercial</span> classes. Whigs appealed to planters who needed <span class="highlight">credit</span> to <span class="highlight">finance</span> their cotton and rice <span class="highlight">trade</span> in the world <span class="highlight">market</span>, to farmers who were <span class="highlight">eager</span> to sell their surpluses, and to workers who wished to <span class="highlight">improve</span> themselves. Democrats attracted farmers <span class="highlight">isolated</span> from the <span class="highlight">market</span> or uncomfortable with it, workers alienated from the emerging <span class="highlight">industrial</span> system, and rising entrepreneurs who <span class="highlight">wanted</span> to <span class="highlight">break</span> monopolies and open the <span class="highlight">economy</span> to newcomers like themselves. <span class="question11">The Whigs were strongest in the towns, cities, and those <span class="highlight">rural</span> areas that were fully integrated into the <span class="highlight">market</span><span class="highlight">economy</span>, whereas Democrats dominated areas of semisubsistence farming that were more <span class="highlight">isolated</span> and languishing <span class="highlight">economically</span>.</span></p>

The options that are consistent with the text are C and C. Option A is wrong and does not match the third sentence of the text. Option B is wrong. The Whig party actually likes the changes brought about by the market. Option D is wrong. Whig people actually emphasize economic development.</p>

        <div class="explanation" data-answer="D">
          <p>The text sentence first describes the areas where the Whig people predominate, and then describes the areas where Democrats predominate. Option A is wrong, because the text sentence does not mention "only in the wealthiest areas," but refers to the areas that are integrated into the market. This area is not necessarily the richest. Option B is wrong. Their supporting areas are not divided according to rural areas and towns, but are divided according to market integration. Option C was wrong because the text sentence did not mention that the Whig-controlled market economy affected the area controlled by the Democrats. Option D is correct. Option D simply changes the order of the description, first describing the Democrats, then the Whigs, with no change in meaning.</p>

          <p>The correct options are A, E, and F. The statement of Option A is used throughout the article and is proven in paragraphs 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Option B is wrong. Jackson is the leader of the Democratic Party and not the leader of the Whig Party. Option C is wrong, not the Democratic Party, but the Whig Party represents the interests of the market, banking and business. Option D is wrong, because the original text mentions that the Whigs in the north support the governmentï¿½s help with education and do not mention the ideas of other Whigs and Democrats. Option E is correct, and paragraphs 2, 3, 4 and 6 of the article all refer to their different views on the market economy and society. Option F is correct. This is another important difference between the two parties. Paragraphs 2, 3, 4 and 5 are clearly mentioned.</p>
