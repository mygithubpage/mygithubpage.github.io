            <b>Nineteen-century Politics in the United States</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>The <span class="underline">development</span> of the modern <span class="underline">presidency</span> in the United States began with Andrew Jackson who swept to power in 1829 at the head of the <span class="underline">Democratic</span> Party and served until 1837. During his <span class="underline">administration</span>, he <span class="light"><span class="underline">immeasurably</span></span> enlarged the power of the <span class="underline">presidency</span>. "The <span class="underline">President</span> is the direct <span class="underline">representative</span> of the American people," he lectured the <span class="underline">Senate</span> when it <span class="underline">opposed</span> him. "He was elected by the people, and is <span class="underline">responsible</span> to them." With this <span class="underline">declaration</span>, Jackson redefined the <span class="underline">character</span> of the <span class="underline">presidential</span> office and its relationship to the people.</p>
          <p>During Jackson's <span class="underline">second</span><span class="underline">term</span>, his opponents had <span class="underline">gradually</span> come together to form the Whig party. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>Whigs and Democrats held different attitudes toward the changes brought about by the <span class="underline">market</span>, banks, and <span class="underline">commerce</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>The Democrats tended to view society as a continuing <span class="underline">conflict</span> between "the people"-farmers, planters, and workers-and a set of <span class="underline">greedy</span> aristocrats. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>This "paper money aristocracy" of bankers and investors manipulated the banking system for their own profit, Democrats claimed, and sapped the nation's <span class="underline">virtue</span> by encouraging speculation and the <span class="underline">desire</span> for sudden, unearned wealth. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>The Democrats <span class="underline">wanted</span> the rewards of the <span class="underline">market</span> without sacrificing the features of a simple <span class="underline">agrarian</span><span class="underline">republic</span>. They <span class="underline">wanted</span> the wealth that the <span class="underline">market</span> offered without the <span class="underline">competitive</span>, changing society; the <span class="underline">complex</span> dealing; the dominance of <span class="underline">urban</span> centers; and the loss of independence that came with it.</p>
          <p>Whigs, on the other hand, were more comfortable with the <span class="underline">market</span>. For them, <span class="underline">commerce</span> and <span class="underline">economic</span><span class="underline">development</span> were agents of <span class="underline">civilization</span>. Nor did the Whigs <span class="underline">envision</span> any <span class="underline">conflict</span> in society between farmers and workers on the one hand and businesspeople and bankers on the other. <span class="underline">Economic</span> growth would <span class="underline">benefit</span> everyone by raising national income and expanding <span class="underline">opportunity</span>. The <span class="underline">government</span>'s responsibility was to provide a well-regulated <span class="underline">economy</span> that guaranteed <span class="underline">opportunity</span> for citizens of <span class="underline">ability</span>.</p>
          <p>Whigs and Democrats differed not only in their attitudes toward the <span class="underline">market</span> but also about how active the central <span class="underline">government</span> should be in people's lives. Despite Andrew Jackson's <span class="underline">inclination</span> to be a strong <span class="underline">President</span>, Democrats as a rule believed in limited <span class="underline">government</span>. <span class="underline">Government</span>'s role in the <span class="underline">economy</span> was to <span class="underline">promote</span> competition by destroying monopolies' and <span class="underline">special</span> privileges. In keeping with this <span class="underline">philosophy</span> of limited <span class="underline">government</span>, Democrats also rejected the idea that <span class="underline">moral</span> beliefs were the <span class="underline">proper</span><span class="underline">sphere</span> of <span class="underline">government</span><span class="underline">action</span>. <span class="underline">Religion</span> and <span class="underline">politics</span>, they believed, should be kept clearly <span class="underline">separate</span>, and they generally <span class="underline">opposed</span><span class="underline">humanitarian</span><span class="underline">legislation</span>.</p>
          <p>The Whigs, in <span class="underline">contrast</span>, viewed <span class="underline">government</span> power positively. They believed that it should be used to protect <span class="underline">individual</span> rights and public <span class="underline">liberty</span>, and that it had a <span class="underline">special</span> role where <span class="underline">individual</span> effort was ineffective. By regulating the <span class="underline">economy</span> and competition, the <span class="underline">government</span> could ensure <span class="underline">equal</span><span class="underline">opportunity</span>. Indeed, for Whigs the <span class="underline">concept</span> of <span class="underline">government</span> promoting the general <span class="underline">welfare</span> went beyond the <span class="underline">economy</span>. In <span class="underline">particular</span>, Whigs in the northern sections of the United States also believed that <span class="underline">government</span> power should be used to <span class="underline">foster</span> the <span class="underline">moral</span><span class="underline">welfare</span> of the country. They were much more likely to <span class="underline">favor</span> social-reform <span class="underline">legislation</span> and aid to education.</p>
          <p>In some ways the social makeup of the two parties was <span class="underline">similar</span>. To be <span class="underline">competitive</span> in winning votes, Whigs and Democrats both had to have <span class="underline">significant</span> support among farmers, the largest group in society, and workers. Neither party could win an election by <span class="underline">appealing</span><span class="underline">exclusively</span> to the rich or the poor. The Whigs, however, enjoyed <span class="underline">disproportionate</span> strength among the business and <span class="underline">commercial</span> classes. Whigs appealed to planters who needed <span class="underline">credit</span> to <span class="underline">finance</span> their cotton and rice <span class="underline">trade</span> in the world <span class="underline">market</span>, to farmers who were <span class="underline">eager</span> to sell their surpluses, and to workers who wished to <span class="underline">improve</span> themselves. Democrats attracted farmers <span class="underline">isolated</span> from the <span class="underline">market</span> or uncomfortable with it, workers alienated from the emerging <span class="underline">industrial</span> system, and rising entrepreneurs who <span class="underline">wanted</span> to <span class="underline">break</span> monopolies and open the <span class="underline">economy</span> to newcomers like themselves. The Whigs were strongest in the towns, cities, and those <span class="underline">rural</span> areas that were fully integrated into the <span class="underline">market</span><span class="underline">economy</span>, whereas Democrats dominated areas of semisubsistence farming that were more <span class="underline">isolated</span> and languishing <span class="underline">economically</span>.</p>
