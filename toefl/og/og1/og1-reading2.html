          <h4 class="w3-center">The Expression of Emotions</h4>
          <p>Joy and sadness are experienced by people in all cultures around the world, but how can we tell when other people are happy or <span class="highlight question1">despondent</span> It turns out that the expression of many emotions may be universal. Smiling is apparently a universal sign of friendliness and <span class="highlight">approval</span>. <span class="question2">Baring the teeth in a <span class="highlight">hostile</span> way</span>, as <span class="highlight">noted</span> by Charles Darwin in the nineteenth <span class="highlight">century</span>, may be a universal sign of anger. As the originator of the <span class="highlight">theory</span> of <span class="highlight">evolution</span>, Darwin believed that the universal <span class="highlight">recognition</span> of <span class="highlight">facial</span> expressions would have <span class="highlight">survival</span> value. For example, <span class="highlight">facial</span> expressions could <span class="highlight">signal</span> the <span class="highlight">approach</span> of enemies (or friends) in the <span class="highlight">absence</span> of language.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A">
            </span>Most investigators <span class="highlight"><span class="question3">concur</span></span> that certain <span class="highlight">facial</span> expressions suggest the same emotions in all people. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>Moreover, people in <span class="highlight">diverse</span> cultures <span class="highlight">recognize</span> the emotions manifested by the <span class="highlight">facial</span> expressions. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>In <span class="highlight">classic</span> research Paul Ekman took photographs of people exhibiting the emotions of anger, <span class="highlight">disgust</span>, fear, happiness, and sadness. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>He then asked people around the world to <span class="highlight">indicate</span> what emotions were being depicted in <span class="question4">them</span>. Those queried ranged from European college students to members of the Fore, a <span class="highlight">tribe</span> that dwells in the New <span class="highlight">Guinea</span> highlands. All groups, including the Fore, who had almost no <span class="highlight">contact</span> with Western <span class="highlight">culture</span>, agreed on the portrayed emotions. <span class="question6">The Fore also displayed <span class="highlight">familiar</span> <span class="highlight">facial</span> expressions when asked how they would <span class="highlight">respond</span> if they were the characters in stories that called for <span class="highlight">basic</span> <span class="highlight">emotional</span> responses.</span> Ekman and his colleagues more recently obtained <span class="highlight">similar</span> results in a study of ten cultures in which participants were permitted to <span class="highlight">report</span> that <span class="highlight">multiple</span> emotions were shown by <span class="highlight">facial</span> expressions. The participants generally agreed on which two emotions were being shown and which <span class="highlight">emotion</span> was more <span class="highlight">intense</span>.</p>
          <p>Psychological researchers generally <span class="highlight">recognize</span> that <span class="highlight">facial</span> expressions <span class="highlight">reflect</span> <span class="highlight">emotional</span> states. In fact, various <span class="highlight">emotional</span> states give rise to certain patterns of electrical <span class="highlight">activity</span> in the <span class="highlight">facial</span> muscles and in the brain. The facial-feedback <span class="highlight">hypothesis</span> argues, however, that the causal relationship between emotions and <span class="highlight">facial</span> expressions can also work in the <span class="highlight">opposite</span> direction. According to this <span class="highlight">hypothesis</span>, signals from the <span class="highlight">facial</span> muscles (""<span class="highlight">feedback</span>) are sent back to <span class="highlight">emotion</span> centers of the brain, and so a person's <span class="highlight">facial</span> expression can influence that person's <span class="highlight">emotional</span> <span class="highlight">state</span>. <span class="highlight">Consider</span> Darwin's words: ""The free expression by outward signs of an <span class="highlight">emotion</span> intensifies it. On the other hand, the repression, as far as possible, of all outward signs softens our emotions."" Can smiling give rise to feelings of good will, for example, and frowning to anger?</p>
          <p>Psychological research has <span class="highlight">given</span> rise to some interesting findings concerning the facial-feedback <span class="highlight">hypothesis</span>. Causing participants in experiments to smile, for example, leads them to <span class="highlight">report</span> more <span class="highlight">positive</span> feelings and to <span class="highlight"><span class="question9">rate</span></span> cartoons (<span class="highlight">humorous</span> drawings of people or situations) as being more <span class="highlight">humorous</span>. When they are caused to frown, they <span class="highlight">rate</span> cartoons as being more <span class="highlight">aggressive</span>.</p>
          <p>What are the possible links between <span class="highlight">facial</span> expressions and <span class="highlight">emotion</span>? One link is <span class="highlight">arousal</span>, which is the <span class="highlight">level</span> of <span class="highlight">activity</span> or preparedness for <span class="highlight">activity</span> in an <span class="highlight">organism</span>. <span class="highlight">Intense</span> contraction of <span class="highlight">facial</span> muscles, such as those used in signifying fear, heightens <span class="highlight">arousal</span>. Self-perception of heightened <span class="highlight">arousal</span> then leads to heightened <span class="highlight">emotional</span> <span class="highlight">activity</span>. Other links may <span class="highlight">involve</span> changes in brain <span class="highlight">temperature</span> and the <span class="highlight">release</span> of neurotransmitters (substances that <span class="highlight">transmit</span> nerve impulses). The contraction of <span class="highlight">facial</span> muscles both influences the <span class="highlight">internal</span> <span class="highlight">emotional</span> <span class="highlight">state</span> and reflects it. Ekman has found that the so-called Duchenne smile, which is characterized by ''<span class="highlight">crow</span>'s feet"" wrinkles around the eyes and a <span class="highlight">subtle</span> <span class="highlight">drop</span> in the eye cover <span class="highlight">fold</span> so that the skin above the eye moves down <span class="highlight">slightly</span> toward the eyeball, can <span class="highlight">lead</span> to pleasant feelings.</p>
          <p>Ekman's <span class="highlight">observation</span> may be <span class="highlight"><span class="question10">relevant</span></span> to the British expression "keep a <span class="highlight">stiff</span> upper lip" as a recommendation for handling <span class="highlight">stress</span>. It might be that a "<span class="highlight">stiff</span>" lip suppresses <span class="highlight">emotional</span> <span class="highlight">response</span> -- as long as the lip is not quivering with fear or <span class="highlight">tension</span>. But when the <span class="highlight">emotion</span> that leads to stiffening the lip is more <span class="highlight">intense</span>, and involves strong <span class="highlight">muscle</span> <span class="highlight">tension</span>, <span class="highlight">facial</span> <span class="highlight">feedback</span> may <span class="highlight">heighten</span> <span class="highlight">emotional</span> <span class="highlight">response</span>.</p>

              <p>According to the meaning of the text, stiffening the upper lip can suppress emotions, and it can also enhance emotional reactions. So A mistakes, not all emotional reactions have these two steps. Option B reverses the causal relationship, which is fear and tension leads to stiffening the upper lip, and not the other way around. Option C is not mentioned. Option D meets the text meaning, correct.</p>

              <p>The "This universality" inserted in the sentence necessarily refers to the content of the previous sentence.

              <p>Option A is a detail and is an example from paragraph 5. Option B is correct, questions about the 2 argument and detailed research experiments are throughout each paragraph of the article. The original option C was not mentioned. Option D, like option B, is correct, and paragraphs 3, 4, 5, and 6 of the article demonstrate how facial expressions reflect people's emotions. Option E is wrong, Ekman does not have this point of view, this view should be Darwin's. Option F is correct. This is the "facial-feedback hypothesis" mentioned in paragraphs 3, 4, 5, and 6.</p>
