      <p><span class="time" data-times="1.86" data-time="4.2">[00:04.20]</span>Professor: Hey, Ellen. How are you doing?</p>
      <p><span class="time" data-times="2.07" data-time="6.06">[00:06.06]</span>Student: Oh, <span class="highlight">pretty</span> good, thanks. How are you?</p>
      <p><span class="time" data-times="1.23" data-time="8.13">[00:08.13]</span>Professor: OK.</p>
      <p><span class="time" data-times="6.55" data-time="9.36">[00:09.36]</span>Student: Did you, um, have a <span class="highlight">chance</span> to look at my grad school <span class="highlight">application</span> ... you know, the <span class="highlight">statement</span> of purpose I wrote?</p>
      <p><span class="time" data-times="2.93" data-time="15.91">[00:15.91]</span>Professor: Well, yeah. In fact, here it is, I just read it.</p>
      <p><span class="time" data-times="2.39" data-time="18.84">[00:18.84]</span>Student: Oh, great! What did you think?</p>
      <p><span class="time" data-times="2.14" data-time="21.23">[00:21.23]</span>Professor: Basically, it's good. <span class="time" data-times="6.49" data-time="23.37">[00:23.37]</span>What you might actually do is take some of these different points here, and actually <span class="highlight">break</span> them out into <span class="highlight">separate</span> paragraphs. <span class="time" data-times="16.53" data-time="29.86">[00:29.86]</span>So, um, one: your purpose for applying for graduate study-uh, why do you want to go to graduate school- and an area of specialty; and, uh, why you want to do the area you're specifying; um, and what you want to do with your <span class="highlight">degree</span> once you get it.</p>
      <p><span class="time" data-times="0.7" data-time="46.39">[00:46.39]</span>Student: OK.</p>
      <p><span class="time" data-times="4.27" data-time="47.09">[00:47.09]</span>Professor: So those are ... they're <span class="highlight">pretty</span><span class="highlight">clear</span> on those four points they want.</p>
      <p><span class="time" data-times="0.5" data-time="51.36">[00:51.36]</span>Student: Right.</p>
      <p><span class="time" data-times="7.08" data-time="51.86">[00:51.86]</span>Professor: So you might just <span class="highlight">break</span> them out into, uh . . . you know, <span class="highlight">separate</span> paragraphs and <span class="highlight">expand</span> on each point some. <span class="time" data-times="5.2" data-time="58.94">[00:58.94]</span>But really what's <span class="highlight">critical</span> with these is that, um, you've gotta let yourself come <span class="highlight">through</span>.<span class="time" data-times="3.41" data-time="64.14">[01:04.14]</span>See, you gotta let them see you in these statements. <span class="time" data-times="8.37" data-time="67.55">[01:07.55]</span><span class="highlight">Expand</span> some more on what's happened in your own life and what shows your ...your <span class="highlight">motivation</span> and <span class="highlight">interest</span> in this area-in <span class="highlight">geology</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.41" data-time="75.92">[01:15.92]</span>Let' em see what really, what ...what captures your imagination about this <span class="highlight">field</span>.</p>
      <p><span class="time" data-times="3.91" data-time="81.33">[01:21.33]</span>Student: OK, so make it a little more ... <span class="highlight">personal</span>? That's OK?</p>
      <p><span class="time" data-times="1.08" data-time="85.24">[01:25.24]</span>Professor: That's fine. <span class="time" data-times="1.65" data-time="86.32">[01:26.32]</span>They look for that <span class="highlight">stuff</span>. <span class="time" data-times="1.54" data-time="87.97">[01:27.97]</span>You don't <span class="highlight">wanna</span> go overboard ...</p>
      <p><span class="time" data-times="0.72999999999999" data-time="89.51">[01:29.51]</span>Student: Right.</p>
      <p><span class="time" data-times="5.4" data-time="90.24">[01:30.24]</span>Professor: ...but it's <span class="highlight">critical</span> that. . . that somebody sees what your <span class="highlight">passion</span> is-your <span class="highlight">personal</span><span class="highlight">motivation</span> for doing this.</p>
      <p><span class="time" data-times="0.42" data-time="95.64">[01:35.64]</span>Student: OK.</p>
      <p><span class="time" data-times="2.12" data-time="96.06">[01:36.06]</span>Professor: And that's gotta come out in here. <span class="time" data-times="10.82" data-time="98.18">[01:38.18]</span>Um, and let's see, uh, you might also give a little, uh-since this is your only <span class="highlight">chance</span> to do it, you might give a little more explanation about your <span class="highlight">unique</span><span class="highlight">undergraduate</span> background. <span class="time" data-times="7.59" data-time="109">[01:49.00]</span>So, you know, how you went <span class="highlight">through</span>, you know, the music program; what you got from that; why you decided to change. <span class="time" data-times="4.21" data-time="116.59">[01:56.59]</span>I mean it's kind of unusual to go from music to <span class="highlight">geology</span>, right?</p>
      <p><span class="time" data-times="6.48" data-time="120.8">[02:00.80]</span>Student: Yeah. I was ...I was afraid that, you know, maybe the personal-type <span class="highlight">stuff</span> wouldn't be what they <span class="highlight">wanted</span>, but...</p>
      <p><span class="time" data-times="7.56" data-time="127.28">[02:07.28]</span>Professor: No, in fact it's ... um, give an example: I... I had a friend, when I was an undergrad, um, went to medical school. <span class="time" data-times="14.37" data-time="134.84">[02:14.84]</span>And he put on his med school application-and he could actually tell if somebody actually read it cause, um, he had <span class="highlight">asthma</span> and the <span class="highlight">reason</span> that he <span class="highlight">wanted</span> to go to med school was he said he <span class="highlight">wanted</span> to do sports medicine because he, you know, he had this real <span class="highlight">interest</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.32" data-time="149.21">[02:29.21]</span>He was an <span class="highlight">athlete</span> too, and . . . and <span class="highlight">wanted</span> to help athletes who had this <span class="highlight">physical</span> problem. <span class="time" data-times="5.43" data-time="154.53">[02:34.53]</span>And he could always tell if somebody actually read his letter, because they would always ask him about that.</p>
      <p><span class="time" data-times="2.96" data-time="159.96">[02:39.96]</span>Student: ...Mmm ... so something <span class="highlight">unique</span>.</p>
      <p><span class="time" data-times="8.13" data-time="162.92">[02:42.92]</span>Professor: Yeah. So see, you know, that's what's good and, and, I think for you probably, you know, your music background's the most <span class="highlight">unique</span> thing that you've got in your <span class="highlight">record</span>.</p>
      <p><span class="time" data-times="0.84999999999999" data-time="171.05">[02:51.05]</span>Student: Right.</p>
      <p><span class="time" data-times="5.83" data-time="171.9">[02:51.90]</span>Professor: ... Mmm ... so you see, you gotta make yourself stand out from a <span class="highlight">couple</span> hundred applications. <span class="time" data-times="1.27" data-time="177.73">[02:57.73]</span>Does that help any?</p>
      <p><span class="time" data-times="2.63" data-time="179">[02:59.00]</span>Student: Yeah, it does. It gives me some good ideas.</p>
      <p><span class="time" data-times="6.64" data-time="181.63">[03:01.63]</span>Professor: And ... what you might also do too is, you know, uh, you might get a friend to <span class="highlight">proof</span> it or something at some point.</p>
      <p><span class="time" data-times="1.34" data-time="188.27">[03:08.27]</span>Student: Oh, sure ... sure.</p>
      <p><span class="time" data-times="3.92" data-time="189.61">[03:09.61]</span>Professor: Also, think about presentation-how the <span class="highlight">application</span> looks. <span class="time" data-times="3.43" data-time="193.53">[03:13.53]</span>In a way, you're actually showing some other skills here, like <span class="highlight">organization</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.22" data-time="196.96">[03:16.96]</span>A lot of <span class="highlight">stuff</span> that's ... that they're not... they're not formally asking for, they're looking at. <span class="time" data-times="6.93" data-time="202.18">[03:22.18]</span>So your <span class="highlight">presentation</span><span class="highlight">format</span>, your grammar, all that <span class="highlight">stuff</span>, they're looking at in your materials at the same time.</p>
      <p><span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="209.11">[03:29.11]</span>Student: Right. OK.</p>
