            <span class="time" data-times="6.48" data-time="120.8">[02:00.80]</span>Student: Yeah. I was ...I was afraid that, you know, maybe the personal-type <span class="highlight">stuff</span> wouldn't be what they <span class="highlight">wanted</span>, but...</p>

            <span class="time" data-times="7.56" data-time="127.28">[02:07.28]</span>Professor: No, in fact it's ... um, give an example: I... I had a friend, when I was an undergrad, um, went to medical school. <span class="time" data-times="14.37" data-time="134.84">[02:14.84]</span>And he put on his med school application-and he could actually tell if somebody actually read it cause, um, he had <span class="highlight">asthma</span> and the <span class="highlight">reason</span> that he <span class="highlight">wanted</span> to go to med school was he said he <span class="highlight">wanted</span> to do sports medicine because he, you know, he had this real <span class="highlight">interest</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.32" data-time="149.21">[02:29.21]</span>He was an <span class="highlight">athlete</span> too, and . . . and <span class="highlight">wanted</span> to help athletes who had this <span class="highlight">physical</span> problem. <span class="time" data-times="5.43" data-time="154.53">[02:34.53]</span>And he could always tell if somebody actually read his letter, because they would always ask him about that.</p>

            <span class="time" data-times="2.96" data-time="159.96">[02:39.96]</span>Student: ...Mmm ... so something <span class="highlight">unique</span>.</p>

            <span class="time" data-times="8.13" data-time="162.92">[02:42.92]</span>Professor: Yeah.

            <span class="time" data-times="5.83" data-time="171.9">[02:51.90]</span>Professor: ... Mmm ... so you see, you gotta make yourself stand out from a <span class="highlight">couple</span> hundred applications. <span class="time" data-times="1.27" data-time="177.73">[02:57.73]</span>Does that help any?</p>

            <span class="time" data-times="6.64" data-time="181.63">[03:01.63]</span>Professor: And ... what you might also do too is, you know, uh, you might get a friend to <span class="highlight">proof</span> it or something at some point.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.34" data-time="188.27">[03:08.27]</span>Student: Oh, sure ... sure.</p>

            <span class="time" data-times="3.92" data-time="189.61">[03:09.61]</span>Professor: Also, think about presentation-how the <span class="highlight">application</span> looks. <span class="time" data-times="3.43" data-time="193.53">[03:13.53]</span>In a way, you're actually showing some other skills here, like <span class="highlight">organization</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.22" data-time="196.96">[03:16.96]</span>A lot of <span class="highlight">stuff</span> that's ... that they're not... they're not formally asking for, they're looking at. <span class="time" data-times="6.93" data-time="202.18">[03:22.18]</span>So your <span class="highlight">presentation</span> <span class="highlight">format</span>, your grammar, all that <span class="highlight">stuff</span>, they're looking at in your materials at the same time.</p>
