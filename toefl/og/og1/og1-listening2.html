              <span class="time" data-times="9.91" data-time="3.91">[00:03.91]</span>Professor: So I <span class="highlight">wanted</span> to discuss a few other terms here ... actually, some, uh, some ideas about how we <span class="highlight">manage</span> our resources.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.99" data-time="13.82">[00:13.82]</span>Let's talk about what that ...what that means. <span class="time" data-times="12.09" data-time="16.81">[00:16.81]</span>If we take a <span class="highlight">resource</span> like water. ..well, maybe we should get a little bit more <span class="highlight">specific</span> here-back up from the more general case-and talk about <span class="highlight">underground</span> water in <span class="highlight">particular</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.84" data-time="28.9">[00:28.90]</span>So hydrogeologists have tried to <span class="highlight">figure</span> out... how much water can you take out from <span class="highlight">underground</span> sources? <span class="time" data-times="2.07" data-time="36.74">[00:36.74]</span>This has been an important question.<span class="time" data-times="8.89" data-time="38.81">[00:38.81]</span>Let me ask you guys: how much water, based on what you know so far, could you take out of, say, an <span class="highlight">aquifer</span>... under the city?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.31" data-time="47.7">[00:47.70]</span>
              <span class="highlight">Male</span> Student: As ... as much as would get recharged?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.23" data-time="51.01">[00:51.01]</span>Professor: OK. So we wouldn't want to take out any more than naturally comes into it. <span class="time" data-times="10.04" data-time="57.24">[00:57.24]</span>The <span class="highlight">implication</span> is that, uh, well, if you only take as much out as comes in, you're not <span class="highlight">gonna</span> <span class="highlight">deplete</span> the <span class="highlight">amount</span> of water that's stored in there, right?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.72" data-time="67.28">[01:07.28]</span>Wrong, but that's the <span class="highlight">principle</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.6" data-time="69">[01:09.00]</span>That's the idea behind how we <span class="highlight">manage</span> our water supplies. <span class="time" data-times="2.94" data-time="73.6">[01:13.60]</span>It's called "safe <span class="highlight">yield</span>."<span class="time" data-times="10.83" data-time="76.54">[01:16.54]</span>Basically what this <span class="highlight">method</span> says is that you can <span class="highlight">pump</span> as much water out of a system as naturally recharges ... as naturally flows back in.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.58" data-time="87.37">[01:27.37]</span>So this <span class="highlight">principle</span> of safe yield-it's based on balancing what we take out with what gets recharged. <span class="time" data-times="5.87" data-time="95.95">[01:35.95]</span>But what it does is, it ignores how much water naturally comes out of the system.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.82" data-time="101.82">[01:41.82]</span>In a natural system, a certain <span class="highlight">amount</span> of <span class="highlight">recharge</span> comes in and a certain <span class="highlight">amount</span> of water naturally flows out <span class="highlight">through</span> springs, streams, and lakes. <span class="time" data-times="4.79" data-time="110.64">[01:50.64]</span>And over the long <span class="highlight">term</span> the <span class="highlight">amount</span> that's stored in the <span class="highlight">aquifer</span> doesn't really change much. <span class="time" data-times="1.33" data-time="115.43">[01:55.43]</span>It's <span class="highlight">balanced</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.66" data-time="116.76">[01:56.76]</span>Now humans come in . . . and start taking water out of the system. <span class="time" data-times="2.7" data-time="121.42">[02:01.42]</span>How have we changed the <span class="highlight">equation</span>?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.2" data-time="124.12">[02:04.12]</span>
              <span class="highlight">Female</span> Student: It's not <span class="highlight">balanced</span> anymore?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.33" data-time="126.32">[02:06.32]</span>Professor: Right. We take water out, but water also naturally flows out. <span class="time" data-times="7.13" data-time="131.65">[02:11.65]</span>And the <span class="highlight">recharge</span> <span class="highlight">rate</span> doesn't change, so the result is we've reduced the <span class="highlight">amount</span> of water that's stored in the <span class="highlight">underground</span> system.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.4" data-time="138.78">[02:18.78]</span>If you keep doing that long enough-if you <span class="highlight">pump</span> as much water out as naturally comes in-gradually the <span class="highlight">underground</span> water levels <span class="highlight">drop</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.77" data-time="147.18">[02:27.18]</span>And when that happens, that can <span class="highlight">affect</span> surface water. <span class="time" data-times="9.91" data-time="150.95">[02:30.95]</span>How? Well, in <span class="highlight">underground</span> systems there are natural <span class="highlight">discharge</span> points-places where the water flows out of the <span class="highlight">underground</span> systems, out to lakes and streams. <span class="time" data-times="5.06" data-time="160.86">[02:40.86]</span>Well, a <span class="highlight">drop</span> in the water <span class="highlight">level</span> can mean those <span class="highlight">discharge</span> points will <span class="highlight">eventually</span> dry up. <span class="time" data-times="4.05" data-time="165.92">[02:45.92]</span>That means water's not getting to lakes and streams that <span class="highlight">depend</span> on it. <span class="time" data-times="3.74" data-time="169.97">[02:49.97]</span>So we've ended up reducing the surface water <span class="highlight">supply</span>, too.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="12.3" data-time="173.71">[02:53.71]</span>You know,in the <span class="highlight">state</span> of Arizona we're managing some <span class="highlight">major</span> water supplies with this <span class="highlight">principle</span> of safe <span class="highlight">yield</span>, under a <span class="highlight">method</span> that will <span class="highlight">eventually</span> dry up the natural <span class="highlight">discharge</span> points of those <span class="highlight">aquifer</span> systems.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.02" data-time="186.01">[03:06.01]</span>Now, why is this an <span class="highlight">issue</span>? <span class="time" data-times="4.25" data-time="189.03">[03:09.03]</span>Well, aren't some of you going to want to live in this <span class="highlight">state</span> for a while? <span class="time" data-times="3.29" data-time="193.28">[03:13.28]</span>Want your kids to grow up here, and your kids' kids? <span class="time" data-times="7.72" data-time="196.57">[03:16.57]</span>You might be concerned with . . . does Arizona have a water <span class="highlight">supply</span> which is sustainable-key word here? <span class="time" data-times="13.62" data-time="204.29">[03:24.29]</span>What that means . . . the general <span class="highlight">definition</span> of sustainable is will there be enough to meet the needs of the present without compromising the <span class="highlight">ability</span> of the future to have the <span class="highlight">availability</span> ... to have the same resources? <span class="time" data-times="6.69" data-time="217.91">[03:37.91]</span>Now, I hope you see that these two ideas are incompatible: sustainability and safe <span class="highlight">yield</span>. <span class="time" data-times="13.19" data-time="224.6">[03:44.60]</span>Because what sustainability means is that it's sustainable for all systems dependent on the water-for the people that use it and for... uh, for supplying water to the dependent lakes and streams.</p>

              <span class="time" data-times="11.6" data-time="237.79">[03:57.79]</span>So I'm <span class="highlight">gonna</span> repeat this: so if we're using a safe-yield <span class="highlight">method</span>, if we're only balancing what we take out with what gets recharged, but-don't forget, water's also flowing out naturally. <span class="time" data-times="6.21" data-time="249.39">[04:09.39]</span>Then the <span class="highlight">amount</span> stored <span class="highlight">underground</span> is <span class="highlight">gonna</span> <span class="highlight">gradually</span> get reduced and that's <span class="highlight">gonna</span> <span class="highlight">lead</span> to another problem. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="255.6">[04:15.60]</span>These <span class="highlight">discharge</span> points-where the water flows out to the lakes and streams-they're <span class="highlight">gonna</span> dry up.
