          <p>As to this topic, I would like to talk about library, since the library is always very important to me. When I was a child, my parents often took me to the library to read and learn. As soon as I stepped into the library for the very first time, I was infatuated with this place. I like reading and writing, and the library is the best place to go. Anyone can access to a variety of books. Besides, the library is quiet and people there are all reading, so I can concentrate on reading better. The last but not the least, I am a person who prefer to live a solitary life, however, I don't want to feel lonely and isolated. The library offers me with such a great environment where I can study alone while surrounded by people. </p>
