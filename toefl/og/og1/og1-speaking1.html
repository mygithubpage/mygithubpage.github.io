          <p>For example, the response “I like this place because it is nice” does not have enough detail. Why is this place nice? Developing this idea more might look like this: “I like this place because it is quiet and peaceful. Listening to the ocean waves on the beach relaxes me and helps me to relieve stress.”</p>

          <p>The speaker continues speaking throughout the entire 45 seconds. She speaks clearly using a variety of vocabulary and a wide range of grammar. Her reasons are well developed. She uses specific details about why France is an important place for her. Instead of just saying, “I’m interested in French culture because it is interesting,” she elaborates by talking about her friend, her interest in French history and culture from a young age, and the food. There is a logical progression of ideas that makes the response easy to understand.</p>

          <p>This response is sustained and the speech is generally understandable. At times, though, the speaker’s pronunciation makes it difficult to understand the meaning of her ideas. She really gives only one reason why she likes shopping. This reason is used repetitively without much elaboration. Shopping is something she likes very much and makes her feel better. She could have added complexity to her ideas by saying something like “When I go shopping, I usually go with friends and we have a good time together without thinking about jobs, or schoolwork.” She also makes some basic grammatical errors and uses a limited range of vocabulary.</p>

          <p>As to this topic, I would like to talk about library, since the library is always very important to me. When I was a child, my parents often took me to the library to read and learn. <b><u>As soon as I stepped into</u> the library for the very first time, I was infatuated with this place.</b> I like reading and writing, and the library <b>is the best place to go</b>. Anyone can access to a variety of books. Besides, the library is quiet and people there are all reading, so I can concentrate on reading better. The last but not the least, I am a person who prefer to live a solitary life, however, I don't want to feel lonely and isolated. The library <b>offers me with such a great environment where I can</b> study alone while surrounded by people. </p>
