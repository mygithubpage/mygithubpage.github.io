She speaks clearly using a variety of vocabulary and a wide range of grammar. Her reasons are well developed. She uses specific details about why France is an important place for her. Instead of just saying, “I’m interested in French culture because it is interesting,” she elaborates by talking about her friend, her interest in French history and culture from a young age, and the food. There is a logical progression of ideas that makes the response easy to understand.</p><p><b>Play Audio Track 32 to hear a mid-level response for Question 1.</b></p><p><audio src="test_1_032.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></p><p><b>Rater’s Comments</b></p><p>This response is sustained and the speech is generally understandable. At times, though, the speaker’s pronunciation makes it difficult to understand the meaning of her ideas. She really gives only one reason why she likes shopping. This reason is used repetitively without much elaboration. Shopping is something she likes very much and makes her feel better. She could have added complexity to her ideas by saying something like “When I go shopping, I usually go with friends and we have a good time together without thinking about jobs, or schoolwork.” She also makes some basic grammatical errors and uses a limited range of vocabulary.</p></div></main></body></html>
