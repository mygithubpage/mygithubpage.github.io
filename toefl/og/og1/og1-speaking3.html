          </h4>Bus Service Elimination Planned The university has decided to discontinue its free bus service for students. The reason given for this decision is that few students ride the buses and the buses are expensive to operate. Currently, the buses run from the center of campus past university buildings and through some of the neighborhoods surrounding the campus. The money saved by eliminating the bus service will be used to expand the overcrowded student parking lots.</article>

        <h3>Listening Text</h3>
        <article>Now listen to two students discussing the article. 

Man:I don't like the university's plan. 

Woman:Really? I've ridden those buses, and sometimes there were only a few people on the bus. It did seem like kind of a waste. 

Man:I see your point. But I think the problem is the route's out-of-date. It only goes through the neighborhoods that've gotten too expensive for students to live in. It's ridiculous that they haven't already changed the route - you know, so it goes where most off-campus students live now. I bet if they did that, they'd get plenty of students riding those buses. 

Woman:Well, at least they are adding more parking. It's gotten really tough to find a space. 

Man:That's the other part I don't like, actually. Cutting back the bus service and adding parking's just gonna encourage more students to drive on campus. And that'll just add to the noise around campus and create more traffic...and that'll increase the need for more parking spaces. 

Woman:Yeah, I guess I can see your point. Maybe it would be better if more students used the buses instead of driving. 

Man:Right. And the university should make it easier to do that, not harder.</article>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
The university is planning to eliminate its free bus service, because not many students use it and the school can use the money saved to build more parking lots. In the conversation, the man disagrees with the university's plan. First of all, he thinks the reason that few students take the bus is that the route is out-of-date, which only goes through the areas that are too expensive for students to live. Instead of eliminating the bus service, the university should change the bus route to where more students live. Secondly, he thinks that more students will drive if the university used the saved money to build more parking lots, and that will create more traffic problems and increase the noise level on campus.</article>
