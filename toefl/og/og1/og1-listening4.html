Drugs that are harmful to the human body</p><p>B. Bacteria that produce antibiotics</p><p>C. DNA that is related to athletic performance</p><p>D. Genes that protect bacteria from antibiotics</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>Two students are reviewing for a biology exam and the content is how bacteria resists antibiotics. It mentions that jumpping and hopping are just another way of saying resistance genes rather than sports. A/B did not mention it....</p></div></div><div class="replay" id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the woman say this?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

Their movements are rapid and unpredictable.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The girls said that what I want to ask is a gene that can obtain resistance genes from other cells in the environment. The boys say they are not called "jumping genes", but the actual scientific name is called "transition." It can be seen that transposon is "jumping genes"....</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>According to the conversation, what are two ways in which bacteria cells get resistance genes? Choose 2 answers.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The resistance genes are carried from nearby cells.</p><p>B. The resistance genes are carried by white blood cells.</p><p>C. The resistance genes are inherited from the parent cell.</p><p>D. The resistance genes are carried by antibiotics.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="AC"><p>The girls asked the boys how the bacteria got the resistance genes. The boys said they could be obtained directly. The girls affirmed this argument but asked how the way to get from the neighboring cells was going on. It can be seen that these two methods. None of the BDs mentioned it....</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What can be inferred about the resistance genes discussed in theconversation?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.
