      <p><span class="time" data-times="3.16" data-time="51.59">[00:51.59]</span>Professor: Right.They grow all kinds of <span class="highlight">commercial</span> crops in water. <span class="time" data-times="3.58" data-time="54.75">[00:54.75]</span>So if you're growing things in water, you can add the <span class="highlight">fertilizer</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.68" data-time="58.33">[00:58.33]</span>What do you need to do to that water <span class="highlight">besides</span> put <span class="highlight">fertilizer</span> in it? <span class="time" data-times="3.08" data-time="62.01">[01:02.01]</span>Anyone ever actually tried to grow plants in water? <span class="time" data-times="1.91" data-time="65.09">[01:05.09]</span>You must <span class="highlight">bubble</span> water <span class="highlight">through</span> it. <span class="time" data-times="1.04" data-time="67">[01:07.00]</span><span class="highlight">Bubble</span> gas <span class="highlight">through</span> it. <span class="time" data-times="1.98" data-time="68.04">[01:08.04]</span>I'm sorry, you must <span class="highlight">bubble</span> gas <span class="highlight">through</span> it. <span class="time" data-times="2.3" data-time="70.02">[01:10.02]</span>So, gas, you have to <span class="highlight">bubble</span><span class="highlight">through</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.55" data-time="72.32">[01:12.32]</span>Think about the soil we talked about last week, about growing plants in soil. <span class="time" data-times="4.78" data-time="76.87">[01:16.87]</span>Think about some of you who have killed your favorite houseplants, 'cause you loved them too much. <span class="time" data-times="3.42" data-time="81.65">[01:21.65]</span>If you overwater, why do your favorite houseplants die?</p>
