            <span class="underline">Female</span> Student: By projects.</p>

By <span class="underline">function</span> ... and by projects. <span class="time" data-times="11.45" data-time="18.32">[00:18.32]</span>Twenty years ago companies were organized in <span class="underline">function</span> groups, where people with a certain <span class="underline">expertise</span> worked together as a unit- the, uh, architects in one unit, the <span class="underline">finance</span> people in another unit. <span class="time" data-times="15.38" data-time="29.77">[00:29.77]</span>Well, nowadays a lot of companies are organized around projects-like a <span class="underline">construction</span><span class="underline">company</span> could be building an office building in one city and an <span class="underline">apartment</span> house somewhere else, and each <span class="underline">project</span> has its own architects and engineers.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="11.25" data-time="45.15">[00:45.15]</span>Now, the good thing about <span class="underline">project</span><span class="underline">organization</span> is that it's easier to change to <span class="underline">adapt</span> to the needs of the project-it's a small group, a dedicated team, not the whole <span class="underline">company</span>. <span class="time" data-times="13.11" data-time="56.4">[00:56.40]</span>Now, with that in <span class="underline">mind</span>, here's a question for you: why do we continue to organize ourselves by <span class="underline">function</span>, <span class="underline">even</span> now, when in fact we <span class="underline">admit</span> that projects are the lifeblood of a lot of organizations? <span class="time" data-times="6.94" data-time="69.51">[01:09.51]</span>Why do some companies <span class="underline">maintain</span> a <span class="underline">functional</span><span class="underline">organization</span><span class="underline">instead</span> of organizing around projects?

            <span class="underline">Female</span> Student: Because, um, if you don't have that <span class="underline">functional</span> structure <span class="underline">within</span> your <span class="underline">organization</span>, chances are you'd have a harder time meeting the goals of the projects.</p>

            <span class="time" data-times="4.48" data-time="88.09">[01:28.09]</span>Professor: Listen, let's say we got four new cars we want to design. <span class="time" data-times="2.63" data-time="92.57">[01:32.57]</span>Why do we need a <span class="underline">functional</span><span class="underline">organization</span>? <span class="time" data-times="8.53" data-time="95.2">[01:35.20]</span>Why not just organize the <span class="underline">company</span> around the four projects-these people make car number one, these other people make car number two...</p>

            <span class="underline">Female</span> Student: Yeah, but who's <span class="underline">gonna</span> be <span class="underline">responsible</span> for what? <span class="time" data-times="0.59" data-time="106">[01:46.00]</span>You know, the way you tell who's ...</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="9.05" data-time="106.59">[01:46.59]</span>Professor: Well ...well, we'll <span class="underline">appoint</span> a manager: new car number one manager, car number two manager they're completely <span class="underline">responsible</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.23" data-time="115.64">[01:55.64]</span>Why should we have a single <span class="underline">engineering</span><span class="underline">department</span> that has all four cars passing <span class="underline">through</span> it?</p>

            <span class="underline">Female</span> Student: When you design a car, you need the <span class="underline">expertise</span> of all the engineers in the <span class="underline">company</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.51" data-time="126.88">[02:06.88]</span>Each engineer needs to be in touch with the entire <span class="underline">engineering</span><span class="underline">department</span>.</p>

            <span class="time" data-times="3.55" data-time="131.39">[02:11.39]</span>Professor: Yeah, but I keep ... I keep asking why. <span class="time" data-times="3.22" data-time="134.94">[02:14.94]</span>I <span class="underline">wanna</span> know why. Yes.</p>

            <span class="underline">Male</span> Student: Well, to <span class="underline">eliminate</span> redundancy's probably one of the biggest factors in an <span class="underline">organization</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.22" data-time="144.21">[02:24.21]</span>So that, uh... so that there's, there's ...standards of... for <span class="underline">uniformity</span> and <span class="underline">efficiency</span> in the <span class="underline">organization</span>.</p>
