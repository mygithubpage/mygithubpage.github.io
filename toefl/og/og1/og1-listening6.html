By <span class="highlight">function</span> ... and by projects. <span class="time" data-times="11.45" data-time="18.32">[00:18.32]</span>Twenty years ago companies were organized in <span class="highlight">function</span> groups, where people with a certain <span class="highlight">expertise</span> worked together as a unit- the, uh, architects in one unit, the <span class="highlight">finance</span> people in another unit. <span class="time" data-times="15.38" data-time="29.77">[00:29.77]</span>Well, nowadays a lot of companies are organized around projects-like a <span class="highlight">construction</span> <span class="highlight">company</span> could be building an office building in one city and an <span class="highlight">apartment</span> house somewhere else, and each <span class="highlight">project</span> has its own architects and engineers.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="11.25" data-time="45.15">[00:45.15]</span>Now, the good thing about <span class="highlight">project</span> <span class="highlight">organization</span> is that it's easier to change to <span class="highlight">adapt</span> to the needs of the project-it's a small group, a dedicated team, not the whole <span class="highlight">company</span>. <span class="time" data-times="13.11" data-time="56.4">[00:56.40]</span>Now, with that in <span class="highlight">mind</span>, here's a question for you: why do we continue to organize ourselves by <span class="highlight">function</span>, <span class="highlight">even</span> now, when in fact we <span class="highlight">admit</span> that projects are the lifeblood of a lot of organizations? <span class="time" data-times="6.94" data-time="69.51">[01:09.51]</span>Why do some companies <span class="highlight">maintain</span> a <span class="highlight">functional</span> <span class="highlight">organization</span> <span class="highlight">instead</span> of organizing around projects? Yes?</p>

            <span class="highlight">Female</span> Student: Because, um, if you don't have that <span class="highlight">functional</span> structure <span class="highlight">within</span> your <span class="highlight">organization</span>, chances are you'd have a harder time meeting the goals of the projects.</p>
