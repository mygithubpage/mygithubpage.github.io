            <span class="time" data-times="3.53" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in a <span class="highlight">philosophy</span> class. <span class="time" data-times="2.98" data-time="3.53">[00:03.53]</span>The professor has been talking about <span class="highlight">ethics</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="11.94" data-time="6.51">[00:06.51]</span>Professor: OK, if we're going to discuss goodness and <span class="highlight">justice</span> - what makes an <span class="highlight">individual</span> good or a society just or virtuous-then we need to start with the <span class="highlight">ancient</span> Greeks. <span class="time" data-times="3.5" data-time="18.45">[00:18.45]</span>So we'll start with Plato-Plato's <span class="highlight">philosophy</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.88" data-time="21.95">[00:21.95]</span>Now, some of you may have studied Plato's <span class="highlight">philosophy</span> in some other <span class="highlight">course</span>, so this might be easy. <span class="time" data-times="6.53" data-time="27.83">[00:27.83]</span>OK, at the risk of boring you, let me give you just an <span class="highlight">overview</span> of Plato's <span class="highlight">ethical</span> <span class="highlight">theory</span>. <span class="time" data-times="16.24" data-time="34.36">[00:34.36]</span>Plato says the soul has-and by "soul" he <span class="highlight">simply</span> means that which animates the body, gives it life-anyway, he says that the soul has three <span class="highlight">separate</span> parts ...called, um, "faculties," which I'll come back to. <span class="time" data-times="9.79" data-time="50.6">[00:50.60]</span>He believed that goodness in an <span class="highlight">individual</span> was to be found when the three parts of the soul worked together, when they weren't in <span class="highlight">conflict</span>, but existed in <span class="highlight">harmony</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.49" data-time="60.39">[01:00.39]</span>A good or just person will have a soul in which the three faculties work well together.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.79" data-time="66.88">[01:06.88]</span>So how does he arrive at that <span class="highlight">analysis</span>? <span class="time" data-times="11.27" data-time="69.67">[01:09.67]</span>Well, he starts out in his very famous work The <span class="highlight">Republic</span>, um, he starts out by saying it's very difficult to get a <span class="highlight">grasp</span> on what the <span class="highlight">individual</span>'s soul looks like. <span class="time" data-times="12.34" data-time="80.94">[01:20.94]</span>So, to get some idea of what the <span class="highlight">individual</span> human soul is like, he says we should study the structure of society-what kinds of people and activities every society has to have. <span class="time" data-times="7.53" data-time="93.28">[01:33.28]</span>He argues that every society has to have three groups of people: workers, soldiers, and leaders. <span class="time" data-times="3.57" data-time="100.81">[01:40.81]</span>And each has a <span class="highlight">sort</span> of defining <span class="highlight">characteristic</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="10.03" data-time="104.38">[01:44.38]</span>Every society has to have workers like farmers or, um, people who work in factories, producing all the things that we need for everyday life. <span class="time" data-times="9.99" data-time="114.41">[01:54.41]</span>And according to Plato, the key feature of workers is that they're focused on their own desires or appetites- interested in satisfying the needs of the body. <span class="time" data-times="4.73" data-time="124.4">[02:04.40]</span>So workers are <span class="highlight">associated</span> with <span class="highlight">desire</span>... OK?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="10.27" data-time="129.13">[02:09.13]</span>Now, if you live in a society that has a good <span class="highlight">amount</span> of wealth-um, good <span class="highlight">agriculture</span>, good industry-other societies are probably going to try to take it. <span class="time" data-times="5.49" data-time="139.4">[02:19.40]</span>So you need a class of soldiers, who are supposed to protect the <span class="highlight">state</span> from <span class="highlight">external</span> threats. <span class="time" data-times="13.75" data-time="144.89">[02:24.89]</span>Well, these soldiers, well, they're going to be in dangerous situations quite frequently, so you need people with, um, a ... a lot of high spirit-uh, an <span class="highlight">emotional</span> type of <span class="highlight">individual</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.2" data-time="158.64">[02:38.64]</span> <span class="highlight">Emotion</span> is what characterizes this group.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.01" data-time="161.84">[02:41.84]</span>And then, Plato says, the third group you need is leaders. <span class="time" data-times="6.3" data-time="166.85">[02:46.85]</span>Their main role will be to think rationally, to use their <span class="highlight">reason</span> or <span class="highlight">intellect</span> to make decisions. <span class="time" data-times="7.21" data-time="173.15">[02:53.15]</span>As decision makers, leaders <span class="highlight">determine</span> what the <span class="highlight">state</span> is to do, how the affairs of the citizens are to be run.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="7.62" data-time="180.36">[03:00.36]</span>Plato then asks himself: OK, <span class="highlight">assume</span> we've got such a society with these three groups. <span class="time" data-times="6.43" data-time="187.98">[03:07.98]</span>When will this society be a good, um, a ... a just society? <span class="time" data-times="7.82" data-time="194.41">[03:14.41]</span>Well, you can only have a good society when its three parts are working well together-each doing its <span class="highlight">proper</span> thing. <span class="time" data-times="7.19" data-time="202.23">[03:22.23]</span>And Plato believes this can only happen if workers and soldiers learn moderation, or self-control.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.27" data-time="209.42">[03:29.42]</span>But why? Why do workers and soldiers have to learn self-control? <span class="time" data-times="6.74" data-time="214.69">[03:34.69]</span>Well, how can a society <span class="highlight">flourish</span> if the workers and soldiers don't control their desires and emotions? <span class="time" data-times="8.1" data-time="221.43">[03:41.43]</span>Plato thinks that if they aren't under control, workers will sleep too much and play too much, so they're not going to get their jobs done. <span class="time" data-times="7.38" data-time="229.53">[03:49.53]</span>And soldiers need to <span class="highlight">channel</span> their high-spiritedness in a certain direction, precisely by being <span class="highlight">courageous</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.76" data-time="236.91">[03:56.91]</span>But you're not going to get that automatically. <span class="time" data-times="2.95" data-time="239.67">[03:59.67]</span>You need to teach them this kind of moderation. <span class="time" data-times="9.35" data-time="242.62">[04:02.62]</span>So you need an educational system that first of all will train the leaders, so that they'll make good decisions, so they'll know what's wise. <span class="time" data-times="7.52" data-time="251.97">[04:11.97]</span>Then make leaders responsible-um, uh, turn over to them the education of the other two groups. <span class="time" data-times="9.17" data-time="259.49">[04:19.49]</span>And <span class="highlight">through</span> education, build a society so that the workers and soldiers learn to use their <span class="highlight">intellect</span> to control their desires and emotions. <span class="time" data-times="6.17" data-time="268.66">[04:28.66]</span>If you had all that, then, for Plato, you'd have a good or just society.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="7.55" data-time="274.83">[04:34.83]</span>Now, take that picture - that social, <span class="highlight">political</span> picture-and <span class="highlight">apply</span> it to the <span class="highlight">individual</span> person. <span class="time" data-times="2.25" data-time="282.38">[04:42.38]</span>You remember about the soul? <span class="time" data-times="3.81" data-time="284.63">[04:44.63]</span>That it consists of three <span class="highlight">separate</span> parts, or faculties? <span class="time" data-times="1.88" data-time="288.44">[04:48.44]</span>Can you guess what they are? <span class="time" data-times="7.46" data-time="290.32">[04:50.32]</span>Desires, emotions, and intellect-the characteristics <span class="highlight">associated</span> with the three groups of society. <span class="time" data-times="4.28" data-time="297.78">[04:57.78]</span>And can you guess how Plato defines a good or just person? <span class="time" data-times="5.23" data-time="302.06">[05:02.06]</span>Well, it's <span class="highlight">parallel</span> to how he characterizes a good or just society. <span class="time" data-times="2.81" data-time="307.29">[05:07.29]</span>The three parts have to be in <span class="highlight">harmony</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.35" data-time="310.1">[05:10.10]</span>In each of us, our desires and emotions often get the better of us, and <span class="highlight">lead</span> us to do <span class="highlight">foolish</span> things. <span class="time" data-times="2.76" data-time="316.45">[05:16.45]</span>They're in <span class="highlight">conflict</span> with the <span class="highlight">intellect</span>. <span class="time" data-times="11.64" data-time="319.21">[05:19.21]</span>So, to get them to all work together, to <span class="highlight">coexist</span> in <span class="highlight">harmony</span>, every person needs to be shaped in the same way that we've shaped society-through the educational system. <span class="time" data-times="6.46" data-time="330.85">[05:30.85]</span>Individuals must be <span class="highlight">educated</span> to use their <span class="highlight">intellect</span> to control their emotions and desires. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="337.31">[05:37.31]</span>That's <span class="highlight">harmony</span> in the soul.</p>
