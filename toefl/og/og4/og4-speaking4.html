However, sometimes an animal species may display a behavior that no longer serves a clear purpose. The original purpose for the behavior may have disappeared long ago, even thousands of years before. These behaviors, known as relict behaviors, were useful to the animal when the species' habitat was different; but now, because of changed conditions, the behavior no longer serves its original purpose. Left over from an earlier time, the behavior remains as a relict, or remnant, long after the environmental circumstance that influenced its evolution has vanished.</p></article><div><audio src="og4-speaking4.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></div><article id="listening-passage" class="passage"><h3>Listening Text</h3><p>Now listen to part of a lecture in a biology class.</p><p>Ok, uh, so a good example of this, found right there in North America, is something an animal called the American Pronghorn does. Prong Horns, as you may know, are a kind of deer-like animal, they live out in the open grassy plains, somewhat in the middle of America, and they are super fast. Pronghorns are, in fact, noted for being the fastest animal in the western hemisphere. Once a Pronghorn starts running, zoom! None of its present predators, like the bobcat or the coyote can even hope to catch up with it. It's off in a flash! Ok, so why then do Pronghorns run so fast? That's the question.Well, it turns out that quite a long time ago, I'm talking tens of thousands of years, things on the grassy plains used to be very different for the Pronghorns, because back then, lions used to live on the plains, chasing and preying upon the Pronghorns, and lions, of course, are a very swift-moving mammal, much faster than the bobcat or coyote or other predators you'd find on the plains today.But, now, however, lions are all extinct in North America, they're no longer predator of the Pronghorn. Tens of thousands of years ago, though, the lions were there chasing the Pronghorns. So back then, the Pronghorn's speed was critical to its survival.</p></article><section id="question"><h4>Question</h4><p>Using the example of the pronghorn and lion, explain the concept of a relict behavior. </p></section><section><h5>Important Points</h5><p>Under the broad definition, money is anything that can be used as payment (as a medium of exchange), e.g., coins/bills and barter. If you take a taxi ride, you could use vegetables as payment for the cab ride. Under a narrower definition, money is anything that must be accepted as payment (legal tender). In the United States, coins and bills are legal tender. A taxi driver must accept coins and bills as payment for the taxi ride. Vegetables and credit cards are not legal tender in the United States, so the taxi driver does not have to accept these as payment.</p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>Relict behavior refers to a kind of behavior in animals that was critical to their survival a long time ago but serve no purpose now due to the change of the environment. In the lecture, the professor takes the American pronghorn that lives in North America. It's known as the fastest animal in the western hemisphere, and none of its present predators, like bobcat or coyote, can catch up with it. However, the pronghorn was fast for a reason a long time ago. Tens of thousands of years ago, there were lions on the grassland, and lions preyed on pronghorns. Since lions were very fast, the pronghorns, in order to survive, had to run for their life. That was how the pronghorn gained its speed. However, lions were extinct then, so the primary reason for the pronghorn's speed was gone. But the behavior remained, and became what's known as relict behavior.

She speaks a little too quickly at times, but the overall meaning is not lost. Her words and ideas flow easily from one idea to the next. She uses complex grammatical structures and a wide range of vocabulary. The speaker fluently summarizes the stimulus accurately recounting the broad and narrow definition. Her response is detailed and sustained. She spends too much time summarizing the first definition and example, so she does not fully explain the second definition and example. However, it is obvious from the apparent ease in which she speaks that she understands the concept and is able to talk about it.</p><p><b>Play Audio Track 123 to hear a mid-level response for Question 1.</b></p><p><audio src="test_4_123.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></p><p><b>Rater’s Comments</b></p><p>The speaker’s pronunciation is generally clear. She sustains speech and continues to try to elaborate her ideas. The hesitance and choppiness indicates a lack of control of vocabulary and grammar. This significantly affects the overall intelligibility of the response. She conveys some relevant details including an almost accurate summary of both definitions of money. However, her response is clearly incomplete. The speaker’s struggle to find the right words to convey her ideas prevents her from efficiently using her time. Neither of the examples is included in the response. Most of her ideas are underdeveloped.</p></div></main></body></html>
