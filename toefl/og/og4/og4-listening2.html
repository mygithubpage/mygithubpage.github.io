          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.82" data-time="6.25">[00:06.25]</span>Professor: We are going to start a study of sunspots today, and I think you'll find it rather interesting. <span class="time" data-times="6.63" data-time="12.07">[00:12.07]</span>Now I'm going to <span class="highlight">assume</span> that you know that sunspots, in the most <span class="highlight">basic</span> terms, are dark spots on the Sun's surface. <span class="time" data-times="1.62" data-time="18.7">[00:18.70]</span>That will do for now. <span class="time" data-times="6.66" data-time="20.32">[00:20.32]</span>The <span class="highlight">ancient</span> Chinese were the first to <span class="highlight">record</span> observations of sunspots as early as the year 165.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.8" data-time="26.98">[00:26.98]</span>When later European astronomers wrote about sunspots, they didn't believe that the spots were actually on the Sun. <span class="time" data-times="9.04" data-time="33.78">[00:33.78]</span>That's because of their belief at the time that the heavenly bodies, the Sun, Moon, Stars, and Planets, were <span class="highlight">perfect</span>, without any flaws or blemishes. <span class="time" data-times="6.99" data-time="42.82">[00:42.82]</span>So the opinion was the spots were actually something else, like shadows of planets <span class="highlight">crossing</span> the Sun's face. <span class="time" data-times="7.66" data-time="49.81">[00:49.81]</span>And this was the thinking of European astronomers until the <span class="highlight">introduction</span> of the <span class="highlight">telescope</span>, which brings us to our old friend, Galileo.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.7" data-time="57.47">[00:57.47]</span>In the early 1600s, based on his observations of sunspots. <span class="time" data-times="2.77" data-time="62.17">[01:02.17]</span>Galileo proposed a new <span class="highlight">hypothesis</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.33" data-time="64.94">[01:04.94]</span>He <span class="highlight">pointed</span> out that the <span class="highlight">shape</span> of sunspots, well, the sunspots weren't <span class="highlight">circular</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.6" data-time="70.27">[01:10.27]</span>If they were shadows of the planets, they would be <span class="highlight">circular</span>, right? <span class="time" data-times="3.1" data-time="73.87">[01:13.87]</span>So that was a problem for the <span class="highlight">prevailing</span> view. <span class="time" data-times="6.33" data-time="76.97">[01:16.97]</span>And he also noticed that the <span class="highlight">shape</span> of the sunspots changed as they seemed to move <span class="highlight">across</span> the Sun's surface.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="7.79" data-time="83.3">[01:23.30]</span>Maybe a <span class="highlight">particular</span> sunspot was <span class="highlight">sort</span> of <span class="highlight">square</span>, then later it would become more lopsided, then later something else. <span class="time" data-times="7.25" data-time="91.09">[01:31.09]</span>So there is another problem with the shadow <span class="highlight">hypothesis</span>, because the <span class="highlight">shape</span> of a <span class="highlight">planet</span> doesn't change. <span class="time" data-times="8.92" data-time="98.34">[01:38.34]</span>What Galileo proposed was that sunspots were indeed a feature of the Sun, but he didn't know what kind of feature.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="11.75" data-time="107.26">[01:47.26]</span>He proposed that they might be clouds in the <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span>, the <span class="highlight">solar</span> <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span>, especially because they seemed to change <span class="highlight">shape</span> and there was no predicting the changes, at <span class="highlight">least</span> nothing Galileo could <span class="highlight">figure</span> out. <span class="time" data-times="4.37" data-time="119.01">[01:59.01]</span>That <span class="highlight">random</span> <span class="highlight">shape</span> changing would be <span class="highlight">consistent</span> with the spots being clouds.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.54" data-time="123.38">[02:03.38]</span>Over the next <span class="highlight">couple</span> hundred years, a lot of hypotheses were tossed around. <span class="time" data-times="6.32" data-time="127.92">[02:07.92]</span>The spots were mountains or holes in the <span class="highlight">solar</span> <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span> <span class="highlight">through</span> which the dark surface of the Sun could be seen. <span class="time" data-times="5.75" data-time="134.24">[02:14.24]</span>Then in 1843, <span class="highlight">astronomer</span> named Heinrich Schwa be made an interesting <span class="highlight">claim</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9.96" data-time="139.99">[02:19.99]</span>Trobe had been watching the Sun every day that it was <span class="highlight">visible</span> for 17 years, looking for <span class="highlight">evidence</span> of a new <span class="highlight">planet</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.16" data-time="149.95">[02:29.95]</span>And he started keeping tracks of sunspots, mapping them, so he wouldn't confuse them, so he wouldn't confuse them with any <span class="highlight">potential</span> new <span class="highlight">planet</span>.<span class="time" data-times="13.71" data-time="156.11">[02:36.11]</span>In the end, there was no <span class="highlight">planet</span>, but there was <span class="highlight">evidence</span> that the number of sunspots increased and decreased in a <span class="highlight">pattern</span>, a <span class="highlight">pattern</span> that began repeating after 10 years, and that was a huge <span class="highlight">breakthrough</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.13" data-time="169.82">[02:49.82]</span>Another <span class="highlight">astronomer</span> named Wolf kept <span class="highlight">track</span> of the Sun for an <span class="highlight">even</span> longer period, 40 years actually.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.89" data-time="177.95">[02:57.95]</span>So Wolf did 40 years of research, and Trobe did 17 years of research. <span class="time" data-times="1.94" data-time="184.84">[03:04.84]</span>I think there is a lesson there. <span class="time" data-times="9.27" data-time="186.78">[03:06.78]</span>Anyway, Wolf went <span class="highlight">through</span> all records from various observatories in Europe and put together a <span class="highlight">history</span> of sunspot observations going back about 100 years. <span class="time" data-times="8.7" data-time="196.05">[03:16.05]</span>From this information, he was able to <span class="highlight">confirm</span> the <span class="highlight">existence</span> of a <span class="highlight">pattern</span>, a repeating <span class="highlight">cycle</span> but Wolf detected an 11-year cycles? <span class="time" data-times="1.12" data-time="204.75">[03:24.75]</span>Not a 10 year <span class="highlight">cycle</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.51" data-time="205.87">[03:25.87]</span>11-year cycles? <span class="time" data-times="3.08" data-time="208.38">[03:28.38]</span>Does that <span class="highlight">sound</span> <span class="highlight">familiar</span> to anyone?

            <span class="time" data-times="4.84" data-time="250.12">[04:10.12]</span>And astronomers did <span class="highlight">eventually</span> <span class="highlight">figure</span> out what sunspots had to do with <span class="highlight">magnetic</span> fields. <span class="time" data-times="2.76" data-time="254.96">[04:14.96]</span>Actually, they are <span class="highlight">magnetic</span> fields. <span class="time" data-times="4.81" data-time="257.72">[04:17.72]</span>And the fact that sunspots are <span class="highlight">magnetic</span> fields accounts for their dark <span class="highlight">appearance</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9.77" data-time="262.53">[04:22.53]</span>That's because <span class="highlight">magnetic</span> fields reduce the <span class="highlight">pressure</span> exerted on the gases inside of them, making the spots cooler than the rest of the Sun's surface. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="272.3">[04:32.30]</span>And since they are cooler, they are darker.</p>

              <p>Lecture is a study of sunspots and explains that this study continues to improve over time. First, the Europeans judged on their own beliefs and then went to Galileo to observe through telescopes. Then challenged the two scholars. After years of research, they discovered that the number of sunspots and the geomagnetic cycle are consistent. The main purpose of Lecture is to say that mankind recognizes sunspots. The evolving process of knowledge. So choose C.</p>

              <p>Pro: When later European astronomers wrote about sunspots, they didn't believe that the spots were actually on the Sun. That's because of their belief at the time that the heavenly bodies, the Sun, Moon, Stars, and Planets, were perfect, Without any flaws or blemishes.</p>
              <p>That's because is a more obvious prompt. The "prejudice" of European astronauts for sunspots stems from their knowledge of celestial bodies. They have always believed that celestial bodies have no flaws. Of course, there can be no black spots on them.</p>

              <p>So Wolf did 40 years of research, and Trobe did 17 years of research. I think there is a lesson there. Anyway, Wolf went though all records from various observatories in Europe and put together a history of sunspot observations going back about 100 years</p>
              <p>This subject mainly listens to tone. The professor read the two scholars' research time in 40 years and 17 years respectively. They all used heavy reading, which shows that he was very impressed with the research time of the two men. The C option is too extreme, and the article does not show that the author is unbelievable about the length of the study. So should choose B.</p>
