and Sweden developed later. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> All four of these countries lagged <span class="highlight">considerably</span> behind in the early nineteenth <span class="highlight">century</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>However, they industrialized rapidly in the <span class="highlight">second</span> half of the <span class="highlight">century</span>,
especially in the last two or three decades. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>In view of their later start and their <span class="highlight">lack</span> of <span class="highlight">coal</span>-undoubtedly the main <span class="highlight">reason</span> they were not among the early industrializers-it is important to 
understand the sources of their success. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p><p>All had small populations. At the beginning of the nineteenth <span class="highlight">century</span>, Denmark and Norway had fewer than 1 million people, while Sweden and the Netherlands had fewer than 2.5 million inhabitants. All exhibited <span class="highlight">moderate</span> growth rates in the <span class="highlight">course</span> of the <span class="highlight">century</span> (Denmark the highest and Sweden the lowest), but all more than doubled in <span class="highlight">population</span> by 1900. Density <span class="highlight">varied</span> greatly. The Netherlands had one of the highest <span class="highlight">population</span> densities in Europe, whereas Norway and Sweden had the lowest Denmark was in between but closer to the Netherlands.</p><p>Considering human capital as a <span class="highlight">characteristic</span> of the <span class="highlight">population</span>, however, all four countries were advantaged by the large percentages of their populations who could read and write. In both 1850 and 1914, the Scandinavian countries had the highest <span class="highlight">literacy</span> rates in Europe, or in the world, and the Netherlands was well above the European <span class="highlight">average</span>. This fact was of <span class="highlight">enormous</span> value in helping the national economies find their niches in the evolving currents of the international <span class="highlight">economy</span>.</p><p>Location was an important <span class="highlight">factor</span> for all four countries. All had <span class="highlight">immediate</span><span class="highlight">access</span> to the sea, and this had important implications for a <span class="highlight">significant</span> international <span class="highlight">resource</span>, fish, as well as for cheap <span class="highlight">transport</span>, <span class="highlight">merchant</span> marines, and the shipbuilding <span class="highlight">industry</span>. Each took <span class="highlight">advantage</span> of these opportunities in its own way. The people of the Netherlands, with a long tradition of fisheries and <span class="highlight">mercantile</span> shipping, had difficulty in developing good harbors <span class="highlight">suitable</span> for steamships: <span class="highlight">eventually</span> they did so at Rotterdam and Amsterdam, with <span class="highlight"><span class="question5">exceptional</span></span> results for <span class="highlight">transit</span><span class="highlight">trade</span> with Germany and central Europe and for the processing of <span class="highlight">overseas</span> foodstuffs and <span class="highlight">raw</span> materials (sugar, tobacco, chocolate, <span class="highlight">grain</span>, and <span class="highlight">eventually</span> oil). Denmark also had an admirable <span class="highlight">commercial</span><span class="highlight">history</span>, particularly with <span class="highlight">respect</span> to traffic <span class="highlight">through</span> the <span class="highlight">Sound</span> (the <span class="highlight">strait</span> separating Denmark and Sweden). In 1857, in return for a payment of 63 million kronor from other <span class="highlight">commercial</span> nations, Denmark <span class="question6">abolished</span> the <span class="highlight">Sound</span> toll dues the fees it had collected since 1497 for the use of the <span class="highlight">Sound</span>. This, <span class="highlight">along</span> with other <span class="highlight">policy</span> shifts toward free <span class="highlight">trade</span>, resulted in a <span class="highlight">significant</span> increase in traffic <span class="highlight">through</span> the <span class="highlight">Sound</span> and in the port of Copenhagen.</p><p>The <span class="highlight">political</span> institutions of the four countries posed no <span class="highlight">significant</span> barriers to <span class="highlight">industrialization</span> or <span class="highlight">economic</span> growth. The nineteenth <span class="highlight">century</span> passed <span class="highlight">relatively</span> peacefully for these countries, with <span class="highlight"><span class="question8">progressive</span></span> democratization taking place in all of them. They were reasonably well governed, without <span class="highlight">notable</span> corruption or grandiose <span class="highlight">state</span> projects, although in all of them the <span class="highlight">government</span> gave some aid to railways, and in Sweden the <span class="highlight">state</span> built the main lines. As small countries dependent on foreign markets, they followed a liberal <span class="highlight">trade</span><span class="highlight">policy</span> in the main, though <span class="question9">a protectionist movement developed in Sweden.</span> In Denmark and Sweden agricultural reforms took place <span class="highlight">gradually</span> from the late eighteenth <span class="highlight">century</span><span class="highlight">through</span> the first half of the nineteenth, resulting in a new class of peasant landowners with a <span class="highlight">definite</span><span class="highlight">market</span><span class="highlight">orientation</span>.</p><p><span class="question10">The key <span class="highlight">factor</span> in the success of these countries (<span class="highlight">along</span> with high <span class="highlight">literacy</span>, which contributed to it) was their <span class="highlight">ability</span> to <span class="highlight">adapt</span> to the international <span class="highlight">division</span> of labor <span class="highlight">determined</span> by the early industrializers and to <span class="highlight">stake</span> out areas of <span class="highlight">specialization</span> in international markets for which they were especially well suited.</span> This meant a great dependence on international <span class="highlight">commerce</span>, which had <span class="highlight">notorious</span> fluctuations; but it also meant high returns to those factors of production that were fortunate enough to be well placed in times of <span class="highlight">prosperity</span>. In Sweden exports accounted for 18 percent of the national income in 1870, and in 1913, 22 percent of a much larger national income. In the early twentieth <span class="highlight">century</span>, Denmark exported 63 percent of its agricultural production: <span class="highlight">butter</span>, pork products, and eggs. It exported 80 percent of its <span class="highlight">butter</span>, almost all to Great Britain, where it accounted for 40 percent of British <span class="highlight">butter</span> imports.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Paragraph 1 supports which of the following ideas about England and Germany?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They were completely industrialized by the start of the nineteenth century.</p><p>B. They possessed plentiful supplies of coal.</p><p>C. They were overtaken economically by the Netherlands and Scandinavia during the early nineteenth century.</p><p>D. They succeeded for the same reasons that the Netherlands and Scandinavia did.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B. Note that there is no obvious keyword for this question. England and Germany cannot be used because they are related to the topic. Therefore, the exclusion method is used. A start of the 19th century does keyword positioning to the second sentence, saying that it is relatively backward, A and C are all the opposite; B's coal keyword positioning to the last sentence, the original said that there is no coal so the Nordic countries did not realize industrialization very early That is, the early realization of industrialization in the United Kingdom and Germany had coal, so B was correct; D was the opposite of the first sentence of the original text and was not chosen.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Paragraph 2 suggests which of the following about the importance of population density in the industrialization of the Netherlands and Scandinavia?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It was a more important factor than population size.</p><p>B. It was more influential than the rate of population growth.</p><p>C. It was more important in the early stages than it was later.</p><p>D. It was not a significant factor.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D population density is targeted to the last two sentences of the second paragraph. It is said that the density of population changes greatly and Denmark is the smallest in Sweden. However, the reason why they all achieved industrialization and industrialization is the same, so density is not important and D is correct. There is no comparison in the original, so no other answer is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraphs 2 and 3, which of the following contributed significantly to the successful economic development of the Netherlands and of Scandinavia?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The relatively small size of their populations</p><p>B. The rapid rate at which their populations were growing</p><p>C. The large amount of capital they had available for investment</p><p>D. The high proportion of their citizens who were educated</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D. Use economic development as a key word to position the last sentence of the third paragraph. Say this fact helps economic development because there are pronouns. So look at the previous sentence. The preceding sentence says that the Nordic countries have the highest literacy rates in Europe and even in the world. It should be education level to help economic development, so the answer is D. A's size, B's rate, and C's investment did not say anything.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, because of their location, the Netherlands and the Scandinavian countries had all of the following advantages when they began to industrialize EXCEPT</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. low-cost transportation of goods</p><p>B. access to fish</p><p>C. shipbuilding industries</p><p>D. military control of the sea</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D EXCEPT questions, exclusion. A's transportation, B's fish and C's shipbuilding can be targeted to the second sentence, so they are all correct, and they are not selected; only D has no corresponding points in the original text, wrong, and selection.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question5">exceptional</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. extraordinary</p><p>B. surprising</p><p>C. immediate</p><p>D. predictable</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" A"><p>A <span class="question5">exceptional</span>: Excellent, outstanding, <span class="question5">exceptional</span>. A is extraordinary and special; B is surprising; C is immediate; D is predictable. So A's extraordinary is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question6">abolished</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. ended</p><p>B. raised</p><p>C. returned</p><p>D. lowered</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" A"><p>A abolish: Abort, interrupt. A is the end; B is caused, put forward; C is returned, return; D is lower. So A's end is the correct answer.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 5, each of the following contributed positively to the industrialization of the Netherlands and Scandinavia EXCEPT</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. generally liberal trade policies</p><p>B. huge projects undertaken by the state</p><p>C. relatively uncorrupt governments</p><p>D. relatively little social or political disruption</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B EXCEPT questions, exclusion, A's liberal trade policies do keyword positioning to the penultimate sentence, so A correct, not selected; B's huge projects do keyword positioning to the third sentence, the original said there is no state projects, so B To say the opposite, choose; the same sentence shows that C is correct, not selected; D's little disruption is targeted to the second sentence of the relatively peacefully, so D is correct, not selected.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question8">progressive</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. rapid</p><p>B. partial</p><p>C. increasing</p><p>D. individual</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" C"><p>C <span class="question8">progressive</span>: advanced, <span class="question8">progressive</span>. A is fast; B is partial; C is incremental, <span class="question8">progressive</span>; D is personal, individual, individual. So C's rising is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The author includes the information that "<span class="highlight">a protectionist movement developed in Sweden</span>" in order to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. support the claim that the political institutions of the four countries posed no significant barriers to industrialization or economic growth</p><p>B. identify an exception to the general trend favoring liberal trade policy</p><p>C. explain why Sweden industrialized less quickly than the other Scandinavian countries and Netherlands</p><p>D. provide evidence that agricultural reforms take place more quickly in countries that have a liberal trade policy than in those that do not</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="a protectionist movement developed in Sweden B"><p>The topic of rhetoric, first look at the sentence where the rhetorical point, said that as a small country, the Nordic countries usually implement a more open trade policy, but Sweden is pursuing protectionism, that is to say, the author wrote an exception, so the answer is B, many people After seeing the central sentence of this paragraph, A was selected. Note that A is wrong because protectionism in Sweden is actually setting up obstacles, so A is negative and C and D do not say anything.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The early industrializes controlled most of the international economy, leaving these countries to stake out new areas of specialization along the margins.</p><p>B. Aided by their high literacy rates these countries were able to claim key areas of specialization within established international markets.</p><p>C. High literacy rates enabled these countries to take over international markets and adapt the international division of labor to suit their strengths.</p><p>D. The international division of labor established by the early industrializers was suited to these countries, a key factor in their success.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The main logic of B's sentence is juxtaposition. The main factors that the trunk says are: 1) adapting to international division of labor; 2) opening up professional fields. So B is correct. A's stake out new areas did not say, the original said areas of specialization; C's take over the original did not say; D said, it should be these countries to adapt to the labor market, not the labor market to adapt to these countries.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 6, a major problem with depending heavily on international markets was that they</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. lacked stability</p><p>B. were not well suited to agricultural products</p><p>C. were largely controlled by the early industrializers</p><p>D. led to slower growth of local industries</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A. With the keyword positioning in the international market to the second sentence, there is a huge fluctuation in the international commerce, so the correct answer is that A lacks stability. The remaining three answers did not say.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 6, what advantage could a country gain from being heavily involved in international commerce?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. A steadily rising national income</p><p>B. Greater control over market fluctuations</p><p>C. High returns when things went well</p><p>D. A reduced need for imports</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C or the international market to do keyword positioning to the second sentence, the question asked the international commerce what is the problem, this question asked what benefits, the second sentence of the latter half of a sudden but, indicating that the previous say is not good to say well, Say return rate is high, so the answer is C, others did not say.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>During this period, Sweden had the highest rate of growth of output per capita of any country in Europe, and Denmark was second..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C. A transition point, this period indicates that there must be a period of time before the correct insertion point, and there are only B and C for the time, but the subsequent after B properly indicates the transition between the two sentences before and after the insertion point, emphasizing that In the latter half of the century they developed rapidly, so they did not insert any sentence; and the insert sentence said highest rate of growth, and the previous sentence of point B was legback.
