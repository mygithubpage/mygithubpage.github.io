          <h4 class="w3-center">Lightning</h4>
          <p>
            <span class="highlight">Lightning</span> is a <span class="highlight">brilliant</span> <span class="highlight">flash</span> of light produced by an electrical <span class="highlight">discharge</span> from a storm cloud. The electrical <span class="highlight">discharge</span> takes place when the <span class="highlight">attractive</span> <span class="highlight">tension</span> between a <span class="highlight">region</span> of negatively charged particles and a <span class="highlight">region</span> of positively charged particles becomes so great that the charged particles suddenly <span class="highlight">rush</span> together. The coming together of the oppositely charged particles neutralizes the electrical <span class="highlight">tension</span> and releases a <span class="highlight"><span class="question2">tremendous</span></span> <span class="highlight">amount</span> of energy, which we see as <span class="highlight">lightning</span>. The separation of positively and negatively charged particles takes place during the <span class="highlight">development</span> of the storm cloud.</p>
          <p>The separation of charged particles that forms in a storm cloud has a sandwich-like structure. Concentrations of positively charged particles develop at the top and bottom of the cloud, but the middle <span class="highlight">region</span> becomes negatively charged. Recent measurements made in the <span class="highlight">field</span> together with <span class="highlight">laboratory</span> simulations <span class="highlight">offer</span> a <span class="highlight">promising</span> explanation of how this structure of charged particles forms. What happens is that small (millimeter-to centimeter-size) pellets of ice form in the cold upper regions of the cloud. When these ice pellets fall, some of them <span class="highlight">strike</span> much smaller ice crystals in the center of the cloud. The <span class="highlight">temperature</span> at the center of the cloud is about -15? or <span class="highlight">lower</span>. At such temperatures, the <span class="highlight">collision</span> between the ice pellets and the ice crystals causes electrical charges to <span class="highlight">shift</span> so that the ice pellets <span class="highlight"><span class="question4">acquire</span></span> a <span class="highlight">negative</span> charge and the ice crystals become positively charged. Then <span class="highlight">updraft</span> wind currents carry the light, positively charged ice crystals up to the top of the cloud. The heavier negatively charged ice pellets are left to <span class="highlight">concentrate</span> in the center. This <span class="highlight">process</span> explains why the top of the cloud becomes positively charged, while the center becomes negatively charged. The negatively charged <span class="highlight">region</span> is large: several hundred meters thick and several kilometers in <span class="highlight">diameter</span>. Below this large, cold, negatively charged <span class="highlight">region</span>, the cloud is warmer than -15?, and at these temperatures, collisions between ice crystals and falling ice pellets produce positively charged ice pellets that then <span class="highlight">populate</span> a small <span class="highlight">region</span> at the <span class="highlight">base</span> of the cloud.</p>
          <p>Most <span class="highlight">lightning</span> takes place <span class="highlight">within</span> a cloud when the charge separation <span class="highlight">within</span> the cloud collapses. However, as the storm cloud develops, the ground <span class="highlight">beneath</span> the cloud becomes positively charged and <span class="highlight">lightning</span> can take place in the form of an electrical <span class="highlight">discharge</span> between the <span class="highlight">negative</span> charge of the cloud and the positively charged ground. <span class="question8"><span class="highlight">Lightning</span> that strikes the ground is the most likely to be <span class="highlight">destructive</span></span>, so <span class="highlight">even</span> though it represents only 20 percent of all <span class="highlight">lightning</span>, it has received a lot of <span class="highlight">scientific</span> <span class="highlight">attention</span>.</p>
          <p>Using high-speed <span class="highlight">photography</span>, scientists have <span class="highlight">determined</span> that there are two steps to the <span class="highlight">occurrence</span> of <span class="highlight">lightning</span> from a cloud to the ground. First, a <span class="highlight">channel</span>, or <span class="highlight">path</span>, is formed that connects the cloud and the ground. Then a strong <span class="highlight">current</span> of electrons follows that <span class="highlight">path</span> from the cloud to the ground, and it is that <span class="highlight">current</span> that <span class="question9">illuminates</span> the <span class="highlight">channel</span> as the <span class="highlight">lightning</span> we see.</p>
          <p>The <span class="highlight">formation</span> of the <span class="highlight">channel</span> is <span class="question12">initiated</span> when electrons <span class="highlight">surge</span> from the cloud <span class="highlight">base</span> toward the ground. When a <span class="highlight">stream</span> of these negatively charged electrons comes <span class="highlight">within</span> 
100 meters of the ground it is met by a <span class="highlight">stream</span> of positively charged particles that comes up from the ground. When the negatively and positively charged streams meet, 
a complete <span class="highlight">channel</span> connecting the cloud and the ground is formed. The <span class="highlight">channel</span> is only a few centimeters in <span class="highlight">diameter</span>, but that is wide enough for electrons to follow the 
<span class="highlight">channel</span> to the ground in the <span class="highlight">visible</span> form of a <span class="highlight">flash</span> of <span class="highlight">lightning</span>. The <span class="highlight">stream</span> of <span class="highlight">positive</span> particles that meets the <span class="highlight">surge</span> of electrons from the cloud often arises from a 
tall <span class="highlight">pointed</span> structure such as a metal flagpole or a tower. That is why the <span class="highlight">subsequent</span> <span class="highlight">lightning</span> that follows the completed <span class="highlight">channel</span> often strikes a tall structure. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span></p>
          <p>Once a <span class="highlight">channel</span> has been formed, it is usually used by several <span class="highlight">lightning</span> discharges, each of them consisting of a <span class="highlight">stream</span> of electrons from the cloud meeting a 
<span class="highlight">stream</span> of <span class="highlight">positive</span> particles <span class="highlight">along</span> the established <span class="highlight">path</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>Sometimes, however, a <span class="highlight">stream</span> of electrons following an established <span class="highlight">channel</span> is met by a <span class="highlight">positive</span> <span class="highlight">stream</span> making 
a new <span class="highlight">path</span> up from the ground. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>The result is a forked <span class="highlight">lightning</span> that strikes the ground in two places. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p>

Conversely, particles with negative charge are heavy, so they do not come up. So the answer is C. The original only stated the temperature in the middle and the lower part. The upper temperature had no information, so A was wrong. From the fourth sentence of the countdown, we can see that the middle part was negatively charged, and B said it was the opposite; the D text did not say either.</p>

A's diameter of the channel and centimeter do keyword positioning to the fourth sentence, but the original text has no information to launch widen, so A mistakes; B's number is targeted to the second sentence, saying that the positive and negative charges within 100 meters will touch To, so B goes against; C's path is targeted to the channel of the last sentence, saying that the positive charge usually rises from a high point on the ground, such as a flagpole, and then the lightning reaches the ground by the path, ie the height of the flagpole The building is part of this channel, so C said building decided that the path is correct; there is no information on the first occurrence of D.</p>
