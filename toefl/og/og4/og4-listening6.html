<span class="time" data-times="5.8" data-time="102.35">[01:42.35]</span>Well, that first touch of ice apparently triggers a biological <span class="highlight">response</span> inside the frog. <span class="time" data-times="16.82" data-time="108.15">[01:48.15]</span>That first of all starts drawing water away from the center of its body, so the middle part of the frog, its <span class="highlight">internal</span> organs, its heart, lungs, liver, these start getting drier and drier while the water that's being pulled away is forming a <span class="highlight">puddle</span> around the organs just <span class="highlight">underneath</span> the skin. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="3" data-time="124.97">[02:04.97]</span>And then that <span class="highlight">puddle</span> of water starts to <span class="highlight">freeze</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.63" data-time="127.97">[02:07.97]</span>OK, up to known, the frog's heart is still beating, right?

</p><p><span class="time" data-times="11.66" data-time="229.33">[03:49.33]</span>Professor: Well, hmm, we really don't know a lot about how long a wood frog <span class="highlight">normally</span> lives, probably just a few years but there is no <span class="highlight">evidence</span> its <span class="highlight">longevity</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.45" data-time="240.99">[04:00.99]</span>It does have some other impacts though. <span class="time" data-times="6.84" data-time="243.44">[04:03.44]</span>In studies, we found that when it comes to <span class="highlight">reproduction</span>, freezing diminishes the mating performance of males. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.25" data-time="250.28">[04:10.28]</span>After they've been frozen and thawed of <span class="highlight">course</span>, they don't <span class="highlight">seem</span> quite as <span class="highlight">vocal</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.91" data-time="255.53">[04:15.53]</span>They move slower and they <span class="highlight">seem</span> to have a harder time recognizing a <span class="highlight">potential</span><span class="highlight">mate</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="260.44">[04:20.44]</span>So if the <span class="highlight">male</span> frog could <span class="highlight">manage</span> not to go <span class="highlight">through</span> this freezing <span class="highlight">cycle</span>, he'd probably have more success in mating. </p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the main purpose of the lecture?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To explain the biological advantages of a physical change that occurs in North American wood frogs.</p><p>B. To explain why the North American wood frog's habitat range has expanded.</p><p>C. To describe the functioning of the circulatory system of the North American wood frog.</p><p>D. To introduce students to an unusual phenomenon affecting North American wood frogs.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>Subject themes are relatively simple, the entire lecture is said to have a magical winter phenomenon in North American wood frog, that is, the heartbeat stopped, but they are also alive. Then talk about the principle of this phenomenon and the effect of this phenomenon. The answer is clear, choose D.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor first mention the arrival of spring?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To encourage students to look for thawing wood frogs.</p><p>B. To point out the time period when frogs begin mating.</p><p>C. To explain why the class will soon be doing experiments with wood frogs.</p><p>D. To emphasize the speed of the thawing process.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>So before we close today, I thought I'd mention a biological event that's a part of the transition from winter to spring , something you can go outside and watch if you have some patience</p><p>The professor said that spring is coming to bring out a seasonal change in North American wood frog, from freeze to thawing. Select A.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What happens to a wood frog as it begins to freeze?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Blood is concentrated in the center of its body.</p><p>B. Blood stops producing sugar.</p><p>C. Water moves out of its internal organs.</p><p>D. Water from just beneath the skin begins to evaporate.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>That first of all starts drawing water away from the center of its body, so the middle part of the frog, its internal organs, its heart, lungs, liver, these start getting drier and drier while the water that's being pulling away is forming a Puddle around the organs just underneath the skin.</p><p>When wood frog touched the ice, freeze activity officially began. The first is the removal of water from internal organs. Obviously, the answer is C.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>What are two points the professor makes about the thawing process of the wood frog?Click on 2 answers.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The thawing process is not fully understood.</p><p>B. The thawing process takes longer than the freezing process.</p><p>C. The frog's internal organs thaw before its outer skin thaws.</p><p>D. Thawing occurs when the frog's heart begins pumping glucose through its body.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="AC"><p>Well, we are not sure actually, the clearer thing is even though the sun is warning the frog up on the outside, its inside thaw out first, the heart and brain and everything. But somehow it all just happens that way every spring(A )</p><p>That first of all starts drawing water away from the center of its body, so the middle part of the frog, its internal organs, its heart, lungs, liver, these start getting drier and drier while the water that's being pulling away is forming a Puddle around the organs just underneath the skin. And then that puddle of water starts to freeze. (C)</p><p>The process of thawing is not fully understood because the professor said not sure. The professor is definitely thawing inside the wood frog. So answer choose A and C.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What impact does freezing have on some thawed wood frogs?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It increases their reproductive success.</p><p>B. It decreases their life span.</p><p>C. It causes them to be more vocal and active.</p><p>D. It reduces their ability to recognize potential mates.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>They move slower and they seem to have a harder time recognizing a potential mate.</p><p>The professor said that the effect of freeze is to reduce male frog's mating ability. Same as option D.</p></div></div><div class="replay" id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor imply when she says this:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. She wants the student to clarify his question.</p><p>B. She wants the student to draw his own conclusions.</p><p>C. She thinks the student does not understand how car antifreeze works.</p><p>D. She thinks the student has misunderstood her point.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Student: A solution of antifreeze like you put in your car in the winter? Professor: Well, you tell me. In frogs, the extra glucose makes it harder for the winter inside the cells to freeze. So the cells stay just slightly wet, Enough so that they can survive the winter. Then after that, the heart stops beating altogether. So is that the same?</p><p>Just tell me you can not choose the answer. The Professor said a bunch of words to guide students in distinguishing the difference between the physiological phenomenon of woodfrog's antifreeze and put the car in the winter. The purpose is to allow students to conclusion based on her tips. Answer selection B</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
