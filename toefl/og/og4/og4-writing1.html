No one is sure exactly what caused the decline, but chances are good that if nothing is done, Torreya will soon become extinct. Experts are considering three ways to address the decline of Torreya. The first option is to reestablish Torreya in the same location in which it thrived for thousands of years. Torreya used to be found in abundance in the northern part of Florida, which has a specific microclimate. A microclimate exists when weather conditions inside a relatively small area differ from the region of which that area is a part. Northern Florida's microclimate is very favorable to Torreya's growth. This microclimate is wetter and cooler than the surrounding region's relatively dry, warm climate. Scientists have been working to plant Torreya seeds in the coolest, dampest areas of the microclimate. The second option is to move Torreya to an entirely different location, far from its Florida microclimate. Torreya seeds and saplings have been successfully planted and grown in forests further north, where the temperature is significantly cooler. Some scientists believe that Torreya probably thrived in areas much further north in the distant past, so by relocating it now, in a process known as assisted migration, humans would simply be helping Torreya return to an environment that is more suited to its survival. The third option is to preserve Torreya in research centers. Seeds and saplings can be moved from the wild and preserved in a closely monitored environment where it will be easier for scientists both to protect the species and conduct research on Torreya. This research can then be used to ensure the continued survival of the species. </p></article><div><audio src="og4-writing1.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></div><article id="listening-passage" class="passage"><h3>Listening Text</h3><p>You've just read about three ways to save Torreya taxifolia. Unfortunately, none of these three options provides a satisfactory solution.About the first solution-reestablishing Torreya in the same location-that's unlikely to be successful, because of what's happening to the coolest dampest areas within torreya's micro-climate. These areas are being strongly affected by changes in the climate of the larger region. This could be because global warming has contributed to an increase in overall temperatures in the region or because wetlands throughout Florida have been drained. Either way, many areas across the region are becoming drier, so it's unlikely that Torreya would have the conditions it needs to survive anywhere within its original Florida micro-climate.Now about the second solution, relocating Torreya far from where it currently grows, well, let's look at what happened when humans helped another tree, the black locust tree, move north to a new environment. When they did this, the black locust tree spread so quickly that it killed off many plants and trees in the new environment, and some of these plants and trees were themselves already in danger of becoming extinct. So assisted migration can have unpredicted outcomes for the new environment.Third, research centers are probably not a solution either. That's because the population of Torreya trees that can be kept in the centers will probably not be able to resist diseases. For a population of trees to survive a disease, it needs to be relatively large and it needs to be genetically diverse. Tree populations in the wild usually satisfy those criteria but research centers would simply not have enough capacity to keep a large and diverse population of Torreya trees, so trees in such centers will not be capable of surviving diseases in the long term. </p></article><section id="question"><h4>Question</h4><p>Summarize the points made in the lecture, being sure to explain how they cast doubt on specific solutions presented reading passage.</p></section><section><h5>Point Made in the Reading Passage</h5><p>Human organ donors gain nothing from their action.</p><p>Sentinel meerkats go without food to stand guard.</p><p>Sentinel meerkats place themselves in danger from predators.</p><h5>Contrasting Point from the Lecture</h5><p>The donors receive appreciation and approval from the rest of society.</p><p>Sentinels actually eat before the other meerkats.</p><p>Sentinels are actually the first to escape the predators.</p></section><article class="response w3-hide"><h5>Score 5 Essay</h5><p>The lecture completely refutes the passage. It is said in the lecture that, the perceived acts of altruism are nothing more than sneaky methods of gaining advantage for one’s self.Contrary to the belief in the passage that sentinels risk their lives for the cause of the whole group, the professor says that the meerkat sentinels are in fact less prone to outside threats. The alarm sentinels give off causes to group to move rashly which draws the predators attention towards them, thus drawing away the attention from the sentinels. The lecture refutes the fact that these meerkats are altruistic in the sense that they gain nothing in exchange of their services. In fact, researches have shown that they have a full stomach as they perform this “altruistic” duty and have a better chance of escaping from danger because they witness it ifrst Proffesor also offers a different underlying motivation that causes people to believe that acts such as donating an organ or sharing food with someone in need are altruistic. She says that people gain appreciation as a result of such acts, which may be deemed by some much more important than materialistic gains.</p><h5>Rater Comments</h5><p>This answer meets all the criteria for a level 5 response to an integrated task. The writer does a good job of selecting, framing, and interweaving points from the lecture and reading, explicitly and ﬂuently presenting accurate connections between the relevant points. All three points made by the lecturer are included. Language is used accurately and effectively, and the overall piece is well organized. </p></article><article class="response w3-hide"><h5>Score 4 Essay</h5><p>Baed on the lecture, meerkats actually do not sacriﬁce themself by becoming a sentinel. Firstly, the meerkats that become a sentinel usually eats before. Secondly, these meerkats usually standing guard near their burrows. As a result, when a predator is seen, they raise an alarm and reach a safe place before the other meerkats that hunt for food. This shows that these meerkats do not put themselves in danger. In fact, the lecturer warned that the the alarm raised by these meerkats could be harmfull for the other meerkats. One of the reason is that the responses of the other meerkats to the alarm might attract attention from the predator. Based on these reasons, meerkats can not be used as an example of a mammal that performs altruistic behavior.</p><p>The lecture also pointed out that, it is not always true that individuals performing altruistic acts gain nothings for themselves. For example, when a man give one of his/her kidney to a family member or even a stranger, his/her selfworth increase. He/she feels usefull for other people. Therefore, he/she gain something from his/her action. </p><p>In sum, altruism behavior in animal and human is questioned. It is difﬁcult for individuals sacriﬁcies its own interest without gain anything for themselves. </p><h5>Rater Comments</h5><p>This response includes all the main points of the lecture. The ﬁrst paragraph begins with a clear statement that sentinel meerkats do not sacriﬁce themselves. There are strong concluding statements in each of the ﬁrst two paragraphs that are quite explicit about the import of the sentinel behavior and the organ donation. The connections to the reading could be stronger. The writer says that the sentinel meerkat “eats before,” but does not make an explicit contrast to the passage that says that sentinel meerkats go without eating. The conclusion in the ﬁnal paragraph is vague (“altruism . . . is questioned”). On balance then, this response is a level 4, with minor vagueness and omission. In terms of language, there are a number of minor errors: “themself,” missing verb in the sentence beginning “Secondly,” “One of the reason,” “a man give,” “It is difﬁcult for individuals sacriﬁcies.” </p></article><article class="response w3-hide"><h5>Score 3 Essay</h5><p>The question which is asked is to know if the apparition of a professor on television is a good or a bad think? On this point, the text and the lecture completely disagree.</p><p>First, we can think that it is a good thing for the professors themselves. It seems to be something logical because today a lot of people want to be known and the television is perhaps the best thing to be known. But what the lecture say is that such a professor don’t have a good reputation. People think they are not very serious when they pass on television. The effect is that they are no more invited to important conferences.</p><p>In what concerned the students and the university, the text shows the facts that some of these apparitions can bring some donation to the university, what is very good. But in the other hand according to the lecture, this professor spend a lot of time travelling and during that time, he isn’t available for the students or for the researches and the university lose therefore some money.</p><p>Finally for the public himself, they could learn some interesting things and it could be a very big chance because a lot of these persons haven’t had the chance going in the university. But it is true that such intervention isn’t often best as something that a journalist could prepare.</p><h5>Rater Comments</h5><p>The writer organizes the response fairly well. After a brief introduction, each reading passage point is briefly summarized and then followed by ideas from the related point in the lecture. However, the response earns a score of 3 because the writer’s summaries of the lecture suffer from several problems. There is imprecision (the idea that “people” rather than fellow academics think the professor appearing on television is not serious); there is omission (the idea that television networks are not interested in in-depth lectures is missing); and there is poor connection of ideas (the idea that a university loses “some money” is not connected to the idea that television appearances take away from professors’ time at the university). Most importantly, there are lapses of clarity due to the writer’s poor language control. Errors in word choice (“pass on television,” “intervention isn’t often best as something”) obscure meaning to such an extent that the lecturer’s response to the first point is conveyed only vaguely, and the response to the last point is completely unclear. Although the writer of this response may have had a good grasp of many ideas he or she wanted to write about, he or she failed to communicate those ideas clearly to the reader. </p></article><h4>Sample Response</h4><div id="responses"><article class="response"></article></div><article><p>The professor in the lecture totally disagrees with the three solutions mentioned in the reading passage. In fact, she believes that these solutions won't lead to satisfactory consequences at all.</p><p>Firstly, the professor mentions that help the Torreya reestablish in its original habitat is unlikely to success. She claims that the coolest and dampest area of the microclimate is strongly influenced by many worldwide climate effects such as the global warming, thus it is impossible for Torreya to thrive again in the same place. This strongly opposes the first method in the reading passage.</p><p>Secondly,  the  professor  claims  that  moving  Torreya  to  a  totally  different  location  is  also unrealistic. She takes Black Locus as an example. Black Locus thrives quickly after entering a new habitat and endangers many scarce species. The professor points out the disastrous consequence and opposes the second method raised in the reading passage.</p><p>Last but not least, the professor claims that keeping Terroya in research center won't be a good method either. Trees preserved in the center cannot resist diseases in the long run. The professor again opposes the last method in the reading passage.</p></article></main></body></html>
