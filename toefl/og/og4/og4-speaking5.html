I wrote it last night, but I forgot to bring it us me.</p><p>(woman) Uh-oh, so what are you gonna do?</p><p>(man) Well, I could drive home and get it, I live off campus, but if I hurry, I'd probably get home and bring the paper back before class was over. You know how strict she is about late submissions.</p><p>(woman) Yeah, but you'd miss part of the class.</p><p>(man) I know!</p><p>(woman) Maybe you could talk to the professor, explain what happened and ask her if you could send it later by email.</p><p>(man) I know, but, I'd have to do it after class cause she always starts class right on time. There wouldn't be time to talk to her until after class.</p><p>(woman) Well, why don't you do that and hope she doesn't consider the paper late?</p></article><section id="question"><h4>Question</h4><p>Briefly summarize the problem the speakers are discussing. Then state which solution you would recommend. Explain the reasons for your recommendation. </p></section><section><h5>Important Points</h5><p>Under the broad definition, money is anything that can be used as payment (as a medium of exchange), e.g., coins/bills and barter. If you take a taxi ride, you could use vegetables as payment for the cab ride. Under a narrower definition, money is anything that must be accepted as payment (legal tender). In the United States, coins and bills are legal tender. A taxi driver must accept coins and bills as payment for the taxi ride. Vegetables and credit cards are not legal tender in the United States, so the taxi driver does not have to accept these as payment.</p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>Well, the man's problem is that he finished his paper but forgot to take it with him today. Accordingly, he believes that he could drive home because he lives off campus. The woman suggests that the man talk to the professor and ask for a later copy of his paper by email. Well I guess talking to the professor would be a better solution for the man's problem for two main reasons. Firstly, the man did get the paper done, and asking for extension wouldn't be unfair for other students. Considering his attitude it's quite understandable to be a few hours late. Second, fetching his paper at the cost of being late for most of the class is definitely not worthy. After all, it's the class that matters to the students not the due date of paper itself. So, I guess talking to the professor about the problem would be a better solution for the man.

She speaks a little too quickly at times, but the overall meaning is not lost. Her words and ideas flow easily from one idea to the next. She uses complex grammatical structures and a wide range of vocabulary. The speaker fluently summarizes the stimulus accurately recounting the broad and narrow definition. Her response is detailed and sustained. She spends too much time summarizing the first definition and example, so she does not fully explain the second definition and example. However, it is obvious from the apparent ease in which she speaks that she understands the concept and is able to talk about it.</p><p><b>Play Audio Track 123 to hear a mid-level response for Question 1.</b></p><p><audio src="test_4_123.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></p><p><b>Rater’s Comments</b></p><p>The speaker’s pronunciation is generally clear. She sustains speech and continues to try to elaborate her ideas. The hesitance and choppiness indicates a lack of control of vocabulary and grammar. This significantly affects the overall intelligibility of the response. She conveys some relevant details including an almost accurate summary of both definitions of money. However, her response is clearly incomplete. The speaker’s struggle to find the right words to convey her ideas prevents her from efficiently using her time. Neither of the examples is included in the response. Most of her ideas are underdeveloped.</p></div></main></body></html>
