        <h3>Listening Text</h3>
        <article>
          <p>Listen to part of a lecture in a business class.</p>
          <p>People who are likely to buy a company's product are called target customers and these target customers influence a company's marketing strategy. In order to develop a marketing strategy, a company would look at certain characteristics of target customers to decide when and where to advertise, so that they'll reach the target customers most effectively. I'd like to talk to you today about two characteristics of target customers that can influence marketing strategy, specifically age and geographic location of target customers.Say a company makes toy cars, who are its target customers? Kids, right? So if a company wants to make sure its television advertising reaches its target customers, it'd want to advertise during times when kids are actually watching television, like during children's television shows. That way it can make sure that kids see the advertisements and that way the company will get people in that age group to go buy toy cars or to ask their parents to buy them, at least. Now, another important characteristic to consider is geographic location, places where the company's target customers live. Think about a company that makes boats. Its target customers are people who own homes near oceans or lakes, places where they can use boats, after all, people who don't live near water don't have much use for boats. So by placing advertisement on signs along the road or on television in cities and towns that are near oceans or lakes, the company would be more likely to reach the target customers for its boats and sell more of them as a result.</p>

          <h5>Important Points</h5>
          <p>Under the broad definition, money is anything that can be used as payment (as a medium of exchange), e.g., coins/bills and barter. If you take a taxi ride, you could use vegetables as payment for the cab ride. Under a narrower definition, money is anything that must be accepted as payment (legal tender). In the United States, coins and bills are legal tender. A taxi driver must accept coins and bills as payment for the taxi ride. Vegetables and credit cards are not legal tender in the United States, so the taxi driver does not have to accept these as payment.</p>

          <p><b>Rater’s Comments</b></p>
          <p>The speaker’s pronunciation and intonation are highly intelligible. She speaks a little too quickly at times, but the overall meaning is not lost. Her words and ideas flow easily from one idea to the next. She uses complex grammatical structures and a wide range of vocabulary. The speaker fluently summarizes the stimulus accurately recounting the broad and narrow definition. Her response is detailed and sustained. She spends too much time summarizing the first definition and example, so she does not fully explain the second definition and example. However, it is obvious from the apparent ease in which she speaks that she understands the concept and is able to talk about it.</p>

          <p><b>Rater’s Comments</b></p>
          <p>The speaker’s pronunciation is generally clear. She sustains speech and continues to try to elaborate her ideas. The hesitance and choppiness indicates a lack of control of vocabulary and grammar. This significantly affects the overall intelligibility of the response. She conveys some relevant details including an almost accurate summary of both definitions of money. However, her response is clearly incomplete. The speaker’s struggle to find the right words to convey her ideas prevents her from efficiently using her time. Neither of the examples is included in the response. Most of her ideas are underdeveloped.</p>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>There're two major characteristics of target customers that influence marketing strategy for products. The first one is age. For example, a toy car company tends to put their advertisements during children's TV show so that they're more likely to be viewed by children and their parents, which are the target customers for the company. If the children see the commercial, they'll probably ask their parents to buy the toy for them. Another is geographical location, that's where the target customers live. A boat company will not release ads in cities and towns that are far away from waters, but rather in places near seas or lakes, because people in those places have the need for a boat and the company will be able to maximize its sales.
