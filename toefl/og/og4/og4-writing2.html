      <p>Every young adults will grow and live apart from their parents to form their own families. The ages for those young adults to be independent depends on each person. Some people may have to live longer with their parents and some others may not. This essay will discuss the issue of independent life and living with their families for a longer time. </p>
      <p>Most young adults prefer to have a seperate or independent life from their parents or families as soon as possible. This is because they have a strong urge for freedom in doing what they desire. But in fact many of them fail. This should not be surprising since often they are actually not ready mentally although they are physically ready. It is widely understood that to live independently requires a lot of energy and is not easy at all. In this twenty ﬁrst century, people may need more and more preparation because competition is increasing rapidly. An observation shows that many University graduated students are unemployed. Therefore, they will not be able to support and fulﬁll their necessities.</p>
      <p>So living independently at an early age is not suitable for all young adults, some young adults may need to take more time to prepare themselves before going out to struggle. Young adults need to be ready to support themselves. Taking time to get more education and living with their families for a longer time may lead them to a better independent life because they will be well prepared for the hardlife outside. Still, living with their families for *too* long will not be a good idea because they could get to used to it and tend to be less independent.</p>
      <p>The time to live independently depends on the person himself. He or she must decide whether they are ready to leave their parents to have an independent life or not. The decision will vary from one person to another. A person should judge that he is capable of fulﬁlling his needs without being dependent on his parents; this indicates that he is ready for his independent life. Otherwise he might need to stay longer with his parents.</p>

      <p>Independence! Who doesn’t want independece? But the bigger question is how much of an independence is being discussed here? Generally, when teenagers grow up, their needs and habit of living change. Some would like their parents to be in control of the major decisions of their lives, while on the other hand, some would not like their parents to be involved in any sort of decision making process of their lives. In my opinion, the young adults should always consult their parents as their guides. I will try to demonstrate my point in the following paragraphs. </p>
      <p>Let’s assume a teenager grows up into a young adult. Now a major decision that he/she might have had to make was to what college/university they were going to attend. If we assume that the person seek complete independence from the early age, then they are generally going to make the decision themselves. But even if they made this desicion by themself, what is the probability that this is the best desicion. We all would agree that the best lesson learned is from a mistake, but why even let that happen? This is the most important decision they would have to make so far, and if they don’t ask around, if they don’t look at the wider picture, how are they supposed to end up at their very best opportunity? This, is what is known as a making/breaking point because this decision of theirs can make or break a very powerful potential future.</p>
      <p>Now, suppose they passed the ﬁrst make/break point. Then comes another one when they are going to marry. Normally, in the western culture, the man and the woman choose their marriage partners themselves, so this is not much of an important issue here. But, what about the cultures that predominantly have arranged marriages? In that case, choosing a husband or a wife could be a huge decision, because generally the marriages are not as easily broken as in the western culture. So, when it comes to this point, one would deﬁnately want to know their parents thinking and their previous experiance. This could come in very handy when one has a choice to make. </p>
      <p>To sum it up, it is very good idea to ask for parents guides, and is never a bad a idea to give up a part of independence for a better future. </p>

      <p>This essay has a rather informal, conversational tone and an “argument” that is coherently and fully developed. Sentence structure is varied throughout, and the writer consistently demonstrates command of language and English idioms, especially by using various informal expressions (“Let’s assume,” “We all would agree,” “can make or break,” “come in very handy”). The essay meets all the criteria for a score of 5. </p>

      <h5>Score 4 Essay—Sample 1</h5>
      <p>There are different opinion regarding how long young adults should live with their parents. Some argues that the sooner a young adults become independence is the better while other think that it will be beneﬁcial if they can live with their parents longer. In my opinion both have positive and negative sides. This essay will provide arguments for each case.</p>
      <p>Some young adults favor for leaving their parents soon. They want to live free, independence from their parents’ supervision. The good thing about being independence as soon as possible is that they can learn how to live by themselves. They must think how to support their living, otherwise they will still need the help of their parents and can not be independence. Living in their own will teach them how to be tough in facing real difﬁculties. But, staying away from parents soon could also lead to negative behaviour if the young adults can not control themselves. They might think that they can do whatever they want with the friends they like. If their friends give bad inﬂuence on them, no one will warn them and they can have problems. Thus, I will agree for young adults to become independence as soon as possible if they are already mature enough and able to control themselves. Parents can help to judge this before they release them. </p>
      <p>the case of young adult is not mature enough, I believe that staying with parents will be better. Parents can provide guidance and help when their children need it. But, if the children is become too dependent on their parents, they will have difﬁculties in their older lives of becoming independece as the parents will not be available for them anymore. So parents in some way should teach their children about independence, for example by giving them responsibilities that should be handled without supervision.</p>
      <p>Based on those arguments, I would like to say that either way could be better that the other depending on the maturity of young adults themselves. If they are mature and have self-control then living independently is better, otherwise they better stay with their parents until ready.</p>

      <p>The points made in this essay are thoroughly developed and concretely supported. The essay is well organized and coherent, with a nice ﬂow. What keeps the response from scoring a 5 is the number of noticeable errors in structure and word choice: “Some argues,” “favor for leaving,” “Living in their own,” “become independence,” “if the children is become too dependent.” None of these errors interferes with meaning, but their quantity and effect earn the essay a score of 4.</p>

      <p>Independency is generally good and helpful for the individual, because it teaches individuals how to take care of different responsibilities, and how to handle things by yourself. people needs to know how to live independently of others, because eventually they will have to.

      <p>In conclusion, although moving out when you are still a young adult to live independently from the family has some good point, the disadvantages of it overcome these good points.</p>

For example, house’s responsabilities or pays. Secound, When peoples live with their parents they dont expend a lot money for haouse or food. Third, they belief that their family is a great company.

      <p>This essay is somewhat developed and is longer than the average essay with a score of 3. It has a coherent organization based on describing the pros and cons of living apart from one’s parents and living with them, with supporting points. In some cases, however, this approach leads to redundancy, especially toward the end of the essay. Additionally, even discounting typographical mistakes, the various errors clearly reveal weakness in command of language (“Live with your parents have many differents advantage,” “the most important problem is . . . expensive”). Meaning is also sometimes obscured (“house’s responsabilities or pays,” “they need to work in the house along because dont have company”). </p>

      <p>Young adults show different patterns of behavior when they have to decide whether continuing to live with their family or not. For instance, in United States young adults prefer to live separated from they parents as soon as possible. This tendency reﬂects wises of freedom and independence. Altough these behavior has remarkable advantages and disadvantage, the advantage can overwhelm the negative effects.</p>
      <p>It is important to recognize that by living separated from parents or family can be more risked than living with them. many young adults are victims of group pressure and gangs because of theirs parents absence. </p>
      <p>However, a signiﬁcant advantage of living by onself is that people develop ledearship skills. Individuals that live by themselves learn to do and sustain their own decisions. On the contrary, people who live with their parents are more shy and less conﬁdent. For instance, many of the greatest world leaders are or have been people that were separated from their parents when they were kids. </p>
      <p>Another advantage of living indepently is that peolpe can fully develop their creative potential. When people is forced to difﬁcult situations, they can surprise us with outstanding abilities and values that otherwise remained hidden. A good example are blind people, these person show a remarkable ability for art and music. In a similar way, when parents are absent or too away for help, individuals manage to survive and be successful.</p>

      <p>Though slightly stronger than the average essay with a score of 3, this essay fails to earn a score of 4 mainly because of errors that obscure meaning (“reﬂects wises of freedom and independence”). Also, connections among ideas are not always completely clear. For example, the details used to support the points made in paragraphs 3 and 4 are concrete but not well connected to each other or to the generalizations made by the writer.</p>

      <p>All of us are surrounded by different kinds of people every day. For students, when they are at school, they are mainly surrounded by teachers and their friends. Both of these two kinds of people have great influence on students. However, I still believe that friends have greater influence on students than teachers do.</p>
      <p>Usually a student and his friends are almost at the same age, or at least they have similar ages. Therefore, they will have a lot of in common, such as hobbies. As a consequence, they can talk to each other and imitate each other's behavior easily. My little brother and his friends are both interested in soccer games and they spent almost all their spare time talking about soccer games worldwide and great football players. What's more, my brother's friend is a good soccer player and my brother tends to imitate his behavior. As a result, my chubby brother becomes better at doing sports, especially playing soccer. Meanwhile, a teacher won't have such great influence on a student since teachers have less in common with students.</p>
      <p>Moreover, in most schools in my country, the teachers just appear in front of the students when there is a class and they will leave the classroom as soon as the class in over. Thus, the students actually have limited time to communicate with their teachers. Even if they do have some time to discuss with their teachers, the topic of the discussion is usually the subject in class. However, a student could have hundreds of different topic, ranging from daily lives or school subjects, to talk with their friends. They have more time communicating and therefore, they know and understand each other better than their teachers. As for me, I can spend a whole day talking to my best friends but only an hour talking with my teachers.</p>
      <p>In addition, an everlasting friend may have greater influence in the long run than a teacher. Some of our friends at school may become friends forever. This kind of friend will influence us even when we graduate. However, teachers, on the contrary seldom become everlasting during our lives. They won't have as great influence in the long run as our friends do.</p>
      <p>All in all, though I have to admit that teachers and friends both have great influence on students, I still believe that students are more affected by their friends. The more people have in common with you, the greater influence they will have on you. Therefore, a friend, who is the most similar to students, is the greatest influence during a student's life.</p>
