                </h3>
                <p>Some people spend their entire lives in one place. Others move a number of times throughout their lives, looking for a better job, house, community, or even climate. Which do you prefer: staying in one place or moving in search of another place? Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.</p>

                <h3>Topic 31 Moving vs. staying at one place</h3>
                <p>Living in one place all your life may seem very convenient. For my part, I am inclined to believe that not everyone is born in the place that is best for him/her, and thus one should take the chance and move to a place that is more suitable. </p>
                <p>For me at least, in this particular time of my development I find it better to stay in a place for a while, and then move on, to another place. However, as I would grow old I do believe my opinions in this matter will modify. </p>
                <p>When I had decided for a career in art history, in a way, I had also chosen for a life on the road. I had always seen myself traveling from one place to another, organizing an exhibition here and there, and moving from one university to the next. In the five years before I started my undergraduate education I had been enrolled in four universities in three different countries. At a first glance, such a way of living seems really appealing. It is always exciting to see new places, and meet new people. </p>
                <p>Also the idea of moving in order to find a more interesting and challenging job seems to be quite legitimate. However, one needs to consider that not everyone moves during his/her life because he/she wants to, but on the contrary because he/she have to. There are people that are running away from their pasts, or for one reason or another they simply cannot stay in the place of their choice. </p>
                <p>Moreover, moving from here to there have disadvantages even for those who enjoy moving. Family and friends are often left behind. Most likely, they miss the places that they have left. A piece of our soul remains in every place we spend a considerable amount of time. And what are we left with in the end? </p>
                <p>Probably with nothing more than the pain of being away from so many relatives, friends, and places we love. </p>
                <p>Best thing to do, in my opinion, is travel all around the world, see as many places and cultures, make friends, but always keep a special place to return to, even if this place is not the one where you were born. </p>
