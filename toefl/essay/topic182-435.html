                <h3>Topic 182 Is human relationship with pets useful?</h3>
                <p>I think that having close relationship with pets is good as long as you do not over do it. Pets are friendly and loving. Let me explain my point of view. </p>
                <p>Pets can be our friends. Especially in old age when our children go away from home to study we feel lonely, then we can keep a pet. Pets could keep us busy and lessen the feeling of loneliness. We can spend most of the time with pets like feeding them, and taking them a walk. Pets are healthy to keep if they could take our mind off of the troubles of day. But on the other hand, if we worry unnecessarily about the items such as food, clothes etc. and behavior of pet, then it's not healthy for us. </p>
                <p>Some animals like cats, parrots, and rabbit are very loving. We can easily love these animals. But emotional involvement with animals is not very good. Some people treat pets as part of their family. They take pets to their own bedrooms and give them place to sleep on their bed. They give them seat on couch or take them in the lap. I do not think all this is very healthy for us. We should have separate utensils and space for pets. A few people try to teach pets eating with spoon and forks, they are happy if pets learn easily. Expecting pets to behave like humans might not be good for pets, after all they are animals. </p>
                <p>There are many store who sell all kind of stuff related to pets such as pet food, pet clothes, pet toys, and pet homes. Buying nutritious food and separate homes for pets is necessary. We should even buy a few toys for entertainment of our pet. Now a day's pet owners spend hundreds of dollars on buying special types of pet food, costly toys, and expensive pet homes. They try to get luxurious things for their pets. I think these people should donate some of that money to child food banks, since many children in our country do not have food to eat. I think spending extra money on pets is waste of money. </p>
                <p>According to me, pets can be friendly and feeling close to them can be healthy, if we do not worry much about them. </p>
