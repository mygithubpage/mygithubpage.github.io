                <h3>Topic 147 How should your school spend a gift of money?</h3>
                <p>Our educational objective is not only to fill students with the knowledge, but also to improve their capacity and skills of analysis, which will benefit the students all their lifetime. So to achieve this ambitious objective, it is necessary that the school shall have all sorts of laboratories to facilitate various laboratory tests in the school. So naturally, when my school receives a gift of money, I think the best way for us to spend the money is to build basic laboratories for the students and teachers. </p>
                <p>Firstly, our school is not well equipped with such a basic necessities. We have capable teachers and intelligent students in our school, which created a strong academic study atmosphere. But due to lack of necessary laboratories, the teaching is only limited in the class. Students learned a lot about the theory but no more practice, which detracts the understanding of students and affects building up of their capacity to apply the knowledge into practice. Therefore, the educational quality is questionable. This has impaired the fame of the school. Consequently, brain drainage is a big problem in the school. The excellent teachers and intelligent students are desperately looking for wellequipped schools for their teaching and studying. So to curtail the loss, it is the high time to invest the fund to build up all these necessities. </p>
                <p>Secondly, to spend the money on establishing laboratories will benefit the school for good in the long run. Parents assess the school according to the educational facilities that the school possesses. Poor facilities will keep students away from the school. So from the point of view of attracting more students, building a first-class laboratory is the prime task of the school. </p>
                <p>Furthermore, the local education authority has also paid attention to the problem of poor educational facilities. If the situation maintains like that without any improving, I suspect our school will be closed down by the authorities. </p>
                <p>Last but not at least, if our school use the money on building educational facilities, it will make the donators more comfortable. By building a new laboratory, I believe it can attract more donators. </p>
                <p>In sum, to spend the gift fund to build up the laboratory is a wise choice, which not only can satisfy the students and teachers in the school, but also can make the parents and the donators happy. </p>
