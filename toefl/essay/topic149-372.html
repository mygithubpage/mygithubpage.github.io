                <h3>Topic 149 How would you use a free gift of land?</h3>
                <p>A fazenda? A playground? Or a garden? How would you use the land that you have received to use as you wish? Obviously, the answers of different people would be diverse. As far as I am concerned, I would build the most advanced hospital on this imaginary land, for the following reasons. </p>
                <p>Firstly, I think the health problem concerns everyone in the world, and then a high-class hospital can favor everyone, not just a portion. There is a common wish in the minds of all people that I can live healthier, and the hospital can meet this wish. Actually, we can live without banks, playgrounds, fazendas, and so on, but none of us can live without hospitals. To some degree, the hospital is the most important building for human being. Therefore, I will choose to build such an important building in my imaginary land. </p>
                <p>Secondly, a high-class hospital can be a scientific center for researching advanced cures to some diseases which cannot be cured now. A few diseases, such as AIDS, cancers, and so on, have been torturing human beings for a long time. People die for them. They separate fathers from children, husbands from wives, friends from friends, brothers from sisters. They have made innumerous tragedies in the world. If I could, I would provide the most advanced hospital to the most outstanding doctors to find some therapies against those diseases. </p>
                <p>After that, there would be fewer pains in the world. What a wonderful world it would be. </p>
                <p>Certainly, there can be more reasons to interpret my choice besides the two cited above, but they are not away from the central idea that my land should favor every people as much as possible. What in my land can fulfill this task? A hospital, of course. </p>
