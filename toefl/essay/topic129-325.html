                <h3>Topic 129 Business research vs. agricultural research</h3>
                <p>There are two kinds of opinions concerning the plan to develop a research center in our country. One is to develop a business research center and the other, a agriculture research center. Taking consideration of the current situation in China, I strongly recommend the former because it will help to solve the urgent problems in our country. </p>
                <p>First of all, a business research center will help to develop the economy. At present, the global economy is slowing down and there is no evidence indicating that the recovery will come any time soon. Our biggest trading partners such as the United States and Japan fall into economic plight. As result, the exportations to those countries and direct investment from them are decreasing. The most important task is how to keep the economy growing healthily. The center will help to complete this task by exploring new business opportunities to increase exporting and helping enterprises adjust themselves. </p>
                <p>Secondly, a business research center will help to solve the problem of unemployment. With the reform of state owned enterprises, more and more workers employed by those enterprises lost their jobs. Our economic reform and adjustment is going through a vital stage. A business research center will help the enterprise figure out how to solve this problem and the unemployed people will have a chance to get jobs in new business fields. </p>
                <p>Finally, it will help to solve China's rural problems. China has a big population, and nearly 70 percent of its population is farmers, namely, 700million farmers in China. Now the rural problem is focused on farmers who have been released from arable lands with the development of new technology can get their jobs. A business research center will help to develop rural economy in the industrial and service fields that can absorb the enormous number of farmers. </p>
                <p>Based on the reasons I present above. I believe a business center will play a strong role at present than a agriculture research center does. As result, I support the plan to develop a business research center in our country. </p>
