          <h3>Topic 74 Is it better to travel with a tour guide?</h3>
          <p>Traveling is one of the most widely enjoyed recreations. The tourist business is becoming increasingly important for many countries' economies and provides a great variety of products and services. People are different and so are their preferences when it comes to spending a vacation traveling to interesting and exotic places. One of the first choices one should make when planning a trip is whether it would be individual or with a group let by a tour guide. If it were up to me, I would go to an excursion as a part of a tourist group. </p>
          <p>First of all, a common problem of people traveling abroad is the unfamiliar language of the country they are visiting. This is a major inconvenience as it could hamper their communication and prevent them from learning valuable things about the place. That's why I think that a tour guide, who in most cases knows at least two languages, would be needed. This is a professional whose job includes guidance and help. Also tour guides tell tourists about the history of the place they are visiting, information which otherwise could hardly be obtained. </p>
          <p>Second, group journeys are supposed to be previously organized. The travel agency makes the full program of the trip: hotel reservations, transportation, food, and sightseeing. Furthermore, many services and museum taxes are cheaper for a whole group. In this way, tourists are much more comfortable, as they safe time and money, and are able to enjoy their vacation without worrying about anything. </p>
          <p>Third, traveling in a group can provide people the opportunity to get to know with many other tourists who are from different backgrounds but are brought together by their common interest of the place they are visiting. Such group trips are a great chance for making new friendships and eventually learning a lot about different people. </p>
          <p>For all these reasons, I prefer to travel in a group with a tour guide, as it would guarantee a more convenient and enjoyable journey. </p>
