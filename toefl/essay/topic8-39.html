          <h3>Topic 8 Has TV destroyed communication?</h3>
          <p>Has television destroyed communication among friends and family? Different people will give different responses to this question from their own characters, emotional concerns and even educational backgrounds. However, when it comes to me, television has severely affected our contact with our friends and family for the following reasons. </p>
          <p>In the first place, watching television will obviously take up our leisure time that can be otherwise spent staying with our friends and family. In fact, the television has provided us with a variety of shows, which can easily catch our eyes. An example is that, a very hot television play will eat much of our free time magically! Many people will admit that the glamour of television is irresistible! So, how about talking with our old friends? Let us watch another hot television soap opera instead! Without television, we will obviously have more time to share with friends, namely, playing tennis, swimming, playing football etc. These activities are all good entertainment and improve our physical fitness as well! Do you expect getting in a good shape or having floppy muscles when sitting in front of television? </p>
          <p>In the second place, programs on televisions have some negative effects on us in terms of violence, illusion and even brain malfunctions. People who are infected with long exposure to television will indulge themselves in a world full of illusionary love, violence or even pessimistic views of life. How can those people have good time with their friends or other family members? Without television we will have more chances to realize this world realistically, cherishing people who are loving me, paying more attention to social problems and leading an optimistic life! From this point of view, television seems to be the source of all these tragedies! </p>
          <p>Admittedly, television is obviously a tool for us to broaden our horizon and entertain ourselves. And such positive effects of television should not be neglected. However, it seems to me that the disadvantages brought by television have outweighed its advantages. </p>
          <p>All in all, if all the factors are contemplated, we can easily reach a conclusion that television has destroyed our communication with our friends and family and is not as effective as we might expect. Let us give up tonight's soap opera and pay a visit to our old friends instead. </p>
