                <h3>Topic 167 Should the school purchase computers or books?</h3>
                <p>The problem that whether school should choose to buy books or computers can be controversial nowadays because people often think that computers can replace books soon. However, I would like to be on the side of people who suggest that schools should books instead of computers. There are several reasons of it and I will discuss two main causes. </p>
                <p>First, even though students can access the information they want more easily, they often recognize that most of the information in computers is apt to be inaccurate. Due to the fact that many people send their information by the Internet or email in order to get their own interests such as money and fame, in this case, their information are often distorted and biased. </p>
                <p>Second, students who study their special area cannot get a deep and wide knowledge through computers because the knowledge from computers is inclined to be shallow and introductive. If possible, students have to print them out to study with long time and write something related on it. </p>
                <p>School's essential purpose, I believe, is getting student to have a deep and wide knowledge to prepare for their future lives in society. In this perspective, books are more suitable to achieve this quintessence duty of schools than computers. </p>
                <p>Therefore schools should choose to buy books. </p>
