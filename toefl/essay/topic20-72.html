                <h3>Topic 20 Should children grow up in the countryside or in a city?</h3>
                <p>Where is a better place for children to grow up, the countryside or the big city? </p>
                <p>The answer to this question differs from individual to individual. As far as I am concerned, it is better for children to grow up in a big city. </p>
                <p>Some people argue that the countryside is an ideal place for children to grow up. </p>
                <p>For one thing, it is less polluted than the city. The air is fresh in the countryside. </p>
                <p>The sky is bluer and the water is clearer. Living in such a place is good to the children's health. For another, as children like playing, only the countryside can offer them a big playground. They can run everywhere, play games in the fields, swim in the river. On the contrary, the city cannot provide such places for children. They can only stay at home and watch TV. </p>
                <p>Although I do agree that growing up in the countryside has one or more advantages, I insist that it is far better to choose the city as the right place for children. To begin with, living in the city can broaden children's horizons. They can meet a lot of people and hear a lot of things that will never happen in the countryside. </p>
                <p>In addition, a city means more chance to receive better education. In most countries, it is no doubt that the level of education in the city is higher than that of the country. As a result, children can meet better teachers and receive high quality of education in the city. </p>
                <p>Last but not least, children can also develop many hobbies in the city. They can learn to play the piano, painting, and dancing, to name a few, which are impossible in the country. </p>
                <p>In conclusion, I believe that it is better for children to grow up in the city not only because it can broaden their horizons, but also because they can receive better education and have a chance to develop many hobbies there. </p>
