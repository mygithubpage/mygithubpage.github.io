          <h3>Topic 30 Should a high school be built in your community?</h3>
          <p>I oppose having a new high school built in my neighborhood. Although I know there's a real need for a new facility, I have to say that I don't want one built so close to me. I think it would cause a lot of problems. </p>
          <p>First of all, there are very few teenagers in this neighborhood, or in our suburban subdivision, for that matter. Most of the residents here are either retired or are just starting out with young children. This means that the kids coming to the new high school wouldn't be walking to school. They would come on buses or would be driving to the school. Either way, this would mean a lot more traffic on our streets. </p>
          <p>In addition to the traffic on school days, there also would be traffic whenever there was a sporting event, such as a basketball or football game, or activities at the school. Would there be enough parking in the school lot for everyone attending those events? Probably not. Consequently, those extra cars would end up parking in our neighborhood. </p>
          <p>My neighbors and I would also be upset about the loss of the park, which is the site that's been selected for the high school. Mothers with young children gather there every morning for their kids to play together. People my age like to take a walk after dinner. On weekends, that park is a place for picnics and relaxation. </p>
          <p>We'd be sorry to lose our neighborhood park. </p>
          <p>I also have some concerns about all those young people being in our neighborhood. Would there be problems with drugs or fights? Could the school district guarantee us that security would be apriority? These are concerns that I don't think can be addressed sufficiently for me to support a new high school in my neighborhood. </p>
