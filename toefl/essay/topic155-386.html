                <h3>Topic 155 What plant is important to the people in your country?</h3>
                <p>There are many kinds of plants in Thailand since Thailand's land and climate are very suitable for agriculture. As soon as I am asked what the most important plant in my country is, I undoubtedly point out that rice is the most necessary plant in Thailand for several important reasons that I will detail in this essay. </p>
                <p>Firstly, rice is the main kind of food in Thailand. Even though there is much more food here such as noodle or fast food, almost all Thai people still eat rice as their daily traditional dish because we have eaten rice for a long time from our ancestral age to the present time. Moreover, rice still provides substantial energy to our bodies, so we have enough energy to do our activities everyday. </p>
                <p>For foreigners, they can have breakfast only with hams and eggs. For me, if I have breakfast with no rice, I feel that I am still hungry. </p>
                <p>Secondly, as a agricultural country, exporting rice is the main part of my country's revenue. Even though we sell several kinds of plants to other countries, rice still makes much more income to us than others. In addition, Thailand ranks first in rice exports in the world. I cannot imagine if we do not have rice as the vital economic product, how could our country survive. I absolutely see the significance of rice because even USA also eagerly tries to develop and cultivate rice by itself in order to defeat Thailand. </p>
                <p>Obviously, no other plants can replace rice in terms of the important food and the vital economic values at present and in the future, even though several kinds of plants are also cultivated here. </p>
