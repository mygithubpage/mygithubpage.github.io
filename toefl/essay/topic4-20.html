                <h3>Topic 4 Are books more important than experience?</h3>
                <p>Upon the question "not everything that is learned is contained in books", different people have different opinions. From my point of view, I believe knowledge gained from experience is more valuable than knowledge gained out of books. In the following paragraphs I will try to explain my position more clearly. </p>
                <p>Firstly, life's valuable lessons are learned from experience. Can you forget important lessons learned from your childhood years, such as jumping down from a high place and broke your arms? From that accident you knew the importance of self-protection. Knowledge gained from experience is likely to be retained in our memory for a long period of time, although most of the time we have to pay a price for it. </p>
                <p>Secondly, knowledge that is gained by doing things can provide you with firsthand information. If you don't have the chance to experience on your own, you can only obtain second-hand knowledge and you will feel a lack of selfconfidence. </p>
                <p>Moreover, many skills and knowledge can only be learned through practical experiences. You cannot learn swimming by just reading from books on how to swim. You have to actually get there and jump into the pool. Experience is the best way to develop your personal abilities. </p>
                <p>However, just as an English proverb goes "a coin has two sides," reading books is also helpful. After all, you will not have the chance to experience everything by yourself. For instance, to travel to foreign countries is expensive and timeconsuming, while reading a book about different cultures provides you with plenty of valuable information in a short period of time. </p>
                <p>To conclude, knowledge gained from experiences is more important. Life requires knowledge, and experience is the key. </p>
