                <h3>Topic 19 Highways or public transportation?</h3>
                <p>In this modern society, governments always confront the dilemma whether spending more money on improving roads and highways or on improving public transportation. This problem is a much-debated one in that it affects everybody in his or her daily life. Personally speaking, I would be one of those who argue that governments should spend more money on improving public transportation. </p>
                <p>Though it is quite rational for average people to choose roads and highways because of the obvious reason that a better road condition could suspend more vehicles and accelerate the speed of them. A close scrutiny of the potential benefits of choosing roads and highways would reveal how flimsy it is to stick to the propensity. A better road condition would bring with it more vehicles, thus a much more crowded traffic. Have you ever been caught in a traffic jam? </p>
                <p>Then how could just spending more money on improving roads and highways Besides, putting the discussion in a wider context, a further reason why I advocate the later lies in the fact that improvement of road condition would stimulate more people to use cars and hence more energy would be used and more pollution would be exposed. This would be the last thing that everyone would like to see. But if we choose to improve public transportation, a quite different result could be. This can be demonstrated by the undeniable fact of our city. We have greatly improved the bus network and reduced the parking places since several years ago. Now more and more people shift from cars to buses and other public transportation, and an azure sky can be highly savored again. </p>
                <p>Finally, frankly speaking, there is also a more practical reason why I choose to improve public transportations. Public transportation encourages a sense of community. People who travel to work together all the time get to know each other better while cars isolate us from neighbors. An improvement in public transportation would make it fit more people's schedules and more people would choose to take public transportation to enjoy communicating with each other. </p>
                <p>When taking into account all these merits and drawbacks I have numerated, we may safely arrived at the conclusion that we should put more money and concerns more about public transportation. We would experience more convenience when traveling as well as an appreciable nature environment. </p>
