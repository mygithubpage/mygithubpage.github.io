                <h3>Topic 15 What are the qualities of a good neighbor?</h3>
                <p>Speaking of the word 'neighbor', it arouses different responses among people. </p>
                <p>Some people may frown upon it, others might nod their heads at it with their whole-hearted smile on their faces. No matter which category you belong to, as a person, especially as a person who has to live next to a neighbor, the concern on the qualities of a good neighbor is always a popular issue to bring about and to desire for. In my opinion, a good neighbor must be a friendly person, while at the same time, a person who is willing to offer help to you when you need the most. </p>
                <p>As an important and fundamental quality of a good neighbor, she or he must be kind and nice. Neighbors are those persons we meet in every day life when we go in and out of the building. They are usually the people we meet at the very beginning of the day, and whom again we will encounter at the end of the day. </p>
                <p>A nice and sincere smile on their faces, or a simple 'hello' as a warm greeting on the way, may bring us a joyful mood for a start of a day. In a very same way, a caring 'how was your day?' on your way home might be treated as a big comfort on your tiredness at the end of your working day. As nice neighbors, they have provided us a very cordial living environment through their care and friendship. </p>
                <p>Other than that, being able to help you out when it is necessary is also considered as a significant trait of a good neighbor. Through our entire lives, there are numerous difficulties or troublesome situations that we have to deal with. When those particular moments come into life, the first person come into our mind is often our best friend or one of the relatives. However, most of the time, they cannot be the real person who we can rely on at those hard times. We will soon realize they are either too far away or they are unavailable right now. </p>
                <p>We all have once had these similar experiences. Then here is the moment where good neighbors should begin to play their helpful roles so that we can immediately turn to them for help and useful advice for dealing and solving the emergency, and so that we do not have to lose our minds in trying to find everyone's phone number. </p>
                <p>These are the precious and indispensable qualities of good neighbors. They are friendly and nice, and they will always be there ready for you when you need someone's help. Living with such a neighbor, you may start to sway at your old image of neighbor, and you may no longer frown upon that topic at the time we talk about it. </p>
