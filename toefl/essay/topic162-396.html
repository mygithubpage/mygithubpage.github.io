                <h3>Topic 162 Do starts deserve high salary?</h3>
                <p>Everyone needs money to support his family and enjoy life. I believe that is one of the most important reasons why people go to work. While an average person just earns basic salary, some famous athletes and entertainers earn millions of dollars every year. Why is that so? Do these people deserve such high salaries? </p>
                <p>Before answering these questions, let me ask you another question, where did your salaries come from? From our employers. Right! Those famous athletes and entertainers made a lot of money for their own employers. Because their skills and achievements on some specific sports or entertainments, other people would like to pay money to watch them playing games or acting in movies. </p>
                <p>This is part of the nature of human beings. From this aspect, they earned what they got. They deserve what they earned. </p>
                <p>In addition, usually those athletes and movie stars have some special talents in a certain area. Athletes are experts at some specific sports such as baseball, basketball, football and so on. Movie stars are good at performance art. </p>
                <p>Average people cannot reach that level, no matter how hard they try. People who watch their games or movies can obtain happy experiences and enjoyments, which can enrich people's life and benefit people's health. Without sports and movies, our life would be much boring and less pleasant. </p>
                <p>Furthermore, those famous people sacrifice something to get what they have. </p>
                <p>For example, almost all athletes suffer from injuries because of heavy trainings and physical competitions to win the games. Movie stars have to face the fact that the average people are not only interested in their movies, but also interested in their personal lives. This is also integral part of human beings. </p>
                <p>Do not be jealous of those famous athletes or entertainers, although we all admire the millions of dollars they made. They have talents, they made us happy and they sacrificed something, either injury or privacy. They earned their own paycheck. </p>
