          <h3>Topic 157 Computers vs. traditional schools</h3>
          <p>With the knowledge explosion, many ways of education will be offered to students. In the future, students may choose to study at home by using technology such as computers or televisions, or choose to study at traditional schools. In my opinion, the former is a better choice. </p>
          <p>In the first place, students can adopt an individualized and effective way of study by using high technology at home. Traditional schools make schedules according an average student's needs. Although they concern the demands of the majority, their schedules are not the just fit ones for many students. But using technology such as computers or televisions, a student can make the class schedule of his or her own, concerning personal ability, recent health condition and so on. In traditional schools, it is impossible that a teacher lecture you the same lesson twice at your own convenience. By using technology, students can review some lessons easily to get better understanding of some courses. </p>
          <p>In the second place, studying at home by using technology can save much space and resources. The more quickly the society develops, the larger the quantity of people who need to go to school. The fast growing industry and service facilities have already made our world a crowded one. If we use traditional schools as we do now, the places that education facilities occupy, of course, will become another contributor to the crisis. On the contrary, studying at home by using technology will not only save more place, but also can release the places they are now occupying. </p>
          <p>Maybe some people will put forward a doubtful point about studying at home using technology, that whether the students can be self-disciplined. I am sure that some measures can be taken about some of the disadvantages of learning at home. In conclusion, studying at home is an ideal choice. I hope we can see the new type of education in the near future. </p>
