                <h3>Topic 138 Member vs. leader</h3>
                <p>According to my opinion, it is always better to be a leader than a follower. True leader show initiative. They take actions and they assume responsibilities. A leader makes a decision. Some followers may approve of the decision, others may complain about it. However, these followers all chose to follow, not to lead. </p>
                <p>They chose not to make a decision. That's how I am different. I am not a follower. I want to make decisions. </p>
                <p>A good leader will not react to events, but will anticipate them. A leader will start a plan of action and then will persuade others to follow. For example, a class president at a local college may feel that the relationship between the community and the campus is not a good one. The citizens may feel that the college kids make too much noise on the street, litter public areas, and shop in other communities. A good class president will recognize that the community and the campus depend on one another. The president will ask the student body to keep noise down, help clean up the neighborhood, and work with businesses to attract students. A good leader takes the initiative. </p>
                <p>Good leaders must be action-oriented. Having taken the initiative, they must see the job though. They have to take charge and lead the followers. They have to motivate and encourage the followers. The followers (in this example, the student body) must understand why good relations with the community are necessary. The followers must be persuaded to do something about it. </p>
                <p>I enjoy taking the initiative, determining the direction, and being responsible for my actions. I do not want to suffer through other people's stupid decisions. </p>
                <p>If there are going to be stupid ways to do something, let them be mine. Would not you agree? </p>
