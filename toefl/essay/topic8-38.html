                <h3>Topic 8 Has TV destroyed communication?</h3>
                <p>What do you usually do to relax yourself and have some fun after a whole day's work? How do you spend most of your spare time with a lowest cost of both money and energy? Most of us will give the same answer: watching TV. As promoted by the development of modern science and technology, television programs today attract a vaster group of audiences by tremendously enriched contents and a 24-hour rolling schedule than ever before. The fact that television seems to control our choice of leisure and entertainment has recently brought a problem to focus: whether has television destroyed communication among friends and family? Those who agree with the statement insist that such lack of communication should attribute to television. However, I hold just an opposite point of view and I will demonstrate my opinion as followed. </p>
                <p>First of all, the advantages of television will speak for itself. As known to all, what we find in television is not only some enjoyment or recreation to kill time but also an important source of knowledge and information. Imagine how television makes us familiar with the miracle creatures in the deep ocean that is unavailable otherwise. Undoubtedly television is an indispensable channel for us to learn the world outside. </p>
                <p>As far as the interpersonal communication is concerned, television also plays a key role in improving, but destroying like someone thinks, the relationship and understanding among friends and family. A good case in the point is that television often focuses the attention of public by broadcasting current events, social news and popular teleplays. It is always easy to find interesting topics with friends and colleagues if you have watched the same TV program lately and want to share your ideas about it. Besides, in my own family, my parents and I enjoy the time when we are sitting together and watching tele-films. </p>
                <p>Because it is the moment for us to feel and enjoy the peacefulness and happiness of family life. </p>
                <p>I do not deny that there may be some cases that people are so addicted to television or some other habits that he/she will probably ignore communication with friends and family. Yet it is the wrong attitude of the person him/herself that results the problem but television. Thus, for the reasons above, I shall say: television, like many other important inventions of human beings, benefits our life with both enjoyment and knowledge. </p>
