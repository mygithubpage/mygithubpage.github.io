          <h3>Topic 44 Travel with a companion vs. travel alone</h3>
          <p>Traveling is a very pleasant thing. Some people like to travel with several friends. Other people, however, would prefer to travel alone. As far as I am concerned, traveling with my friends is better. </p>
          <p>Why do some people like to travel alone? For one thing, they can experience more freedom. They do not need to discuss the itinerary of travel with others. </p>
          <p>He/she can just go whenever he/she wants. For another, they do not need to keep an eye on how to get along with friends. </p>
          <p>Although there may be one or more advantages to traveling alone, I insist that traveling with friends is better. In the first place, the trip will become easy. </p>
          <p>Traveling is not a very easy activity. For example, you need to find transportation, hotels and restaurants in new places. Several friends can share these tasks so that everyone has a chance to enjoy the journey. </p>
          <p>In the second place, you can get help when you need. There will be many unexpected things that could happen during the journey. Such as, someone gets lost, gets sick, or cannot wake up early for the morning flight. It is very tough for people to handle these situations by themselves especially when they travel to a new place. Friends can give you a hand to overcome all these difficulties. </p>
          <p>Every one needs the help from others. </p>
          <p>In addition, you can have more fun by traveling with friends. Enjoying the scenic spots is wonderful, while traveling on the road is boring. How to spend this boring time? Talking with friends, playing cards will help. </p>
          <p>In conclusion, I prefer to travel with friends rather than travel alone not only because the trip will be easier with friends, but also because I can have more fun by with friends' company. </p>
