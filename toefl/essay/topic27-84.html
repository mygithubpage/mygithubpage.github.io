          <h3>Topic 27 Should people do things that they do not like?</h3>
          <p>Should people sometimes do things that they do not enjoy doing? Many people strongly oppose this idea, while others insist that although people naturally favor doing what they enjoy doing, under certain circumstances people may well be advised to act against their interests and it would benefit people in many ways. Personally, I would side with the latter. </p>
          <p>For one thing, it usually takes quite some time for people to discover their interest. My personal experience serves as a typical example. From my childhood, I learned a lot of time to discover my interest. I tried to play an electronic organ, draw oil paintings, and even learn ballet. Superficially, it seems to be a sound solution to find out what my interest is, but when carefully weighing in the mind, I find that it has wasted me plenty of time. A scrutiny of these arguments would reveal how unnecessary they are. </p>
          <p>For another, many things that people instinctively hate to do will actually benefit them in the long run. A basketball star's personal experience is a good example. He likes running when he was a child. When he was in high school, he joined the track and field team. By a chance, he met a basketball coach and was asked if he wanted to become an occupational basketball player. Although he was not interested in playing basketball, nevertheless, his parents told him that doing something he hated to do might change his whole life in a good way. </p>
          <p>By taking the advice of his parents, he went to the basketball team and now he turned out be extremely successes! For another example, we are not always interested to move to different places. In fact, we will have more opportunities of improving our lives by moving around. As President Kennedy pointed out," Change is the law of life, and those who look only to the past or the present are certain to miss the future." </p>
          <p>Still some people might list other reasons to explain why people should do some things that they do not enjoy doing. However I assume the points I have discussed in the above analysis are the most relevant! </p>
