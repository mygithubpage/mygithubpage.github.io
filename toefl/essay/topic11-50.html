                <h3>Topic 11 Sports or library?</h3>
                <p>Many universities offer their students a lot of facilities for engaging in sports activities besides their normal academic programs. There is a gym and a swimming pool on almost every campus. There are also many other groups like swimming or jogging societies for students to join and enjoy sports during there spare time. On one hand this is a good chance to help students maintain their physical health and fitness, on the other hand it takes up a lot of the universities' resources. </p>
                <p>"A healthy mind lives in a healthy body." This is one of the main reasons why universities investment big money into their sports facilities. A lot of research concerning the relationship between physical fitness and mental abilities come to the conclusion that a good physical condition creates a strong mental power. </p>
                <p>One must emphasize that the investment on sports facilities is worthwhile and beneficial. </p>
                <p>The opposite opinion is that it is a waste of money and resources to investment in sports facilities for students. Many people think that students should concentrate on academic issues. It is more important to spend money on buying books and computers for libraries, because libraries provide students an essential environment for their course studies and research. </p>
                <p>In my personal opinion, when the financial resources are limited, it is more sensible to spend money on improving research and teaching facilities like libraries and computers, which are the key issues of a successful university education. Students can always find their own ways to do physical exercises, such as utilizing the facilities in the community. Nevertheless, after satisfying all the academic needs, if there is still some money left, the money should be invested into sports facilities. </p>
