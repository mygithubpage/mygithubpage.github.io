                <h3>Topic 93 What are important qualities of a good roommate?</h3>
                <p>At first glance it seems very difficult for us to define what are the important qualities of a good roommate. However, after serious considerations we can see that under most circumstances, a good roommate should at least have the following three qualities. </p>
                <p>First of all, a good roommate should be open and willing to communicate. </p>
                <p>There are always issues regarding rent, bills, food and household duties, guests, privacy, noises, sharing and borrowing, to name a few, and interests and hobbies of roommates are not always the identical. There will always be conflicts among roommates. When problems or conflicts arise, roommates must openly discuss the issue and reach a solution to the problem. In addition, a successful roommate relationship requires good communication. Take time to talk frequently to each other; chatting with each other helps keep up the basic relationship that can provide the underpinning for a harmonious relationship. </p>
                <p>Therefore open and willing to communicate is the first important quality of a good roommate. </p>
                <p>Secondly, an important quality of a good roommate is considerate and understanding. A good roommate understands what you need; He is a good friend and a good listener, and offer you help when you need it. Of course, you should not depend on your roommate to satisfy all your social needs. Make other friends and get involved in activities is also important, and could leave more private time for your roommate. </p>
                <p>The third important quality of a good roommate is that he should be a hard worker, and have the desire to do better. As we know, roommates will always influence each other in some ways. As an old Chinese proverb, one who mixes with vermilion will turn red; one who touches pitch shall be defiled therewith. </p>
                <p>So like choosing a friend, it is very important to choose a roommate who has good qualities. </p>
                <p>Of course, some roommates eat and socialize separately and barely get to know each other. They never become friends. Still, if your roommate possesses the above-mentioned qualities, your residential life will be peaceful and enjoyable. </p>
