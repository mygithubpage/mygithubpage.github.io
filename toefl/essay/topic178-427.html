          <h3>Topic 178 What changes will the 21st century bring?</h3>
          <p>With the advent of the 21st century, the world is facing many changes. There are incredible advancements in science and technology fields. In my point of view, these breakthroughs will bring more conveniences to people and make our life easier. </p>
          <p>First of all, one of the most significant changes is the use of computers and robots. Using of such computers and robots in industries can bring an increase in output and accuracy. Also, these computer parts and robots are being made so tiny that they can be built into both personal and industrial equipments. </p>
          <p>Moreover, there will be more innovations, inventions and researches in different areas of science and technology, such as more advanced telecommunication with a new generation of satellites, faster means of transportations, newer engines for planes, and quicker diagnosis of diseases by using advanced auto analyzers. </p>
          <p>On the other hand, a few disadvantages such as air and water pollution, decreasing of natural resources cannot be underestimated. Although these negative aspects are almost negligible in comparison with great advancements of this new century, most scientists believe that these negative effects are not overrated. </p>
          <p>In conclusion, it can be concluded that not only does the new century brings us many great advantages, but also it brings a few disadvantages in which people have to deal with. </p>
