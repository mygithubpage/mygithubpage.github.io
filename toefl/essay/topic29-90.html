                <h3>Topic 29 Has human harmed the Earth or made it a better place?</h3>
                <p>When it comes to what human activity made the Earth, tradition has human activity that damaged the Earth. Nevertheless, although human activity has caused some damage to the earth, our Earth has certainly been turned into a much more beautiful world than it was centuries ago. </p>
                <p>First of all, due to the development of human productivity made possible by science and technology, we now enjoy living conditions that our ancestors could never dreamed of. Nowadays, we use machine to plant crops, use synthetic fodder to feed livestock, use water conservancy project to generate electric power and so on. In term of substantive level, no other reasons in my decision is more crucial than the one above. </p>
                <p>Furthermore, the use of machines has greatly improved our working conditions, enabling us to enjoy more leisure and entertainment. Tape recorder's invention serves as a typical example. They are small and have well sound quality. We can take it everywhere with us and the tape recorder has a valuable argument that it enabled me to listen to my favorite music wherever I want in a variety of different formats. </p>
                <p>Of course, it should be admitted that human activity has resulted in the environmental crisis, which I believe we could overcome with the help of science and technology. The majority holds the opinion that human activity carries lots of pollution, which made the air quality worse, and endangered species increases everyday. On the surface, these seem to be terrible. However, people are taking a fresh look at it that they can be improved sooner because of science and technology development. </p>
                <p>In short, human activity makes the Earth develop. It is difficult to imagine how the world will be without human activity. Similarly, a person who does not use machine in peacetime that cannot get anything done. Therefore, after pondering this question on many occasions, I believe that human activity makes the Earth better and beautiful and a great place to live! </p>
