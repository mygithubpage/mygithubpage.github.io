                <h3>Topic 163 The importance of reading and writing</h3>
                <p>For ages, reading and writing has been vital aids to the intellectual, emotional and spiritual growth of mankind. With rapid changes in the society and scientific advancement of human race over the decades, the necessity and importance of reading and writing has increased remarkably. It has become a pivotal skill a person should learn to be successful. </p>
                <p>Several reasons account for the lesser importance of reading and writing in the past. Firstly, education was restricted to certain sections of the society and not everyone benefited from its advantages. Only the learned few enjoyed intellectual satisfaction. Knowledge was not shared freely due to lack of proper means of communication, thus preventing many from realizing the benefits of education and learning. Secondly, technology was not so advanced in the past. </p>
                <p>Hence the general pace of life was slower than it is now and people did not feel the need to keep themselves abreast of affairs around them. In other words, the need did not arise for mass awareness and participation in efforts for intellectual enlightenment through reading and writing. Nevertheless, writing was a more popular than reading since it was the most common means of communication - in the form of letters. </p>
                <p>However, at present the scenario has changed considerably. Innovation and change are integral parts of life. Now advancement in technology marks the day. </p>
                <p>To cope up with the rapidly evolving new ideas and concepts, reading has become more important now than ever before. Invention of high-tech gadgets and state-of-the-art information systems in areas of communication, transport and general business demands more awareness about contemporary events and changes. With advancement in technology, man's eagerness to succeed has increased. Consequently the realization has dawned on him that such dreams can be materialized through intellectual advancement - a feat possible only through self-reading and personal research. With the invention of computer has commenced an age of electronic communication and online commerce. </p>
                <p>Although writing letters has decreased considerably with the advent of electronic mail, it will take some time to make our varied businesses paperless. </p>
                <p>Thus though reduced, people still do some writing, wither in forms of documents, memorandums, business contracts or research papers. Education has made people more aware of his potential and reading and writing has become instrumental to man's success in today's competitive world. </p>
