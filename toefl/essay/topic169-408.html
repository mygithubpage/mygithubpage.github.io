          <h3>Topic 169 Why is music important to many people?</h3>
          <p>"Music hath charms to soothe the savage breast." </p>
          <p>English literature is full of references of music. Literatures of different eras reflect the likes, dislikes and nature of people belonging to that era. If you read music-related phrases or poems of any era, you will find that these phrases or poems reflect the same reasons people listened to music years back, as they do today. </p>
          <p>Music is, and has always been a part of mankind. Walk into any IT company today, and you will see people working with their headphones on. Stroll into the reception of any Multinational company, you will be greeted with a pleasant music playing at a low volume from the speakers. Most people say that music helps them work better and creates a relaxing ambience. Any great occasion is incomplete without music. Be it Valentine's Day, friendship day, someone's birthday, or a party. On Valentine's Day, love songs hit the top charts; special cassettes are complied as valentine day's specials. On parties and birthdays, people like to celebrate with loud music. </p>
          <p>Can you imagine any type of dance without music? Dance steps are created according to the rhythm and beats of different types of music. Operas, plays and musicals all revolve around music. While watching different dance forms and musicals, you also enjoy the music that is a part of it. </p>
          <p>You will find that music is your best companion. If you are feeling low, there will be peppy songs to cheer you. If you are in a philosophical mood there will be different types of music to add to your reflective mood. Different people have different preferences towards music during different moods. </p>
          <p>There is an endless variety of music available - instrumental, blues, jazz, rock, pop, reggae and lots more. Every type of music has a different impact on people. Some people prefer to begin their day with soft instrumental music. </p>
          <p>Some prefer hard rock playing in their cars as they drive to work. Different people like to end their day listening to different types of music. </p>
          <p>So, music is an inherent part of human life. Even nature has it's own music. </p>
          <p>Bird's chirping in the morning, water gushing down rivers, and breeze blowing through trees are all a part of nature's own music. Life without music would be still and meaningless. That's the reason people listen to music for different reasons and at different times. </p>
