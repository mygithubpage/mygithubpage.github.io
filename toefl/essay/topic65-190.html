          <h3>Topic 65 Should a city preserve or destroy its historic buildings?</h3>
          <p>Whether the city should try to preserve its old, historic building or destroy them? </p>
          <p>I believe that different people will have different opinions. According to my experiences, I think that we should preserve these old, historic buildings. I like to use following reasons to explain why I think so. </p>
          <p>The first and important reason is that every old building represents an important piece of history. Undoubtedly, they can reflect contemporary culture, custom and life style, etc. For example, the former Imperial Palace in China, where ancient emperors have ever stayed, has had a longstanding history as long as over 2,000 years. Through it, we not only can remember many famous historical events, but can also know that ancient people have grasped very advanced architecture techniques and methods. </p>
          <p>I believe if we demolish these valuable buildings, we will destroy a significant piece of history. More seriously, we will not be able to rebuild them. What people need is not the duplication or copy. In many old cities, there are some old houses at where there were many important meetings hold. When we visited old sites, we seemed to go back to that turbulent and exciting time - as if we can hear what those important historic characters were talking. </p>
          <p>I admit that some old buildings have become a bit dilapidated and unsightly, and have not generated any revenue. But if we can refurbish them, I believe that they could start to attract visitors again. From what has been discussed above, I can safely draw the conclusion that we should preserver these historic buildings. </p>
