                <h3>Topic 33 A piece of jewelry vs. a concert</h3>
                <p>Depending on personal experience, personality type and emotional, we find that some people hold the idea of enjoying a concert if a gift of money has been received, but others choose to buy a piece of jewelry and that is also my point. </p>
                <p>My arguments for this point are listed as follows. </p>
                <p>The main reason for a piece of jewelry I like is that it has a great value of collection. With the resistance of fading, erosion and alteration, jewelry is probably the first durable ornaments humans possessed. In addition, owing to rareness, costly jewelry is regarded as particular merchandise and left behind to the offspring. Furthermore, its value will not depreciate like paper currency because of turbulent society and economy. According to the three points above, we can reach the investment value of choosing a piece of jewelry. </p>
                <p>Another reason can be seen by every one is that jewelry can make people pretty, and always symbolizes something. For example, through the centuries, rings have perpetuated the talismanic role of the diamond. In the Middle Ages and Renaissance period, every ring that was set with a precious stone was not so much a piece of jewelry, but an amulet that conveyed the magic powers of the stone upon the wearer. On the other hand, "A diamond is forever" is internationally known to men and women of all ages and may very well mean something different for everyone. Aside from its status as the ultimate symbol of love, diamonds have been around for millions of years, thus in their own right symbolizing, "forever." So, it is a good present that you buy a piece of jewelry for your love. </p>
                <p>Admittedly, listening to a concert also has advantages, but the influence is short-lived. So, taking into account of all the factors that I have discussed in the above analysis, I believe that it is more advisable to buy a piece of jewelry rather than a ticket to a concert. </p>
