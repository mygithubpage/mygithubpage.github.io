                <h3>Topic 59 What's your hurry?</h3>
                <p>Life is short. Haste makes waste. What's your hurry? These three sayings characterize the way I manage my day-to-day chores. I don't want to rush through things; I prefer to take my time. </p>
                <p>Life is short. You never know what may happen tomorrow so it is important to enjoy today. Of course, some people will say that's why it is important to cram a lot into a day. But then, how would you possibly have time to enjoy all of those experiences. By doing a few things slowly and doing them well, you can savor the experience. </p>
                <p>Haste makes waste. We are not machines. We can't rush through things mechanically. If we do, we might forget something; we might take shortcuts. </p>
                <p>By taking our time, we can do a chore carefully, completely, and correctly. </p>
                <p>What's your hurry? Where's the fire? I don't see any need to rush to the next experience. There's still a lot to see and learn from the chores around you. </p>
                <p>Taking care of your baby brother for instance can be very rewarding. You could simply keep him near you while you watch TV and write a letter and talk on the phone. Or you could devote your whole attention to him and observe his reactions to his environment. You can observe carefully, if you are trying to do four things at the same time. </p>
                <p>To twist a common saying, "Don't just do something, sit there!" Take life easy and savor each minute. Life is shorter than you think. </p>
