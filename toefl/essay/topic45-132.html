                <h3>Topic 45 Getting up early vs. staying up late</h3>
                <p>Some people prefer to get up early in the morning and start the day's work. </p>
                <p>Others, however, prefer to get up later in the day and work until late at night. </p>
                <p>As far as I am concerned, getting up early is a good habit because it is good for health, and it is easy for people to take care of everyday work. </p>
                <p>In the first place, everyone knows that getting up early is a very good habit for our health. You can enjoy the fresh air in the early morning, and also you can get a good night's sleep during the quiet midnight. Moreover, if you get up early, before go to work, you still have enough time to do some exercises, such as walking, running and riding the bike. Without doubt, all of the exercises can help your to stay healthy. </p>
                <p>In the second place, it is easy to take care of everyday work if people get up early. For example, if everyone in the family gets up early, the wife will have enough time to prepare the breakfast for the whole family, the children will have enough time to catch the school bus, the husband will never forget to change his dirty shirt. Everything is in order. </p>
                <p>Admittedly, some people who work until midnight and get up later in the day claim that working in the midnight is more efficient for them and they can concentrate on their work without distraction. However, the advantages of getting up early carry more weight than those of getting up late. </p>
                <p>To sum up, from what I have discussed above, we can safely draw the conclusion that getting up early can benefit us not only because it is good for our health but also it is easy for us to take care of everyday work. Therefore, I prefer to get up early in the morning and start the day's work. </p>
