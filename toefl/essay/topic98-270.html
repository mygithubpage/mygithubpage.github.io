          <h3>Topic 98 What would you choose to represent your country?</h3>
          <p>If I can send one thing to represent my own country - China to an international exhibition, I would choose a book that has graphical illustrations besides each context. </p>
          <p>The main reason is that paper was invented by one of our ancestors and it is essential to our everyday life. Were it not for the paper, many documents would not have been passed down for centuries. In addition, with the written language being used, many famous people and great things about my country can be recorded in this book. For example, it can explain the educative theories of Confucius, one of the greatest educators in our country. </p>
          <p>On the other hand, with the universal language of graph, people around the world can understand more easily with the help of the vivid presentation. In this way, even a young child who does not read will learn what I want to tell them. </p>
          <p>In a word, people attending the exhibition will know that Chinese people discovered paper, and Confucius was one of the greatest educators in China. </p>
          <p>Besides, this book also reminds us how clever our ancestors are and what we need to do to keep up. With these wisdoms, we can invent more convenient equipments or make important discoveries to better our lives for the future. </p>
          <p>In conclusion, if I have the opportunity to introduce one thing to people in the world, I would bring a book that documents all the traditional inventions and people of my own country. In that way, the world will understand more about my country. </p>
