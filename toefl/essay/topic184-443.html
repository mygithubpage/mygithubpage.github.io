                <h3>Topic 184 Individual learning vs. group learning</h3>
                <p>Some students prefer to study alone, while others prefer to study with friends. </p>
                <p>Although studying with friends has its advantages, in my point of view, I would like to study alone. The reasons are as follows. </p>
                <p>When you study, especially when you study some subjects that are hard to understand, such as math and physics you need to concentrate on them. That requires a quiet environment without distractions. Studying alone can provide that, and you can read your books and think of questions without being disturbed. It will help you to understand the knowledge better and to remember the knowledge better. </p>
                <p>Furthermore, studying alone has another advantage that studying with friends does not have. That is it forces you to think. When you face some questions hard to solve, and there is no other students around you, you have to think of the questions hard and try you best to solve them. This gives you an opportunity to improve your ability to deal with problems by yourself. </p>
                <p>Obviously, studying with friends cannot give you these. Because when you meet some questions, you probably turn to friends for help. </p>
                <p>The third advantage of studying alone is also the most important reason. It can make you think independently and have your own opinions. You have to think independently when you study alone. No one can give you interference or suggestions. You will not be affected by other people's opinions. That can help you create your own thoughts, not to become a parrot. After all, the best parrots still live in cages. </p>
                <p>Though studying with friends has some advantages, for instance, it can help you to solve your questions faster and improve your friendship, however I think the advantages of studying alone overweight these of studying with friends. My preference would be to study alone. </p>
