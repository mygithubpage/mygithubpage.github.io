                <h3>Topic 92 One-season or four-season climate</h3>
                <p>There is no denying the fact that whether to choose a place that have the same weather all year long, or a place where the weather changes several times a year is a popular topic which is much talked about. Although it seems that normally we cannot tell which one outweigh the other between these two kinds of places, they deserve some close examination. </p>
                <p>If three criteria were taken into account, I would prefer living in areas where the weather changes several times a year. There are no less than three advantages in this as rendered below. </p>
                <p>First, varied weather or climate broadens the range of our pastimes. For example, we can go swimming in summer and go skiing in winter. If the place we live in has only hot weather all year long, like Singapore, most of us can never have a chance to go skiing. </p>
                <p>Secondly, the change of climate gives us opportunities to wear many kinds of clothes. Some say it is a waste of money to buy clothes depending on seasons. </p>
                <p>However, wearing various clothes, looking at others' fashion, and feeling the change of seasons is very interesting for me. </p>
                <p>Thirdly, changing of seasons is good for our health. When winter comes our body's metabolism slows down, and when summer comes it speeds up, so that our body can maintain a good rhythm. Also snows in the winter can kill a lot of bacteria and bad insects, so that in spring our chance of being infected with a disease such as flu is decreased and we can enjoy nice atmosphere and sceneries. </p>
                <p>For these reasons, I prefer to live in areas that have several changes of weather. </p>
                <p>Only these three reasons can make a person draw the conclusion that living in areas that have season changes is better. </p>
