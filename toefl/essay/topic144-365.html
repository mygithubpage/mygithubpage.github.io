                <h3>Topic 144 A traditional house vs. a modern apartment</h3>
                <p>I know there are advantages to living in a modern apartment, but I'd prefer to live in a traditional house. My main reason is that I love traditional designs. </p>
                <p>They're graceful and warm and inviting. I think modern designs are very empty and sterile and not appealing. So, because of the way it looks, I'd choose a traditional house. </p>
                <p>I recognize the fact that a modern apartment is going to be in much better shape. </p>
                <p>Being new probably means all the plumbing works, the roof is not going to leak, the windows are properly sealed, and the kitchen appliances are in working order. A traditional house cannot guarantee any of that. In fact, it's likely that things will break down or need replacement, simply because of age. </p>
                <p>Still, if the appliances are old, so is the wood, and that's a big advantage as far as I am concerned. Very few new buildings have the kind of beautiful woods that were used years ago. It's something that cannot be copied. </p>
                <p>Space is always important to me, too. I need a lot of room for my home office, my clothes, and to display all the knickknacks I have picked up in my travels. I also like to have interesting space. I do not want all the rooms and windows the same size or a boxy design. A modern apartment usually comes in one size and shape. A traditional house is going to have a variety of spaces where I can put a little table or a window seat. And it will have lots of room, from basement to attic. These are all good reasons for me to prefer living in a traditional house. </p>
                <p>Some people love modern design, but it's not for me. The space and beauty of a traditional home are more important to me than having everything new and perfect. </p>
