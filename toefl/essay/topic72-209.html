                <h3>Topic 72 Does grades encourage students to learn?</h3>
                <p>When it comes to the issue that whether grades are the purpose of student's education, different people have different ideas. As far as I am concerned, the grade can promote student's attitudes toward learning. </p>
                <p>I take this view on account of the following reasons. First of all, grades are the objects that demonstrate students' abilities in specified fields that they learned. </p>
                <p>Since there are lots of drawbacks of other evaluation methods, examinations or grades are the most efficient and fairest way to describe a student's capabilities. </p>
                <p>For example, a student who achieves the best grades in all subjects is undoubtedly the best student in his class. </p>
                <p>Second to take into account is that grades are possibly the definitive factor whether one student can obtain a decent and well-paid job. Having not many working experiences, students can only prove the proof of their abilities by showing exam records to their employers. </p>
                <p>Last but not least, contrasting to the better grades the his classmates make, a confident and self disciplined student will continue making effort on his study. </p>
                <p>Such kind of a grading system certainly encourages students to learn. </p>
                <p>However, just as the English proverb goes, "a coin has two sides." Those who maintain the opposite view are partly reasonable that grades could not demonstrate all the abilities that a student has, such as communication skills and survival skills. </p>
                <p>Despite the factor I outlined, we can easily conclude that, generally speaking, grades are very important for student's study, and they surely encourage students to learn. </p>
