                <h3>Topic 32 Do you spend money or save them?</h3>
                <p>When I am economically independent, I will choose to enjoy the money I earn instead of saving it for some time in the future. Life is a process of consuming; and we are growing old day after day. So why not taking advantage of being young to enjoy yourself fully, deeply and truly with money - which really can give you many things although we say that money cannot buy all? </p>
                <p>No one would deny that we are all in pursuit of happiness. And this happiness should belong to today but not tomorrow. Imagine a person, who saves all he can save in the hope of living better in his later life or making use of the money when necessary, suddenly dies from a traffic accident one morning, leaving all his savings without enjoying a pit of them. Since no one will know what will happen in the next second, we had better enjoy what we own now, thus at least nothing regrettable left in our life if something does overtake us. Money is just what can provide us most of the enjoyments. In this highly commercial world, nothing can be done without money - seeing movies, watching a game, eating at a fancy restaurant, and so on. Money itself indeed cannot give us happiness, but at least it can offer us such opportunities to seek happiness in certain aspect. </p>
                <p>For the young, youth is such a valuable period that none of us should leave something regrettable in this golden age. Ascetic-like life is not I want to lead. I am a person who thinks material things the most important because I like commodities of famous brand, I like eating in expensive restaurants instead of snack bars, I want to traveling all over the world, things for which money is indispensable. I earn money to fulfill what I look forward to but not put aside to prepare for something that may happen. </p>
                <p>Furthermore, in view of the nowadays economy situation, governments in all countries encourage people to consume but not save. Economy in many countries is down and down, the most distinctive indication of which is the poor consumption. If every person saves instead consuming, how could the situation be better? Enjoying what you earn cannot only bring you your own happiness but also contribute to the economy of your country, why not? </p>
                <p>In one word, I myself choose to spend what I learn and enjoy in time but not save my money for some time in the future. And I believe that is better both for you and for the society. So, never hesitate, buy what you want to buy if you have enough money, and enjoy yourself as much as you like. </p>
