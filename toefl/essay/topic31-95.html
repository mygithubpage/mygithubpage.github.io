                <h3>Topic 31 Do you prefer to stay at one place or move around?</h3>
                <p>Staying in one place or moving in search of another place? Some people prefer to living in one place because they enjoy a harmonious relation with their neighbors and environments. While others prefer to moving from one place to another because of various reasons, a better job, house, community, or even climate. Looking back to my education and looking forward to my future career, I have been and will be moving a number of times. But considering my personality, I would rather live in one place when I am old. </p>
                <p>For a student, a good education opportunity is the most important concern. </p>
                <p>Students leave their homes for good university education. Different schools have different teaching styles. It is very common for students to choose among different schools to find a most suitable one. I did pursue my bachelor's degree far from my hometown, and I am pursuing my master degree at another university, and would like to pursue a ph. D abroad. </p>
                <p>Career development is another important issue. In order to have a strong experience and to get a fulfilling job, people would work in a number of companies. In different companies, we could experience different cultures and ways of doing things. The variety of people and culture will do much good to our future career development. </p>
                <p>However, frankly speaking, I am not an aggressive person. I would rather enjoy my live in a stable pace. When I am old and without the pressure to struggle for a better job, I would prepare to stay in a peaceful and quiet place, where I could chat with my old friends everyday. </p>
                <p>Taking into account all these factors, I would like to present myself such a solution: To try a number of places for better education and job opportunities when I am young; to stay in a peaceful place to enjoy live with my wife when I am old. </p>
