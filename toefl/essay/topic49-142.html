                <h3>Topic 49 Face-to-face communication vs. emails or phone calls</h3>
                <p>Many people hold the view that face-to-face communication is better than other types of communication, such as letters, e-mail, or telephone calls. As far as I am concerned, I do not agree with that view. There are many reasons that support my point of view, and I would explore a few of the most important ones here. </p>
                <p>The main reason is that people live and work with a fast pace nowadays. They are busy with everything. However, they also need to communicate with their friends or relatives. The result is that they have no time to set an appointment. </p>
                <p>This situation is very common. The best solution is to communicate by letters, e-mails or telephone calls. We could write letters or e-mails in our leisure time and send them out immediately or call somebody and talk for a few minutes. </p>
                <p>These things would not take up a long time and can be scheduled quite easily. </p>
                <p>Another reason is that it is too time and money-consuming for two friends that live far away from each other to schedule a face-to-face meeting. In this situation, using letters, e-mail or telephone calls will be a better way. People by this means could communicate with each other conveniently no matter how far they apart. Take one of my friends for example, he communicates with one of his friend in Germany by using emails. </p>
                <p>Furthermore, I believe that sometimes people will find it difficult to communicate face-to-face. They need to talk about something that is hard for them to confronting each other. At this time, letters, e-mail or telephone calls are better ways of interaction. </p>
                <p>Given the factors I outlined above, we may reach the conclusion that communication by letters, e-mails, or telephone calls is better than face-to-face communication. </p>
