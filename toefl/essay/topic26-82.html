                <h3>Topic 26 Should a new movie theater be built in your neighborhood?</h3>
                <p>Some people will say that a new movie theater in our neighborhood would be a bad thing. However, I fully support the plan to build one. I feel that a movie theater would bring more opportunities for recreation, reduce teenage delinquency, and lead to several improvement in the town. </p>
                <p>As it stands there is little to do in my town. There are no parks here, and there is certainly no nightlife. Additionally, the nearest movie theater is more than thirty minutes drive away. That is inconvenient for anyone here. Many movies end late at night. Who wants a long drive at 11:30 p. m. or midnight? A new movie theatre near our homes will certainly welcomed by people living here. </p>
                <p>Building a new movie theater here will reduce juvenile delinquencies. Like every one else, teens here are bored. They need activities to keep them busy and out of troubles. The jobs that the theater will provide will help teens, too. </p>
                <p>We also need more businesses that are willing and eager to employ young people. </p>
                <p>Overall, the new theater will bring many improvements to the town. For example, it will help other business. The movie theater will attract customers from neighboring towns. Those neighbors do not have a reason to come to this town now. However, if they are coming here for a movie, they will be more likely to spend time and money here. If we get more visitors, we will need more roads. While this may be costly, it will also make travel easier for people living here. We will be able to get around faster. Safety will be improved with the new roads, because they will be in better conditions than many that we have I believe that our town needs a new movie theater. Again, I support it fully. I hope that others in our community will join me to convince residents and local government. </p>
