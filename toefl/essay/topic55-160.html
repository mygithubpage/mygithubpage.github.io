                <h3>Topic 55 Decision</h3>
                <p>Napoleon once said that an ordinary military commander would perform better than two excellent ones. By this he meant that a military commander should exercise his power independently and make his decisions without the interference from others, which could ensure high efficiency in military operations. Napoleon is a genius and his words might be true in military struggles. However, for most people, it is essential for them to consult other people before they make any important decision. </p>
                <p>Young people need to seek advice from elder ones in the matters of their life and careers. Sometimes the opinions of the old people are so valuable that it plays a very important role in helping young people make decisions. Each year, millions of young students attend a national entrance examination for higher education. When deciding on the subjects and schools, the students often receive opinions from their parents, teachers, friends or those who took part in the examination in the previous years. When running the government, officials need to consult experts and the masses before they make any important decisions. "A wise ruler should gather opinions from all sides", this is an epigram held by generations of Chinese rulers in the past. In the seventies and eighties of the last century, some local governments in east China constructed many chemical plants to facilitate the development of the economy, without hearing the opinions of environmental experts. </p>
                <p>As a result, the wastes and gases discharged from these plants have brought about serious pollutions to the local environment. As an old Chinese saying is, "three cobblers with their wits combined equals Zhuge Liang, the master mind." A person may benefit a lot from the opinions of experienced people: he can avoid the similar mistakes and learn valuable lessons. The successful people are often those who are able to utilize the opinions of others. </p>
