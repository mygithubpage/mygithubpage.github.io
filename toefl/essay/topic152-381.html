          <h3>Topic 152 Why should forest be saved?</h3>
          <p>What is clear is that forests provide humans with many social, economic, and environmental benefits. </p>
          <p>However, huge areas of the richest forests in the world have been cleared for wood fuel, timber products, agriculture, and cattle. If the current rate of deforestation, about 80,000 square kilometers per year, is kept, they may completely disappear by the year 2030. In Vietnam, our country, according to the ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, 1,054 forest fires occurred last year, destroying 15,370 hectors of forest and causing damage worth US $ 9,8 million. Particularly, Upper U Minh, formerly a nature reserve, was mostly destroyed, just after being re-classified as a national park. </p>
          <p>In fact, like Vietnam, the countries with the most tropical forests tend to be developing and overpopulated nations in the southern hemisphere. Due to poor economies, people resort to clearing the forest and planting crops in order to survive. Therefore, the most effective conservation policies are to relieve poverty and expand access to education, healthcare, and the most important, alternative livelihoods. Allocating forests to farms and plantations is also a sound one. In addition, stricter laws should be issued to reduce the destruction of forests, which is caused mostly by logging interests. </p>
          <p>All in all, nowadays, one of the greatest concerns worldwide is the loss of natural resources, particularly forests. Many solutions have been suggested to save forests from destruction. However, many forests in the world remain unprotected. </p>
