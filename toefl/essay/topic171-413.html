          <h3>Topic 171 What one thing would you take for a trip?</h3>
          <p>If there were just one other thing I could take with me on a trip, it would most probably have to be my copy of Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, my favorite novel by Douglas Adams. </p>
          <p>This might seem to be a strange choice to many people, most of whom would generally prefer instead, to take something of more practical value, like a cellphone or a camera. I however, do have reasons for my decision. </p>
          <p>For one thing, I am a book-worm. I adore reading books, and cannot imagine a world without them. Books relieve boredom, dissipation, and listlessness. To me, books are the perfect antidote to counter depression and loneliness, feelings that one is bound to experience if one is going to stay away from home for such a long period. The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy is a book that is calculated to enliven any mood, and any situation. </p>
          <p>Another reason for my choice is that a trip generally entails a lot of traveling. I am not excessively fond of traveling, but I happen to be one of those people who can read while traveling, and so find it a most delightful way to spend journeys that otherwise tend to be rather tedious. The book has made bearable many a boring journey in the past and I anticipate that it will stand me in good stead during this trip too. </p>
          <p>The hitchhiker's guide to the Galaxy has been my favorite book for a long time now. I have read it several times, and look forward to reading it again and again. </p>
          <p>It has brought laughter and humor into my life, and I cannot remember a page in the book that I did not enjoy. It has been an admirable travel companion to me in the past, and I would definitely take it with me on my trip for the simple reason that it is one of my most prized possessions. </p>
