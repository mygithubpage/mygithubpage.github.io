                <h3>Topic 43 Why are people attracted to a dangerous sport?</h3>
                <p>I think some people get attracted to dangerous sports or other dangerous activities for diverse reasons. There are many dangerous sports or activities, but for the purpose of this discussion, I will just mention a few of them. These are: Car racing, Bull fighting, Skiing, Horse racing and Mountain climbing. Some people are attracted to dangerous sports/activities based on the following reasons I will present in the next three paragraphs. </p>
                <p>First, some people engage in dangerous sports/activities for recreational purposes. Often, they derive pleasure from such activities, and they believe it's fun. For example, horse racing is dangerous, accidental fall from the horse back during the race could lead to death or serious injury. Nevertheless the fun and excitement of horse riding cannot be replaced by other sports/activities. </p>
                <p>Second, some people get attracted to dangerous sports/activities for economic reason. Some earn their living through their participation in dangerous sports/activities. For example, there are two famous mountain climbers in my country that earn a lot of money through this dangerous activity 'mountain climbing'. Unfortunately, one of them can no longer participate in the activity because of his predicament. He missed his step and fell from the peak of the mountain and broke his spinal cord. </p>
                <p>Lastly, some people are attracted to dangerous sports to get attention from the people or to prove that they are brave. Such people may engage in bull fighting, they want to show people that are fearless and can face any challenge that might seem inevitable. </p>
                <p>In conclusion, people have different reasons for engaging in dangerous sports/ activities .1 believe with the above mentioned reasons you can see why some people are attracted to dangerous sports. </p>
