          <h3>Topic 113 A new university in the community</h3>
          <p>It is said that a new university will be established in our community. Some people think it is better for the community to have a university. But others do not think so. As far I am concerned, I think both sides have their own reasons. </p>
          <p>Let us get down to the arguments first before we take a side. </p>
          <p>People who hold the opinion of supporting the government's plan may have their views as follows. For one thing, a university around here may provide people with more chances to pursue advanced education. People living near here can go to the university library at their leisure time. There they can use the various resources of education, such as the book collection, and the computers. </p>
          <p>In addition, they can take some part-time continuing education course to improve their skills at work, or pursue a higher degree. The other advantage of establishing a university here is that it may bring the community an academic atmosphere. With so many educated people around town, the community makes you feel so peaceful and in harmony. </p>
          <p>People who take the opposite side may present some disadvantages of building a university near the community. Firstly, they feel that a university may occupy larger amount of land and use a lot of money which can be used for some other purposes: such as a shopping mall which can make people's life more convenient, or a factory which can employ a lot of people. The benefits that can be brought by those facilities are more obvious and tangible. Secondly, they think that the students at the university are young people who may sometimes cause troubles such as drinking, speeding or having wild parties, which could probably destroy the quite atmosphere of the community. </p>
          <p>All above seems reasonable from their own respective. Personally I support the idea to establish a university in the community because it can really give us more chance to improver ourselves. </p>
