                <h3>Topic 64 Self-employed vs. employed</h3>
                <p>My friends and I always talk about our jobs. Whether to work for ourselves, own a business or work for an employer is one of the hot topics we discuss. </p>
                <p>Some prefer to work for themselves or own a business. While others prefer to work for an employer. As far as I am concerned, I would like to work for myself. My arguments for this point are listed as follows. </p>
                <p>First of all, perhaps one disadvantage to work for others is that we could not plan our time freely. We have to work from 8 to 5 according to the employer's schedule. No matter what the weather is like and no matter whether it is necessary, we have to go to our office on time. We have no choice but to obey the rules set by the employer. Suppose we work for ourselves, we could decide our own timetable. We could find the best time for us to work and improve the work efficiency. </p>
                <p>Another reason for my inclination for working for ourselves is that we earn what we deserve. Our wages would be very clear to us. We know what we should earn. That's fair and we would work harder to get better result. However, when we work for others, the boss decides what we earn. It often occurs that we get less than we could earn. </p>
                <p>In addition, working for ourselves, we try our best in our work to reach our goal, thus we would be faster to succeed in life. If we work for others, the enthusiasm to work may not be so high. I heard many enterprisers who work for themselves succeed earlier than people of the same age. </p>
                <p>In a word, in spite of the fact that there may be a couple of disadvantages to work for ourselves, I feel that the advantages are more obvious, that is we could plan our time for work more freely, earn the amount of money that we deserve and get early success in life. Taking into account of all these factors, I would choose to work for myself. </p>
