                <h3>Topic 129 Business research vs. agricultural research</h3>
                <p>It is a well-established fact that science from the very beginning has aimed to serve the community. This has been in the form of taming the nature forces, alleviating some arduous problems, or improving the mundane life in one form or another. My country is a developing one, and is suffering from some economic problems. While agriculture has been the most pervasive hustle since the first Egyptian stepped into the Nile valley, nevertheless, I prefer the business center to be developed and hereinafter I will present and analyze this perspective. </p>
                <p>Agriculture is responsible for providing the community with food and supporting some industries. For my country, there is no persistent conflict in providing food. Moreover, no conflict exists regarding the necessary water supply. Not denying that researches in agriculture will produce new generations of crops that consume less water, produce more nourishment, resist diseases, or require fewer pesticides. However, in my perspective, we must provide more jobs to increase the income of families and hence supply them with adequate fund that will motivate the economy wheel. This attitude will result in more purchases and hence the necessity for increasing the agricultural production will arise. But first we must begin with research center that supports the economy. </p>
                <p>To support the economy, provide more jobs, and increase the annual income per capita, we must focus on the most lucrative activities. Agriculture is considered within the least profitable activities. While business fortifies all aspects of the economy, business research will improve sales of marketing centers, provide the industry with new ideas based on the requirements of the customers. </p>
                <p>Moreover, business will assert the economic side of management systems of factories and governmental facilities. </p>
                <p>Ultimately, universities should provide the community with more researches and scientific potential in the field that exclusively support the welfare of the community. Keeping this in mind, business centers will be the right choice. </p>
