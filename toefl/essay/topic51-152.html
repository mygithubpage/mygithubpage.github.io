                <h3>Topic 51 Careful planning</h3>
                <p>Gorge Barton, the famous American general in the Second World War, was well-known for his bold plan and his ability to grasp chances to strike the enemy in an unexpected way. However, few people know that Barton was also very careful with the battle plans, taking into consideration all the details and making preparation for any sort of accidents. I think in a modern society success often comes from taking risks or chances, but careful planning is vital for us to attain our goals. </p>
                <p>No matter what good ideas or big ambition we have, we need to make careful plans in which every step is to be considered. Otherwise, these ideas or ambition will remain "something in the air" which may never be realized. In China, a person who likes to take risks and is hasty in making his decisions is often criticized by others as one who is bold and immature. From early childhood, we are encouraged to take careful considerations before doing any thing important. </p>
                <p>Confucius, the ancient Chinese scholar, told his disciples that he would think it over for many times before making any decision. However, on the other hand, in today's fast changing world, we should try to find new ways and come up with new ideas in our work. If we are contented with what we have and always follow the same routine everyday, we may face the risk of being surpassed by others. </p>
                <p>As an old Chinese saying goes, "a wise man should have a careful mind as well as a bold spirit." In order to achieve success, we should not be afraid of taking risks and try to grasp chances, but at the same time our efforts must be based on careful planning. </p>
