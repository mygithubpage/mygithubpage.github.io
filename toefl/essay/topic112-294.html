                <h3>Topic 112 How should children spend their time?</h3>
                <p>In our rapidly changing world people begin to understand more and more that nothing is so valuable but knowledge. Education has become an important part of people's life. Due to this some people think that children should begin their formal education at a very early age and should spend most of their time on school studies. But others believe that young children should spend most of their time playing. To my mind these two views should be balanced so as not to go to the extremes. </p>
                <p>The first point of view that children should start early on their studies make me assume that it can be harmful and damaging for a child's physical development and personality. As a teacher I have seen the result of beginning education too early. Children are deprived of the enjoyment of their childhood years and their intrinsic desire to play. Some children cannot concentrate on their study and keep playing at school. Besides, the children who are not allowed to play and are forced to study can begin to detest the education process and the teachers. </p>
                <p>So, to force children to study at an early age can spoil the whole picture. </p>
                <p>When facing the question of early education it is also important to note that children who begin to study at an early age are often overloaded by studying material and homework, which they are not ready to cope with. Besides some parents neglect their children and do not pay enough attention to the children's problems at school thinking that they are still young. </p>
                <p>The second opinion that children should play instead of study also has disadvantages. In this case children are not well prepared for their school life at all. They have no idea what he is going to do at school. In addition, research shows that early education can benefit children's brain development and prepare them better for the futures school education. The most important time for early education could be missed if parents do not send their children to school at an appropriate age. </p>
                <p>In conclusion I would like to point out that that early education and play should be well balanced so that their enjoyment of childhood that is once in a lifetime would not be deprived. It is quite important for governments to design and implement an appropriate primary education system so that young children can have chances to both learn and play at school. </p>
