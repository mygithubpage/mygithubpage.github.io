                <h3>Topic 135 Should high school students wear uniforms?</h3>
                <p>My high schools required us a few years ago to wear school uniforms. </p>
                <p>Somehow this requirement is not mandatory anymore, therefore only a couple of students have decided to wear the uniform from time to time. Other high schools in my town never required such things as a uniform, so the decision of the principal brought a lot of contradictory discussions. </p>
                <p>In my opinion, the fact that this requirement did not last is a confirmation of the fact that it was not a good idea. First of all, I consider that what we wear expresses our personality. Our clothes tell a lot about the type of person we are, so an outfit established by others means a denial of expressing ourselves. It is also true that we cannot wear at school fancy clothes, like when we go out with our friends, for example. But even if some of us decide to wear extravagant clothes, I think this issue concerns only them. They establish an image of themselves and therefore they will be regarded as they wish to be regarded. </p>
                <p>Teachers told us that we should be proud to wear the high school uniform when people recognize us on the streets, saying that we belong to the best high school in town. We were not exactly regarded as eminent students, especially by our colleagues from other schools. I believe that the way in which we behave and the way we think shows better what kind of an education we have than the fact that we are wearing gray clothes, which we do not even like. The schoolyard looked so strange when we were coming out from classes. All of us in dark uniforms, as if we were alike. We were not, and we should also show that to people surrounding us. </p>
                <p>It's my belief that requiring high school uniforms is an unnecessary thing. A prestigious high school is not a high school who likes to show off with its students, but one who lets the students express themselves freely. </p>
