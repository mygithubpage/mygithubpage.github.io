          <h3>Topic 110 Being alone vs. with friends</h3>
          <p>Some people like to spend most of their time with their friends. Other people, however, just want to be alone in their spare time. As far as I am concerned, I belong to the latter kind of people. </p>
          <p>In the first place, I feel comfortable if I am alone. This is not because I do not like friends, but because of my personal character, quiet and a bit shy. When I am with my friends, I always feel embarrassed since I am always a listener. </p>
          <p>Trying to find topics makes me very tired. On the contrary, staying alone does not bother me. I do not need to discuss with others about what I want to do. Go shopping, go to a movie, go swimming, just do it. The most important thing is, I do not feel lonely when I am alone. </p>
          <p>In the second place, I need to have more time to learn new knowledge. I am working in the field of computer programming. As we know, the development of the computer technology is amazingly fast. If a person has not been working in this field for more than five years, he would find that he has to study from scratch when he decides to pick up his old job. So it goes without saying that I have to update my computer knowledge frequently in order to keep up with my career. Based on this, I do not have much spare time to fool around with friends. </p>
          <p>In conclusion, I prefer to spend most of my time alone not only because I am not good at getting along with friends, but also because I have to spend most of time in studying new technology. </p>
