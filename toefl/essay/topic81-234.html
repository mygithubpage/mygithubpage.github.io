                <h3>Topic 81 Has technology made the world a better place to live?</h3>
                <p>Many people take the view that technology has made the world a better place to live. As far as I am concerned, I share the common view with them. Because I could pick up examples here and there around us and I would here explore a few of the most important ones. </p>
                <p>The main reason is that if we look around, we may find that technology makes for us a better place to live. Take our house for example, without architectural technology, we could only live in the open wild. Thanks for those architects and engineers, we can live in a warm comfort house that protects us not only from the rain and wind, but also from the coldness of the winter, and the hotness of the summer. </p>
                <p>Another reason is that we could communicate with our relatives or friends without the need of meeting them face-to-face. Information technology helps us a lot in communication. For instance, telephones and cellular phones help us talk with others no matter where they are; computer networks connecting the whole world offer us another alternative of communication. By email, our messages can reach the destination in just a few seconds. </p>
                <p>Furthermore, transportation technology realizes the dream of people who want to travel around the world or to the space. We all can imagine that without car, bus or bicycles, how could most of us manage to get to work everyday? </p>
                <p>In a word, technology has changed the world in a better way for us to live in terms of housing, communication, transportation and many other aspects. </p>
                <p>Taking into account of all factors mentioned above, we might reach the conclusion that technology has made the world a better place to live. </p>
