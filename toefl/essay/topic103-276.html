                <h3>Topic 103 What characteristic makes people successful?</h3>
                <p>In my point of view, a sense of humor is as important as, if not more important than, other characteristics that a person can have to be successful in life. This I support with the following reasons. </p>
                <p>Firstly, humor helps us to maintain a correct sense of values. It is because that we are always reminded that tragedy is not really far from comedy, and then we never get a lop-sided view of things. A small example could get some light on this point. Once I failed an assignment again, and I told myself that God was on vacation these days. I did not feel frustrated, and I succeeded the third time. So, if we can see the funny side, we never make the mistake of taking ourselves too seriously. It is helpful for us to keep self-confident. </p>
                <p>In addition, the sense of humor is associated with happiness, and happiness will influence people around us. Those who bring happiness to others probably have a good relationship with people surrounding them, which is essential to a successful life. We all have the experience that we are inclined to talk and cooperate with humorous people. We may treat such experience as an enjoyment instead of a rigid work. </p>
                <p>However, to be a successful people is a tough thing. We need intelligence, honesty, determination, a sense of humor and so on. Without intelligence, we could not find the keys to solve all the intricate problems. Without honesty, no one would trust us and we could achieve nothing alone. Without determination we would easily bend for difficulty. </p>
                <p>Even so, I still think of humor as the most important part. A sense of humor supports an active attitude towards life. And it is such attitude that encourages intelligence, honest and other characteristics in you. To summon up, a sense of humor is the most important characteristic. If happiness is one of the great goals of life, then it is the sense of humor that provides the key. </p>
