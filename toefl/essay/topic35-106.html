                <h3>Topic 35 A live performance vs. television broadcast</h3>
                <p>I do not agree with the statement that attending a live performance such as a play, concert or sport event is more enjoyable than watching the same event on TV, because there are many disadvantages in attending a real performance. </p>
                <p>Firstly, there is too much trouble in attending a real performance. You have to buy tickets, sometimes stand in a long queue; you have to plan the trip and set out a few hours before the show started. After arrival at the theatre or stadium, you will have great trouble finding a parking place. During a sport event, your personal safety might be jeopardized: the sports funs might get too excited about the event, and become a mob. Many people might have heard the news that a girl was killed by a puck during a hockey game. If you take public transport or a taxi home after the show, you might find it very difficult to catch a bus or find a cab. </p>
                <p>Secondly, the seating arrangement can greatly affect the comfort of watching the show. If your seat is far from the stage or playground, you cannot even see the show clearly. People's heads and cheers will distract you from viewing the show, and in the end you do not even know whom you have seen in a play, or who wins in a sports event! </p>
                <p>Thirdly, there is no flexibility in a real show. After you have been through so much trouble and eventually start to enjoy the show, you might find that you are quite disappointed about the show after all. Unlike watching TV programs, you neither simply change channels nor leave the theatre in the middle of a concert or play. You might spend a lot of money to suffer from a show that you do not like. </p>
                <p>On the contrary, watching TV at home, where you can make yourself a cup of coffee, sit back comfortably and relax, watch the show closely, and enjoy the realistic image and sound from your SONY home-theatre system. Besides, you can watch programs whatever you like, and go to bed right when the show has ended. </p>
                <p>Although many people enjoy the excitement of watch a real show, I think nothing is more convenient and comfortable than watch TV at home. </p>
