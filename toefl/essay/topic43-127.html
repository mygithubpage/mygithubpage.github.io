                <h3>Topic 43 Why are people attracted to a dangerous sport?</h3>
                <p>Have you experienced the fear of bungee jumping? Have you ever enjoyed the excitement of car racing? Nowadays, more and more people are attracted to such dangerous activities, especially the young people. Wondering why? After thinking about the lifestyle of those people, the reason goes as follows. </p>
                <p>While the world is becoming more and more competitive, the tasks on each person's shoulders become heavier and heavier. People's everyday activities are very intense. The best way to relax and get relieved is to go in for dangerous activities, because while you are doing something dangerous, you have to concentrate on it, and you cannot think about anything else. Hence you relieved all the unhappiness and the troubles you had in the daily work. </p>
                <p>In addition, to take risks and try out new things is one of human being's basic instincts. People always like to do something new, especially when something is popular as well. According to some statistics, the dangerous activities are becoming extremely popular among young people. If you do not try some dangerous activities, people will think that you are a coward and you are afraid of doing it. So it is reasonable enough for them to do dangerous sports to show their braveness. </p>
                <p>However, I do not like dangerous activities and I believe the phenomenon that people are attracted to dangerous activities is just a whim. After realizing countless disadvantages of them, people will reconsider about them. Some safer activities to help people to get relieved will be developed afterwards. </p>
