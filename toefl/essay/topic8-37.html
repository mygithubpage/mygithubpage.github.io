                <h3>Topic 8 Has TV destroyed communication?</h3>
                <p>Nowadays, television plays an important role in people's life. It is the main information source and its popularity is still growing. </p>
                <p>Every day many new technological inventions are introduced. Almost all activities at home have already been mechanized. We use machines for everything. For example, we use microwave ovens to prepare food more quickly than we used to do it before; we order food, books and anything else we need just by clicking on a few buttons on the computer keyboard. Also we use mobile phones to be always in touch with our family, friends and the rest of the world. </p>
                <p>This is the good side of using technology. A few centuries ago people used to read newspapers and find out everything that had happened all over the world. </p>
                <p>Today newspapers are almost completely replaced by a newly invented gadget. </p>
                <p>This innovation is called television. It has been the most popular information "supplier" since its invention. </p>
                <p>Every evening family members sit in front of the TV set and watch programs such as talking shows, news, and movies for hours, sometimes without even saying a word to each other. Instead of sitting around the dining table and telling each other about what happened earlier that day they sit on the sofa and gaze at the TV screen. </p>
                <p>Is that right? Apparently, it is not. Everybody has to think for himself whether he and his family want to become 'couch potatoes' or they should continue to communicate with each other and avoid using television and all other technological achievements so much. We should ask ourselves whether we want to lead such a life with no real contact with other human beings. Is it really worth it? </p>
