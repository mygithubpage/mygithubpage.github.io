                <h3>Topic 4 Are books more important than experience?</h3>
                <p>We gain our knowledge about the world and our life from two sources: from experience and from books. These two resources are both important, but which of them is more important? </p>
                <p>Knowledge from books forms a very important part of our knowledge structure. </p>
                <p>In schools and colleges, we learn knowledge that is fundamental to our future career. We learn knowledge from books in order to make our contributions to this society in the future. A student learns mathematic equations and other scientific knowledge and become a scientist or engineer. We will be illiterate and ignorant without learning knowledge from books. Moreover, we acquire knowledge about life and the world by reading books, magazines and newspapers. This is also very important, as we cannot experience everything all by ourselves. Therefore books are a very important source of knowledge. </p>
                <p>On the other hand, we cannot learn everything from books. "Experience is the best teacher" is an old cliche but I agree with it. The most important, and sometimes the hardest lessons we learn in life come from our participation in situations. We learn how to get along with others or how to gain self-respect from our experience, not from books. We cannot learn emotional feelings, such as love and care, through books; they come from our real life experience. </p>
                <p>Knowledge from experience is also a very important supplement to knowledge from books. </p>
                <p>Needless to say both learning sources, books and experience, are very important to us. But in my opinion knowledge from experience is more important, because without knowledge from experience, it is impossible to get a real understanding of knowledge from books, and how to apply this knowledge to real world situations. </p>
