                <h3>Topic 78 Teamwork vs. working independently</h3>
                <p>There are many ways in which people can complete their works. Some prefer to work with a group of people on a team. Others prefer to work independently. </p>
                <p>To work with others can inspire their spirit and produce twice the result with half the effort. In my opinion, working on a team is more important. </p>
                <p>In business, people who are able to work with a group of people on a team tend to communicate well with others. In order to complete a sophisticated task, individuals must work together, each sharing a part of the whole task, in order to achieve the results. The team must interchange their ideas during each process in the forms of meetings and discussions. Each one tries his/her best to give a better idea to make the process more time-efficient. </p>
                <p>In addition, we cannot live in a society independently and we need to communicate with each other, so communication skills are very important to this society. Through teamwork, we can develop and improve this ability. </p>
                <p>Although one can complete a work independently with one's innovation and sometimes can accomplish a perfect work with great compliments, many reasons show that throughout teamwork really can achieve more than we may think of. No wonder, in the Fl race, team order is the most important thing that every member in the team must obey. </p>
