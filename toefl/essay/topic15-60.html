                <h3>Topic 15 What are the qualities of a good neighbor?</h3>
                <p>Neighbors are the people who live near us, and their behavior influences our daily life. Good neighbors can make us feel comfortable and give us many help, and everyone will benefit from a good relationship among neighbors. In my point of view, these are three conspicuous aspects of the qualities of a good neighbor. </p>
                <p>One of the most important characteristics of good neighbors is that they have a good living habit and are friendly to others. A person with bad habit will affect your daily life. For example, children are most likely to be influenced by bad neighbors and carry on bad habits. On the other hand, being friendly is also an important nature of good neighbors. If neighbors are unfriendly, they are hard to approach and difficult to get along with. </p>
                <p>Another important aspect of good neighbors is that they should be willing to help others. In our daily life, emergency situations may happen, and we may encounter difficulties that cannot be resolved by ourselves. At this time, the quickest help we can get is probably from our neighbors. To some degree, neighbors are as important as relatives to us, because they could provide the immediate help. In the same way, a neighbor who likes to help others will get help in return. Help each others can form a friendly and harmonious relationship among the neighbors. </p>
                <p>All in all, a good neighbor is someone who has a good living habit, is friendly and is willing to help others. Taking into account of all these factors, we may reach the conclusion that a good relationship among neighbors need the maintenance from us. </p>
