          <h3>Topic 51 Taking risks vs. planning</h3>
          <p>According to the words of Salustius "One is a creator of his own fate." Some people believe that success in life always comes unexpectedly and that's why it is only due to taking risks or chances. On the other hand, others are more inclined to planning their own lives. In my opinion, planning is the better approach for one who strives for success in life because it gives him an assurance in his future success and makes it possible for one to use his time more efficiently and to be more cautious regarding the difficulties that may appear on the way to success. </p>
          <p>Success in life comes from careful planning and hard-working. To plan means to pursue some aim and to be confident that it will come some time inevitably. </p>
          <p>In this way, one acquires a bigger faith in his own abilities and become more urgent in pursuing that aim. </p>
          <p>Another important priority of planning is that one can predict some of the difficulties that may arise during his work and in this way he can be better prepared for them. For instance if one desires to gain a better assignment within his office he must clarify his aim and plan everything in advance before taking great pains in pursuing it. </p>
          <p>Other advantage of planning is that one can dispose of his time in the most appropriate way in order to fulfill everything that is related to his views of success. It occurs very often in life that one should do a lot of things concomitantly - to look after his children, to work, to spend enough time with his dears and relatives, to find time for rest, etc. Thus only careful planning can make it possible for one to complete many tasks in a short time. </p>
          <p>Of course, both careful planning and mere taking risks have their strong and weak points but the former is more likely since it gives one more confidence in future success in his work, it helps one to overcome every impediment more easily and use his time in full value. </p>
