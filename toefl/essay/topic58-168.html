                <h3>Topic 58 Can business do anything they want to make a profit?</h3>
                <p>Can businesses do anything they want to make a profit? That is a complex and controversial issue. Some people think that businesses should do anything they can to make a profit, while other people believe that businesses should be honest while making a profit, not only for themselves but also for the community. I agree with the latter point of view and in the following paragraphs I will try to explain my position more clearly. </p>
                <p>First of all, I truly believe that one of the foremost important qualities of a successful business is honesty. Businesses should be honest because it can help to expand a client base and maintains a long-lasting partnership. No one wants to conduct business with a dishonest company. </p>
                <p>Secondly, not every business is ethical. For example, computer games are a very successful business, but they often impact children's behavior, and increase the cases of violence on the playground. Another example is companies like McDonald's that sell fast food to children. According to the Canadian Pediatric Society, a quarter of the children living in North America are now obese, a rate that tripled between 1981 and 1996. Therefore, some businesses can destroy our health, with only one goal in mind, and that is to increase profit. I believe it is an unacceptable situation and steps must be taken to make drastic changes. </p>
                <p>Thirdly, businesses should be beneficial to the community, because the profit they make comes from the community to begin with. A percentage of the profit should be returned to the community. Businesses should support and encourage the construction of playgrounds, schools and parks. </p>
                <p>Given the reasons discussed above, the conclusion, which may be intertwined at the beginning of the discussion and thus become more persuasive, may be safely reached that businesses should not only do what they can to make a profit, but also support and develop the community, with integrity and honor. </p>
