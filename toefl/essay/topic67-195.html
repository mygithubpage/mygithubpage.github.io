                <h3>Topic 67 Inexperienced, cheap workers or experienced workers?</h3>
                <p>To hire an inexperienced worker at a lower salary or an experienced worker at a higher salary, this is an interesting question for an employer. As far as I am concerned, a good employer will choose the latter without hesitation, because he knows an experienced worker deserves what he is paid. </p>
                <p>Qualified workers play the most important role in any business. The directors controls the business, the managers operate the business, whereas, it is nobody else but the workers who are expected and responsible to produce qualified products. Without those products the business will be a castle in the air. Thus qualified workers are indispensable for an employer. </p>
                <p>What makes a qualified worker? Undoubtedly, experience is one of the most valued merits. Experience means quality and efficiency; both of which guarantee a well-run business. It is true that the employer has to pay more for an experienced worker, but what such a worker brings to the employer is much more than he is paid. </p>
                <p>Admittedly, no one is born to be an experienced worker. A rookie is inevitably a rookie at his debut, and he needs opportunity to obtain the required experiences. Hence there must be some employers who are willing to provider them with such opportunities. </p>
                <p>In a word, for an employer, it is profitable to hire an experienced worker at a higher salary than to an inexperienced one at a lower salary. However, some wise employer may want to hire inexperienced workers with potential. </p>
