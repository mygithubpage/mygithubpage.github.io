          <h3>Topic 136 Is winning the most important aspect of playing a game?</h3>
          <p>Recently, many people argue as if it is a general truth that playing a game is fun only when you win. In various games and matches, the main aim of players from both sides seems to be winning. And winning is not only for the players themselves, but also for the honor of their team, and even for that of their nation. But to be frankly, I cannot agree with them. There are numerous reasons, and I would explore only a few primary ones here. </p>
          <p>The main problem with this argument is that the real meaning of a game is to enjoy the process of the game; the result, whether it is win or lose, does not seem matter. Think of the original games of our ancestors, the goal is to show their love of sports, their physical strength and celebrating the hunting. And the true intention of their game is for relaxation and amusement. Another good example is that children enjoy playing games more than adults. When we watch children play, we can understand that they are more concentrate on the game itself, and do not care for the result. There are to young to realize the importance of winning the game, therefore they enjoy it more. </p>
          <p>If the players play a game for winning, they will concentrate on scores too much, and forget to enjoy the game. In this society, everyone want to be winner, for they will not only win the honor, but also win fame, money, and so on. In the same way, the loser will lose everything. It seemed that playing a game become a way to get material comfort, but not fulfillment of spirit. </p>
          <p>Furthermore, when players play a game for winning, they face the stress from the team, even for the nation, and they struggle to win. Sometimes, players do everything by fair means or foul in order to win. They may use illegal drugs, or bribe the judges. There are various scandals about athlete almost in every international game, and this thing become more and more serious. These are all because the results of games have been linked to money and the honor of a country. </p>
          <p>General speaking, when you only want to win, you will lose the fun of playing a game. Taking into account of all these factors, we may reach the conclusion that, it is wiser to learn to enjoy playing without regard of the result of game. </p>
