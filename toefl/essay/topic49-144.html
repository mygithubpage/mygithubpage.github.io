                <h3>Topic 49 Face-to-face communication vs. emails or phone calls</h3>
                <p>With the rapid growth of high technology, computer, telephone and other communication tools have become more and more important in our daily life, so what people have gradually ignored face-to-face communication. </p>
                <p>If I were asked whether face-to-face communication is better than other forms of communications, such as email, phone calls or letters, I would choose email and phone calls. Here I am going to enumerate some reasons to support my choice. </p>
                <p>The main reason is that communication by telephone or by e-mail is more convenient. There is no need to make appointment with friends before meetings; all you need is just to remember their phone numbers or email addresses. </p>
                <p>Wherever you are and whenever it will be, communication is as easy as face-toface talking. Moreover, it is more efficient for people to communicate. </p>
                <p>Another important reason is that the way people connect by email can make more friends. I have many friends on the Internet and we communicate with each other regularly, so I have gained more information and knowledge in many other fields. </p>
                <p>Last but not least, indirect communication such as emails and phone calls can avoid direct confrontation and embarrassment. Sometimes we may not feel comfortable to borrow something or ask for a favor from our friends, because we are afraid of being rejected. At this time, an email or a phone call can be more convenient and can avoid embarrassment. </p>
                <p>If all these factors are contemplated, the advantages of communication through email or telephone carry more weight than those of face-to-face communication. </p>
