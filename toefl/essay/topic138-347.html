                <h3>Topic 138 Member vs. leader</h3>
                <p>I agree with the statement that being a member of a group is far better than being leader of the same due to that an individual can adapt certain qualities. </p>
                <p>Major among them are compromising abilities, sincerity and doing work perfectly free from external pressures. </p>
                <p>Firstly being a member of a team acquires the ability to compromise and to cooperate with other members. Both of which are very helpful for an individual to cope with future life and to develop strong characters. Teamwork by itself increases social skills and develops friendly attitude among teammates. Every member freely mingles with each other and shares his responsibility in times of need. For example if a co-worker falls sick, he is taken good care and other members will share upon his duty. </p>
                <p>Secondly comes sincerity, a member in team is always under strict control and supervision of the leader. As a result of which he is very careful not to make mistakes and performs his tasks accurately and attentively. For example, if a member in the group has to come to work at 9. 00am, he comes there well before time and never gives chance to anyone to comment that he arrived late. </p>
                <p>Finally comes the quality of work that is always done perfectly by a member because he is free from external pressures, unlike his team leader. Neither he need to worry about the outcome nor take the headaches of any failures in the future. So he does his best in doing work with complete satisfaction without worrying about the results. For example, many higher authorities and pressures of outcome of the game influence a captain in a baseball team. In doing so he may not perform up to the mark and may lose his concentration at the playground. On the other hand an ordinary player has no tensions and pressures and mostly he becomes the main person to win the game. </p>
                <p>In order to build a strong character by acquiring qualities like compromising, sincerity, and doing work perfectly with free mind it is better to be a member in a group rather leading it. </p>
