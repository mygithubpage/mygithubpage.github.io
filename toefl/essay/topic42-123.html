                <h3>Topic 42 What is a very important skill a person should learn?</h3>
                <p>"It is never too late to learn" is an English proverb meaning that people should never stop learning all his life. In other words, life is a process of constant learning, which enables an individual to make continuous progress to perfect him or her as a human being. Therefore, I deem the ability to learn is the most important skill of a person in the world today to achieve any accomplishments. </p>
                <p>We are living in an era of knowledge explosion. There are too many skills to be grasped by a single individual within a comparatively short period of time. </p>
                <p>Skills considered necessary nowadays include English, computer, driving, etc. </p>
                <p>It is not very likely for a fresh college graduate to be proficient in all these skills. The most possible occurrence is that a person first chooses his field of profession and then starts to master those required skills in his field. Thus, I argue that the ability to learn new skills is more essential than the skills themselves. </p>
                <p>Another reason for my avocation for the learning ability is that if a person is capable of acquiring new knowledge soon, he must be a smart, trainable and adaptable person who is what the rapidly developed society needs. In a society fraught with new difficulties and problems, a quick-witted person, when faced with them, will come up with solutions more easily than those who only know "the skills." That is why I believe the capacity to acquire knowledge carries more weight than "the knowledge" itself. </p>
                <p>In short, in a time teeming with many unprecedented events, the problemsolving ability or new knowledge-acquiring skill is the most crucial one necessary for a person who wants to be successful. </p>
