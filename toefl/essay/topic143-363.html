                <h3>Topic 143 A long vacation vs. several short vacations</h3>
                <p>If a student only has one vacation each year, even that is a long vacation, he or she will have to have a long boring school term after the vacation. I believe that students should have several short vacations throughout the year for several reasons. </p>
                <p>The first reason is that several short vacations mean several short school terms. </p>
                <p>The schools can arrange all year's curricula in several short terms more clearly, more efficiently and more effectively. Every subject will have a clear start and end, and can be taught intensely. Otherwise, it will be very difficult to arrange so many subjects in one long term. Schools may have to split the long term to fit in different courses, or let all the subjects take turns in one week. That really confuses the students. </p>
                <p>Another reason is that several short vacations are also good for parents to arrange. It's easy to deal with a short vacation than a long vacation. Parents can send their children to short term holiday camps, or just have them travel around. </p>
                <p>But it is almost impossible to let them do those activities throughout a long vacation. Needless to say, it's much easier to find a short time baby sitter. </p>
                <p>Furthermore, several short school terms can help to keep students' interest in study. Every time when they return to schools after a vacation, they will be refreshed and willing to learn. On the other hand, a long school term will make students feel bored and exhausted. </p>
                <p>On the other hand, a long vacation may have some benefits. For example, students can attend an after school like a summer school to learn some extra courses, or high school and college students can find a part-time job to make some extra money. Nevertheless, for all the reasons I mention above, only one vacation will make school life boring. So I support that students should have several short vacations throughout the year. </p>
