                <h3>Topic 90 What famous entertainer or athlete you would like to meet?</h3>
                <p>Many people dream to meet a famous entertainer or athlete. If I could meet such a person I would like that it be Bulgarian entertainer Slavi Trifonov, who presents evening show, " Slavi's show" on BTV channel, because of the following. </p>
                <p>First of all it would be interesting for me to meet the man, who had very big influence over the audience. Resent sociological researches show that more than two million people (the population of Bulgaria is around seven million people) watch his show every evening. Furthermore you could hear discussions about his show or jokes, which he told during the show, almost everywhere, in a public transportation, on a street or even at work. </p>
                <p>The second reason for which I would like to meet Slavi Trifonov is that in my opinion he is very brave man. He does not afraid to ridicule those Bulgarian politicians, who abuse their power for personal purposes, despite of personal threats, which he received several times. For example, a few months ago, he received a threat for making a hidden camera for a member of Bulgarian Parliament who did not want to pay a penalty for parking on an inappropriate place and who also offended a policeman. </p>
                <p>Last but not least, I would like to meet Slavi Trifonov, because he took in the past a leading role as one of the organizers of throwing down Gan Videnov's socialist government. Some days after the show "KU-KU" (in which he participated at that time and presented his political jokes and songs) was watched, the students' demonstrations against poverty, unemployment and high inflation rate began. Thanks to that the government resigned and new elections started a few months later. </p>
                <p>To sum up, I would like to meet the famous Bulgarian entertainer Slavi Trifonov, because he has a big influence over many Bulgarians, he is very brave and he was the organizer of an important historic event in modern history of my country. </p>
