                <h3>Topic 6 What would you change about your hometown?</h3>
                <p>I am from Arroz e Feijao, a small town in the northeast of Brazil. If I can change one thing about my home town, I would like to build a factory here. </p>
                <p>Building a factory in there will bring a lot of advantages and disadvantages, but I believe that Arroz e Feijao will mostly benefit from the building of a new factory because it is largely populated by poor people and the factory would bring many benefits to this small town. However, of course, a factory has disadvantages as well. </p>
                <p>As you know, factories usually bring pollution. If this factory is not managed very effectively and efficiently according to specific rules, it's prone to polluting the local air and water. What's more, factories usually make noise. </p>
                <p>Beside clean drinkable water and fresh air, an ideal community should be quiet. </p>
                <p>If the factory cannot maintain this standard to the community, it will not last long. A factory that is too noisy or pollutes too much will eventually be relocated to a new area. </p>
                <p>On the other hand, a factory could bring a lot of benefits to the community. So I would support the plan to build a factory to my community for all the reasons I will describe below. </p>
                <p>First of all, the construction of a factory will surely improve the local infrastructure. To run smoothly, the factory will have to have a steady, reliable supply of water and electricity. Some old pipes will be changed, and some facilities will be renovated. The residents' living standard get improved as a result of these widespread changes, an important benefit in Arroz e Feijao, where many people do not have access to clean water. </p>
                <p>Secondly, to make sure the shipping of materials and products and the employees' commute more convenient, the local roads will have to be rebuilt and broadened, resulting in improved public transportation. The town's residents can take a public bus to go shopping or go to work. As a result, air pollution and fuel consumption might be reduced. </p>
                <p>Most important, a factory's establishment will bring up a lot of employment opportunities for the community. A factory needs experts from various fields. </p>
                <p>The residents can take just a few minutes to go to the factory to work. So, the local residents can benefits from this factory. </p>
                <p>Generally speaking, I would like to build a factory near my community if I have a chance. If the factory can be managed successfully, the factory and the local residents can have benefit mutually. </p>
