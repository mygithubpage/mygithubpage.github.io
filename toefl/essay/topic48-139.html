                <h3>Topic 48 Why people work?</h3>
                <p>When talking about working, some people always complain a lot about it. They regard working as affliction that means hardship, vapidity and low earnings. </p>
                <p>They may even dream that they can also live a happy life without working. But as we all know, that won't come true. Everyone needs to work for many different reasons. I believe the three most common reasons are to acquire knowledge, to seek fame and to enjoy life. </p>
                <p>In the first place, we work to practice our skills and we have to learn many aspects of knowledge to solve the problems and to overcome difficulties. So working makes us skillful and effortless. The experiences we learn from working are the most important wealth. They are the major sources of wisdom. </p>
                <p>If we don't work, how can we improve our intelligence and then how can we expect a wonderful life? </p>
                <p>In the second place, we work to realize our value by producing large amount of goods and serving others. A farmer is not a farmer until he plant corps, a teacher is not a teacher until she teach classes. They all have their responsibilities and they also win our respects because of their contributions to the society. That's the meaning of life, which gives us courage and confidence to exert our powers to build a happy home. </p>
                <p>In addition, we work to keep us healthy. We can communicate with each other during work. Meanwhile, we are helped and encouraged. We have to work to relieve our pressure. When you do something you are very competent to, you will view it as a kind of entertainment. You even find joy from them. If we don't work, we will become torpid and fat. </p>
                <p>In conclusion, I believe that working is a tool by which we can make a key to the gate of knowledge; it is a road that leads to tomorrow, and it is a prescription that can keep us fit. All in all, working provides us so much that I love work. </p>
