                <h3>Topic 115 Making plans for free time</h3>
                <p>Some people prefer to plan activities for their free time very carefully. Others choose not to make any plans at all for their free time. In my opinion, I prefer to plan my free time carefully, since I can do more things, and I can enjoy myself more. </p>
                <p>First I will go over the advantages of not to making any plans for my free time. </p>
                <p>When I do not make plans, I do not feel restricted by a preset routine, and my activities can be more spontaneous. In addition, when I have no plans of my own, it is easier to adapt to what my friends and family members may be doing. </p>
                <p>For instance, if I find out that a friend wishes to go to the beach, I can adjust myself to his or her plans with perfect freedom. </p>
                <p>However, there are more advantages to planning activities for my leisure time very carefully. By making a careful plan I can do more things, because I am more organized and I do not waste time. Moreover, with a plan I can enjoy myself more. If I have planned ahead I am fully prepared for the activities I wish to engage in, and I have nothing to worry about. </p>
                <p>Personally, I feel that the advantages of planning activities for my free time very carefully are greater than the advantages of not making any plans at all. </p>
                <p>From these reasons discussed above, I prefer to plan activities for my leisure time very carefully. </p>
