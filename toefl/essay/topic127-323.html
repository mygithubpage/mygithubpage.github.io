                <h3>Topic 127 Reading fiction vs. watching movies</h3>
                <p>Watching movies is a much better option compared to reading fiction. So I disagree that reading fiction is more enjoyable than watching movies. In fact movies provide a first hand experience with real emotions. Also movies can be watched with the company of others, thus making for healthy relationships. </p>
                <p>Movies are generally much better received compared to novels or short stories. </p>
                <p>They tend to be much more exciting and surely provide real-time first hand experience. Reading fiction, more often than not, gives only vicarious pleasure. </p>
                <p>Also movies are a much better option for real emotions. The scenes, physiognomy of characters and background music all add up to a great experience. Howsoever good a piece of fiction is, it leaves much to be desired. </p>
                <p>The way movies exhibit a wide gamut of emotions and experiences are difficult to find in fiction books. </p>
                <p>Another major reason for movies being more enjoyable is that one can watch movies in company of others. No such sharing is possible in reading fiction. </p>
                <p>There is nothing like enjoying a movie with the person you love, or your family members, it provides the warmth to make for a pleasurable experience. </p>
                <p>In conclusion, I derive much greater fun, joy and excitement from watching movies, than by reading fiction. According to me, movies will always hold the upper hand. </p>
