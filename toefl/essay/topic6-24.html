                <h3>Topic 6 What would you change about your hometown?</h3>
                <p>Today, everything seems to change in split seconds. But, there is something that still lacks among every soul that resides in my hometown. And, I think you have got what I meant, cleanliness. These ideas of cleanliness in my opinion are divided into two types: external and internal cleanliness. </p>
                <p>I was born in Kuala Lumpur and have lived here all my life. The city that I see today is way too advanced and developed compared to when I was in primary school. Kuala Lumpur is well known for its magnificent and the most luxurious airport in the world. But, what is the use of having all these advancements when the sense of cleanliness among the citizens is still below average. In example, I have actually witnessed a man spitting on a beautiful pavement when there was a dustbin right next to him. </p>
                <p>Apart from what I have mentioned above, I would like to emphasize on internal cleanliness. Most people in Malaysia treat foreigners with good respect and hospitality. But, there are some people who would take advantage of these foreigners. For instance, shop owners raise the price of goods when foreigners visit their shops. I have actually witnessed a cab driver bargaining the ride fare with a foreign lady who was extremely tired after a daylong shopping with her young kids. I am trying to wonder, what has happened to the moral and the culture of our fellow Asians that we used to be so proud of? </p>
                <p>I understand that the government has taken lots of steps to improve the state of cleanliness within fellow Malaysians. I just hope that these steps were more comprehensive. We should cultivate the sense of cleanliness among each and every citizen in order to promise success to the planned manifesto. Last but not least, every citizen should willingly contribute to the efforts of maintaining cleanliness in their surroundings. We should not be self-centered when it comes to the matter of cleanliness because cleanliness ensures a healthy living. Think your deeds of maintaining cleanliness as a charity and start it from the steps of your home. At the end of the day, you will experience self-satisfaction towards your contribution to your hometown, as a wise person once said, "The greatest gift of charity is to give what is in your heart. </p>
