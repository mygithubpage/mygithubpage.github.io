                <h3>Topic 71 A high-paying job vs. quality spare time</h3>
                <p>Between a high-paying job with long hours and a lower-paying job with shorter hours, I will definitely choose a high-paying job with long hours, although I might have little time to spend with my family and friends. </p>
                <p>Firstly, money can help my dreams come true. I need a lot of money to do many things. I want to buy a huge house with a garden and a swimming pool. I also want to have an expensive car. Maybe my relatives need my financial assistance. Especially, I hope my family can have a kind of comfortable life. </p>
                <p>My children can go to a famous private university to get excellent education. If I have no money, all of my dreams cannot come true. </p>
                <p>In addition, to me, making a lot of money is a sign of success. I think that no one respects a poor man in today's society. From newspaper to television, almost all media focus on wealthy people instead of the poor. I cannot let the others consider me an incompetent man. </p>
                <p>Of course, making this choice means that I have to pay a price. Perhaps, I cannot spend too much time with my family and friends. But I never regret my decision because I believe that both my family and my friends can understand me. For my family, I think they should know whom I do this for. For my friends, they will think how success I am and they will proud of me. </p>
                <p>In conclusion, money is so important to me that I must choose a high-paying job regardless of the consequences it will cause. </p>
