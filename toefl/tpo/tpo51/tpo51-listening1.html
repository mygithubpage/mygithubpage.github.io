            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.53" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Listen to part of a <span class="underline">conversation</span> between a student and her <span class="underline">biology</span> professor.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.57" data-time="6.53">[00:06.53]</span>Professor:So, the <span class="underline">assignment</span> is to <span class="underline">reproduce</span> one of the animal <span class="underline">camouflage</span> experiments we read about in our textbook. <span class="time" data-times="2" data-time="13.1">[00:13.10]</span>Which experiment did you pick?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.92" data-time="15.1">[00:15.10]</span>Student:Well, I was wondering if I can try to <span class="underline">reproduce</span> an experiment that's......kind of the <span class="underline">opposite</span> of what was discussed in the textbook?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.49" data-time="23.02">[00:23.02]</span>Professor:So <span class="underline">instead</span> of how and why an animal might <span class="underline">hide</span> itself, you want to do something about why an animal might want to be seen? <span class="time" data-times="2.15" data-time="31.51">[00:31.51]</span>Em? Tell me more.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.55" data-time="33.66">[00:33.66]</span>Student:Well, I got the idea from one of the journals you said we should look at. <span class="time" data-times="5.74" data-time="37.21">[00:37.21]</span>It's an experiment about ah......they called them eyes bugs in the article?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.56" data-time="42.95">[00:42.95]</span>Professor:Eyes bugs, sure. <span class="time" data-times="7.26" data-time="44.51">[00:44.51]</span>The patterns on the wings of moths and butterflies that are generally believed to scare off predators because they look like big eyes?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.37" data-time="51.77">[00:51.77]</span>Student:Yeah. Except the article was about the experiment that disputes that <span class="underline">theory</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.98" data-time="56.14">[00:56.14]</span>Professor:Well, we know that the markings do scare the birds but the idea that the spots looked like eyes is......well, that is just a commonly held belief.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.21" data-time="66.12">[01:06.12]</span>Student:So, that's not <span class="underline">even</span> based on research?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="11.29" data-time="69.33">[01:09.33]</span>Professor:Well, this whole idea of moths and butterfly markings being scary because they looked like eyes, rest on how we imagine the predators, like birds, <span class="underline">perceive</span> the markings.<span class="time" data-times="2.17" data-time="80.62">[01:20.62]</span> And we can never really know that. <span class="time" data-times="3" data-time="82.79">[01:22.79]</span>All we can do is <span class="underline">observe</span> bird <span class="underline">behavior</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.55" data-time="85.79">[01:25.79]</span>But tell me more about the experiment.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.76" data-time="88.34">[01:28.34]</span>Student: Ok. It said the experiment looked at the shapes of the markings on moths' wings. <span class="time" data-times="8.23" data-time="93.1">[01:33.10]</span>The researchers <span class="underline">wanted</span> to know if the markings that were round and eye-shaped were more <span class="underline">effective</span> in deterring predators than <span class="underline">square</span> and <span class="underline">rectangular</span> markings.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.11" data-time="101.33">[01:41.33]</span>Professor: OK.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.5" data-time="102.44">[01:42.44]</span>Student:Yeah. So they attached food to paper models of moths with different shaped marks drawn on the wings to see how birds reacted. <span class="time" data-times="6.61" data-time="109.94">[01:49.94]</span>And what's interesting is they realized the round marks were not more <span class="underline">effective</span> in scaring bird than other shapes.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.89" data-time="116.55">[01:56.55]</span>Professor:Were they less <span class="underline">effective</span>?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.33" data-time="118.44">[01:58.44]</span>Student:No, they were about the same. <span class="time" data-times="6.46" data-time="120.77">[02:00.77]</span>But what researchers did <span class="underline">determine</span> is that larger markings were more <span class="underline">effective</span> than smaller markings in scaring off <span class="underline">prey</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.26" data-time="127.23">[02:07.23]</span>They call this <span class="underline">phenomenon</span> "<span class="underline">visual</span> aliveness".</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.13" data-time="130.49">[02:10.49]</span>Professor:<span class="underline">Visual</span> aliveness. Um. <span class="time" data-times="4.18" data-time="132.62">[02:12.62]</span>Well, I guess that it is not all that shocking if you think about it.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.64" data-time="136.8">[02:16.80]</span>Student:So anyway, is it ok? <span class="time" data-times="2.81" data-time="139.44">[02:19.44]</span>Can I repeat this experiment and write about it?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.21" data-time="142.25">[02:22.25]</span>Professor:Yes, I think that'll work. <span class="time" data-times="3.7" data-time="144.46">[02:24.46]</span>The problem I <span class="underline">proceed</span> is......well......where? <span class="time" data-times="5.13" data-time="148.16">[02:28.16]</span>This is an <span class="underline">urban</span> <span class="underline">campus</span>, you'll have a hard time finding a good place to set up the experiment.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.88" data-time="153.29">[02:33.29]</span>Student:Oh, I wasn't planning on doing it on <span class="underline">campus</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.6" data-time="156.17">[02:36.17]</span>I'm going home for <span class="underline">spring</span> <span class="underline">break</span> and my family lives in the country, far from the near city. <span class="time" data-times="1.83" data-time="160.77">[02:40.77]</span>I can set it up in the backyard.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.06" data-time="162.6">[02:42.60]</span>Professor:Good idea. <span class="time" data-times="6.33" data-time="163.66">[02:43.66]</span>Except one week is not a lot of time, so you will need to make some adjustments to have enough <span class="underline">data</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="169.99">[02:49.99]</span>I'd set up the experiment near bird feeder and get in as much <span class="underline">observation</span> time as you can.</p>
