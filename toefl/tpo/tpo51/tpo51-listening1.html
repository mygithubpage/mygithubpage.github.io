And we can never really know that. All we can do is to observe bird behavior. But tell me more about the experiment.</p><p>The teacher here said that we humans think that the pattern of eye shape on moths and butterflies would scare away predators because we think that birds will perceive this pattern as the shape of the eyes. This is a common assumption for people, but it is actually It is impossible for us humans to know how these birds view this pattern. Option C meets. Option A says that these patterns will be hidden, Option B says that these patterns will appeal to certain types of birds, and Option D says that butterflies and moths courtship through this pattern do not match.

But what reporter did determine is that the larger markings were more effective than next markings that scaring off prey. They call this phenomenon "visual aliveness".</p><p>The students here mentioned two results of the experiment in the magazine: The first is that the patterns of different shapes do not have different effects on the repulsive birds, and the second is that the size of the patterns will have an effect on the effects of deterring birds.

Except one week is not a lot of time, so you will need to make some adjustments to have enough data. I'd set up the experiment near bird feeder and get in as much observation time as you can.</p><p>The professor here mentioned the bird feeder because he felt that the student's spring break was only one week, and the time may be insufficient for experimentation. Therefore, the experimental setup needs to be improved to get enough data within a week. One of the changes to the experimental setup was to experiment around bird feeders. So this strategy is to make students' experiments easier to succeed. Option A is appropriate. Option B is to recommend a place in the school that is suitable for experimentation. Option C is to discuss another experiment with amazing results. Option D says that in order to point out the deficiencies in the original experiment, it does not follow the original meaning.
