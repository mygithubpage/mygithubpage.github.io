        <article>
          <p>Humans have long been fascinated by elephants, the largest land animal in the modern world. Social animals that live in herds, elephants are native to both Africa and Asia. Their large ears, long trunk, and long life span have made elephants one of the most captivating creatures on Earth. Our long-standing interest in elephants has led to several beliefs about surprising elephant behaviors.</p>
          <p>Elephants Are Aware of Approaching Death</p>
          <p>One of the popular beliefs is that when elephants become old and weak, they know that they are nearing the end of their lives. They demonstrate this by breaking away from their herds and going off alone to certain locations often found near bodies of water - so called "elephant graveyards" - to die alone. The idea that old elephants seem aware that they will die soon is supported by the discovery of many sites containing bones exclusively of elderly elephants.</p>
          <p>Representing Objects through Art</p>
          <p>Additionally, elephants seem to have artistic ability. Elephants can be taught to hold a paintbrush in their trunk and use it to paint on a canvas. Some elephants have been known to paint drawings that represent recognizable things: flowers, other elephants, even themselves. This talent makes elephants the only animal other than humans to produce art representing the world around them.</p>
          <p>Fear of Mice</p>
          <p>Finally, it has long been believed that elephants have a fear of mice. In 77 C.E., the Roman philosopher and scientist Pliny the Elder wrote that elephants are more afraid of mice, small mammals that can do elephants no harm, than of the much more dangerous animals with which elephants normally share an environment, such as lions or tigers. In a recent scientific experiment in which a herd of elephants was confronted with several mice, the elephants backed away from the mice and left the area to avoid them. </p>

          <p>Elephants are fascinating but the beliefs you just read about are based on misunderstandings of elephant behavior. </p>
          <p>First we should not assume that old elephants are aware they will die soon just because they break away from their herds. There's a very practical reason why old elephants leave their herds. You see when elephants get old enough their teeth become worn down and they have difficulty chewing so elderly elephants wander away from their herd to look for softer vegetation that's easier to eat. Softer vegetation is usually found in your water that's why many old elephants graze near water and eventually die there and areas we've come to call elephant graveyard. </p>
          <p>Second the issue of whether elephants have artistic ability. If you watch elephants trained to paint you'll notice that a human trainers stroking the elephant's ears whenever the elephant moves the paint brush. Elephant ears are very sensitive and touching them in certain ways can be used to train the elephants to do tricks. The trainer teaches the elephant to remember certain patterns of paint brush strokes. And that encourages the elephant to repeat the brush strokes by touching its ears. So an elephant using a paint brush is just painting lines it's been trained to paint. It doesn't necessarily know that the lines are supposed to represent flowers or animals. </p>
          <p>Third Pliny the elder and others are misinterpreting the reaction of elephants to mice. Elephants that react fearfully to mice aren't reacting to the mice themselves but to the fact that the mice are unfamiliar to them. Being cautious about unfamiliar animals is a natural instinct. But elephants that live in environments where mice are comin like elephants in zoos don't react with fear to the money's. Clearly once elephants become familiar with mice and realize that they don't pose a threat they don't mind them.</p>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>In the reading, the article introduces three surprising beliefs about elephant behaviors. However, in the listening, the professor gives out three reasons why these beliefs can't stand. First, the reading says that elephants are aware of approaching death. Nevertheless, the listening points out that the true reason why an elephant may break away from the herd is that their teeth become worn out and the animal has to seek for softer plants as their food resources. Therefore, they would get close to the water where soft plants usually occur and finally die there. Second, the reading asserts that elephants have artistic ability and know how to represent objects through art. However, the listening again rejects this statement. According to the lecture, in order to train elephants to paint, the painters will stroke elephant's ears and help them to memorize certain patterns of paintbrush strokes. In this way, elephant would harness the capacity to draw lines that they are taught to paint. But the thing is that they are just programmed to draw these lines and don't have any idea of what these lines represent. Third, the reading says that the elephants have a fear of mice. But the listening also disputes this because it supposes the reason why elephants try to avoid mice is that mice are unfamiliar to them not that they are afraid of them. Those elephants living in the zoo don't show any fright of mice because mice are always around them and they get used to these small creatures very much. In another word, once elephants are accustomed to mice, they wouldn't mind if they are around or not. In a nutshell, by giving all these three reasons, the listening successfully goes against the reading article. </p>
