Something's tend to spread much quicker, um, for example, artistic, or architectural styles, such as domes used in architecture.</p><p>Here the professor mentioned the dome is to illustrate that the process of cultural proliferation is not only slow, but also fast, and the speed of cultural diffusion of different things is different. Option B is appropriate. Option A says to point out a style of architecture that is spread through merchant trips. Option C is to say that a project must have 0 to work.
