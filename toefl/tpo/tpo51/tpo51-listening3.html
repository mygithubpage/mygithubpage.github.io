              <span class="time" data-times="13.25" data-time="5">[00:05.00]</span>Professor:So one of the more <span class="highlight">common</span> topics that comes up in world <span class="highlight">history</span> because it's had a <span class="highlight">pretty</span> <span class="highlight">dramatic</span> effect on how different societies evolved over long periods of time is cultural <span class="highlight">diffusion</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.15" data-time="18.25">[00:18.25]</span>Now, cultural <span class="highlight">diffusion</span> is generally defined as the transmission of <span class="highlight">culture</span> from one society to another.<span class="time" data-times="8.42" data-time="25.4">[00:25.40]</span> And by <span class="highlight">culture</span>, we mean anything from <span class="highlight">artistic</span> styles to......um......you know, technology, science. <span class="time" data-times="2.56" data-time="33.82">[00:33.82]</span>So we use <span class="highlight">culture</span> very broadly. <span class="time" data-times="12.96" data-time="36.38">[00:36.38]</span>A <span class="highlight">common</span> means of this <span class="highlight">process</span> taking place is <span class="highlight">trade</span>, travelling merchants or trading hubs, places where people from various areas all come together and ideas get exchanged.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.66" data-time="49.34">[00:49.34]</span>Let's start with the example of the transmission of a number system, a system that used the number Zero, from South Asia into Western Europe.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9" data-time="60">[01:00.00]</span>Ok, so before this cultural <span class="highlight">diffusion</span> happened, the <span class="highlight">dominant</span> number system in Western Europe was the Roman Numeral System. <span class="time" data-times="11.15" data-time="69">[01:09.00]</span>The Roman Numeral System developed <span class="highlight">primarily</span> as a means of record-keeping, as a way to keep <span class="highlight">track</span> of <span class="highlight">commercial</span> transactions, um, taxes, censors' records, things of that <span class="highlight">sort</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.85" data-time="80.15">[01:20.15]</span>As a <span class="highlight">consequence</span>, this system started with the number One.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.55" data-time="85">[01:25.00]</span>Student:With One? Not with Zero?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.95" data-time="87.55">[01:27.55]</span>Professor:Right. See in Roman Numerals, Zero isn't really a value in and out itself. <span class="time" data-times="3.6" data-time="93.5">[01:33.50]</span>It wasn't used independently as a number on its own.<span class="time" data-times="4.18" data-time="97.1">[01:37.10]</span> If your <span class="highlight">primary</span> concerns just <span class="highlight">basic</span> types of record-keeping......</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4" data-time="101.28">[01:41.28]</span>Student:Oh, yeah. I guess you wouldn't need a Zero to <span class="highlight">count</span> <span class="highlight">livestock</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.62" data-time="105.28">[01:45.28]</span>Professor:Or to keep <span class="highlight">track</span> of green production or do a <span class="highlight">census</span>. <span class="time" data-times="11.1" data-time="108.9">[01:48.90]</span>And it wasn't an impediment as far as <span class="highlight">sort</span> of <span class="highlight">basic</span> <span class="highlight">engineering</span> was concerned either, um, to their <span class="highlight">ability</span> to <span class="highlight">construct</span> buildings, roads, <span class="highlight">stuff</span> like that.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.4" data-time="120">[02:00.00]</span>But other number systems developed in Asia, systems that do <span class="highlight">incorporate</span> Zero. <span class="time" data-times="5.12" data-time="126.4">[02:06.40]</span>The <span class="highlight">mathematics</span> these societies developed included things like <span class="highlight">negative</span> numbers. <span class="time" data-times="3.83" data-time="131.52">[02:11.52]</span>So you start to get more <span class="highlight">sophisticated</span> levels of <span class="highlight">mathematics</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="11.65" data-time="135.35">[02:15.35]</span>So one of the earliest written text sub <span class="highlight">mathematics</span>, that has Zero, <span class="highlight">negative</span> numbers, <span class="highlight">even</span> some <span class="highlight">sort</span> of <span class="highlight">basic</span> <span class="highlight">algebra</span>, is written in South Asia in the early 7th <span class="highlight">century</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4" data-time="147">[02:27.00]</span>This text makes its way into the Middle East, to Baghdad.<span class="time" data-times="5.5" data-time="151">[02:31.00]</span> And it's <span class="highlight">eventually</span> translated into Arabic by a Persian <span class="highlight">astronomer</span> and <span class="highlight">mathematician</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.5" data-time="156.5">[02:36.50]</span>Once he began his translation, he quickly realizes the <span class="highlight">advantage</span> of this system, the types of math that can be done. <span class="time" data-times="4.77" data-time="165">[02:45.00]</span>Soon, the text begins to be more widely circulated <span class="highlight">through</span> the Middle East. <span class="time" data-times="4.23" data-time="169.77">[02:49.77]</span>And other mathematicians start to <span class="highlight">advocate</span> using this number system.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5" data-time="174">[02:54.00]</span>So by the 10th <span class="highlight">century</span>, it's the <span class="highlight">dominant</span> system in the Middle East.<span class="time" data-times="6.77" data-time="179">[02:59.00]</span> And as a <span class="highlight">consequence</span>, <span class="highlight">algebra</span> and other more <span class="highlight">sophisticated</span> forms of <span class="highlight">mathematics</span> start to <span class="highlight">flourish</span>.<span class="time" data-times="7.89" data-time="185.77">[03:05.77]</span> Meanwhile, in Western Europe, the Roman Numeral System, a system without Zero, was still in place.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.34" data-time="193.66">[03:13.66]</span>In the late 12th <span class="highlight">century</span>, an Italian <span class="highlight">Mathematician</span> named Fibonacci was travelling in North Africa <span class="highlight">along</span> with his father, a <span class="highlight">merchant</span>.<span class="time" data-times="4.3" data-time="204">[03:24.00]</span> And while he's there, Fibonacci discovers this Arabic text. <span class="time" data-times="5.47" data-time="208.3">[03:28.30]</span>He translates the text into <span class="highlight">Latin</span>, and returns to Europe. <span class="time" data-times="9.93" data-time="213.77">[03:33.77]</span>And he promotes the <span class="highlight">adoption</span> of this number system because of the advantages in recording <span class="highlight">commercial</span> transactions, calculating interests, things of that nature. <span class="time" data-times="7.3" data-time="223.7">[03:43.70]</span> <span class="highlight">Within</span> the next <span class="highlight">century</span> and the half, that becomes the accepted <span class="highlight">dominant</span> number system in Western Europe.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4" data-time="231">[03:51.00]</span>Any questions? Robert?</p>

The famous Fibonacci <span class="highlight">sequence</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.85" data-time="244.7">[04:04.70]</span>Although he didn't actually invent it, it was just an example that had been used in your <span class="highlight">original</span> text. <span class="time" data-times="1.85" data-time="251.55">[04:11.55]</span>I mean, can you imagine? <span class="time" data-times="3.93" data-time="253.4">[04:13.40]</span>Introducing the <span class="highlight">concept</span> of Zero to Western Europe? <span class="time" data-times="3" data-time="257.33">[04:17.33]</span>And this is what you go down in <span class="highlight">history</span> for?</p>
