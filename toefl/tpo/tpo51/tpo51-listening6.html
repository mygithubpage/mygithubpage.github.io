            <span class="time" data-times="4.66" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Listen to part of a discussion in a <span class="highlight">history</span> of science class. <span class="time" data-times="4.34" data-time="4.66">[00:04.66]</span>The class is discussing the heliocentric <span class="highlight">theory</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="9.6" data-time="9">[00:09.00]</span>
            <span class="highlight">Male</span> Student:What I found really difficult to understand is why the heliocentric <span class="highlight">theory</span>, um, why wasn't like believed by everybody right away?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="8.4" data-time="18.6">[00:18.60]</span>Professor:Well, one thing that's hard to do is to <span class="highlight">sort</span> of see things from the <span class="highlight">perspective</span> of someone who's hearing that <span class="highlight">theory</span> for the first time. <span class="time" data-times="13.6" data-time="27">[00:27.00]</span>I mean today we <span class="highlight">tend</span> to <span class="highlight">assume</span> that the moment the heliocentric <span class="highlight">theory</span> was laid out, the idea that the Sun, not the Earth, was the center of the <span class="highlight">solar</span> system, that you know, you'd have to be in denial, not to accept it. <span class="time" data-times="1.7" data-time="40.6">[00:40.60]</span>But it really wasn't that easy.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.7" data-time="42.3">[00:42.30]</span>
            <span class="highlight">Male</span> Student:But the idea that the earth wasn't the center of the <span class="highlight">universe</span>......that has been tossed around for like centuries, right? <span class="time" data-times="2.3" data-time="49">[00:49.00]</span>I mean, lots of people would have the idea.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.55" data-time="51.3">[00:51.30]</span>Professor:Yes, that's true, going all the way back to the <span class="highlight">Ancient</span> Greeks. <span class="time" data-times="10.75" data-time="55.85">[00:55.85]</span>But in Europe, when Galileo championed it in the 17th <span class="highlight">century</span>, during part of his discoveries using a <span class="highlight">telescope</span>, there still was some <span class="highlight">major</span> <span class="highlight">resistance</span> to it.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.65" data-time="66.6">[01:06.60]</span>
            <span class="highlight">Male</span> Student:But I still don't understand why, I mean, isn't it <span class="highlight">obvious</span>?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="11.1" data-time="70.25">[01:10.25]</span>Professor:Well, despite Galileo's <span class="highlight">ingenious</span> arguments in support of the heliocentric <span class="highlight">theory</span>, there was still a lot of reasons why people of that period couldn't buy into it. <span class="time" data-times="7.25" data-time="81.35">[01:21.35]</span>Remember, we are talking about four hundred years ago, so ah, let's think about a few of those reasons, Ok?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="8.85" data-time="88.6">[01:28.60]</span>So, first of all, they could work out that if the Earth was going around the Sun, then it had to be traveling at many thousands of kilometers per hour. <span class="time" data-times="3.55" data-time="97.45">[01:37.45]</span>And that was just beyond anything anyone could understand. <span class="time" data-times="7" data-time="101">[01:41.00]</span>You know, they could understand riding a horse or walking, maybe they could get up to 30, 32 kilometers per hour. <span class="time" data-times="3.2" data-time="108">[01:48.00]</span>But tens of thousands of kilometers per hour?<span class="time" data-times="1.6" data-time="111.2">[01:51.20]</span> That was just <span class="highlight">crazy</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.2" data-time="112.8">[01:52.80]</span>So, to many people, whatever is going on, it couldn't be that.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.2" data-time="118">[01:58.00]</span>
            <span class="highlight">Female</span> Student:Um... So people didn't believe the heliocentric <span class="highlight">theory</span> because it was so hard to believe?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.8" data-time="124.2">[02:04.20]</span>Professor:Exactly. But, there were more <span class="highlight">scientific</span> kinds of reactions as well. <span class="time" data-times="10" data-time="129">[02:09.00]</span>Because, look, if you have ever been on a carousel or you are on a ride at an <span class="highlight">amusement</span> park and you are on something that is going round round and round, two things, alright?<span class="time" data-times="2.9" data-time="139">[02:19.00]</span>One, you know you are moving, there is no <span class="highlight">doubt</span>.<span class="time" data-times="7.4" data-time="141.9">[02:21.90]</span>And the other thing is, you know that unless you hold on tight, you are <span class="highlight">gonna</span> go flying out because of <span class="highlight">centrifugal</span> force, right?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="7.73" data-time="149.3">[02:29.30]</span>
            <span class="highlight">Female</span> Student:So, if I understand you for the <span class="highlight">average</span> person 400 hundred years ago there was no <span class="highlight">evidence</span> that we are moving at higher speed, right?<span class="time" data-times="4.35" data-time="157.03">[02:37.03]</span>Since everything was securely on the ground and no one was flying off into <span class="highlight">space</span>?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.4" data-time="161.38">[02:41.38]</span>Professor:Yes. And in <span class="highlight">particular</span>. <span class="time" data-times="12.22" data-time="163.78">[02:43.78]</span>And this was one <span class="highlight">specific</span> difficulty for people in the period, <span class="highlight">even</span> if they thought that there was some <span class="highlight">sort</span> of force that maybe kept you and me and buildings and things on the surface of the Earth. <span class="time" data-times="6" data-time="176">[02:56.00]</span>Their <span class="highlight">theory</span> about the nature of the <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span> was that nothing was holding it down. <span class="time" data-times="10.15" data-time="182">[03:02.00]</span>So if, if you can understand that way of thinking, then clearly, if the Earth, was moving at a great speed, we should've lost all our <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span> a long time ago. <span class="time" data-times="3.85" data-time="192.15">[03:12.15]</span>You know, it would be like, trailing away behind us. <span class="time" data-times="13" data-time="196">[03:16.00]</span>And so, I want to try a little <span class="highlight">sort</span> of experiment, because, I, I think that what we will find is that some of us have ideas about <span class="highlight">motion</span> that actually fit with anti-heliocentrism.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.92" data-time="209">[03:29.00]</span>
            <span class="highlight">Male</span> Student:Anti-heliocentrism? <span class="time" data-times="2.26" data-time="211.92">[03:31.92]</span>No way. It's the 21st <span class="highlight">century</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.42" data-time="214.18">[03:34.18]</span>Professor:Well, then let's see.<span class="time" data-times="2.7" data-time="216.6">[03:36.60]</span> So, picture the following. <span class="time" data-times="5" data-time="219.3">[03:39.30]</span>You are at the <span class="highlight">equator</span>, moving at 1600 kilometers per hour. Ok?<span class="time" data-times="4.8" data-time="224.3">[03:44.30]</span> And you <span class="highlight">drop</span> something, small and light, like a matchstick for example. <span class="time" data-times="1.9" data-time="229.1">[03:49.10]</span>Where is it going to land?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.7" data-time="231">[03:51.00]</span>
            <span class="highlight">Male</span> Student:That's easy. It will be long gone. <span class="time" data-times="5.2" data-time="233.7">[03:53.70]</span>The matchstick is so light that it will fly right out of my hand and end up away behind me somewhere.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.7" data-time="238.9">[03:58.90]</span>Professor:Ah, actually, that matchstick you dropped, it'll land right at your feet.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="0.80000000000001" data-time="245.6">[04:05.60]</span>
            <span class="highlight">Male</span> Student:What?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.2" data-time="246.4">[04:06.40]</span>Professor:Well, let's think about it. <span class="time" data-times="15.4" data-time="248.6">[04:08.60]</span>If I got to <span class="highlight">consider</span> that the Earth's rotating at 1600 kilometer per hour at the <span class="highlight">equator</span>, and you, me, the <span class="highlight">air</span>, and that matchstick will all moving together at the same speed, <span class="highlight">even</span> though it doesn't <span class="highlight">seem</span> or look or feel like we are moving. <span class="time" data-times="10.6" data-time="264">[04:24.00]</span>So class, clearly, <span class="highlight">even</span> today, we actually have some <span class="highlight">inclination</span> to think that if the Earth were moving around at a great speed, we all would see signs of it. <span class="time" data-times="6.4" data-time="274.6">[04:34.60]</span>Perhaps now you are less <span class="highlight">inclined</span> to dismiss those who once found heliocentrism so hard to believe. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="281">[04:41.00]</span>Ok, let's move on.</p>
