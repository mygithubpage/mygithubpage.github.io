To explain why some people resisted the heliocentric theory</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The source of this question is:</p><p>Professor:</p><p>Well, despite Galileo's ingenious arguments in support of the heliocentric theory, there was still a lot of conditions why people of that period couldn't buy into it. Remember, we are talking about four hundred years ago, so ah, let's think about a Few of those reasons, Ok?</p><p>The professor here clearly stated that to start discussing why the heliocentric theory is not believed by previous people, Option D is appropriate. Option A was meant to compare the ancient and modern theory of the solar system. Option B was meant to speak of the astronomical studies accepted by the heliocentric theory. Option C was to evaluate changes in astronomy in the seventeenth century. Select D.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What do the examples of riding a horse and walking represent?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Speeds that people were familiar with</p><p>B. Demonstrations of movement that Galileo used in an experiment</p><p>C. The movement of the planets across the sky</p><p>D. Types of motion that can be felt</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The source of this question is:</p><p>Professor:</p><p>So, first of all, they could work out that if the Earth was going around the Sun, then it had to be traveling at many thousands of kilometers per hour. And that was just beyond any anything that anyone could understand. You know, they could understand Riding a horse or walking, maybe they could get up to 30, 32 kilometers per hour. But tens of thousands of kilometers per hour? That was just crazy. So, so many people, whatever is going on, it couldn't be that .</p><p>The example cited here by professors of horse riding and walking is to say that these are the speeds that people are familiar with. As for the speed of thousands of kilometers and an hour of the earth running around the sun, they are unfamiliar and cannot believe it. Option A is appropriate. Option B is an explanation of Galileo's exercise in the experiment. Option C is a movement of the planets in the sky. Option D is a movement that can be felt. It is not appropriate. Select A.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What point does the professor make when he discusses a ride at an amusement park?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. That some people thought Earth's orbit was perfectly round</p><p>B. That people expect to be affected by centrifugal force</p><p>C. That some things can appear to move when they are not moving</p><p>D. That moving at high speeds is not always dangerous</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The source of this question is:</p><p>Professor:</p><p>There, more Things, alright? One, you know you are moving, there is no doubt. And the other thing is, you know that unless you hold on tight, you are gonna go flying out because of centrifugal force, right?</p><p>The example taught here is to show that people actually understand the effects of centrifugal force during rotation. For example, everyone knows that if they do not hold tight, they will be thrown out. Option B is correct. Option A says that some people think that the Earth's orbit is not perfectly round. Option C says that some immovable things appear to be moving. Option D says that high-speed motion is not always dangerous and is not appropriate. Select B.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor, 400 years ago what was believed to be true about Earth's atmosphere?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It prevented high-speed motion of objects on Earth.</p><p>B. It would only move if Earth moved.</p><p>C. It was not affected by the motion of the Sun.</p><p>D. It was not held down by any force.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The source of this question is:</p><p>Professor:</p><p>Their theory about the nature of the atmosphere was that nothing was holding it down. So if, can you can understand that way of thinking, then clearly, if the Earth, was moving at a great speed, we should have lost all our atmosphere a Long time ago.</p><p>The professor here said that 400 years ago people believed that the atmosphere would not be dragged down by force. Option D is correct. Option A says that the atmosphere prevents high-speed movement of objects on Earth, Option B says that only the Earth's moving atmosphere will move, and Option C says that atmospheric movement is not affected by the movement of the Sun. Select D.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor talk about dropping a matchstick?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

To illustrate how natural it is to have antiheliocentric beliefs</p><p>D. To identify the inspiration for antiheliocentrism</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The source of this question is:</p><p>Professor:</p><p>Well, then let's see. So, picture the following. You are at the equator, moving at 1600 kilometers per hour. Ok? And you drop something, small and light, like a matchstick for example. Where is it going to land?</p><p>The</p><p>Male Student:</p><p>That's easy. It will be long gone. The matchstick is so light that it will fly right out of my hand and end up away after me somewhere.</p><p>The</p><p>Professor:</p><p>Ah, actually, that matchstick you dropped, It will land right at your feet.</p><p>Here is an example of professors throwing matches to prove that even in the current 21st century, many people still hold some wrong and anti-Japanese opinions, and everyone naturally holds this wrong view. Option C is correct. Option A is to infer that the equator is the most appropriate place to test gravity. Option B is to say that in order to explain the speed at which the atmosphere affects the falling of objects, Option D means that it is not appropriate to determine the source of inspiration for the anti-Japanese psyche. Select C.</p></div></div><div class="replay" id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor mean when he says this:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Some arguments for heliocentrism made sense to many scientists.</p><p>B. Some reactions to heliocentrism served to refine the theory.</p><p>C. Some arguments against heliocentrism were supported by observation.</p><p>D. Some scientists who rejected heliocentrism accepted it later.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The source of this question is:</p><p>Female Student:</p><p>Um... So people didn't believe the heliocentric theory because it was so hard to believe?</p><p>The</p><p>Professor:</p><p>There, more Things, alright? One, you know you are moving, there is no doubt. And the other thing is, you know that unless you hold on tight, you are gonna go flying out because of centrifugal force, right?</p><p>The</p><p>The professor here said that with respect to the heliocentric, some people still have some more scientific responses. The example he gave later is to illustrate that people have found some false beliefs that do not meet the heliocentric theory through the observation of the rotational movements in daily life. Option C is appropriate. Option A is to say that some heliocentric views are justified for many scientists. Option B is to say that some feedback on heliocentric theory has improved the theory. Option D is to say that some scientists originally opposed the heliocentric theory. Later they accepted it. . Select C.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
