In Europe as a whole, the <span class="highlight">population</span> rose from 188 million in 1800 to 400 million in 1900. By 1900, <span class="highlight">virtually</span> every area of Europe had contributed to the <span class="highlight">tremendous</span><span class="highlight">surge</span> of <span class="highlight">population</span>, but each <span class="highlight">major</span><span class="highlight">region</span> was at a different <span class="highlight">stage</span> of <span class="highlight">demographic</span> change.</p><p>Improvements in the food <span class="highlight">supply</span> continued trends that had started in the late seventeenth <span class="highlight">century</span>. New lands were put under <span class="highlight">cultivation</span>, while the use of crops of American <span class="highlight">origin</span>, particularly the potato, continued to <span class="highlight">expand</span>. Setbacks did <span class="highlight">occur</span>. Regional agricultural failures were the most <span class="highlight">common</span> cause of <span class="highlight">economic</span> recessions until 1850, and they could <span class="highlight">lead</span> to localized <span class="highlight">famine</span> as well. A <span class="highlight">major</span> potato blight (<span class="highlight">disease</span>) in 1846-1847 led to the deaths of at <span class="highlight">least</span> one million persons in Ireland and the <span class="highlight">emigration</span> of another million, and Ireland never recovered the <span class="highlight">population</span> levels the potato had <span class="highlight">sustained</span> to that point. Bad <span class="highlight">grain</span> harvests at the same time led to increased hardship <span class="highlight">throughout</span> much of Europe.</p><p>After 1850, however, the <span class="highlight">expansion</span> of foods more regularly <span class="question4">kept pace with</span><span class="highlight">population</span> growth, though the poorer classes remained <span class="highlight">malnourished</span>. Two developments were <span class="highlight">crucial</span>. First, the <span class="highlight">application</span> of science and new technology to <span class="highlight">agriculture</span> increased. Led by German universities, increasing research was devoted to improving seeds, developing chemical fertilizers, and advancing <span class="highlight">livestock</span>. After 1861, with the <span class="highlight">development</span> of land-grant universities in the United States that had huge agricultural programs, American crop-production research added to this mix. Mechanization included the use of <span class="highlight">horse-drawn</span> harvesters and seed drills, many developed <span class="highlight">initially</span> in the United States. It also included <span class="highlight">mechanical</span> cream separators and other food-processing devices that improved <span class="highlight">supply</span>.</p><p>The <span class="highlight">second</span><span class="highlight">development</span> involved industrially based <span class="highlight">transportation</span>. With trains and steam shipping, it became possible to move foods to <span class="highlight">needy</span> regions <span class="highlight">within</span> Western Europe quickly. <span class="highlight">Famine</span> (as <span class="highlight">opposed</span> to <span class="highlight">malnutrition</span>) became a thing of the past. Many Western European countries, headed by Britain, began also to <span class="highlight">import</span> increasing amounts of food, not only from Eastern Europe, a <span class="highlight">traditional</span><span class="highlight">source</span>, but also from the Americas, Australia, and New Zealand. Steam shipping, which improved speed and <span class="highlight"><span class="question6">capacity</span></span>, as well as new procedures for <span class="highlight">canning</span> and refrigerating foods (particularly after 1870), was <span class="highlight">fundamental</span> to these developments.</p><p>Europe's <span class="highlight">population</span> growth included one <span class="highlight">additional</span><span class="highlight">innovation</span> by the nineteenth century: it combined with rapid <span class="highlight">urbanization</span>. More and more Western Europeans moved from countryside to city, and big cities grew most rapidly of all. By 1850, over half of all the people in England lived in cities, a first in human <span class="highlight">history</span>. In one <span class="highlight">sense</span>, this <span class="highlight">pattern</span> seems <span class="highlight"><span class="question8">inevitable</span></span> growing numbers of people pressed <span class="highlight">available</span> resources on the land, <span class="highlight">even</span> when farmwork was combined with a bit of manufacturing, so people crowded into cities seeking work or other resources. Traditionally, however, death rates in cities <span class="question10">surpass</span>ed those in the countryside by a large <span class="highlight">margin</span>; cities had maintained <span class="highlight">population</span> only <span class="highlight">through</span><span class="highlight">steady</span> in-migration. Thus rapid <span class="highlight">urbanization</span> should have reduced <span class="highlight">overall</span><span class="highlight">population</span> growth, but by the middle of the nineteenth <span class="highlight">century</span> this was no longer the case. <span class="highlight">Urban</span> death rates remained high, particularly in the lower-class slums, but they began to <span class="highlight">decline</span> rapidly.</p><p>The greater reliability of food supplies was a <span class="highlight">factor</span> in the <span class="highlight">decline</span> of <span class="highlight">urban</span> death rates. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span><span class="highlight">Even</span> more important were the gains in <span class="highlight">urban</span><span class="highlight">sanitation</span>, as well as measures such as <span class="highlight">inspection</span> of housing. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> Reformers, including enlightened doctors, began to study the causes of high death rates and to <span class="highlight">urge</span><span class="highlight">remediation</span>. <span class="highlight">Even</span> before the discovery of germs, beliefs that <span class="highlight">disease</span><span class="highlight">spread</span> by "miasmas" (<span class="highlight">noxious</span> forms of bad <span class="highlight">air</span>) prompted <span class="highlight">attention</span> to sewers and open <span class="highlight">garbage</span>; Edwin Chadwick led an <span class="highlight">exemplary</span><span class="highlight">urban</span><span class="highlight">crusade</span> for <span class="highlight">underground</span> sewers in England in the 1830s. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span><span class="highlight">Gradually</span>, public health provisions began to cut into customary <span class="highlight">urban</span><span class="highlight">mortality</span> rates. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span> By 1900, in some parts of Western Europe life expectancy in the cities began to <span class="highlight">surpass</span> that of the <span class="highlight">rural</span> areas. <span class="highlight">Industrial</span> societies had figured out ways to <span class="highlight">combine</span> large and growing cities with <span class="highlight">population</span> growth, a <span class="highlight">development</span> that would soon <span class="highlight">spread</span> to other parts of the world.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 1, which of the following is true about Europe in the nineteenth century?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. A large increase in food production led to industrialization.</p><p>B. Population changes occurred at the same pace in the major regions.</p><p>C. The standard of living rose to the level of that in most parts of the world.</p><p>D. The tremendous rise in population led to greater agricultural output in every region.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The title is factual information. Question Q: Which of the following is correct about Europe in the 19th century?</p><p>Option A: The increase in food production has led to industrialization. Correctly, because the first sentence of the first paragraph says "a huge increase in agricultural output without which industrialization would have been impossible", indicating that agricultural output is a prerequisite for industrialization, so the A option is the correct answer.</p><p>Option B: The pace of demographic changes in major regions is consistent. The error corresponds to "but each major region was at a different stage of demographic change" in the last sentence of the first paragraph, so the B option is completely contradictory to the original and excluded.</p><p>Option C: The standard of living improves to the same level as the rest of the world. Error, corresponding to "Western Europeans by the laws half of the nineteenth century enjoyed higher standards of living and longer, healthier lives than most of the world's peoples." as stated in the first sentence of the first paragraph. Europeans have a higher standard of living, so C is excluded.</p><p>Option D: The large population growth has led to an increase in agricultural output value in various regions. According to the contents of the first paragraph, it is the development of agriculture that promotes population growth. Therefore, the D option logic is reversed. exclude.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 2, which of the following caused the food supply to increase in most of Western Europe during the nineteenth century?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Replacement of seventeenth-century farming techniques with more modern ones</p><p>B. Improved grain harvests in most European countries</p><p>C. Reduced demand for food as a result of a decreased population</p><p>D. Use of new land to grow crops</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The title is factual information. Question What is the reason for the increase in food production in Western Europe in the 19th century? Corresponding to the second sentence of the second paragraph, "New lands were put under cultivation, while the use of crops of American origin, particularly the potato, continued to expand." This sentence says that people open up new land for farming and grow native crops. The scale continues to expand. Option D: Open up new land to grow crops, in line with the text, it is the correct answer.</p><p>Option A: Replace 17th-century farm technology with more advanced equipment. In the second paragraph, only the first sentence mentions the 17th century, "Improvements in the food supply continues trends that had started in the late seventeenth century." But this sentence says that the increase in food supply continues the trend since the end of the 17th century. Did not mention the technology, so the A option was not mentioned, excluded.</p><p>Option B: Increased food in most parts of Europe. The question is what is the reason for the growth of grain production in Western Europe in the 19th century? The B option re-stated the question again and answered it without asking.</p><p>Option C: As the population declines, so does food demand. The error, because the C option is the result of the failure of agriculture, is the main content of the second half of the second paragraph, has nothing to do with this topic, is unrelated to interference information, so the C option is excluded.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>In paragraph 2, why does the author mention the potato blight that occurred in Ireland?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To identify a crop that was more successful in the United States than it was in Western Europe</p><p>B. To support a claim about regional agricultural failures</p><p>C. To give an example of a problematic trend that had started in the late seventeenth century</p><p>D. To provide evidence that many countries in Europe experienced a loss of population in the nineteenth century</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>This question is title of function. Question Q: Why did the author mention potato late blight? The example is definitely to support or explain the point of view, so we went ahead and found the phrase "Setbacks did occur. Regional agricultural failures were the most common cause of economic recessions until 1850, and they could lead to localized famine as well." The example of blight is to illustrate the consequences of agricultural failure. Therefore, the B option is correct.</p><p>Option A: Demonstrates that a crop is more successful in the United States than in Western Europe. The mistake, the example of potatoes is not to illustrate the success of planting crops. On the contrary, this is a failure of agriculture, resulting in the death of many people, so the A option was ruled out.</p><p>Option C: An example of the trend from the end of the 17th century is problematic. The phrase "In the food supply continuing trends that had started in the late seventeenth century." at the beginning of the third paragraph only serves to illustrate that the food supply has been improving since the end of the 17th century. The "potato blight" is an example of agricultural failure. It has nothing to do with the food supply trend since the 17th century, so the C option is excluded.</p><p>Option D: Provide evidence that the population of many countries in Europe declined in the 19th century. The decline in population is the result of the failure of agriculture caused by "potato blight". It is "potato blight" that leads to "the loss of population". It is not used to prove that the population is declining, so the D option is logically incorrect and excluded.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The phrase "<span class="highlight"><span class="question4">kept pace with</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. exceeded</p><p>B. matched the increase in</p><p>C. increased the rate of</p><p>D. caused</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>This question is a vocabulary question. "Kept pace with" means "to keep up," and we took the words into the original text. "Aft 1850, however, the expansion of foods more periodically <span class="question4">kept pace with</span> population growth, though the poorer classes remained malnourished." Yes, "However, after 1850, the increase in food slowly follows the pace of population growth, although the poor are still malnourished." Let's take a look at the options:</p><p>A option: exceeded, meaning "exceeds", meaning does not match, so ruled out.</p><p>Option B: matched the increase in, meaning "matching with the growth of ...", the meaning is consistent, it is the correct answer.</p><p>C option: increased the rate of, meaning "increased ... rate", meaning does not match, so ruled out.</p><p>D option: caused, meaning "cause, cause", meaning does not match, so ruled out.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 3, all of the following factors helped the supply of food meet the needs of a growing population EXCEPT</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. increased agricultural research in Germany</p><p>B. introduction of new crops</p><p>C. development of food-processing devices</p><p>D. agricultural programs in universities in the United States</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>This question is a negative factual information question.

The fourth sentence of the third paragraph is positioned "Led by German universities, increasing research was devoted to improving seeds, developing chemical fertilizers, and advancing livestock."</p><p>Option B: Introducing new crops. This information was not mentioned in the third paragraph and is therefore the correct answer.</p><p>Option C: Development of food processing equipment. The last sentence of the third paragraph was positioned "It also includes mechanical cream separators and other food-processing devices that improving supply." Mentioned mechanical cream separators and other food processing equipment to raise the supply level, so the C option was mentioned in the original text, exclude.</p><p>D option: American university agricultural project. Corresponding to the phrase "After 1861, with the development of land-grant technologies in the United States that had huge agricultural programs, American crop-production research added to this mix." mentioned in the sentence, the land grant university has a huge agricultural project. , so the D option is in accordance with the original text, excluded.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question6">capacity</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. variety of goods</p><p>B. distance</p><p>C. reliability</p><p>D. available storage space</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" D"><p>This question is a vocabulary question.

The fourth paragraph mainly describes the impact of transportation. According to the keyword "famine" in the title, we locate the third sentence "Famine (as opposed to malnutrition) became a thing of the past." Looking further ahead, in the previous sentence, people can be transported by train and steamship. Rapidly transport food to impoverished areas in Western Europe. This shows that the progress of transportation can solve the problem of famine, so the C option is correct.</p><p>A option: reduction in malnutrition. "malnutrition" appears in brackets in the sentence "Famine (as opposed to malnutrition) became a thing of the past." to explain that famine and malnutrition are two different concepts. There is no mention of malnutrition in the text. The decrease, so the A option is irrelevant information, exclude.</p><p>Option B: Create more storage facilities. The fourth paragraph did not mention this information throughout the paragraph and was therefore excluded.</p><p>Option D: Progress in agriculture in Eastern Europe. Error, according to the keyword "Eastern Europe" we find this sentence "Many Western European countries, headed by Britain, as well as to import increasing amounts of food, not only from Eastern Europe, a traditional source, but also......" In fact, it is to explain that transportation is conducive to the import of grain and that grain can be imported from Eastern Europe.

According to the key word "underground sewers" in the title, the article "Even before the discovery of germs, beliefs that disease spread by "miasmas" (noxious forms of bad air) prompted attention to sewers and open garbage; Edwin Chadwick led an exemplary urban crusade for underground sewers in England in the 1830s." It was said that even before the bacteria was discovered, people had realized that it was important to clean the sewers and clean up the garbage, and Chadwick It also led the exemplary urban movement in the United Kingdom and called for the reform of urban sewers. From the overall perspective of the sixth paragraph, "underground sewers" ??improve an example of urban sanitation facilities, which helps reduce the incidence of disease and thus reduce the mortality rate of the population. This question is a forward reasoning process, so the B option is correct here.</p><p>Option A: In the 1930s, the sewer was popular in most parts of Western Europe, but according to the context we know that Chadwick was still leading the exemplary sewer rig movement in Britain at the time, indicating that the sewer was not popular at the time. Conflict with the content of the article, ruled out.</p><p>Option C: The existence of a sewer makes people find that bacteria can cause disease. Wrong, because the article did not mention the information, but said that before the bacteria was discovered, people had begun to pay attention to the cleanliness of the sewer.</p><p>D option: encourage people to leave the countryside and move to the city.

Correct, corresponding to the contents of the original paragraph three. The third paragraph is about the positive impact of science and technology, and the fourth paragraph is about the progress of transportation and food processing equipment. Therefore, the A option is a summary of the third and fourth paragraphs of the article, so it is the correct answer. The</p><p>Option B: The development of food processing technology has enabled western European countries to import food from other countries and grow their own crops. In the second paragraph, "New lands were put under cultivation, while the use of crops of American origin, particularly the potato, continued to expand."
