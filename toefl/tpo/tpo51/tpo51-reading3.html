          <h4 class="w3-center">Population Growth in Nineteenth-Century Europe</h4>
          <p>Because of <span class="highlight">industrialization</span>, but also because of a <span class="highlight">vast</span> increase in agricultural <span class="highlight">output</span> without which <span class="highlight">industrialization</span> would have been impossible, Western Europeans by the <span class="highlight">latter</span> half of the nineteenth <span class="highlight">century</span> enjoyed higher standards of living and longer, healthier lives than most of the world's peoples. In Europe as a whole, the <span class="highlight">population</span> rose from 188 million in 1800 to 400 million in 1900. By 1900, <span class="highlight">virtually</span> every area of Europe had contributed to the <span class="highlight">tremendous</span> <span class="highlight">surge</span> of <span class="highlight">population</span>, but each <span class="highlight">major</span> <span class="highlight">region</span> was at a different <span class="highlight">stage</span> of <span class="highlight">demographic</span> change.</p>
          <p>Improvements in the food <span class="highlight">supply</span> continued trends that had started in the late seventeenth <span class="highlight">century</span>. New lands were put under <span class="highlight">cultivation</span>, while the use of crops of American <span class="highlight">origin</span>, particularly the potato, continued to <span class="highlight">expand</span>. Setbacks did <span class="highlight">occur</span>. Regional agricultural failures were the most <span class="highlight">common</span> cause of <span class="highlight">economic</span> recessions until 1850, and they could <span class="highlight">lead</span> to localized <span class="highlight">famine</span> as well. A <span class="highlight">major</span> potato blight (<span class="highlight">disease</span>) in 1846-1847 led to the deaths of at <span class="highlight">least</span> one million persons in Ireland and the <span class="highlight">emigration</span> of another million, and Ireland never recovered the <span class="highlight">population</span> levels the potato had <span class="highlight">sustained</span> to that point. Bad <span class="highlight">grain</span> harvests at the same time led to increased hardship <span class="highlight">throughout</span> much of Europe.</p>
          <p>After 1850, however, the <span class="highlight">expansion</span> of foods more regularly <span class="question4">kept pace with</span> <span class="highlight">population</span> growth, though the poorer classes remained <span class="highlight">malnourished</span>. Two developments were <span class="highlight">crucial</span>. First, the <span class="highlight">application</span> of science and new technology to <span class="highlight">agriculture</span> increased. Led by German universities, increasing research was devoted to improving seeds, developing chemical fertilizers, and advancing <span class="highlight">livestock</span>. After 1861, with the <span class="highlight">development</span> of land-grant universities in the United States that had huge agricultural programs, American crop-production research added to this mix. Mechanization included the use of <span class="highlight">horse-drawn</span> harvesters and seed drills, many developed <span class="highlight">initially</span> in the United States. It also included <span class="highlight">mechanical</span> cream separators and other food-processing devices that improved <span class="highlight">supply</span>.</p>
          <p>The <span class="highlight">second</span> <span class="highlight">development</span> involved industrially based <span class="highlight">transportation</span>. With trains and steam shipping, it became possible to move foods to <span class="highlight">needy</span> regions <span class="highlight">within</span> Western Europe quickly. <span class="highlight">Famine</span> (as <span class="highlight">opposed</span> to <span class="highlight">malnutrition</span>) became a thing of the past. Many Western European countries, headed by Britain, began also to <span class="highlight">import</span> increasing amounts of food, not only from Eastern Europe, a <span class="highlight">traditional</span> <span class="highlight">source</span>, but also from the Americas, Australia, and New Zealand. Steam shipping, which improved speed and <span class="highlight"><span class="question6">capacity</span></span>, as well as new procedures for <span class="highlight">canning</span> and refrigerating foods (particularly after 1870), was <span class="highlight">fundamental</span> to these developments.</p>
          <p>Europe's <span class="highlight">population</span> growth included one <span class="highlight">additional</span> <span class="highlight">innovation</span> by the nineteenth century: it combined with rapid <span class="highlight">urbanization</span>. More and more Western Europeans moved from countryside to city, and big cities grew most rapidly of all. By 1850, over half of all the people in England lived in cities, a first in human <span class="highlight">history</span>. In one <span class="highlight">sense</span>, this <span class="highlight">pattern</span> seems <span class="highlight"><span class="question8">inevitable</span></span> growing numbers of people pressed <span class="highlight">available</span> resources on the land, <span class="highlight">even</span> when farmwork was combined with a bit of manufacturing, so people crowded into cities seeking work or other resources. Traditionally, however, death rates in cities <span class="question10">surpass</span>ed those in the countryside by a large <span class="highlight">margin</span>; cities had maintained <span class="highlight">population</span> only <span class="highlight">through</span> <span class="highlight">steady</span> in-migration. Thus rapid <span class="highlight">urbanization</span> should have reduced <span class="highlight">overall</span> <span class="highlight">population</span> growth, but by the middle of the nineteenth <span class="highlight">century</span> this was no longer the case. <span class="highlight">Urban</span> death rates remained high, particularly in the lower-class slums, but they began to <span class="highlight">decline</span> rapidly.</p>
          <p>The greater reliability of food supplies was a <span class="highlight">factor</span> in the <span class="highlight">decline</span> of <span class="highlight">urban</span> death rates. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> <span class="highlight">Even</span> more important were the gains in <span class="highlight">urban</span> <span class="highlight">sanitation</span>, as well as measures such as <span class="highlight">inspection</span> of housing. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> Reformers, including enlightened doctors, began to study the causes of high death rates and to <span class="highlight">urge</span> <span class="highlight">remediation</span>. <span class="highlight">Even</span> before the discovery of germs, beliefs that <span class="highlight">disease</span> <span class="highlight">spread</span> by "miasmas" (<span class="highlight">noxious</span> forms of bad <span class="highlight">air</span>) prompted <span class="highlight">attention</span> to sewers and open <span class="highlight">garbage</span>; Edwin Chadwick led an <span class="highlight">exemplary</span> <span class="highlight">urban</span> <span class="highlight">crusade</span> for <span class="highlight">underground</span> sewers in England in the 1830s. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span> <span class="highlight">Gradually</span>, public health provisions began to cut into customary <span class="highlight">urban</span> <span class="highlight">mortality</span> rates. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span> By 1900, in some parts of Western Europe life expectancy in the cities began to <span class="highlight">surpass</span> that of the <span class="highlight">rural</span> areas. <span class="highlight">Industrial</span> societies had figured out ways to <span class="highlight">combine</span> large and growing cities with <span class="highlight">population</span> growth, a <span class="highlight">development</span> that would soon <span class="highlight">spread</span> to other parts of the world.</p>

              <p>The title is factual information. Question Q: Which of the following is correct about Europe in the 19th century?</p>
              <p>Option A: The increase in food production has led to industrialization. Correctly, because the first sentence of the first paragraph says "a huge increase in agricultural output without which industrialization would have been impossible", indicating that agricultural output is a prerequisite for industrialization, so the A option is the correct answer.</p>
              <p>Option B: The pace of demographic changes in major regions is consistent. The error corresponds to "but each major region was at a different stage of demographic change" in the last sentence of the first paragraph, so the B option is completely contradictory to the original and excluded.</p>
              <p>Option C: The standard of living improves to the same level as the rest of the world. Error, corresponding to "Western Europeans by the laws half of the nineteenth century enjoyed higher standards of living and longer, healthier lives than most of the world's peoples." as stated in the first sentence of the first paragraph. Europeans have a higher standard of living, so C is excluded.</p>
              <p>Option D: The large population growth has led to an increase in agricultural output value in various regions. According to the contents of the first paragraph, it is the development of agriculture that promotes population growth. Therefore, the D option logic is reversed. exclude.</p>

              <p>The title is factual information. Question What is the reason for the increase in food production in Western Europe in the 19th century? Corresponding to the second sentence of the second paragraph, "New lands were put under cultivation, while the use of crops of American origin, particularly the potato, continued to expand." This sentence says that people open up new land for farming and grow native crops. The scale continues to expand. Option D: Open up new land to grow crops, in line with the text, it is the correct answer.</p>
              <p>Option A: Replace 17th-century farm technology with more advanced equipment. In the second paragraph, only the first sentence mentions the 17th century, "Improvements in the food supply continues trends that had started in the late seventeenth century." But this sentence says that the increase in food supply continues the trend since the end of the 17th century. Did not mention the technology, so the A option was not mentioned, excluded.</p>
              <p>Option B: Increased food in most parts of Europe. The question is what is the reason for the growth of grain production in Western Europe in the 19th century? The B option re-stated the question again and answered it without asking.</p>
              <p>Option C: As the population declines, so does food demand. The error, because the C option is the result of the failure of agriculture, is the main content of the second half of the second paragraph, has nothing to do with this topic, is unrelated to interference information, so the C option is excluded.</p>

            </p>
            <div class="explanation">
              <p>This question is title of function. Question Q: Why did the author mention potato late blight? The example is definitely to support or explain the point of view, so we went ahead and found the phrase "Setbacks did occur. Regional agricultural failures were the most common cause of economic recessions until 1850, and they could lead to localized famine as well." The example of blight is to illustrate the consequences of agricultural failure. Therefore, the B option is correct.</p>
              <p>Option A: Demonstrates that a crop is more successful in the United States than in Western Europe. The mistake, the example of potatoes is not to illustrate the success of planting crops. On the contrary, this is a failure of agriculture, resulting in the death of many people, so the A option was ruled out.</p>
              <p>Option C: An example of the trend from the end of the 17th century is problematic. The phrase "In the food supply continuing trends that had started in the late seventeenth century." at the beginning of the third paragraph only serves to illustrate that the food supply has been improving since the end of the 17th century. The "potato blight" is an example of agricultural failure. It has nothing to do with the food supply trend since the 17th century, so the C option is excluded.</p>
              <p>Option D: Provide evidence that the population of many countries in Europe declined in the 19th century. The decline in population is the result of the failure of agriculture caused by "potato blight". It is "potato blight" that leads to "the loss of population". It is not used to prove that the population is declining, so the D option is logically incorrect and excluded.</p>

Taking the vocabulary into the original text, "Steam shipping, which improved speed and <span class="question6">capacity</span>, as well as new procedures for canning and refrigerating foods (particularly after 1870), was fundamental to these developments. This phrase means "a steam boat that can increase the speed and <span class="question6">capacity</span> of transportation, as well as new processes for canning and refrigerating foods (especially after 1870), have laid the foundation for these developments."

              <p>The title is factual information. The fourth paragraph mainly describes the impact of transportation. According to the keyword "famine" in the title, we locate the third sentence "Famine (as opposed to malnutrition) became a thing of the past." Looking further ahead, in the previous sentence, people can be transported by train and steamship. Rapidly transport food to impoverished areas in Western Europe. This shows that the progress of transportation can solve the problem of famine, so the C option is correct.</p>
              <p>A option: reduction in malnutrition. "malnutrition" appears in brackets in the sentence "Famine (as opposed to malnutrition) became a thing of the past." to explain that famine and malnutrition are two different concepts. There is no mention of malnutrition in the text. The decrease, so the A option is irrelevant information, exclude.</p>
              <p>Option B: Create more storage facilities. The fourth paragraph did not mention this information throughout the paragraph and was therefore excluded.</p>
              <p>Option D: Progress in agriculture in Eastern Europe. Error, according to the keyword "Eastern Europe" we find this sentence "Many Western European countries, headed by Britain, as well as to import increasing amounts of food, not only from Eastern Europe, a traditional source, but also......" In fact, it is to explain that transportation is conducive to the import of grain and that grain can be imported from Eastern Europe. However, there is no mention of advances in agricultural methods in Eastern Europe. Therefore, the D option is excluded.</p>

              <p>This question is an inference question. Which of the following inferences about the sewer information is correct? According to the key word "underground sewers" in the title, the article "Even before the discovery of germs, beliefs that disease spread by "miasmas" (noxious forms of bad air) prompted attention to sewers and open garbage; Edwin Chadwick led an exemplary urban crusade for underground sewers in England in the 1830s." It was said that even before the bacteria was discovered, people had realized that it was important to clean the sewers and clean up the garbage, and Chadwick It also led the exemplary urban movement in the United Kingdom and called for the reform of urban sewers. From the overall perspective of the sixth paragraph, "underground sewers" ??improve an example of urban sanitation facilities, which helps reduce the incidence of disease and thus reduce the mortality rate of the population. This question is a forward reasoning process, so the B option is correct here.</p>
              <p>Option A: In the 1930s, the sewer was popular in most parts of Western Europe, but according to the context we know that Chadwick was still leading the exemplary sewer rig movement in Britain at the time, indicating that the sewer was not popular at the time. Conflict with the content of the article, ruled out.</p>
              <p>Option C: The existence of a sewer makes people find that bacteria can cause disease. Wrong, because the article did not mention the information, but said that before the bacteria was discovered, people had begun to pay attention to the cleanliness of the sewer.</p>
              <p>D option: encourage people to leave the countryside and move to the city. Wrong, because there is no mention in the article of a logical association between the two.......</p>

              <p>This question is a sentence insertion question. The sentence to be inserted means "this personal effort has a major and practical impact on society." In terms of the context, the above content must mention personal efforts on a person, and the following content will inevitably elaborate on this individual The impact of the behavior. So, we go back to the text to see:</p>
              <p>Until the B option, there was no "personal", and in the previous sentence of the C box, "Edwin Chadwick led an exemplary urban crusade for underground sewers in England in the 1830s." Leading an exemplary urban movement in the United Kingdom demanded the reform of urban sewers. The sentence behind the C option is to say that Chadwick's urban movement has had an impact on society. Therefore, the sentence is best inserted in C. D is also inappropriate, because the content behind the D box is also to explain the positive impact of these reforms. If the content of "positive influence" is disconnected at D, it is obviously not appropriate.</p>

              <p>This question is a full-text summary question. Let's look at the options one by one to find out the correct answer: Option A: Due to advances in science and technology, transportation, and food storage methods, the impact of agricultural failure diminishes after 1850. Correct, corresponding to the contents of the original paragraph three. The third paragraph is about the positive impact of science and technology, and the fourth paragraph is about the progress of transportation and food processing equipment. Therefore, the A option is a summary of the third and fourth paragraphs of the article, so it is the correct answer. The</p>
              <p>Option B: The development of food processing technology has enabled western European countries to import food from other countries and grow their own crops. In the second paragraph, "New lands were put under cultivation, while the use of crops of American origin, particularly the potato, continued to expand." People opened land and planted native crops; The development of transportation allows Western European countries to import food from other countries. However, there is no logical relationship between the two information. The B option creates the logic between the two, so the B option is wrong. The</p>
              <p>Option C: As the food supply becomes more reliable, the reformer improves the health level and repairs the house, the urban population mortality rate is reduced. The C option information can correspond to the contents of the sixth paragraph of the article and is the focus of the discussion in the sixth paragraph. Therefore, the C option is correct. The</p>
              <p>Option D: Although the failure of agriculture led to the death and migration of the population, the population was restored within a short period of time. The error, corresponding to the second paragraph of the article, "...and Ireland never recovered the population levels the potato had sustained to that point." indicates that the population has never returned to the previous level. Therefore, the D option contradicts the content of the article. exclude. The</p>
              <p>E option: The population growth in rural areas is faster than the growth in food supply and living space, so people move to cities to seek job opportunities and other resources. Correct, corresponding to the fifth paragraph of the article. The</p>
              <p>Option F: Improvements in crop planting methods have created many new job opportunities for the farm, prompting people to move from crowded cities to rural areas. Errors, the full text only mentioned the migration of the population from rural to urban areas, so the F option was not mentioned in the article, excluded.</p>
