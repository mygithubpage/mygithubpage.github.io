            <b>Population Growth in Nineteenth-Century Europe</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>Because of <span class="underline">industrialization</span>, but also because of a <span class="underline">vast</span> increase in agricultural <span class="underline">output</span> without which <span class="underline">industrialization</span> would have been impossible, Western Europeans by the <span class="underline">latter</span> half of the nineteenth <span class="underline">century</span> enjoyed higher standards of living and longer, healthier lives than most of the world's peoples. In Europe as a whole, the <span class="underline">population</span> rose from 188 million in 1800 to 400 million in 1900. By 1900, <span class="underline">virtually</span> every area of Europe had contributed to the <span class="underline">tremendous</span> <span class="underline">surge</span> of <span class="underline">population</span>, but each <span class="underline">major</span> <span class="underline">region</span> was at a different <span class="underline">stage</span> of <span class="underline">demographic</span> change.</p>
          <p>Improvements in the food <span class="underline">supply</span> continued trends that had started in the late seventeenth <span class="underline">century</span>. New lands were put under <span class="underline">cultivation</span>, while the use of crops of American <span class="underline">origin</span>, particularly the potato, continued to <span class="underline">expand</span>. Setbacks did <span class="underline">occur</span>. Regional agricultural failures were the most <span class="underline">common</span> cause of <span class="underline">economic</span> recessions until 1850, and they could <span class="underline">lead</span> to localized <span class="underline">famine</span> as well. A <span class="underline">major</span> potato blight (<span class="underline">disease</span>) in 1846-1847 led to the deaths of at <span class="underline">least</span> one million persons in Ireland and the <span class="underline">emigration</span> of another million, and Ireland never recovered the <span class="underline">population</span> levels the potato had <span class="underline">sustained</span> to that point. Bad <span class="underline">grain</span> harvests at the same time led to increased hardship <span class="underline">throughout</span> much of Europe.</p>
          <p>After 1850, however, the <span class="underline">expansion</span> of foods more regularly kept pace with <span class="underline">population</span> growth, though the poorer classes remained <span class="underline">malnourished</span>. Two developments were <span class="underline">crucial</span>. First, the <span class="underline">application</span> of science and new technology to <span class="underline">agriculture</span> increased. Led by German universities, increasing research was devoted to improving seeds, developing chemical fertilizers, and advancing <span class="underline">livestock</span>. After 1861, with the <span class="underline">development</span> of land-grant universities in the United States that had huge agricultural programs, American crop-production research added to this mix. Mechanization included the use of <span class="underline">horse-drawn</span> harvesters and seed drills, many developed <span class="underline">initially</span> in the United States. It also included <span class="underline">mechanical</span> cream separators and other food-processing devices that improved <span class="underline">supply</span>.</p>
          <p>The <span class="underline">second</span> <span class="underline">development</span> involved industrially based <span class="underline">transportation</span>. With trains and steam shipping, it became possible to move foods to <span class="underline">needy</span> regions <span class="underline">within</span> Western Europe quickly. <span class="underline">Famine</span> (as <span class="underline">opposed</span> to <span class="underline">malnutrition</span>) became a thing of the past. Many Western European countries, headed by Britain, began also to <span class="underline">import</span> increasing amounts of food, not only from Eastern Europe, a <span class="underline">traditional</span> <span class="underline">source</span>, but also from the Americas, Australia, and New Zealand. Steam shipping, which improved speed and <span class="underline">capacity</span>, as well as new procedures for <span class="underline">canning</span> and refrigerating foods (particularly after 1870), was <span class="underline">fundamental</span> to these developments.</p>
          <p>Europe's <span class="underline">population</span> growth included one <span class="underline">additional</span> <span class="underline">innovation</span> by the nineteenth century: it combined with rapid <span class="underline">urbanization</span>. More and more Western Europeans moved from countryside to city, and big cities grew most rapidly of all. By 1850, over half of all the people in England lived in cities, a first in human <span class="underline">history</span>. In one <span class="underline">sense</span>, this <span class="underline">pattern</span> seems <span class="underline">inevitable</span> growing numbers of people pressed <span class="underline">available</span> resources on the land, <span class="underline">even</span> when farmwork was combined with a bit of manufacturing, so people crowded into cities seeking work or other resources. Traditionally, however, death rates in cities surpassed those in the countryside by a large <span class="underline">margin</span>; cities had maintained <span class="underline">population</span> only <span class="underline">through</span> <span class="underline">steady</span> in-migration. Thus rapid <span class="underline">urbanization</span> should have reduced <span class="underline">overall</span> <span class="underline">population</span> growth, but by the middle of the nineteenth <span class="underline">century</span> this was no longer the case. <span class="underline">Urban</span> death rates remained high, particularly in the lower-class slums, but they began to <span class="underline">decline</span> rapidly.</p>
          <p>The greater reliability of food supplies was a <span class="underline">factor</span> in the <span class="underline">decline</span> of <span class="underline">urban</span> death rates. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> <span class="underline">Even</span> more important were the gains in <span class="underline">urban</span> <span class="underline">sanitation</span>, as well as measures such as <span class="underline">inspection</span> of housing. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> Reformers, including enlightened doctors, began to study the causes of high death rates and to <span class="underline">urge</span> <span class="underline">remediation</span>. <span class="underline">Even</span> before the discovery of germs, beliefs that <span class="underline">disease</span> <span class="underline">spread</span> by "miasmas" (<span class="underline">noxious</span> forms of bad <span class="underline">air</span>) prompted <span class="underline">attention</span> to sewers and open <span class="underline">garbage</span>; Edwin Chadwick led an <span class="underline">exemplary</span> <span class="underline">urban</span> <span class="underline">crusade</span> for <span class="underline">underground</span> sewers in England in the 1830s. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span> <span class="underline">Gradually</span>, public health provisions began to cut into customary <span class="underline">urban</span> <span class="underline">mortality</span> rates. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span> By 1900, in some parts of Western Europe life expectancy in the cities began to <span class="underline">surpass</span> that of the <span class="underline">rural</span> areas. <span class="underline">Industrial</span> societies had figured out ways to <span class="underline">combine</span> large and growing cities with <span class="underline">population</span> growth, a <span class="underline">development</span> that would soon <span class="underline">spread</span> to other parts of the world.</p>
