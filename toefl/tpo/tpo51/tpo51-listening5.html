The book's called The Birds of the America and the illustrator was John James Audubon.</p><p>The professor at the beginning of the lecture mentioned that this lesson is about illustrator books. An example is the book "American Birds." The entire lecture is also centered on the unity of art and science of the book. Option C is in line with the original text. Option A is about the steps to publish an illustrated book, Option B is about the book's impact on science, and Option D is about the accuracy of scientific illustration.

He closely studied other illustrated books.</p><p>D. He provided the printer with detailed instructions.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="AD"><p>The source of this question is:</p><p>Professor:</p><p>His water colors were merely preparatory studies, mostly through painted wild and misobserving birds in the wild. These water colors were then sent to his printer who created the final prints for the book. And Audubon was so concerned with accuracy that he often scribble notes to The printer around the edges of these original water colors.</p><p>Professors here have spoken about Audubon's two ways of painting illustration. The first step is to study the field before painting. The second step is to send the original watercolor to the publisher, and the publisher can then publish it according to his annotation, corresponding to option A respectively. And option D. Option C stated that he had carefully studied other illustration books, and Option B said that he did not wear the foot ring for the birds.

And this was perhaps a point that critics of his art work at That time just didn't appreciate.</p><p>The professor here said that he felt that Audubon's motivation for doing this painting was to pursue scientific correctness, but critics at the time did not understand his motivation. Option A is correct. Option B said that they did not like the Audubon style change, Option C said they were disappointed with the narrow Audiuon study object, and Option D said that they thought that Audubon's use of oil paint was not complicated and inappropriate.

To suggest that Audubon was more successful as a scientist than as an illustrator</p><p>D. To give examples that show the importance of detail in Audubon's illustrations</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The source of this question is:</p><p>Professor:</p><p>Audubon, also study birds in ways that didn't directly inform his art. Ah, you know what's bird banding right? A bird has a band attached to its foot so we can learn about things like migration patterns. Well, the first recorded instance Of anyone doing, it was Audubon. Another example, a common belief of that time was that vultures used their sense of smell to find food. Audubon didn't believe that. So, he tested it. He put a large painting of a Dead sheep in a field and sure enough, vultures found it and started pecking at it.</p><p>The purpose of teaching vultures and bird toes here is to show that Audubon will also study birds through some non-artistic methods. He may be called a naturalist. Option B is correct. Option A is for students to understand the level of development of scientific knowledge at that time. Option C is to show that Audubon is a better scientist than a painter. Option D is to show that the details of Audubon's illustration are not appropriate.

Bird illustrations that were painted in an uncharacteristically careless manner</p><p>D. Bird illustrations that Audubon intended to be fanciful rather than realistic</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The source of this question is:</p><p>Professor:</p><p>There are actually several birds in his book that no one has ever seen. These are sometimes called Audubon's mystery birds, because even though he drew them, there is no evidence that they exist in the wild.</p><p>The professor here clearly stated that Audubon's mysterious birds refer to birds that are not known in reality. Option B is correct. Option A is a bird illustration of the lost Audubon, Option C is an illustration drawn in a rough, unnatural manner, and Option D is an illustration of Audubon's biased imagination rather than a biased reality.

That particular species of warbler has since gone extinct.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The source of this question is:</p><p>Professor:</p><p>Hybridization is something that's well-known in birds. And it definitely explains the relatively unique-looking duck Audubon painted. He originally suggested that maybe it wasn't an unknown species but a hybrid, born from two different species. Since then, this particular Crossing the species has actually been recorded, both in the wild and in captivity. So it turns out that Audubon was right. And this duck actually was a hybrid.</p><p>The professor here clearly explained the theory most likely to explain Audubon's mysterious bird, that is, he painted a hybrid bird. Option C is correct. Option A said that when he was painting, he forgot some details, Option B said that he copied other people's paintings, and Option D said that it was an extinct bird that was not appropriate.
