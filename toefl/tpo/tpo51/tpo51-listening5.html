          <p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.17" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Listen to part of a lecture in an art <span class="underline">history</span> class.<span class="time" data-times="3.83" data-time="3.17">[00:03.17]</span> The professor has been discussing illustrated books.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8" data-time="7">[00:07.00]</span>Professor:I want to take a look one <span class="underline">particular</span> book to give you an idea about what was involved in publishing illustrated books in the 1800s.<span class="time" data-times="6" data-time="15">[00:15.00]</span>The book's called The Birds of the America and the illustrator was John James Audubon.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="19" data-time="21">[00:21.00]</span>So,The Birds of the America, four volumes which contained illustrations of nearly every bird in the United States, over 400 birds, all hand-colored, all painted life-sized, the largest birds painted on the largest printing paper <span class="underline">available</span> at that time.<span class="time" data-times="2.77" data-time="40">[00:40.00]</span>This required a lot of <span class="underline">dedication</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.23" data-time="42.77">[00:42.77]</span>And Audubon is best remembered as an incredibly <span class="underline">meticulous</span> <span class="underline">accurate</span> artist, a very <span class="underline">accomplished</span> illustrator of the natural world.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.9" data-time="51">[00:51.00]</span>And while there were other artists working on the <span class="underline">similar</span> <span class="underline">project</span> at the same time, Audubon's book remains the most well-known and successful of its kind. <span class="time" data-times="4.1" data-time="60.9">[01:00.90]</span>But, let's talk a bit about Audubon himself first.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5" data-time="65">[01:05.00]</span>First of all, Audubon was not a <span class="underline">traditional</span> painter.<span class="time" data-times="2.9" data-time="70">[01:10.00]</span>And by this I mean that he didn't work in oils.<span class="time" data-times="3.23" data-time="72.9">[01:12.90]</span> He preferred to use water color and <span class="underline">pastel</span> crayons.<span class="time" data-times="3.53" data-time="76.13">[01:16.13]</span>And he worked on paper <span class="underline">instead</span> of on <span class="underline">canvas</span>.<span class="time" data-times="8.64" data-time="79.66">[01:19.66]</span>The thing is, Audubon considered the illustrations in his book, not the <span class="underline">original</span> water colors, to be his finished product.<span class="time" data-times="6.7" data-time="88.3">[01:28.30]</span>His water colors were merely preparatory studies, most of which were painted while he was observing birds in the wild.<span class="time" data-times="5.3" data-time="95">[01:35.00]</span> These water colors were then sent to his printer who created the final prints for the book.<span class="time" data-times="8.5" data-time="100.3">[01:40.30]</span> And Audubon was so concerned with <span class="underline">accuracy</span> that he often scribbled notes to the printer around the edges of these <span class="underline">original</span> water colors.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.2" data-time="108.8">[01:48.80]</span>In fact, you might question whether producing a work of art was <span class="underline">even</span> Audubon's goal. <span class="time" data-times="5" data-time="114">[01:54.00]</span>Now, when I look at Audubon's illustrations, I see a work of art. <span class="time" data-times="7.5" data-time="119">[01:59.00]</span>But, it may make more <span class="underline">sense</span> to <span class="underline">consider</span> Audubon, first and <span class="underline">foremost</span>, as a <span class="underline">naturalist</span>, as a scientist. <span class="time" data-times="6.36" data-time="126.5">[02:06.50]</span>See, the early 19th <span class="underline">century</span> when Audubon was painting was a time of <span class="underline">major</span> <span class="underline">scientific</span> inquiry. <span class="time" data-times="6.14" data-time="132.86">[02:12.86]</span>And an <span class="underline">essential</span> way of spreading <span class="underline">scientific</span> knowledge was <span class="underline">through</span> those illustrated books.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.72" data-time="139">[02:19.00]</span>Student:So what did Audubon <span class="underline">consider</span> himself? An artist or a scientist?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.88" data-time="144.72">[02:24.72]</span>Professor:I'm not sure the <span class="underline">distinction</span> between the two was all that <span class="underline">clear</span> in the 1800s. <span class="time" data-times="6.95" data-time="149.6">[02:29.60]</span>I think we can accurately <span class="underline">state</span> that the driving force in his art was getting the science right. <span class="time" data-times="5.25" data-time="156.55">[02:36.55]</span>And this was perhaps a point that critics of his art work at that time just didn't <span class="underline">appreciate</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.5" data-time="161.8">[02:41.80]</span>Audubon also study birds in ways that didn't directly <span class="underline">inform</span> his art. <span class="time" data-times="2.7" data-time="167.3">[02:47.30]</span>Ah, you know what bird banding is right? <span class="time" data-times="5.3" data-time="170">[02:50.00]</span>A bird has a <span class="underline">band</span> attached to its foot so we can learn about things like <span class="underline">migration</span> patterns. <span class="time" data-times="5" data-time="175.3">[02:55.30]</span>Well, the first recorded <span class="underline">instance</span> of anyone doing that, it was Audubon. <span class="time" data-times="6.7" data-time="180.3">[03:00.30]</span>Another example, a <span class="underline">common</span> belief of that time was that vultures used their <span class="underline">sense</span> of smell to find food. <span class="time" data-times="1.71" data-time="187">[03:07.00]</span>Audubon didn't believe that. <span class="time" data-times="1.35" data-time="188.71">[03:08.71]</span>So, he tested it. <span class="time" data-times="7.94" data-time="190.06">[03:10.06]</span>He put a large painting of a dead sheep in a <span class="underline">field</span>, and sure enough, vultures found it and started pecking at it.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.3" data-time="198">[03:18.00]</span>Now, Audubon's work was very <span class="underline">accurate</span>, and we know this because we can <span class="underline">compare</span> his illustrations to the birds around us. <span class="time" data-times="3" data-time="206.3">[03:26.30]</span>But sometimes it's not possible to <span class="underline">check</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4" data-time="209.3">[03:29.30]</span>There are actually several birds in his book that no one's ever seen. <span class="time" data-times="8.7" data-time="213.3">[03:33.30]</span>These are sometimes called Audubon's mystery birds, because <span class="underline">even</span> though he drew them, there is no <span class="underline">evidence</span> that they exist in the wild.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.3" data-time="222">[03:42.00]</span>For someone who's respected as a <span class="underline">naturalist</span>, isn't it strange to think that he drew some birds that don't <span class="underline">appear</span> to be real? <span class="time" data-times="5.7" data-time="230.3">[03:50.30]</span>For example, there is an <span class="underline">illustration</span> that appears to be a type of warbler, a small bird. <span class="time" data-times="3.9" data-time="236">[03:56.00]</span>It has a white ring around its eyes and white bars on its wings. <span class="time" data-times="11" data-time="239.9">[03:59.90]</span>No one's ever seen a warbler like this, so some people <span class="underline">wonder</span> if Audubon maybe forgot certain details about this bird when he painted it, or that he copied another artist's work. <span class="time" data-times="7.2" data-time="250.9">[04:10.90]</span>But considering that Audubon was such a <span class="underline">meticulous</span> artist, well, that might be a better answer.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.1" data-time="258.1">[04:18.10]</span>Hybridization is something that's well-known in birds. <span class="time" data-times="4.8" data-time="262.2">[04:22.20]</span>And it <span class="underline">definitely</span> explains the rather unique-looking duck Audubon painted. <span class="time" data-times="7" data-time="267">[04:27.00]</span>He himself suggested that maybe it wasn't an unknown <span class="underline">species</span> but a hybrid, born from two different <span class="underline">species</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.1" data-time="274">[04:34.00]</span>Since then, this <span class="underline">particular</span> <span class="underline">crossing</span> <span class="underline">species</span> has actually been recorded, both in the wild and in <span class="underline">captivity</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.29" data-time="281.1">[04:41.10]</span>So it turns out that Audubon was right.<span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="283.39">[04:43.39]</span> And this duck actually was a hybrid.</p>
