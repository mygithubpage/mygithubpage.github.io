          <p>Listen to part of a lecture in a biology class. </p>
          <p>Okay so many animals benefit from living in groups it provides them with protection from predators and with social companionship. So it's important for these animals to maintain their groups unity they need ways to either avoid conflicts or if they do occur to resolve them peacefully. To help them achieve this many animals use water called display behaviors. These are behaviors that are mostly for show a symbolic behaviors that send a message to the other animals and help maintain their groups unity. </p>
          <p>One way is through the use of threatening display behaviors. Threatening display behaviors are used to communicate a warning. But they aren't meant to really harm other animals rather they help animals avoid fights. Some monkeys like baboons for instance frequently use threatening display behaviors. Like. Well let's save 2 baboons find some fruit and they both want it. One baboon maybe the first baboon to see the fruit might stare at the other one and make threatening noises grunts to let the other baboon know it wants the fruit. And because the other baboon understands the meaning of the stairs and grunts it can give up the fruit without a fight and this behavior benefits the group by preventing conflict. </p>
          <p>But sometimes physical fights do occur. And animals need a way to reconcile afterwards to make up to ensure that everyone in the group continues to get along. In these cases an animal might use friendly display behavior to restore group unity. A let's return to the baboon example out let's say the 2 baboons do end up getting into a physical fight over the fruit. After the conflict the 2 animals need a way to resolve things. So what they do is approach each other while making friendly noises. Then maven hug each other as if to say everything's okay now I'm not angry with you anymore. Now through this display behavior friendly noises or hugs the baboons can makeup and the group can go back to normal.</p>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>In the lecture, the professor talks about two ways animals may use to maintain group unity. There are two key points. The first key point is using what is called threatening display behavior. Take baboons for example. When two baboons find some fruit and both of them want to eat it, one of the baboons may stare at the fruit and make some threatening noises. After receiving these signals, the other baboon would walk away and give up these fruit without a fight. Thus, the group unity is remained. The second key point is through use of friendly display behavior. Still back to baboon example. If two baboons do get into a physical fight but afterwards, they would get close to each other and even hug each other, which means that they are not angry anymore, they can still be friends. So the unity is maintained again. Therefore, by giving out these two examples, the professor explains two ways to maintain group unity.</p>
