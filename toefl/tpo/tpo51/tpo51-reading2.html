Fluids flow easily and <span class="highlight">conform</span> to the <span class="highlight">shape</span> of their containers. The geologic processes related to the movement of fluids on a <span class="highlight">planet</span>'s surface can completely resurface a <span class="highlight">planet</span> many times. These processes <span class="highlight">derive</span> their energy from the Sun and the <span class="highlight">gravitational</span> forces of the <span class="highlight">planet</span> itself. As these fluids <span class="highlight">interact</span> with surface materials, they move particles about or react chemically with them to <span class="highlight question1">modify</span> or produce materials. On a <span class="highlight">solid</span><span class="highlight">planet</span> with a <span class="highlight">hydrosphere</span> and an <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span>, only a tiny <span class="highlight">fraction</span> of the <span class="highlight">planetary</span><span class="highlight">mass</span> flows as surface fluids. Yet the movements of these fluids can <span class="highlight"><span class="question2">drastically</span></span><span class="highlight">alter</span> a <span class="highlight">planet</span>. <span class="highlight">Consider</span><span class="highlight">Venus</span> and Earth, both <span class="highlight">terrestrial</span> planets with atmospheres.</p><p><span class="highlight">Venus</span> and Earth are commonly regarded as twin planets but not <span class="highlight">identical</span> twins. They are about the same size, are composed of <span class="highlight">roughly</span> the same mix of materials, and may have been comparably endowed at their beginning with <span class="highlight">carbon</span><span class="highlight">dioxide</span> and water. However, the twins evolved differently largely because of differences in their distance from the Sun. With a <span class="highlight">significant</span><span class="highlight">amount</span> of <span class="highlight">internal</span> heat, <span class="highlight">Venus</span> may continue to be geologically active with volcanoes, rifting, and folding. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> However, it lacks any sign of a <span class="highlight">hydrologic</span> system (water <span class="highlight">circulation</span> and <span class="highlight">distribution</span>): there are no streams, lakes oceans or glaciers. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span><span class="highlight">Space</span> probes suggest that <span class="highlight">Venus</span> may have started with as much water as Earth, but it was unable to keep its water in <span class="highlight">liquid</span> form. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span> Because <span class="highlight">Venus</span> receives more heat from the Sun, water released from the <span class="highlight">interior</span> evaporated and rose to the upper <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span> where the Sun's <span class="highlight">ultraviolet</span> rays broke the molecules apart. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span> Much of the freed <span class="highlight">hydrogen</span> escaped into <span class="highlight">space</span>, and <span class="highlight">Venus</span> lost its water. Without water, <span class="highlight">Venus</span> became less and less like Earth and kept an <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span> filled with <span class="highlight">carbon</span><span class="highlight">dioxide</span>. The <span class="highlight">carbon</span><span class="highlight">dioxide</span> acts as a <span class="highlight">blanket</span>, creating an <span class="highlight">intense</span> greenhouse effect and driving surface temperatures high enough to <span class="highlight">melt</span><span class="highlight">lead</span> and to <span class="highlight"><span class="question4">prohibit</span></span> the <span class="highlight">formation</span> of <span class="highlight">carbonate</span> minerals. Volcanoes continually vented more <span class="highlight">carbon</span><span class="highlight">dioxide</span> into the <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span>. On Earth, <span class="highlight">liquid</span> water removes <span class="highlight">carbon</span><span class="highlight">dioxide</span> from the <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span> and combines it with <span class="highlight">calcium</span>, from rock <span class="highlight">weathering</span>, to form <span class="highlight">carbonate</span><span class="highlight">sedimentary</span> rocks. Without <span class="highlight">liquid</span> water to remove <span class="highlight">carbon</span> from the <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span>, the <span class="highlight">level</span> of <span class="highlight">carbon</span><span class="highlight">dioxide</span> in the <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span> of <span class="highlight">Venus</span> remains high.</p><p>Like <span class="highlight">Venus</span>, Earth is large enough to be geologically active and for its <span class="highlight">gravitational</span><span class="highlight">field</span> to hold an <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span>. Unlike <span class="highlight">Venus</span>, it is just the right distance from the Sun so that <span class="highlight">temperature</span> ranges allow water to exist as a <span class="highlight">liquid</span>, a <span class="highlight">solid</span>, and a gas. Water is thus extremely <span class="highlight">mobile</span> and moves rapidly over the <span class="highlight">planet</span> in a <span class="highlight">continuous</span><span class="highlight">hydrologic</span><span class="highlight">cycle</span>. Heated by the Sun, the water moves in great cycles from the oceans to the <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span>, over the <span class="highlight">landscape</span> in river systems, and <span class="highlight"><span class="question8">ultimately</span></span> back to the oceans. As a result, Earth's surface has been continually changed and eroded into <span class="highlight">delicate</span> systems of river valleys - a <span class="highlight">remarkable</span><span class="highlight">contrast</span> to the surfaces of other <span class="highlight">planetary</span> bodies where <span class="highlight">impact</span> craters <span class="highlight">dominate</span>. Few areas on Earth have been untouched by flowing water. As a result, river valleys are the <span class="highlight">dominant</span> feature of its <span class="highlight">landscape</span>. Similarly, wind <span class="highlight">action</span> has scoured fine particles away from large areas, depositing them elsewhere as <span class="highlight">vast</span> sand seas dominated by dunes or in sheets of <span class="highlight">loess</span> (<span class="highlight">fine-grained</span> soil deposits). These <span class="highlight">fluid</span> movements are caused by <span class="highlight">gravity</span> flow systems energized by heat from the Sun. Other geologic changes <span class="highlight">occur</span> when the <span class="question11">gases in the <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span> or water react with rocks at the surface to form new chemical compounds</span> with different properties. An important example of this <span class="highlight">process</span> was the <span class="highlight">removal</span> of most of Earths <span class="highlight">carbon</span><span class="highlight">dioxide</span> from its <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span> to form <span class="highlight">carbonate</span> rocks. However, if Earth were a little closer to the Sun, its oceans would <span class="highlight">evaporate</span>; if it were farther from the Sun, the oceans would <span class="highlight">freeze</span><span class="highlight">solid</span>. <span class="question12">Because <span class="highlight">liquid</span> water was present, self-replicating molecules of <span class="highlight">carbon</span>, <span class="highlight">hydrogen</span>, and <span class="highlight">oxygen</span> developed life early in Earth's <span class="highlight">history</span> and have <span class="highlight">radically</span> modified its surface, blanketing huge parts of the continents with greenery.</span> Life thrives on this <span class="highlight">planet</span>, and it helped create the <span class="highlight">planet</span>'s oxygen- and nitrogen-rich <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span> and <span class="highlight">moderate</span> temperatures.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">modify</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. obtain</p><p>B. change</p><p>C. replace</p><p>D. absorb</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>This question is a vocabulary question. Modify means "modify; change". The words "As these fluids interact with surface materials, they move particles about or react chemically with them to modify or produce materials." may be translated as "When these fluids and surface materials When interacting, their particles exchange or chemical reactions occur to change or create new substances." Let's look at the options:</p><p>A option: "obtain", meaning "acquisition", does not match, so it is excluded.</p><p>The B option: change, which means "change", means the closest, so it is the correct answer.</p><p>The C option: replace, which means "replace", does not match, so it is excluded.</p><p>The D option: absorb, which means "absorb", does not match, so it is excluded.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question2">drastically</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. gradually</p><p>B. permanently</p><p>C. extensively</p><p>D. possibly</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" C"><p>This question is a vocabulary question. The word <span class="question2">drastically</span> means "to be thoroughly; violently" and the word appears in the penultimate sentence of the first paragraph. The phrase means "However, the movement of these fluids can dramatically change a planet." Let's look at the options one by one:</p><p>A option: gradually, meaning "gradually, gradually", meaning does not match, so ruled out.</p><p>B option: permanent, meaning "permanently, long-term unchanged", meaning does not match, so ruled out.</p><p>C option:extensively means "generally, broadly", meaning the closest, so it is the correct answer.</p><p>D option:possibly, meaning "possibly", meaning does not match, so ruled out.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Paragraph 1 supports all of the following statements about fluids EXCEPT</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They can chemically react with particles on a planet's surface.</p><p>B. Most of their mass does not flow but remains in place.</p><p>C. Their movement can reshape the surface of certain kinds of planets.</p><p>D. Their movement is driven by the Sun and by gravity.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>This question is a question of negating factual information. It is necessary to select options that are inconsistent with the factual information. Let's look at the options below:</p><p>A option: The fluid can react with the planet's surface. According to the keyword "chemically" in the option, the phrase "As these fluids interact with surface materials, they move particles about or react chemically with them to modify or produce materials." Chemical reactions can occur with other substances, so the A option is in compliance with the original text and excluded.</p><p>Option B: Most of the fluid's material will not move and will remain in place. According to the keyword "mass", the phrase "On a solid planet with a hydrosphere and an atmosphere, only a tiny fraction of the planetary mass flows as surface fluids." is located in the material of the planet. Only a small part of the material is fluid. The B option says that most of the material does not move in the fluid. So the target for the two is different. Second, even if we only look at the options, we can judge that it is not in accordance with common sense, because the first sentence of the first paragraph says that the constituent particles of the fluid will move to each other. Therefore, all the components of the fluid will flow.Therefore, the B option does not meet the original text and is the correct answer.</p><p>Option C: The movement of the fluid will reshape the planet's surface. The term "reshape" in the third sentence of the first paragraph corresponds to "The geologic processes related to the movement of fluids on a planet's surface can completely resurface a planet many times." The term "resurface" is exactly the same as the "resurface" in the original text. Therefore, the C option is in accordance with the original text and excluded.</p><p>D option: Fluid movement is driven by the sun and gravity. Corresponding to the fourth sentence "These processes derive their energy from the Sun and the gravitational forces of the planet itself."</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question4">prohibit</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. prevent</p><p>B. speed up</p><p>C. affect</p><p>D. encourage</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" A"><p>This question is a vocabulary question. Prohibit means "forbid, stop," and the word "The carbon dioxide acts as a blanket, creating an intense greenhouse effect and driving surface temperatures high enough to melt lead and to <span class="question4">prohibit</span> the formation of carbonate minerals." It is "carbon dioxide acts as a blanket, producing a strong greenhouse effect, making the surface temperature of Venus high enough to melt lead and prevent the formation of carbonate minerals." Let's look at options again:</p><p>A option: prevent, meaning "prevention; stop", the meaning is consistent, it is the correct answer.</p><p>B option: speed up, meaning "acceleration", meaning does not match, so ruled out.</p><p>C option: affect, meaning "impact", meaning does not match, so ruled out.</p><p>D option: encourage, meaning "encourage, encourage", meaning does not match, so ruled out.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 2, what is one difference between Earth and Venus?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Earth has less water in its atmosphere than Venus does.</p><p>B. Earth has a hydrologic system but Venus does not.</p><p>C. Earth is less geologically active than Venus is.</p><p>D. Earth has more carbon dioxide than Venus does.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The title is factual information. Question Which of the following is the difference between Earth and Venus? Because the entire second paragraph describes the difference between Venus and the Earth, it is not possible to locate the key words by keyword, and you can only see the options one by one:</p><p>Option A: Earth's atmosphere contains less water than Venus' atmosphere. But in the second paragraph it was mentioned that Venus received more heat from the sun and the internal water was evaporated, so it lost water. Therefore, the A option contradicts the original information and is incorrect.</p><p>Option B: Earth has a hydrological system, but Venus does not. According to the keyword "hydrologic system", the word "However, it lacks any sign of a hydrologic system (water circulation and distribution): there are no streams, lakes oceans or glaciers." Any hydrological system. Look down again, "Space probes suggest that Venus may have started with as much water as Earth, but it was unable to keep its water in liquid form." This sentence said that at first Venus was water like the earth, but Venus It is impossible to preserve the moisture in liquid form. We can see from the side that there is water on the earth.Therefore, the B option complies with the original text and is correct.</p><p>Option C: Earth's geological activity is not as high as Venus. In the second paragraph, it was indeed mentioned that the volcanic activity on the Venus, rifts, and folds have been active. However, it is not compared with the planet Venus, so the comparison does not exist, and the C option is excluded.</p><p>D option: Earth has more carbon dioxide than Venus. According to the second paragraph, we can only know that the atmosphere of Venus is "filled with carbon dioxide", but it is impossible to know who the Earth and Venus have on the total number of carbon dioxide. There is no mention of the comparative relationship in this article, so D is excluded.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>It can be inferred from paragraph 2 that Earth evolved differently than Venus did in part because</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. there was more volcanic activity on early Venus than on early Earth</p><p>B. they received different amounts of solar energy</p><p>C. their interiors contained different amounts of heat</p><p>D. their early atmospheres contained different levels of oxygen and nitrogen</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>This question is an inference question. One of the reasons why the title asks the Earth how Venus evolved is different from that of Venus? According to the key word "evolved differently" in the title, the phrase "However, the twins evolved differently because of differences in their distance from the Sun." The difference is the most important reason that causes them to evolve in different ways. But there is no such option. Then we have to speculate, what is the result of the difference in distance with the sun? Because Venus is closer to the Sun, it absorbs more heat, and the distance between the Earth and the Sun is moderate and the temperature is more appropriate. So different from the sun, it will lead to different temperatures in 2 weeks. The difference in temperature directly determines whether there is water on the planet and indirectly determines the planet's topography. Therefore, the B option: they absorb different amounts of solar energy, is the correct answer. Look at other options:</p><p>Option A: Venus has more volcanic activity in the early stages than in the early days of the Earth. The article only mentioned that there was frequent volcanic activity on Venus, and it was not compared with Earth. A was excluded.</p><p>C options: They contain different internal energy. Not mentioned in the article. C option is excluded.</p><p>Option D: They contain different levels of oxygen and nitrogen in their early stages. The second paragraph only mentions "Space probes suggest that Venus may have started with as much water as Earth, but ..." Venus and the Earth both contained water in the early days, but did not mention oxygen and nitrogen content, so the D option was not mentioned. exclude.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 2, all of the following played a role in keeping carbon dioxide levels high in the atmosphere of Venus EXCEPT</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. the breaking apart of water molecules by ultraviolet rays</p><p>B. the evaporation of water released from the planet's interior</p><p>C. the escape of hydrogen into space</p><p>D. the release of molecules from melting metals such as lead</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>This question is an inference question.

We return to the original positioning according to the keywords in the options and use the exclusion method to do the problem.</p><p>A option: UV will break down water molecules. According to the keyword "ultraviolet rays", the phrase "Because Venus receives more heat from the Sun, water released from the interior evaporated and rose to the upper atmosphere where the Sun's ultraviolet rays broke the molecules apart." It is mentioned that once there is no water, the amount of carbon dioxide will continue to increase. Therefore, A is excluded.</p><p>Option B: The moisture released from evaporation inside the planet will be evaporated. The B option comes from the same sentence as the A option. In the same way, B option is excluded.</p><p>Option C: Hydrogen escapes into the universe. According to the keywords "hydrogen" and "escape", the phrase "Much of the freed hydrogen escaped into space, and Venus lost its water."</p><p>D option: molecules released from molten metal (such as lead). According to the keyword "lead," this is the phrase "The carbon dioxide acts as a blanket, creating an intense greenhouse effect and driving surface temperatures high enough to melt lead and to <span class="question4">prohibit</span> the formation of carbonate minerals." The effect of increasing concentrations - causing a greenhouse effect, so that the planet's temperature becomes high enough to melt the metal. Therefore, the D option is not the cause of the increase in carbon dioxide, so D is the correct answer.......</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 3, Earth's surface is different from the surfaces of many other planetary bodies in which of the following ways?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It is more strongly marked by river valleys and erosion.</p><p>B. It is more geologically active.</p><p>C. It is covered by impact craters.</p><p>D. It has an atmosphere.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The title is factual information. According to the keyword "other planetary bodies" in the stem, the sentence "As a result, Earth's surface has been changed substantially and eroded into delicate systems of river valleys-a remarkable contrast to the surfaces of other planetary bodies where impact The craters dominate." So, obviously, the difference between the Earth and other planets is that the surface of the Earth is constantly changing and being eroded to form a complex valley system. Therefore, the A option is correct.</p><p>Option B: The earth is more geographically active. The third paragraph only mentions that the earth has a high degree of geographic activity but does not say that it is more active than other planets. Therefore, the comparison does not exist and B excludes.</p><p>Option C: Earth's surface is covered by craters. Wrong, because the text says that other planets are covered with craters. Therefore, the C option contradicts the original information. The C option is wrong.</p><p>D option: Earth has atmosphere. However, according to the foregoing, we know that Venus also has an atmosphere. So this is not a unique feature of the Earth that can distinguish it from other planets. Therefore, the D option is excluded.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 3, why is water able to move so freely on Earth?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Earth's temperatures are such that water exists in solid, liquid, and gas forms.</p><p>B. Earth is large enough to be geologically active and for its gravitational field to hold an atmosphere.</p><p>C. Earth's surface allows river valleys to develop across the landscape.</p><p>D. Earth has active winds that blow across seas and oceans causing fluid movements.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The title is factual information. The question asks why water can flow freely on the earth? According to the keywords "water" and "move" in the stem, we can locate the third paragraph of the second and third sentences "Unlike Venus, it is just the right distance from the Sun so that temperature ranges allow water to exist as a liquid The second sentence says that the Earth's appropriate temperature range allows water to exist in the form of liquids, solids, and gases. Special attention should be paid to the word "thus" in the third sentence, which can show obvious causality. Therefore, the reason for the free flow of water on Earth is the second sentence in front. So the A option is correct.</p><p>Option B: The earth is large, geological activity is active, and gravity can maintain the atmosphere. This is the common ground between the Earth and Venus, not the cause of the flow of water. It belongs to unrelated interference information and is excluded.</p><p>Option C: The surface of the earth allows the valley to pass through. According to the context, we know that water on the earth created the landform of the valley, and the logic of the C option was reversed, and the result was taken as the reason. Therefore, the C option was excluded.</p><p>D option: Earth's wind force will cause fluid movement when blowing over the ocean. Wrong, because the article only mentioned that the wind will drive the movement of fine particles to form a desert. Therefore, the D option is out of nothing and excluded.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the author point out that on Earth "<span class="highlight">gases in the atmosphere or water react with rocks at the surface to form new chemical compounds</span>"?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To explain why scientists believe that few areas on Earth have been untouched by flowing water.</p><p>B. To identify one of several ways in which the movement of fluids can affect the surface of a planet.</p><p>C. To provide evidence that fluid movements are caused by gravity flow systems energized by the Sun.</p><p>D. To identify an effect of wind scouring fine particles away from large areas.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="gases in the atmosphere or water react with rocks at the surface to form new chemical compounds B"><p>This question is title of function. First, we find the sentence in the text of the highlight in the text "Other geologic changes occur when the gases in the atmosphere or water react with rocks at the surface to form new chemical compounds with different properties." Note the first logical word "other" It shows that the gas or water in the atmosphere reacts with the rocks to form new compounds, which is a geographical change. The other kind of affirmation was mentioned in the previous article, namely "wind action". As previously mentioned, the fluid motion caused by wind action is caused by the gravity flow system produced by the solar thermal energy, which is a way to change the earth's landform. The word "Other..." is another way that fluid motion changes the topography chemically. These two methods of changing the landscape are parallel. Therefore, the contents of the quotation marks clearly indicate the way in which the other fluid acts to change the topography. Corresponding to the B option, it is correct.</p><p>Option A: Explain why scientists believe that liquid water is almost everywhere on Earth. Wrong, because the A option has no causal link with the content of the task and is therefore excluded.</p><p>Option C: Demonstrate the fluid motion caused by the gravity flow system. Its energy is derived from the sun. Wrong, because the content of the question is not an example of the proof of the C option. There is no proof and proof relationship between the two, but two separate, parallel points. Therefore, C excludes.</p><p>D option: Explain the effect of wind force. The content of the headline is not the influence of wind force, so it is excluded.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Life on Earth is responsible for many changes to the planet's surface, including blankets of greenery.</p><p>B. Self-replicating molecules of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen led to the development of life early in Earth's history.</p><p>C. The presence of water made it possible for life to develop early in Earth's history and to significantly change its surface.</p><p>D. Early in life's history on Earth, self-replicating molecules of carbon hydrogen, and oxygen began blanketing the surface in greenery.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>This question is a sentence simplification question. First of all, let's look at this sentence. This means, "Because of the existence of liquid water, self-replicating carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen molecules formed the early life of the earth and fundamentally changed the surface so that a large area of ??land was covered in green." The sentence structure is an "and" side-by-side structure. The existence of liquid water, on the one hand, formed the life of the early earth, and on the other hand changed the surface. After clarifying the sentence structure, we look at the options:</p><p>The A option emphasizes the causal relationship between "earth life" and "change of the earth". "be responsible for" is an implied causal logic word here, but in the original text, "Earth of life on the earth" and "change of the earth's surface," It is a parallel structure that is the result of the existence of liquid water. Therefore, the logic of A is wrong.</p><p>Option B only mentions "Earth Generation on Earth," and the "change of landscape" component of the latter sentence is missing. Therefore, the B option lacks the backbone of the sentence and excludes it.</p><p>The C option is a synonymous rewriting of the original sentence. The structure of the parallel sentence is clear and the main sentence is complete. Therefore, it is the correct answer.</p><p>D option will be the main sentence in the original sentence "developed life early in Earth's history", casually written into a time adverbial "early in life's history on Earth", not only a logical error, and the lack of sentence stem, so ruled out.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Venus may not have always been this way..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>This question is a sentence insertion question. The sentence to be inserted means "Venus may not always be the same." Then we return to the original view.</p><p>A sentence in front of the A box is to say that the Geological activity of Venus is active, and after the A box, there is a sentence turning that there is no hydrological system on Venus. From the viewpoint of the meaning of the clause, it is obviously inappropriate to insert the sentence in A.</p><p>The first sentence in Box B says that there is no hydrological system on Venus. In the B-box, the space probe shows that the water content of Venus and Earth may be the same at the beginning. There is a turning point in these two sentences. Therefore, the sentence is best inserted at B. - "Venus may not always be like this (without a hydrological system). In the beginning, Venus also contains water like Earth."</p><p>The content before and after the C and D boxes is to discuss why there is no water on Venus. The logic is very complete and no sentence needs to be inserted, so C and D are excluded.</p></div></div><div id="question14" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>Over time, the movement of surface fluids has greatly changed Venus and Earth.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.Although Venus is about the same size as Earth, its greater volcanic activity has added considerably to carbon dioxide levels in its atmosphere.</p><p>B.Like Venus Earth has an atmosphere, but Earth's atmosphere has far more oxygen and nitrogen than does the atmosphere of Venus.</p><p>C.On Earth, chemical reactions involving fluids remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by giving rise to carbonate rocks, and winds energized by gravity flow systems move fine particles from one place to another.</p><p>D.Because Venus lost the water it originally had, most of its carbon dioxide remained in its atmosphere, causing the planet to become very warm.</p><p>E.On Earth, the dominance of river valley landscapes and the existence of life are due to the planet s hydrologic cycle.</p><p>F.The evaporation of liquid water from Earth's surface is largely limited by the life forms that have developed, particularly the vegetation.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="BCD"><p>This question is a full-text summary question. We use the exclusion method to do the problem. The</p><p>Option A: Although Venus is as large as Earth, its more frequent volcanic activity increases the carbon dioxide content of its atmosphere. The A option corresponds to the second paragraph of the article, but the A option has 3 errors. 1 is that the article does not mention that Venus volcanic activity is more frequent than the earth; 2 is that the article did not mention that volcanic activity increased carbon dioxide content; the third is the A option is a detailed description, not the article trunk. Therefore, the A option is excluded. The</p><p>Option B: Like Venus, Earth also contains an atmosphere, but the Earth's atmosphere contains more oxygen and nitrogen. Corresponds to the second and third paragraphs of the article and the last sentence of the third paragraph. Through the second and third paragraphs, we know that Earth and Venus have atmosphere, and the last sentence says "Life thrives on this planet, and it helped create the planet's oxygen - and nitrogen-rich atmosphere and moderate temperatures." Life on earth It thrives, and the birth of life is also conducive to the creation of an oxygen-rich and nitrogen-rich atmosphere and a suitable temperature for the earth. Therefore, the B option complies with the contents of the article and is correct.Option C: On Earth, liquids remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, forming carbonate rocks, and wind forces driven by gravity flow systems carry fine particles to other areas. Corresponding to the third paragraph of the article, the C option outlines the ways in which the two fluids can change the topography. It is in line with the context and correct. The</p><p>Option D: Because Venus lost its original water, carbon dioxide has been present in the atmosphere, resulting in a greenhouse effect. Corresponding to the second paragraph of the article, it is in line with the text and correct.</p><p>E option: On the Earth, the valley's landscape and life are caused by the earth's hydrosphere. The E option corresponds to the penultimate sentence of the article "Because liquid water was present, self-replicating molecules of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen developed life early in Earth's history and have radically modified its surface, blanketing huge parts of the continents with greenery." The content is correct, but this is a detailed description and is therefore excluded.</p><p>F option: Liquid water evaporated from the surface of the earth is largely constrained by the form of life. This information is not mentioned in the full text and is therefore excluded.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
