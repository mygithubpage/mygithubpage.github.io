            <b>Surface Fluids on Venus and Earth</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>A <span class="underline">fluid</span> is a <span class="underline">substance</span>, such as a <span class="underline">liquid</span> or gas, in which the <span class="underline">component</span> particles (usually molecules) can move past one another. Fluids flow easily and <span class="underline">conform</span> to the <span class="underline">shape</span> of their containers. The geologic processes related to the movement of fluids on a <span class="underline">planet</span>'s surface can completely resurface a <span class="underline">planet</span> many times. These processes <span class="underline">derive</span> their energy from the Sun and the <span class="underline">gravitational</span> forces of the <span class="underline">planet</span> itself. As these fluids <span class="underline">interact</span> with surface materials, they move particles about or react chemically with them to <span class="light"><span class="underline">modify</span></span> or produce materials. On a <span class="underline">solid</span> <span class="underline">planet</span> with a <span class="underline">hydrosphere</span> and an <span class="underline">atmosphere</span>, only a tiny <span class="underline">fraction</span> of the <span class="underline">planetary</span> <span class="underline">mass</span> flows as surface fluids. Yet the movements of these fluids can <span class="underline">drastically</span> <span class="underline">alter</span> a <span class="underline">planet</span>. <span class="underline">Consider</span> <span class="underline">Venus</span> and Earth, both <span class="underline">terrestrial</span> planets with atmospheres.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="underline">Venus</span> and Earth are commonly regarded as twin planets but not <span class="underline">identical</span> twins. They are about the same size, are composed of <span class="underline">roughly</span> the same mix of materials, and may have been comparably endowed at their beginning with <span class="underline">carbon</span> <span class="underline">dioxide</span> and water. However, the twins evolved differently largely because of differences in their distance from the Sun. With a <span class="underline">significant</span> <span class="underline">amount</span> of <span class="underline">internal</span> heat, <span class="underline">Venus</span> may continue to be geologically active with volcanoes, rifting, and folding. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> However, it lacks any sign of a <span class="underline">hydrologic</span> system (water <span class="underline">circulation</span> and <span class="underline">distribution</span>): there are no streams, lakes oceans or glaciers. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> <span class="underline">Space</span> probes suggest that <span class="underline">Venus</span> may have started with as much water as Earth, but it was unable to keep its water in <span class="underline">liquid</span> form. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span> Because <span class="underline">Venus</span> receives more heat from the Sun, water released from the <span class="underline">interior</span> evaporated and rose to the upper <span class="underline">atmosphere</span> where the Sun's <span class="underline">ultraviolet</span> rays broke the molecules apart. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span> Much of the freed <span class="underline">hydrogen</span> escaped into <span class="underline">space</span>, and <span class="underline">Venus</span> lost its water. Without water, <span class="underline">Venus</span> became less and less like Earth and kept an <span class="underline">atmosphere</span> filled with <span class="underline">carbon</span> <span class="underline">dioxide</span>. The <span class="underline">carbon</span> <span class="underline">dioxide</span> acts as a <span class="underline">blanket</span>, creating an <span class="underline">intense</span> greenhouse effect and driving surface temperatures high enough to <span class="underline">melt</span> <span class="underline">lead</span> and to <span class="underline">prohibit</span> the <span class="underline">formation</span> of <span class="underline">carbonate</span> minerals. Volcanoes continually vented more <span class="underline">carbon</span> <span class="underline">dioxide</span> into the <span class="underline">atmosphere</span>. On Earth, <span class="underline">liquid</span> water removes <span class="underline">carbon</span> <span class="underline">dioxide</span> from the <span class="underline">atmosphere</span> and combines it with <span class="underline">calcium</span>, from rock <span class="underline">weathering</span>, to form <span class="underline">carbonate</span> <span class="underline">sedimentary</span> rocks. Without <span class="underline">liquid</span> water to remove <span class="underline">carbon</span> from the <span class="underline">atmosphere</span>, the <span class="underline">level</span> of <span class="underline">carbon</span> <span class="underline">dioxide</span> in the <span class="underline">atmosphere</span> of <span class="underline">Venus</span> remains high.</p>
          <p>Like <span class="underline">Venus</span>, Earth is large enough to be geologically active and for its <span class="underline">gravitational</span> <span class="underline">field</span> to hold an <span class="underline">atmosphere</span>. Unlike <span class="underline">Venus</span>, it is just the right distance from the Sun so that <span class="underline">temperature</span> ranges allow water to exist as a <span class="underline">liquid</span>, a <span class="underline">solid</span>, and a gas. Water is thus extremely <span class="underline">mobile</span> and moves rapidly over the <span class="underline">planet</span> in a <span class="underline">continuous</span> <span class="underline">hydrologic</span> <span class="underline">cycle</span>. Heated by the Sun, the water moves in great cycles from the oceans to the <span class="underline">atmosphere</span>, over the <span class="underline">landscape</span> in river systems, and <span class="underline">ultimately</span> back to the oceans. As a result, Earth's surface has been continually changed and eroded into <span class="underline">delicate</span> systems of river valleys - a <span class="underline">remarkable</span> <span class="underline">contrast</span> to the surfaces of other <span class="underline">planetary</span> bodies where <span class="underline">impact</span> craters <span class="underline">dominate</span>. Few areas on Earth have been untouched by flowing water. As a result, river valleys are the <span class="underline">dominant</span> feature of its <span class="underline">landscape</span>. Similarly, wind <span class="underline">action</span> has scoured fine particles away from large areas, depositing them elsewhere as <span class="underline">vast</span> sand seas dominated by dunes or in sheets of <span class="underline">loess</span> (<span class="underline">fine-grained</span> soil deposits). These <span class="underline">fluid</span> movements are caused by <span class="underline">gravity</span> flow systems energized by heat from the Sun. Other geologic changes <span class="underline">occur</span> when the gases in the <span class="underline">atmosphere</span> or water react with rocks at the surface to form new chemical compounds with different properties. An important example of this <span class="underline">process</span> was the <span class="underline">removal</span> of most of Earths <span class="underline">carbon</span> <span class="underline">dioxide</span> from its <span class="underline">atmosphere</span> to form <span class="underline">carbonate</span> rocks. However, if Earth were a little closer to the Sun, its oceans would <span class="underline">evaporate</span>; if it were farther from the Sun, the oceans would <span class="underline">freeze</span> <span class="underline">solid</span>. Because <span class="underline">liquid</span> water was present, self-replicating molecules of <span class="underline">carbon</span>, <span class="underline">hydrogen</span>, and <span class="underline">oxygen</span> developed life early in Earth's <span class="underline">history</span> and have <span class="underline">radically</span> modified its surface, blanketing huge parts of the continents with greenery. Life thrives on this <span class="underline">planet</span>, and it helped create the <span class="underline">planet</span>'s oxygen- and nitrogen-rich <span class="underline">atmosphere</span> and <span class="underline">moderate</span> temperatures.</p>
