            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.57" data-time="12">[00:12.00]</span>Student:Everything's ready. Ah, fifteen people have signed up. <span class="time" data-times="5.73" data-time="14.57">[00:14.57]</span>Our train gets into New York City at noon which leaves plenty of time to get <span class="underline">downtown</span> to the art <span class="underline">gallery</span> for the <span class="underline">reception</span>.</p>
