The choice of Memphis by Egypt's first kings reflects the site's <span class="highlight">strategic</span> importance. First, and most <span class="highlight">obvious</span>, the <span class="highlight">apex</span> of the Nile River <span class="highlight">delta</span> was a politically opportune location for the <span class="highlight">state</span>'s administrative center, standing between the united lands of Upper and <span class="highlight">Lower</span> Egypt and offering ready <span class="highlight">access</span> to both parts of the country. The older <span class="highlight">predynastic</span> (pre-3100 B.C.) centers of power, This and Hierakonpolis, were too <span class="highlight">remote</span> from the <span class="highlight question1">vast</span> expanse of the <span class="highlight">delta</span>, which had been incorporated into the unified <span class="highlight">state</span>. Only a city <span class="highlight">within</span> easy <span class="highlight">reach</span> of both the Nile <span class="highlight">valley</span> to the south and the more <span class="highlight">spread</span> out, difficult <span class="highlight">terrain</span> to the north could provide the necessary <span class="highlight">political</span> control that the rulers of early dynastic Egypt (<span class="highlight">roughly</span> 3000-2600 B.C.) required.</p><p><span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> The <span class="highlight">region</span> of Memphis must have also served as an important node for <span class="highlight">transport</span> and communications, <span class="highlight">even</span> before the unification of Egypt. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> The <span class="highlight">region</span> probably acted as a <span class="highlight">conduit</span> for much, if not all, of the river-based <span class="highlight">trade</span> between northern and southern Egypt. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span> Moreover, commodities (such as wine, <span class="highlight">precious</span> oils, and metals) imported from the Near East by the royal courts of <span class="highlight">predynastic</span> Upper Egypt would have been channeled <span class="highlight">through</span> the Memphis <span class="highlight">region</span> on their way south. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span><span class="question6">In short, <span class="highlight">therefore</span>, the site of Memphis offered the rulers of the Early Dynastic Period an <span class="highlight">ideal</span> location for controlling <span class="highlight">internal</span><span class="highlight">trade</span><span class="highlight">within</span> their <span class="highlight">realm</span>, an <span class="highlight">essential</span> requirement for a state-directed <span class="highlight">economy</span> that depended on the movement of goods.</span></p><p>Equally important for the national <span class="highlight">administration</span> was the <span class="highlight">ability</span> to control communications <span class="highlight">within</span> Egypt. The Nile provided the easiest and quickest <span class="highlight">artery</span> of communication and the national capital was, again, ideally located in this <span class="highlight">respect</span>. Recent geological surveys of the Memphis <span class="highlight">region</span> have revealed much about its <span class="highlight">topography</span> in <span class="highlight">ancient</span> times. It appears that the location of Memphis may have been <span class="highlight">even</span> more <span class="highlight">advantageous</span> for controlling <span class="highlight">trade</span>, <span class="highlight">transport</span>, and communications than was <span class="highlight">previously</span><span class="question7">appreciated</span>. Surveys and <span class="highlight">drill</span> cores have shown that the <span class="highlight">level</span> of the Nile <span class="highlight">floodplain</span> has steadily risen over the last five millenniums. When the <span class="highlight">floodplain</span> was much <span class="highlight">lower</span>, as it would have been in <span class="highlight">predynastic</span> and early dynastic times, the <span class="highlight">outwash</span> fans (fan-shaped deposits of sediments) of various wadis (stream-beds or channels that carry water only during rainy periods) would have been much more <span class="highlight">prominent</span> features on the east bank. The fan <span class="highlight">associated</span> with the <span class="highlight">Wadi</span> Hof extended a <span class="highlight">significant</span> way into the Nile <span class="highlight">floodplain</span>, forming a constriction in the <span class="highlight"><span class="question9">vicinity</span></span> of Memphis. The <span class="highlight">valley</span> may have narrowed at this point to a <span class="highlight">mere</span> three kilometers, making it the <span class="highlight">ideal</span> place for controlling river traffic.</p><p>Furthermore, the Memphis <span class="highlight">region</span> seems to have been favorably located for the control not only of river-based <span class="highlight">trade</span> but also of <span class="highlight">desert</span><span class="highlight">trade</span> routes. The two <span class="highlight">outwash</span> fans in the area gave <span class="highlight">access</span> to the <span class="highlight">extensive</span><span class="highlight">wadi</span> systems of the eastern <span class="highlight">desert</span>. In <span class="highlight">predynastic</span> times, the <span class="highlight">Wadi</span> Digla may have served as a <span class="highlight">trade</span><span class="highlight">route</span> between the Memphis <span class="highlight">region</span> and the Near East, to judge from the unusual <span class="highlight">concentration</span> of foreign artifacts found in the <span class="highlight">predynastic</span><span class="highlight">settlement</span> of Maadi. <span class="highlight">Access</span> to, and control of, <span class="highlight">trade</span> routes between Egypt and the Near East seems to have been a <span class="highlight">preoccupation</span> of Egypt's rulers during the period of <span class="highlight">state</span><span class="highlight">formation</span>. The <span class="highlight">desire</span> to <span class="highlight">monopolize</span> foreign <span class="highlight">trade</span> may have been one of the <span class="highlight">primary</span> factors behind the <span class="highlight">political</span> unification of Egypt. The <span class="highlight">foundation</span> of the national capital at the <span class="highlight">junction</span> of an important <span class="highlight">trade</span><span class="highlight">route</span> with the Nile <span class="highlight">valley</span> is not likely <span class="question11">to have been accidental.</span> Moreover, the Wadis Hof and Digla provided the Memphis <span class="highlight">region</span> with <span class="highlight">accessible</span><span class="highlight">desert</span><span class="highlight">pasturage</span>. As was the case with the cities of Hierakonpolis and Elkab, the <span class="highlight">combination</span><span class="highlight">within</span> the same area of both <span class="highlight">desert</span><span class="highlight">pasturage</span> and <span class="highlight">alluvial</span><span class="highlight">arable</span> land (land <span class="highlight">suitable</span> for growing crops) was a particularly <span class="highlight">attractive</span> one for early <span class="highlight">settlement</span>; this <span class="highlight">combination</span> no <span class="highlight">doubt</span> contributed to the <span class="highlight">prosperity</span> of the Memphis <span class="highlight">region</span> from early <span class="highlight">predynastic</span> times.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">vast</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. fertile</p><p>B. huge</p><p>C. unique</p><p>D. irregular</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>This question is a vocabulary question. The meaning of "vast" is "huge; a large number". The word "This and Hierakonpolis, too too remote from the vast expanse of the delta, which had been incorporated into the unified state." means "This. The city and Hierakonpolis (Jeiropolis) are far away from the vast Nile Delta, and this area has been incorporated into the unified kingdom of Egypt." Let's look at the options:</p><p>A option: fertile meaning "fertile", meaning does not match, so ruled out.</p><p>Option B: Huge means "huge". Meaning is correct. It is the correct answer.</p><p>The C option: unique means "unique, unique" and does not match, so it is excluded.</p><p>D option: Irregular means "irregular, irregular" meaning does not match, so ruled out.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 1, why was Memphis a better choice for the capital of a united Egypt than either This or Hierakonpolis?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Memphis was in a better location for maintaining administrative control.</p><p>B. Memphis had long been a regional administrative center by the time Egypt was united.</p><p>C. This and Hierakonpolis had never actually been incorporated into the unified state.</p><p>D. Egyptian rulers had failed to keep political control over This and Hierakonpolis in predynastic times.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The title is factual information. According to the keyword "choice" in the title, locate the sentence in the first paragraph. "The choice of Memphis by Egypt's first kings reflects the site's strategic importance." Explains that Memphis's location is of strategic significance. Let's look at "First, and most obvious, the apex of the Nile River delta was a politically opportune location." For the state's administrative center, standing between the united lands of Upper and Lower Egypt and offering ready access to both parts of the country." This sentence emphasizes that the geographical location of Memphis lies between the two parts of the country. The geographical location is very conducive to the management of the entire country. The author's example of "This" and "Hierakonpolis" is the comparison of Memphis's position. The two cities are too far away from the Nile Delta to provide the rulers of the early Egyptian dynasty with the necessary political rule. condition. So the A option is correct.</p><p>Option B: Memphis had been the administrative center of the region until its unification in Egypt. Wrong, because the text says "The older predynastic (pre-3100 BC) centers of power. This and Hierakonpolis, too too remote from the vast expanse of the delta..." explicitly mentions that Egypt's former political center was "This" and " Hierakonpolis". Therefore, the B option is wrong.</p><p>Option C: "This" and "Hierakonpolis" have never really been incorporated into the unified Egypt. Wrong, because the article says "This and Hierakonpolis,...had been incorporated into the unified state." The C option contradicts the original and is therefore excluded.</p><p>Option D: In the former dynasty, the Egyptian rulers were unable to rule politically in "This" and "Hierakonpolis". It was not mentioned in the text and was ruled out.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>It can be inferred from paragraph 1 that one consequence of the unification of Egypt was</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. the reduction of the strategic importance of older centers of power</p><p>B. the opportunity for the recently united Egypt to become economically self-sufficient</p><p>C. the increase in political tensions between the rulers of Upper and Lower Egypt</p><p>D. the reduction of Egypt's dependence upon the Nile for trade and communications</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>This question is a reasoning question. The question asked what is the result of the unity of Egypt. According to the last two sentences of the first paragraph, we can learn that "This" and "Hierakonpolis" are the old capitals of Egypt, but because they are too far away from the Nile Delta, they cannot provide political rule for the rulers of the early Egyptian dynasties. The necessary conditions, and thus the superior geographical location of Memphis replaced. So the A option: The reduction of old strategic importance is the correct answer.</p><p>Option B: Egypt in modern times has the opportunity to achieve economic self-sufficiency. Wrong, because the first paragraph did not mention anything related to the economy at all, so Option B was ruled out.</p><p>Option C: The relationship between the rulers of Upper Egypt and Lower Egypt became tense. In the first paragraph, only the sentence mentioned Upper Egypt and Lower Egypt "First, and most obvious, the apex of the Nile River delta...standing between the united lands of Upper and Lower Egypt and offering ready access to both parts Of the country." But this sentence is to describe the excellent geographical location of Memphis, and it has nothing to do with the tensions in political relations. Therefore, the C option is not mentioned in the text and excluded.</p><p>Option D: Reduced dependence on Egypt for trade and communications through the Nile. Wrong, because in the first paragraph there is no mention of Egypt's dependence on the Nile for trade and communications, and there is no way to talk about reducing dependence. Therefore, the D option was not mentioned in the first paragraph and was excluded.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the following best describes how paragraph 1 is organized?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Two simultaneous developments are described, as well as the reasons why neither one would have occurred without the other.</p><p>B. A hypothesis is presented, and then points in favor of that hypothesis as well as points against it are discussed.</p><p>C. A major event is described, and then the most obvious effects of that event are presented.</p><p>D. A decision is described, and then one likely motivation for that decision is presented.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The title is organizational structure questions. The first question is how to organize? We read through the first paragraph and look for logical words to analyze the structure of this paragraph of text. The first sentence describes the geographical location and historical background of Memphis. The second sentence suggests that the location of Memphis reflects its strategic importance. The third sentence gives the reason: Memphis is in the middle and the lower half of the country and has a very good location for the national administrative center. The fourth sentence uses the remote locations of the cities of "This" and "Hierakonpolis" as inverse proportions to bring out the geographical superiority of Memphis. The fifth sentence summarizes that Memphis is close to both the North and the South and can provide the necessary conditions for political rule for the rulers of the early Egyptian dynasty. Below we look at the options:</p><p>A option: Simultaneously describe two kinds of development, and two indispensable reasons. Wrong, because the text does not describe two kinds of development, only describes the strategic importance of Memphis.Therefore, A is excluded.</p><p>Option B: Propose an illusion and then discuss the content that supports the hypothesis and overturns the hypothesis. This paragraph proposes that "the location of Memphis reflects strategic importance" and gives reasons for support, but it does not override the hypothesis. Therefore, the B option is excluded.</p><p>Option C: Describes a major event and then discusses its impact. Wrong because the first paragraph did not discuss the impact of choosing Memphis as the capital.</p><p>D option: First describe a conclusion and then propose a possible reason. Correctly, the first paragraph described the conclusion that "The choice of Memphis by Egypt's first kings reflects the site's strategic importance." The first reason is that "First, and most obvious, the apex of the Nile River delta was a politically opportune. Location for the state's administrative center,... "So the D option fits the organizational structure of the first paragraph.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 2, when did Egypt import goods from the Near East?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Once internal trade was fully controlled from Memphis</p><p>B. Not until early dynastic Egypt established its state-directed economy</p><p>C. As early as predynastic times</p><p>D. Only when local supplies of those goods had been completely used up</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The title is factual information. According to the keywords "import" and "Near East" in the title, the second sentence of the third sentence "Moreover, commodities (such as wine, precious oils, and metals) imported from the Near East by the royal courts of Predynastic Upper Egypt would have been channeled through the Memphis region on their way south." "Predynastic" in the sentence corresponds exactly to the "predynastic time" in the C option. In addition, the first sentence of the second paragraph also indicates that the Memphis region must also be an important hub for transportation and communications, even before the reunification of Egypt. The "before Egypt's unification" here refers to the predynastic time before the dynasty. Therefore, the C option is correct.</p><p>Option A: When Memphis controls domestic trade. According to "internal trade", the last sentence of paragraph 2 is positioned "In short, accordingly, the site of Memphis offered the rulers of the Early Dynastic Period an ideal location for controlling internal trade within their realm..." but this is a summary sentence, Regardless of the topic, A is excluded.</p><p>Option B: Until the early days of the new dynasty when Egypt established a state-owned economy. The term "state directed economy" is only mentioned in the last sentence of the second paragraph, but is not related to the topic and is therefore excluded.</p><p>D option: When the local merchandise runs out. It was not mentioned in the article and was ruled out.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Thus in Memphis, the rulers of the Early Dynastic Period were ideally placed to control internal trade, which they had to do in order to run their economy.</p><p>B. Therefore the rulers of the Early Dynastic Period thought Memphis was the ideal location for trade with nearby countries.</p><p>C. In short, a state-directed economy like that of the Early Dynastic Period requires choosing a single location to which goods can be moved-Memphis, in this case.</p><p>D. In sum, then, a state-directed economy first developed during Egypt's Early Dynastic Period because Memphis was an ideal location for controlling trade.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>This question is a sentence simplification question. First of all, let's look at the sentence to be simplified. The subject is site, which means that Memphis' site selection can provide the rulers of the early Egyptian dynasty with an ideal geographical position to control domestic trade, and in the latter half of the sentence "An essential requirement" is an appositive for "controlling internal trade within their realm," which means that controlling domestic trade is a necessary condition for establishing a state-owned economy that depends on the circulation of goods. Let's look at the options below:</p><p>In option A, "were ideally placed" corresponds to the "an ideal location" in the original text. The meaning of the sentence is basically the same as the sentence to be simplified. The main component is a lot, so A is the correct answer.</p><p>The B option lacks the content of "controlling the domestic economy to build the state-owned economy" in the latter part of the original text. Therefore, the B option lacks the important components of the sentence and excludes it.</p><p>The C option dominates the main content of the sentence, saying that in order to build a state-owned economy, it is necessary to find a place where goods can circulate, such as Memphis. The original sentence mainly emphasizes the importance of the geographical location of Memphis. Therefore, the C option is logically incorrect.</p><p>The D option, like the C option, emphasizes the emergence of the state-owned economy. But the original sentence emphasizes the importance of the geographical location of Memphis. Therefore, the D option is logically incorrect.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question7">appreciated</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. proposed</p><p>B. understood</p><p>C. approved</p><p>D. expected</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>This question is a vocabulary question. "<span class="question7">appreciated</span>" means "grasping; understanding, understanding". The word "It appears that the location of Memphis may have even even more Benefit for controlling trade, transport, and communications than was previously <span class="question7">appreciated</span>." means "From this point of view, the geographical location of Memphis may be even more advantageous than what people had previously thought of controlling trade, transportation, and communications." Let's look at options:</p><p>A option "proposed", proposal; proposal, meaning does not match, so ruled out.</p><p>B option "understood", understanding, understanding, meaning is the closest, so it is the correct answer.</p><p>C option "approved", yes, support, meaning does not match, so ruled out.</p><p>D option "expected", expectation, expectation, meaning does not match, so ruled out.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 3, recent research into the topography of the Memphis region in ancient times suggests which of the following?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The level of the Nile floodplains was much higher in predynastic and dynastic times than in later times.</p><p>B. The sediment deposits of wadis were not as noticeable in predynastic and dynastic times than in later times.</p><p>C. The Nile valley at the point of Memphis was narrower in predynastic and dynastic times than it was in later times.</p><p>D. Frequent rainy periods may have caused a significant reduction of trade traffic during the predynastic and dynastic times.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The title is factual information. After reading through the third paragraph, we look at the options one by one:</p><p>Option A: The height of the floodplain of the Nile is much higher at "predynastic and dynastic times". The word "When the floodplain was much lower, as it would have been been in predynastic and early dynastic times..." so we can know Many, so the A option is contradictory with the original and excluded.</p><p>Option B: River sediments are more "predynastic and dynastic times" than later, but there is no mention of river sediments in these two periods. The article only mentioned "much more prominent features on the east bank." There are more sediments on the east bank. Therefore, the B option is not mentioned in the text and is excluded.</p><p>Option C: The Nile Valley is narrower during the period of "predynastic and dynastic times." Corresponding to the phrase "The valley may have narrowed at this point to a mere three kilometers, making it the ideal place for controlling river traffic." It means that the valley became very narrow at the time and it was only 3 kilometers wide. Make it an ideal place to control river traffic. Therefore, the C option meets the original text and is correct.</p><p>Option D: Frequent rainfall reduces trade traffic in "predynastic and dynastic times". Wrong, because the text did not mention it.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question9">vicinity</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. center</p><p>B. fields</p><p>C. city</p><p>D. surrounding area</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" D"><p>This question is a vocabulary question. "<span class="question9">vicinity</span>" means "nearby" and the word "The fan associated with the Wadi Hof extended a significant way into the Nile floodplain, forming a constriction in the <span class="question9">vicinity</span> of Memphis." means "Hof River Ice". The water fan extended to the floodplain of the Nile and caused a squeeze near the city of Memphis." Let's look at the options:</p><p>A option "center", meaning "central; center", does not match, so it is excluded.</p><p>The B option "fields", meaning "sites; fields," does not match, so it is excluded.</p><p>The C option "city", meaning "city", does not match, so it is excluded.</p><p>The D option "surrounding area", meaning "nearby place", means that the meaning is correct and therefore it is the correct answer.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, which of the following is NOT a reason Memphis was chosen as the capital of a united Egypt?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It was at the junction of a major trade route with the Nile valley.</p><p>B. It was near land that could be used for animal grazing and for growing crops.</p><p>C. The nearby outwash fans led into wadis that could be used as desert trade routes.</p><p>D. Since foreign traders had settled in nearby Maadi, trade between the two cities could be established.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>This question is a negative factual information question. We look for keywords from the options, locate the original text, and eliminate them one by one.</p><p>A option, according to the keyword "junction" to locate the phrase "The foundation of the national capital at the junction of an important trade route with the Nile valley is not likely <span class="question11">to have been accidental.</span>" The trade route between Egypt and the Near East is an urgent task for Egyptian rulers when the country was just completed. Therefore, the A option is in accordance with the original text and excluded.</p><p>Option B corresponds to the countdown to the fourth paragraph and the two sentences. The two sentences say that desert ranch and alluvial arable land are combined in the area, so the B option is in accordance with the original text and excluded.</p><p>The C option corresponds to the second sentence of the fourth paragraph, "The two outwash fans in the area gave access to the extensive wadi systems of the eastern desert."</p><p>Option D stated that foreign traders settled near Mardi City and promoted trade between the two places. The information is not mentioned in the text, so the D option is the correct answer.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The phrase "<span class="highlight">to have been accidental</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. to have gone wrong</p><p>B. to have been helpful</p><p>C. to have occurred by chance</p><p>D. to have made a difference</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="to have been accidental C"><p>This question is a vocabulary question. "To have been accidental" means "accidentally". The phrase "The foundation of the national capital at the junction of an important trade route with the Nile valley is not likely <span class="question11">to have been accidental.</span>" It is not accidental that "it is a coincidence that the establishment of a national capital at the intersection of the important trade route and the Nile Valley." Let's look at the options:</p><p>The "A" option means "out of question" and does not match. Therefore, it is excluded.</p><p>The meaning of B option is "helpful", meaning it does not match, so it is excluded.</p><p>The C option means "accidentally". The meaning is correct, so it is the correct answer.</p><p>The meaning of the D option is "become different".</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>In paragraph 4, why does the author mention the cities of Hierakonpolis and Elkab?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To give an indication of the level of prosperity that Memphis is thought to have enjoyed from its earliest days</p><p>B. To compare the Memphis region to them in terms of their similar combinations of characteristics providing advantages for early settlement</p><p>C. To identify the models that the founders of Memphis followed in laying out the national capital</p><p>D. To suggest that the combination of desert pasturage and alluvial arable land in the same area was very common</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>This question is title of function. First of all, we use the keyword "Hierakonpolis and Elkab" to locate its position in the text. This is the last sentence in this paragraph. It means "the combination of desert pasture and alluvial cultivated land (land suitable for cultivating crops) in the same area, making this area It has become a particularly attractive early settlement; this combination has undoubtedly contributed to the prosperity of the Memphis region in the early days of the dynasty." Look at the previous sentence "Moreover, the Wadis Hof and Digla provided the Memphis region with accessible desert pasturage By combining these two sentences, we can see that Memphis, like Hierakonpolis and Elkab, is a combination of desert pasture and alluvial cultivated land. Therefore, the author exemplifies the desert ranch and the alluvial cultivated land, which can also promote Memphis's Prosperity provides favorable conditions for settlement. This is also an important reason for Memphis's site selection. So the B option is correct.</p><p>A option: An example of the early level of prosperity in Memphis. Wrong, because the author cited the example of the two cities, not to illustrate how early Memphis had flourished, but to emphasize that they have similar geographical features, and this geographic feature is very beneficial to the prosperity of the city. Therefore, the A option is excluded.Option C: The builders build Memphis with reference to these two cities. Wrong, because the article did not mention this information. Therefore, C excludes.</p><p>Option D: Explain that the combination of desert grazing land and alluvial cultivated land is very common. Wrong, the article did not mention this information, and this is not the main purpose of the author's example of the two cities. Therefore, D is excluded.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>While considerations of political power and ease of administration were decisive in choosing the location of the new capital, the site clearly had other advantages..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>This question is a sentence insertion question. The sentence to be inserted means "Although political factors and ease of management are decisive factors in the capital's site selection, it is clear that Memphis was chosen as the capital because it has other advantages." The first paragraph of the article is all in the Describe the geographical location of Memphis can provide the necessary conditions for the rulers of the early Egyptian dynasty to provide political rule. The entire second paragraph describes the Memphis area as an important hub for transportation and communications. Therefore, the sentence is inserted at the beginning of the second paragraph, that is, A is the most appropriate place to play a role in the connection.

Correct, corresponding to the second paragraph of the article 2, 3 sentence, so the A option is a summary of the second paragraph of the article, it is correct.</p><p>Option B says that recent geological studies have found that the topographic features of Memphis make it an ideal location for controlling communications and trade. Corresponding to the sentence in the third paragraph of the article "It appears that the location of Memphis may have been even more provided for controlling trade, transport, and communications than was previously <span class="question7">appreciated</span>." the B option is a summary of the third paragraph of the article. It is correct.</p><p>The C option says that Egyptian rulers monopolize foreign trade because these trades need to go through the Digla River. The phrase corresponding to the last paragraph "In predynastic times, the Wadi Digla may have served as a trade route between the Memphis region and the Near East, to judge from the unusual concentration of foreign artifacts found in the predynastic settlement of Maadi." C The options are not explicitly mentioned in the text, and they are only details, not the subject of the article. It is excluded.Option D said that after Memphis became the capital, the importance of the Nile trade increased, and the importance of land desert trade decreased. This information is not mentioned in the text, and based on the full text information, we can speculate that desert trade was equally important at the time. Therefore, the D option is excluded.</p><p>The E option says that although the valleys near Memphis have been squeezed, the Nile remains the best route for communications and travel as the flood plains rise. This information is not mentioned in the text and is detailed information that can be excluded directly.</p><p>The F option says that the geographical location of Memphis, in addition to favouring agricultural development, will also help Egyptian rulers control the desert trade between Egypt and the Near East. It is a summary of the last paragraph of the article, so the F option is correct.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
