            <b>Memphis: United Egypt's First Capital</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>The city of Memphis, located on the Nile near the modern city of Cairo, was founded around 3100 B.C. as the first capital of a recently united Egypt. The choice of Memphis by Egypt's first kings reflects the site's <span class="underline">strategic</span> importance. First, and most <span class="underline">obvious</span>, the <span class="underline">apex</span> of the Nile River <span class="underline">delta</span> was a politically opportune location for the <span class="underline">state</span>'s administrative center, standing between the united lands of Upper and <span class="underline">Lower</span> Egypt and offering ready <span class="underline">access</span> to both parts of the country. The older <span class="underline">predynastic</span> (pre-3100 B.C.) centers of power, This and Hierakonpolis, were too <span class="underline">remote</span> from the <span class="light"><span class="underline">vast</span></span> expanse of the <span class="underline">delta</span>, which had been incorporated into the unified <span class="underline">state</span>. Only a city <span class="underline">within</span> easy <span class="underline">reach</span> of both the Nile <span class="underline">valley</span> to the south and the more <span class="underline">spread</span> out, difficult <span class="underline">terrain</span> to the north could provide the necessary <span class="underline">political</span> control that the rulers of early dynastic Egypt (<span class="underline">roughly</span> 3000-2600 B.C.) required.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A">
            </span> The <span class="underline">region</span> of Memphis must have also served as an important node for <span class="underline">transport</span> and communications, <span class="underline">even</span> before the unification of Egypt. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> The <span class="underline">region</span> probably acted as a <span class="underline">conduit</span> for much, if not all, of the river-based <span class="underline">trade</span> between northern and southern Egypt. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span> Moreover, commodities (such as wine, <span class="underline">precious</span> oils, and metals) imported from the Near East by the royal courts of <span class="underline">predynastic</span> Upper Egypt would have been channeled <span class="underline">through</span> the Memphis <span class="underline">region</span> on their way south. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span> In short, <span class="underline">therefore</span>, the site of Memphis offered the rulers of the Early Dynastic Period an <span class="underline">ideal</span> location for controlling <span class="underline">internal</span> <span class="underline">trade</span> <span class="underline">within</span> their <span class="underline">realm</span>, an <span class="underline">essential</span> requirement for a state-directed <span class="underline">economy</span> that depended on the movement of goods.</p>
          <p>Equally important for the national <span class="underline">administration</span> was the <span class="underline">ability</span> to control communications <span class="underline">within</span> Egypt. The Nile provided the easiest and quickest <span class="underline">artery</span> of communication and the national capital was, again, ideally located in this <span class="underline">respect</span>. Recent geological surveys of the Memphis <span class="underline">region</span> have revealed much about its <span class="underline">topography</span> in <span class="underline">ancient</span> times. It appears that the location of Memphis may have been <span class="underline">even</span> more <span class="underline">advantageous</span> for controlling <span class="underline">trade</span>, <span class="underline">transport</span>, and communications than was <span class="underline">previously</span> appreciated. Surveys and <span class="underline">drill</span> cores have shown that the <span class="underline">level</span> of the Nile <span class="underline">floodplain</span> has steadily risen over the last five millenniums. When the <span class="underline">floodplain</span> was much <span class="underline">lower</span>, as it would have been in <span class="underline">predynastic</span> and early dynastic times, the <span class="underline">outwash</span> fans (fan-shaped deposits of sediments) of various wadis (stream-beds or channels that carry water only during rainy periods) would have been much more <span class="underline">prominent</span> features on the east bank. The fan <span class="underline">associated</span> with the <span class="underline">Wadi</span> Hof extended a <span class="underline">significant</span> way into the Nile <span class="underline">floodplain</span>, forming a constriction in the <span class="underline">vicinity</span> of Memphis. The <span class="underline">valley</span> may have narrowed at this point to a <span class="underline">mere</span> three kilometers, making it the <span class="underline">ideal</span> place for controlling river traffic.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, the Memphis <span class="underline">region</span> seems to have been favorably located for the control not only of river-based <span class="underline">trade</span> but also of <span class="underline">desert</span> <span class="underline">trade</span> routes. The two <span class="underline">outwash</span> fans in the area gave <span class="underline">access</span> to the <span class="underline">extensive</span> <span class="underline">wadi</span> systems of the eastern <span class="underline">desert</span>. In <span class="underline">predynastic</span> times, the <span class="underline">Wadi</span> Digla may have served as a <span class="underline">trade</span> <span class="underline">route</span> between the Memphis <span class="underline">region</span> and the Near East, to judge from the unusual <span class="underline">concentration</span> of foreign artifacts found in the <span class="underline">predynastic</span> <span class="underline">settlement</span> of Maadi. <span class="underline">Access</span> to, and control of, <span class="underline">trade</span> routes between Egypt and the Near East seems to have been a <span class="underline">preoccupation</span> of Egypt's rulers during the period of <span class="underline">state</span> <span class="underline">formation</span>. The <span class="underline">desire</span> to <span class="underline">monopolize</span> foreign <span class="underline">trade</span> may have been one of the <span class="underline">primary</span> factors behind the <span class="underline">political</span> unification of Egypt. The <span class="underline">foundation</span> of the national capital at the <span class="underline">junction</span> of an important <span class="underline">trade</span> <span class="underline">route</span> with the Nile <span class="underline">valley</span> is not likely to have been accidental. Moreover, the Wadis Hof and Digla provided the Memphis <span class="underline">region</span> with <span class="underline">accessible</span> <span class="underline">desert</span> <span class="underline">pasturage</span>. As was the case with the cities of Hierakonpolis and Elkab, the <span class="underline">combination</span> <span class="underline">within</span> the same area of both <span class="underline">desert</span> <span class="underline">pasturage</span> and <span class="underline">alluvial</span> <span class="underline">arable</span> land (land <span class="underline">suitable</span> for growing crops) was a particularly <span class="underline">attractive</span> one for early <span class="underline">settlement</span>; this <span class="underline">combination</span> no <span class="underline">doubt</span> contributed to the <span class="underline">prosperity</span> of the Memphis <span class="underline">region</span> from early <span class="underline">predynastic</span> times.</p>
