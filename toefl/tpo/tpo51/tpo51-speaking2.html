During a campaign, many candidates may make a lot of propaganda videos to create a trustworthy and reliable public image. However, in these materials, it may have some made-up information which is used to mislead and attract potential voters, who know nothing of what the true story is. If this trick could happen to adults, not to mention those eighteen-year-old youth. Therefore, it is unwise to allow eighteen-year-olds to vote and a better approach would be to let them vote when they get older and more mature, like 24-year-old or something.</p></article></div></main></body></html>
