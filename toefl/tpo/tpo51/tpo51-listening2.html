          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="10.26" data-time="43.49">[00:43.49]</span>Now, <span class="highlight">scientific</span> theories about the origins of <span class="highlight">maize</span> first started coming out in the 1930s, one involved a plant called teosinte.<span class="time" data-times="5.6" data-time="53.75">[00:53.75]</span>Teosinte is a tall grass that grows wild in certain parts of Mexico and Guatemala. <span class="time" data-times="9.94" data-time="59.35">[00:59.35]</span>When researchers first started looking at wild teosinte plants, they thought there was a <span class="highlight">chance</span> that the two plants, um, <span class="highlight">maize</span> and teosinte, were related. <span class="time" data-times="4.44" data-time="69.29">[01:09.29]</span>The young wild teosinte plant looks a lot like the corn plant. <span class="time" data-times="6.06" data-time="73.73">[01:13.73]</span>And the plants continue to <span class="highlight">resemble</span> each other, at <span class="highlight">least</span> <span class="highlight">superficially</span>, <span class="highlight">even</span> when they're developed.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.36" data-time="79.79">[01:19.79]</span> But when the scientists examined the fruits of the two plants, it was a different story.<span class="time" data-times="9.5" data-time="85.15">[01:25.15]</span> When you look at right corn, you see <span class="highlight">roll</span> upon <span class="highlight">roll</span> of juicy kernels, um, all those tiny little yellow squares that people eat. <span class="time" data-times="10.95" data-time="94.65">[01:34.65]</span>Fully-grown teosinte, on the other hand, has a skinny <span class="highlight">stock</span> that holds only a <span class="highlight">dozen</span> or so kernels behind a hard, um, almost a stone-like casing.<span class="time" data-times="9.35" data-time="105.6">[01:45.60]</span> In fact, based on the <span class="highlight">appearance</span> of its fruit, teosinte was <span class="highlight">initially</span> considered to be a closer <span class="highlight">relative</span> to rice than to <span class="highlight">maize</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="11.38" data-time="114.95">[01:54.95]</span>But there was one geneticist, named George Beadle, who didn't give up so easily on the idea that teosinte might be, well, the parent of corn. <span class="time" data-times="9.13" data-time="126.33">[02:06.33]</span>While still a student in the 1930s, Beadle actually found that the two plants have very <span class="highlight">similar</span> chromosomes, very <span class="highlight">similar</span> <span class="highlight">genetic</span> information.<span class="time" data-times="4.56" data-time="135.46">[02:15.46]</span> In fact, he was <span class="highlight">even</span> able to make <span class="highlight">fertile</span> hybrids between the two plants.<span class="time" data-times="7.82" data-time="140.02">[02:20.02]</span> In hybridization you remember, the genes of two <span class="highlight">species</span> of plants are mixed to produce a new third plant, a hybrid. <span class="time" data-times="7.49" data-time="147.84">[02:27.84]</span>And if this <span class="highlight">offspring</span>, this hybrid, is <span class="highlight">fertile</span>, then that suggests that the two <span class="highlight">species</span> are closely related <span class="highlight">genetically</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.7" data-time="155.33">[02:35.33]</span>This new hybrid plant looked like an <span class="highlight">intermediate</span>, right between <span class="highlight">maize</span> and teosinte. <span class="time" data-times="9.8" data-time="161.03">[02:41.03]</span>So Beadle concluded that <span class="highlight">maize</span> must have been developed over many years, ah, that is a <span class="highlight">domesticated</span> form of teosinte.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.05" data-time="170.83">[02:50.83]</span>Many experts in the <span class="highlight">scientific</span> <span class="highlight">community</span>, however, remained unconvinced by his conclusions. <span class="time" data-times="11.76" data-time="176.88">[02:56.88]</span>They believed that with so many <span class="highlight">apparent</span> differences between the two plants, it would have been <span class="highlight">unlikely</span> that <span class="highlight">ancient</span>, the pre-historic peoples could have <span class="highlight">domesticated</span> <span class="highlight">maize</span> from teosinte. <span class="time" data-times="8.09" data-time="188.64">[03:08.64]</span>I mean, when you think about it, these people lived in small groups, and they had to be on the move <span class="highlight">constantly</span> as the seasons changed. <span class="time" data-times="17.87" data-time="196.73">[03:16.73]</span>So for them to selectively <span class="highlight">breed</span>, to have the patience to be able to pick out just the right plants and <span class="highlight">gradually</span> over generations, <span class="highlight">separate</span> out the <span class="highlight">durable</span> nutritious <span class="highlight">maize</span> plant from the Beadle teosinte that easily broke apart, it's a <span class="highlight">pretty</span> <span class="highlight">impressive</span> <span class="highlight">feat</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.68" data-time="214.6">[03:34.60]</span>And you can easily see why so many experts would have been <span class="highlight">skeptical</span>. <span class="time" data-times="12.34" data-time="218.28">[03:38.28]</span>But as it turns out, Beadle found <span class="highlight">even</span> more <span class="highlight">evidence</span> for his <span class="highlight">theory</span> when he continued his experiments, producing new hybrids, to <span class="highlight">investigate</span> the <span class="highlight">genetic</span> relationship between teosinte and <span class="highlight">maize</span>. <span class="time" data-times="10.53" data-time="230.62">[03:50.62]</span> <span class="highlight">Through</span> these successful experiments, he calculated that only about 5 <span class="highlight">specific</span> genes were <span class="highlight">responsible</span> for the main differences between teosinte and <span class="highlight">maize</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.55" data-time="241.15">[04:01.15]</span>The plants were <span class="highlight">otherwise</span> surprisingly <span class="highlight">similar</span>, <span class="highlight">genetically</span>.</p>

I mean, when you think about it, these people lived in small groups, and they have to be on move constantly as the seasons changed. So for them to necessarily breed, to have the patience to be able to pick Out just the right plants and gradually over generations, separate out the durable nutritious maize plant from the Beadle teosinte that easily broke apart, it's a pretty impressive feat. The professor here said that at the beginning many scientists did not believe Beardle's conclusion because they felt Taking into account the turbulent lifestyle of the ancient people and the length of time, difficulty and complexity of domesticating wild plants, it is unlikely that the ancient people would successfully domesticate Daweiyu into corn.

              <p>The source of this question is: Professor: Many experts in the scientific community, however, following unconvinced by his conclusions. They believed that with so many apparent differences between the two plants, it would have been impossible that the ancient, the pre-historic peoples could have Domesticated maize from teosinte. I mean, when you think about it, these people lived in small groups, and they have to be on move constantly as the seasons changed. So for them to necessarily breed, to have the patience to be able to pick Out just the right plants and gradually over generations, separate out the durable nutritious maize plant from the Beadle teosinte that easily broke apart, it's a pretty impressive feat. The professor here said that at the beginning many scientists did not believe Beardle's conclusion because they felt that Taking into account the turbulent lifestyle of the ancient people and the length of time, difficulty and complexity of domesticating wild plants, it is unlikely that ancient people would successfully domesticate Daweiyu into corn. Option C is appropriate. Option A said that they accepted the arguments but questioned the evidence. Option B said that they opposed it because the conclusion was inconsistent with the archeological findings. Option D said that they doubted this conclusion because the genetic research at the time was questioned. Select C.......</p>

              <p>The source of this question is: Professor: Through these successful experiments, he calculated that only about 5 specific genes were responsible for the main differences between teosinte and maize. The plant were otherwise surprisingly similar, genetically.</p>
              <p>Here Beatle finally concluded that there are five genes that cause a difference between corn and eutrophin, and most of the other genes are similar. Option C is correct. Option A says that both lack the genes commonly found in a domesticated plant. Option B says that both have genes that allow them to adapt to different climates. Option D says that both the genes and the rice genes are similar and not suitable . Select C.......</p>
