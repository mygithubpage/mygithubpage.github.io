              <span class="time" data-times="10.34" data-time="6.72">[00:06.72]</span>Professor:So, continuing with crop <span class="highlight">domestication</span> and corn, or, um, <span class="highlight">maize</span> as is often called, <span class="highlight">obviously</span> it's one of the world's most important crops today. <span class="time" data-times="7.85" data-time="17.06">[00:17.06]</span>It's such a big part of the <span class="highlight">diet</span> in so many countries and it's got so many different uses that it's hard to imagine a world without it. <span class="time" data-times="14.88" data-time="24.91">[00:24.91]</span>But because it doesn't grow naturally, without human <span class="highlight">cultivation</span>, and because there's no <span class="highlight">obvious</span> wild <span class="highlight">relative</span> of <span class="highlight">maize</span>, um, well, for the longest time researchers weren't able to find any <span class="highlight">clear</span> link between <span class="highlight">maize</span> and other living plants. <span class="time" data-times="3.7" data-time="39.79">[00:39.79]</span>And that's made it hard for them to <span class="highlight">trace</span> the <span class="highlight">history</span> of <span class="highlight">maize</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.26" data-time="43.49">[00:43.49]</span>Now, <span class="highlight">scientific</span> theories about the origins of <span class="highlight">maize</span> first started coming out in the 1930s, one involved a plant called teosinte.<span class="time" data-times="5.6" data-time="53.75">[00:53.75]</span>Teosinte is a tall grass that grows wild in certain parts of Mexico and Guatemala. <span class="time" data-times="9.94" data-time="59.35">[00:59.35]</span>When researchers first started looking at wild teosinte plants, they thought there was a <span class="highlight">chance</span> that the two plants, um, <span class="highlight">maize</span> and teosinte, were related. <span class="time" data-times="4.44" data-time="69.29">[01:09.29]</span>The young wild teosinte plant looks a lot like the corn plant. <span class="time" data-times="6.06" data-time="73.73">[01:13.73]</span>And the plants continue to <span class="highlight">resemble</span> each other, at <span class="highlight">least</span> <span class="highlight">superficially</span>, <span class="highlight">even</span> when they're developed.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.36" data-time="79.79">[01:19.79]</span> But when the scientists examined the fruits of the two plants, it was a different story.<span class="time" data-times="9.5" data-time="85.15">[01:25.15]</span> When you look at right corn, you see <span class="highlight">roll</span> upon <span class="highlight">roll</span> of juicy kernels, um, all those tiny little yellow squares that people eat. <span class="time" data-times="10.95" data-time="94.65">[01:34.65]</span>Fully-grown teosinte, on the other hand, has a skinny <span class="highlight">stock</span> that holds only a <span class="highlight">dozen</span> or so kernels behind a hard, um, almost a stone-like casing.<span class="time" data-times="9.35" data-time="105.6">[01:45.60]</span> In fact, based on the <span class="highlight">appearance</span> of its fruit, teosinte was <span class="highlight">initially</span> considered to be a closer <span class="highlight">relative</span> to rice than to <span class="highlight">maize</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="11.38" data-time="114.95">[01:54.95]</span>But there was one geneticist, named George Beadle, who didn't give up so easily on the idea that teosinte might be, well, the parent of corn. <span class="time" data-times="9.13" data-time="126.33">[02:06.33]</span>While still a student in the 1930s, Beadle actually found that the two plants have very <span class="highlight">similar</span> chromosomes, very <span class="highlight">similar</span> <span class="highlight">genetic</span> information.<span class="time" data-times="4.56" data-time="135.46">[02:15.46]</span> In fact, he was <span class="highlight">even</span> able to make <span class="highlight">fertile</span> hybrids between the two plants.<span class="time" data-times="7.82" data-time="140.02">[02:20.02]</span> In hybridization you remember, the genes of two <span class="highlight">species</span> of plants are mixed to produce a new third plant, a hybrid. <span class="time" data-times="7.49" data-time="147.84">[02:27.84]</span>And if this <span class="highlight">offspring</span>, this hybrid, is <span class="highlight">fertile</span>, then that suggests that the two <span class="highlight">species</span> are closely related <span class="highlight">genetically</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.7" data-time="155.33">[02:35.33]</span>This new hybrid plant looked like an <span class="highlight">intermediate</span>, right between <span class="highlight">maize</span> and teosinte. <span class="time" data-times="9.8" data-time="161.03">[02:41.03]</span>So Beadle concluded that <span class="highlight">maize</span> must have been developed over many years, ah, that is a <span class="highlight">domesticated</span> form of teosinte.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.05" data-time="170.83">[02:50.83]</span>Many experts in the <span class="highlight">scientific</span> <span class="highlight">community</span>, however, remained unconvinced by his conclusions. <span class="time" data-times="11.76" data-time="176.88">[02:56.88]</span>They believed that with so many <span class="highlight">apparent</span> differences between the two plants, it would have been <span class="highlight">unlikely</span> that <span class="highlight">ancient</span>, the pre-historic peoples could have <span class="highlight">domesticated</span> <span class="highlight">maize</span> from teosinte. <span class="time" data-times="8.09" data-time="188.64">[03:08.64]</span>I mean, when you think about it, these people lived in small groups, and they had to be on the move <span class="highlight">constantly</span> as the seasons changed. <span class="time" data-times="17.87" data-time="196.73">[03:16.73]</span>So for them to selectively <span class="highlight">breed</span>, to have the patience to be able to pick out just the right plants and <span class="highlight">gradually</span> over generations, <span class="highlight">separate</span> out the <span class="highlight">durable</span> nutritious <span class="highlight">maize</span> plant from the Beadle teosinte that easily broke apart, it's a <span class="highlight">pretty</span> <span class="highlight">impressive</span> <span class="highlight">feat</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.68" data-time="214.6">[03:34.60]</span>And you can easily see why so many experts would have been <span class="highlight">skeptical</span>. <span class="time" data-times="12.34" data-time="218.28">[03:38.28]</span>But as it turns out, Beadle found <span class="highlight">even</span> more <span class="highlight">evidence</span> for his <span class="highlight">theory</span> when he continued his experiments, producing new hybrids, to <span class="highlight">investigate</span> the <span class="highlight">genetic</span> relationship between teosinte and <span class="highlight">maize</span>. <span class="time" data-times="10.53" data-time="230.62">[03:50.62]</span> <span class="highlight">Through</span> these successful experiments, he calculated that only about 5 <span class="highlight">specific</span> genes were <span class="highlight">responsible</span> for the main differences between teosinte and <span class="highlight">maize</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.55" data-time="241.15">[04:01.15]</span>The plants were <span class="highlight">otherwise</span> surprisingly <span class="highlight">similar</span>, <span class="highlight">genetically</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.28" data-time="244.7">[04:04.70]</span>And more recently, botanists have used modern DNA testing to <span class="highlight">scan</span> plant samples collected from <span class="highlight">throughout</span> the western <span class="highlight">hemisphere</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.57" data-time="252.98">[04:12.98]</span>This has allowed them to <span class="highlight">pinpoint</span> where the <span class="highlight">domestication</span> of <span class="highlight">maize</span> most likely took place.<span class="time" data-times="4.45" data-time="258.55">[04:18.55]</span> And their research took them to a <span class="highlight">particular</span> river <span class="highlight">valley</span> in southern Mexico. <span class="time" data-times="6.98" data-time="263">[04:23.00]</span>They've also been able to <span class="highlight">estimate</span> that the <span class="highlight">domestication</span> of <span class="highlight">maize</span> most likely occurred about 9000 years ago.<span class="time" data-times="4.22" data-time="269.98">[04:29.98]</span> And <span class="highlight">subsequent</span> <span class="highlight">archaeological</span> digs have confirmed this <span class="highlight">estimate</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.02" data-time="274.2">[04:34.20]</span>In one site, archaeologists uncovered a set of tools that were nearly 9000 years old. <span class="time" data-times="6.12" data-time="280.22">[04:40.22]</span>And these tools were covered with a <span class="highlight">dusty</span> <span class="highlight">residue</span>, a <span class="highlight">residue</span> of <span class="highlight">maize</span> as it turns out. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="286.34">[04:46.34]</span>Thus making them the oldest <span class="highlight">physical</span> <span class="highlight">evidence</span> of <span class="highlight">maize</span> that we found so far.   </p>
