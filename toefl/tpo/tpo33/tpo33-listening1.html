            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.2" data-time="7.82">[00:07.82]</span>Student: Hi. I am a little lost. <span class="time" data-times="2.64" data-time="11.02">[00:11.02]</span>Um, is this the housing <span class="underline">maintenance</span> office? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.09" data-time="13.66">[00:13.66]</span>Employee: You found it. <span class="time" data-times="0.97" data-time="14.75">[00:14.75]</span>How can I help you? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.38" data-time="15.72">[00:15.72]</span>Student: Oh, good. I have a quick question. <span class="time" data-times="3.08" data-time="18.1">[00:18.10]</span>Are we allowed to keep electric heaters in our rooms? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.5" data-time="21.18">[00:21.18]</span>Employee: Actually, you are not. <span class="time" data-times="1.07" data-time="22.68">[00:22.68]</span>What's going on? <span class="time" data-times="0.93" data-time="23.75">[00:23.75]</span>Your room cold? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.88" data-time="24.68">[00:24.68]</span>Student: It's freezing in my room. <span class="time" data-times="2.04" data-time="26.56">[00:26.56]</span>I think the heat went out or something. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.36" data-time="28.6">[00:28.60]</span>Employee: Are you sure it's out?<span class="time" data-times="1.99" data-time="29.96">[00:29.96]</span> Maybe it just got turned out too far. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.4" data-time="31.95">[00:31.95]</span>Student: Oh, no. I tried adjusting the, uh, the heat control, but it doesn't make any <span class="underline">difference</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.24" data-time="37.35">[00:37.35]</span>It's so cold in my bedroom I can't sleep at night. <span class="time" data-times="3.1" data-time="40.59">[00:40.59]</span>I've actually been sleeping on the sofa in the front room. <span class="time" data-times="2.06" data-time="43.69">[00:43.69]</span>The heat still works in there. <span class="time" data-times="3.93" data-time="45.75">[00:45.75]</span>Actually, we get hot <span class="underline">air</span> in all the bedrooms except ours. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.04" data-time="49.68">[00:49.68]</span>Employee: Wow! Do you have a roommate? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.09" data-time="51.72">[00:51.72]</span>Student: Yeah. But she said she isn't bothered by the cold.<span class="time" data-times="3.44" data-time="54.81">[00:54.81]</span> But on the sofa, I am kept up by the noise out in the hall. <span class="time" data-times="2.49" data-time="58.25">[00:58.25]</span>The dorms can sometimes get <span class="underline">pretty</span> noisy.<span class="time" data-times="2.04" data-time="60.74">[01:00.74]</span> So what can be done about it? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.31" data-time="62.78">[01:02.78]</span>Employee: Well, OK. There's a <span class="underline">couple</span> of things we can do. <span class="time" data-times="3.71" data-time="66.09">[01:06.09]</span>I can have a custodian take a look at it and see if he can do something. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.54" data-time="69.8">[01:09.80]</span>Student: Actually, I asked the custodian yesterday to take a look. <span class="time" data-times="2.49" data-time="73.34">[01:13.34]</span>But he said he couldn't find anything wrong. <span class="time" data-times="5.88" data-time="75.83">[01:15.83]</span>He said that some of the other rooms have lost heat also and that if we'd come here you guys would <span class="underline">fix</span> it. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.25" data-time="81.71">[01:21.71]</span>Employee: Oh, he did?<span class="time" data-times="6.42" data-time="82.96">[01:22.96]</span> That's <span class="underline">weird</span>, because I would have...well, the custodians themselves are usually supposed to <span class="underline">report</span> any problems right away. <span class="time" data-times="4.9" data-time="89.38">[01:29.38]</span>OK. In that case, then what you need to do is...here, fill out this form. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.25" data-time="94.28">[01:34.28]</span>Student: I have to fill out a form? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.12" data-time="96.53">[01:36.53]</span>Employee: Yeah, but at <span class="underline">least</span> that'll put your heater problem in a work order for the <span class="underline">maintenance</span> <span class="underline">crew</span> and they'll get to you as soon as possible. <span class="time" data-times="7.2" data-time="102.65">[01:42.65]</span>Just so you know, because it's not winter yet and it's not as cold as it could be, it may take a few days for a <span class="underline">maintenance</span> <span class="underline">crew</span> to get to you. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.15" data-time="109.85">[01:49.85]</span>Student: A few days? <span class="time" data-times="2.29" data-time="111">[01:51.00]</span>I can't <span class="underline">even</span> sleep in my own room! <span class="time" data-times="2.04" data-time="113.29">[01:53.29]</span>Can't we just get an electric heater? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.49" data-time="115.33">[01:55.33]</span>Employee: I am sorry. But students just aren't allowed. <span class="time" data-times="4.28" data-time="117.82">[01:57.82]</span>OK. I can see that this is a problem, and not just with your room. <span class="time" data-times="6.3" data-time="122.1">[02:02.10]</span>So if you can get the form back to me this afternoon, I'll try to get a <span class="underline">maintenance</span> <span class="underline">crew</span> to look at your problem by tomorrow. <span class="time" data-times="0.71999999999999" data-time="128.4">[02:08.40]</span>How's that? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.34" data-time="129.12">[02:09.12]</span>Student: Oh, that would be great. Seriously.<span class="time" data-times="1.37" data-time="131.46">[02:11.46]</span> I have to take off now. <span class="time" data-times="2.95" data-time="132.83">[02:12.83]</span>But when I fill this form out, I give it to you, right? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="135.78">[02:15.78]</span>Employee: Right. And if I am not here, just put it in my box and I'll get it. </p>
