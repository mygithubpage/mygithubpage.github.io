            <span class="time" data-times="6.31" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in an art <span class="highlight">history</span> class. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="9.61" data-time="6.31">[00:06.31]</span>Professor: OK. We have been talking about the art and <span class="highlight">architecture</span> of the Italian Renaissance, from around A.D. 1400 to around A.D. 1600. <span class="time" data-times="6.08" data-time="15.92">[00:15.92]</span>Last class, we had a look at some of the <span class="highlight">magnificent</span> palaces and villas built during this time period. <span class="time" data-times="5.86" data-time="22">[00:22.00]</span>And just as class was ending, someone asked about the gardens <span class="highlight">associated</span> with these palaces and villas. <span class="time" data-times="3.54" data-time="27.86">[00:27.86]</span>And so I'd like to say a few things about them before we move on. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.71" data-time="31.4">[00:31.40]</span>Now, when I say gardens, I don't mean vegetable gardens or simple flower gardens. <span class="time" data-times="8.69" data-time="38.11">[00:38.11]</span>These were lavishly constructed, finely detailed gardens that covered hundreds of acres, with <span class="highlight">exotic</span> plants and ornamental statues. <span class="time" data-times="5.87" data-time="46.8">[00:46.80]</span>And they were just as much a <span class="highlight">symbol</span> of their owners' social <span class="highlight">position</span> as their palaces and villas were. <span class="time" data-times="5.31" data-time="52.67">[00:52.67]</span>Again, what was the inspiration for the Renaissance? Rebecca. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.38" data-time="57.98">[00:57.98]</span>Student: <span class="highlight">Classical</span> art and <span class="highlight">architecture</span> of the <span class="highlight">ancient</span> Greeks and Romans. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.09" data-time="62.36">[01:02.36]</span>Professor: That's right. <span class="time" data-times="17.03" data-time="63.45">[01:03.45]</span>As we've said before, the main point of the Renaissance was to <span class="highlight">revive</span> the <span class="highlight">genius</span> of the <span class="highlight">ancient</span> Greeks and Romans, which is why designers of Renaissance gardens designed them as the <span class="highlight">ancient</span> Romans would have designed them, or at <span class="highlight">least</span> as they imagined the <span class="highlight">ancient</span> Romans would have designed them. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.16" data-time="80.48">[01:20.48]</span>Student: How did they know what <span class="highlight">ancient</span> Roman gardens look like? </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.36" data-time="83.64">[01:23.64]</span>Professor: Well, they didn't have any pictures. <span class="time" data-times="9.43" data-time="86">[01:26.00]</span>But they did have some very detailed descriptions of <span class="highlight">ancient</span> Roman villas and their gardens that had been written by famous Roman authors who lived during the height of the Roman <span class="highlight">Empire</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9.24" data-time="95.43">[01:35.43]</span>And at <span class="highlight">least</span> three of those authors, one was a <span class="highlight">scholar</span>, one was a poet, and one was lawyer, were very authoritative, very <span class="highlight">reliable</span> sources. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="9.58" data-time="104.67">[01:44.67]</span>Ah...and interestingly enough, there was another <span class="highlight">source</span> that didn't <span class="highlight">describe</span> <span class="highlight">classical</span> gardens but still became a great influence on Renaissance gardens.<span class="time" data-times="7.49" data-time="114.25">[01:54.25]</span>It was also written back during the height of the Roman <span class="highlight">Empire</span> by a <span class="highlight">mathematician</span> known as Hero of Alexandria.<span class="time" data-times="1.55" data-time="121.74">[02:01.74]</span> Hero was a Greek. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.79" data-time="123.29">[02:03.29]</span>But he lived in Alexandria, Egypt, which was at the time part of the Roman <span class="highlight">Empire</span>. <span class="time" data-times="19.48" data-time="128.08">[02:08.08]</span>Hero compiled descriptions and sketches of seventy some clever little <span class="highlight">mechanical</span> devices, most of which utilized compressed <span class="highlight">air</span> to cause water, or in some cases wine, to flow from one place to another, or sometimes to <span class="highlight">squirt</span> or to make some kind of noise. Yes? John? </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.86" data-time="147.56">[02:27.56]</span>Student: Could you give an example? </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="7.08" data-time="149.42">[02:29.42]</span>Professor: Well, one of the devices was a <span class="highlight">sacrificial</span> <span class="highlight">vessel</span> that was <span class="highlight">obviously</span> designed for a <span class="highlight">temple</span>, not for a garden. <span class="time" data-times="5.13" data-time="156.5">[02:36.50]</span>Anyway, if you <span class="highlight">drop</span> money into this <span class="highlight">vessel</span>, water would flow out of it. <span class="time" data-times="8.03" data-time="161.63">[02:41.63]</span>Well, <span class="highlight">creative</span> minds in the Renaissance realized that this little <span class="highlight">device</span> could be nicely repurposed as a nifty little <span class="highlight">fountain</span>.<span class="time" data-times="3.35" data-time="169.66">[02:49.66]</span>Designers of Renaissance gardens loved this <span class="highlight">sort</span> of thing. <span class="time" data-times="5.58" data-time="173.01">[02:53.01]</span>They loved to <span class="highlight">incorporate</span> novelties and tricks, things to <span class="highlight">amuse</span> and impress guests. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.49" data-time="178.59">[02:58.59]</span>Student: And that was the purpose? <span class="time" data-times="1.06" data-time="180.08">[03:00.08]</span>To impress people? </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="7.53" data-time="181.14">[03:01.14]</span>Professor: Sure. As a nobleman or wealthy <span class="highlight">landowner</span>, one purpose of having a fabulous <span class="highlight">villa</span> with a <span class="highlight">fantastic</span> garden was to impress people. <span class="time" data-times="2.84" data-time="188.67">[03:08.67]</span>It was a way of proving your social <span class="highlight">position</span>. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.99" data-time="191.51">[03:11.51]</span>Student: Well...OK. You also mentioned tricks. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.38" data-time="195.5">[03:15.50]</span>Professor: Well, for example, some gardens had <span class="highlight">plaster</span> or <span class="highlight">marble</span> birds that sang when water flowed <span class="highlight">through</span> them. <span class="time" data-times="3.33" data-time="201.88">[03:21.88]</span>Some fountains were designed to <span class="highlight">squirt</span> people with water. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.02" data-time="205.21">[03:25.21]</span>Student: And these things were <span class="highlight">popular</span>? </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.27" data-time="207.23">[03:27.23]</span>Professor: Yes. They may have been the most <span class="highlight">popular</span> features of the gardens. <span class="time" data-times="5.08" data-time="210.5">[03:30.50]</span>I mean, flowers and statues can be nice to look at, but these things were a lot more fun. <span class="time" data-times="8.17" data-time="215.58">[03:35.58]</span>And the more clever the <span class="highlight">device</span> is, the more famous the garden and the greater <span class="highlight">prestige</span> the <span class="highlight">landowner</span> enjoyed. Yes? Rebecca. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.47" data-time="223.75">[03:43.75]</span>Student: What about mazes? <span class="time" data-times="3.11" data-time="226.22">[03:46.22]</span>I read that they were a <span class="highlight">major</span> part of the Renaissance gardens. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.14" data-time="229.33">[03:49.33]</span>Professor: Oh, yes. They certainly were!<span class="time" data-times="5.28" data-time="231.47">[03:51.47]</span> Mazes or labyrinths, as they're also called, were very <span class="highlight">common</span> in Renaissance gardens. <span class="time" data-times="3.9" data-time="236.75">[03:56.75]</span>How that came to be though is a bit of a mystery. <span class="time" data-times="10.43" data-time="240.65">[04:00.65]</span>Mazes have a long <span class="highlight">history</span> going back to the <span class="highlight">ancient</span> Egyptians, but they started appearing in gardens only during the Renaissance, or perhaps just a little bit <span class="highlight">prior</span> to that. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="8.14" data-time="251.08">[04:11.08]</span>According to one <span class="highlight">source</span>, what happened was: in the late 1400s, a highly respected expert published a book on <span class="highlight">architecture</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.49" data-time="259.22">[04:19.22]</span>And readers somehow mistakenly inferred from that book that <span class="highlight">ancient</span> Romans had mazes in their gardens. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="265.71">[04:25.71]</span>So then designers of Renaissance gardens thinking they were following in the footsteps of the <span class="highlight">ancient</span> Romans...well...guess what they did. </p>
