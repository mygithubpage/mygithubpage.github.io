We have been talking about the art and <span class="highlight">architecture</span> of the Italian Renaissance, from around A.D. 1400 to around A.D. 1600. <span class="time" data-times="6.08" data-time="15.92">[00:15.92]</span>Last class, we had a look at some of the <span class="highlight">magnificent</span> palaces and villas built during this time period. <span class="time" data-times="5.86" data-time="22">[00:22.00]</span>And just as class was ending, someone asked about the gardens <span class="highlight">associated</span> with these palaces and villas. <span class="time" data-times="3.54" data-time="27.86">[00:27.86]</span>And so I'd like to say a few things about them before we move on. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.71" data-time="31.4">[00:31.40]</span>Now, when I say gardens, I don't mean vegetable gardens or simple flower gardens. <span class="time" data-times="8.69" data-time="38.11">[00:38.11]</span>These were lavishly constructed, finely detailed gardens that covered hundreds of acres, with <span class="highlight">exotic</span> plants and ornamental statues. <span class="time" data-times="5.87" data-time="46.8">[00:46.80]</span>And they were just as much a <span class="highlight">symbol</span> of their owners' social <span class="highlight">position</span> as their palaces and villas were. <span class="time" data-times="5.31" data-time="52.67">[00:52.67]</span>Again, what was the inspiration for the Renaissance?

As a nobleman or wealthy <span class="highlight">landowner</span>, one purpose of having a fabulous <span class="highlight">villa</span> with a <span class="highlight">fantastic</span> garden was to impress people. <span class="time" data-times="2.84" data-time="188.67">[03:08.67]</span>It was a way of proving your social <span class="highlight">position</span>. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.99" data-time="191.51">[03:11.51]</span>Student: Well...OK. You also mentioned tricks. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.38" data-time="195.5">[03:15.50]</span>Professor: Well, for example, some gardens had <span class="highlight">plaster</span> or <span class="highlight">marble</span> birds that sang when water flowed <span class="highlight">through</span> them. <span class="time" data-times="3.33" data-time="201.88">[03:21.88]</span>Some fountains were designed to <span class="highlight">squirt</span> people with water. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.02" data-time="205.21">[03:25.21]</span>Student: And these things were <span class="highlight">popular</span>? </p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.27" data-time="207.23">[03:27.23]</span>Professor: Yes.

The most popular features of ancient Roman gardens.</p><p>B. The goals of Renaissance garden designers.</p><p>C. The influence of Renaissance gardens on modern Italian gardens.</p><p>D. Differences between ancient Greek gardens and ancient Roman gardens.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>Just as the class was ending, someone asked about the gardens associated with these palaces and villas. And so I'd like to say a few things about them before we move on. Someone asked the question about GARDEN at the end, so to sum up, we should talk about it.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The professor mentions three authors from ancient Rome. What point does the professor make about the three authors?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They provided credible descriptions of ancient Roman gardens.</p><p>B. They probably exaggerated the beauty of ancient Roman gardens.</p><p>C. They probably never owned gardens themselves.</p><p>D. They invented gardening practices that are still used in Italy today.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>Female Student: How did they know what ancient Roman gardens looked like?</p><p>Well, they didn't have any pictures but they did have some very detailed descriptions of ancient Roman villas and their gardens that had been written by famous Roman authors who lived during the height of the Roman Empire. And at least three of those authors, Students were asked how they knew what the garden was like. The professor replied because there are detailed records, especially three very reliable records.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor mention Hero of Alexandria?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To explain the relationship between ancient Greek gardens and ancient Roman gardens.</p><p>B. To explain how ancient Roman gardens came to be influenced by Egyptian culture.</p><p>C. To point out that garden designers were highly respected members of Roman society.</p><p>D. To indicate the origin of some of the features of Renaissance gardens.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>Uh, and interestingly enough, there was another source that didn't describe classical gardens but still became a great influence on Renaissance gardens. It was also written back during the height of the Roman Empire, by a mathematician known as Hero of Alexandria. With the iconic word "interestingly enough," one important point is that another resource that has a great influence on the garden is written by Hero of Alexandria.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor, what was one goal of the designers of Renaissance gardens?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To incorporate plants from as many parts of the world as possible.</p><p>B. To develop beautiful new breeds of plants.</p><p>C. To provide amusement for guests.</p><p>D. To create a peaceful setting for prayer and meditation.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Could you give an example?</p><p>Well, one of the devices was a sacrificial vessel that was available designed for a temple not for a garden. Anyway, if you dropped money into this vessel, water would flow out of it, well, creative minds in the Renaissance realized that this little Device could be nicely re-purposed as a nifty, little fountain. Designers of Renaissance gardens loved this sort of thing. They loved to adopt novelties and tricks, things to amuse and impress guests.</p><p>This question is a typical question that leads to questions and answers in a dialogue. The student asked the teacher to give an example. The teacher gave an example and concluded that the designer liked the idea to please the customer.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor imply about mazes?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They were not part of ancient Roman gardens.</p><p>B. They were not common in Renaissance gardens.</p><p>C. They often incorporated hidden water tricks.</p><p>D. They were the most creative aspect of Renaissance gardens.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>(female student) What about mazes? I read that they were a major part of the Renaissance gardens?</p><p>Oh, yes, they certainly were. Mazes, or labyrinths as they also called, were very common in Renaissance gardens.</p><p>  And readers somehow mistakenly inferred from that book that ancient Romans had mazes in their gardens.</p><p>Teacher-student interaction raises the focus of maze. The professor first said that maze is part of the Renaissance garden. But later, the reader mistakenly deduced that it was part of the Roman garden. The implication was that it was not part of the Roman garden.</p></div></div><div class="replay" id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor imply when he says this:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Designers of Renaissance gardens were in some ways more creative than the designers of ancient Roman gardens.</p><p>B. Designers of Renaissance gardens sometimes had inaccurate conceptions of ancient Roman gardens.</p><p>C. Designers of Renaissance gardens sometimes deliberately violated the design principles used in ancient Roman gardens.</p><p>D. Designers of Renaissance gardens were able to take advantage of technology that was not available to the designers of ancient Roman gardens.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Or, at least, as they imagined the ancient Romans would have designed them. This sentence means that at least they imagine ..., the meaning outside of the word, and there is a gap with the facts, so it is inaccurate conceptions.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
