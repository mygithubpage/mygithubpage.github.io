Now that fast food is everywhere, I can' t help myself from going into those restaurants that serve fried chicken, burgers and pizza. When I don' t know what to eat for lunch, I would reach for McDonald' s next to my school. I have to admit that they' re really tasty, and I can never go wrong with a beef burger combo. However, in the past, there weren' t this many choices. Most people who earn a regular salary would cook at home, and it' s usually healthier-at least the food wouldn' t be so greasy, and there would be more vegetables rather than meat. So I think it is becoming more difficult to eat healthy food right now.</p></article></div></main></body></html>
