of a lecture in an <span class="highlight">archaeology</span> class. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.75" data-time="7.81">[00:07.81]</span>Professor: The Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt might be the most famous building in the world. <span class="time" data-times="2.09" data-time="13.56">[00:13.56]</span>We know exactly when it was built. <span class="time" data-times="7.14" data-time="15.65">[00:15.65]</span><span class="highlight">Construction</span> started in 2547 B.C.E., about 4500 years ago. <span class="time" data-times="1.79" data-time="22.79">[00:22.79]</span>We know who had it built. <span class="time" data-times="1.9" data-time="24.58">[00:24.58]</span>That was the pharaoh Khufu. <span class="time" data-times="3.93" data-time="26.48">[00:26.48]</span>We know who oversaw its <span class="highlight">construction</span>-the pharaoh's brother. <span class="time" data-times="5.73" data-time="30.41">[00:30.41]</span>We know so many things about it, but the funny thing is: we still don't know exactly how it was built. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.93" data-time="36.14">[00:36.14]</span>This picture will give you an idea of the size of the Pyramid and the size of the blocks it's made out of. <span class="time" data-times="7.29" data-time="42.07">[00:42.07]</span>About two million stone blocks were used to build the Great Pyramid and they are incredibly <span class="highlight">massive</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.13" data-time="49.36">[00:49.36]</span>The <span class="highlight">average</span> weight is two and a half tons. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="12.19" data-time="52.49">[00:52.49]</span>The problem that has puzzled scholars for centuries is how were these blocks lifted up the height of this <span class="highlight">massive</span> structure and then fit into place and without the <span class="highlight">benefit</span> of modern technology. <span class="time" data-times="4.13" data-time="64.68">[01:04.68]</span>Of <span class="highlight">course</span>, there've been a lot of theories over the centuries. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.94" data-time="68.81">[01:08.81]</span>The oldest recorded one is by the Greek historian Herodotus.<span class="time" data-times="7.03" data-time="72.75">[01:12.75]</span> He visited Egypt around 450 B.C.E., when the Pyramid was already 2000 years old. <span class="time" data-times="6.37" data-time="79.78">[01:19.78]</span>His <span class="highlight">theory</span> was that cranes were used, much like we use cranes today to <span class="highlight">construct</span> tall buildings. <span class="time" data-times="3.97" data-time="86.15">[01:26.15]</span>And Herodotus may have seen Egyptians using cranes made of wood. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.66" data-time="90.12">[01:30.12]</span>But the problem with this <span class="highlight">theory</span> has to do with simple <span class="highlight">mechanics</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.86" data-time="93.78">[01:33.78]</span>A <span class="highlight">crane</span> needs a wide and <span class="highlight">sturdy</span><span class="highlight">base</span> to stand on or it will fall over. <span class="time" data-times="5.33" data-time="98.64">[01:38.64]</span>Well, as you get toward the top of the Pyramid, there's really no place for a <span class="highlight">crane</span> to stand. <span class="time" data-times="3.44" data-time="103.97">[01:43.97]</span>The stone blocks are too narrow to provide a <span class="highlight">base</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.29" data-time="107.41">[01:47.41]</span>Well, so much for that <span class="highlight">theory</span>. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.96" data-time="109.7">[01:49.70]</span>The next one has to do with the use of a ramp that would allow workers to <span class="highlight">drag</span> a stone <span class="highlight">block</span> up the side of the structure. <span class="time" data-times="2.72" data-time="116.66">[01:56.66]</span>Of <span class="highlight">course</span> the ramp can't be too <span class="highlight">steep</span>.<span class="time" data-times="2.42" data-time="119.38">[01:59.38]</span> It has to have a long <span class="highlight">gentle</span><span class="highlight">slope</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.11" data-time="121.8">[02:01.80]</span>And that's the problem. <span class="time" data-times="9.42" data-time="123.91">[02:03.91]</span>If you build a ramp with a <span class="highlight">slight</span><span class="highlight">slope</span> up to the top of a Pyramid that's over 130 meters high, it would have to be almost two kilometers long. <span class="time" data-times="4.37" data-time="133.33">[02:13.33]</span>Well, the Pyramid is built on a <span class="highlight">flat</span> area called the Giza <span class="highlight">Plateau</span>.<span class="time" data-times="4.72" data-time="137.7">[02:17.70]</span> The <span class="highlight">Plateau</span> is <span class="highlight">simply</span> not big enough to <span class="highlight">accommodate</span> a two-kilometer-long ramp. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.24" data-time="142.42">[02:22.42]</span>OK. So what now? <span class="time" data-times="10.53" data-time="144.66">[02:24.66]</span>Well, if you've ever driven on a mountain road, you'd know that it has a lot of twists and turns and bends in it, because that's how engineers keep the road from having to be too <span class="highlight">steep</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.29" data-time="155.19">[02:35.19]</span>So why not <span class="highlight">wrap</span> the ramp around the Pyramid? <span class="time" data-times="2.28" data-time="158.48">[02:38.48]</span>Building the ramp around it as you go? <span class="time" data-times="2.05" data-time="160.76">[02:40.76]</span>Sounds like a <span class="highlight">pretty</span> good idea.<span class="time" data-times="2.58" data-time="162.81">[02:42.81]</span> Except it's got a serious problem.<span class="time" data-times="6.07" data-time="165.39">[02:45.39]</span> See...one of the most <span class="highlight">remarkable</span> things about the Great Pyramid is how <span class="highlight">accurate</span> the proportions are. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.29" data-time="171.46">[02:51.46]</span>The dimensions are almost <span class="highlight">perfect</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.94" data-time="173.75">[02:53.75]</span>To get that perfection, the engineers must have had to <span class="highlight">measure</span> it repeatedly during <span class="highlight">construction</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.79" data-time="179.69">[02:59.69]</span>And the way you'd <span class="highlight">measure</span> it is from the four corners of the <span class="highlight">base</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.51" data-time="183.48">[03:03.48]</span>Well, if you got a ramp spiraling up from the <span class="highlight">base</span> of the Pyramid, those corners would be buried by that ramp during <span class="highlight">construction</span>. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.98" data-time="190.99">[03:10.99]</span>Well, who says the ramp has to be on the outside of the Pyramid? <span class="time" data-times="2.77" data-time="194.97">[03:14.97]</span>And now we get to the latest idea. <span class="time" data-times="9.16" data-time="197.74">[03:17.74]</span>If the ramp were on the inside of the Pyramid, the corners at the <span class="highlight">base</span> would be <span class="highlight">exposed</span>, so the engineers could do their measurements while they were building. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.47" data-time="206.9">[03:26.90]</span>Well, an <span class="highlight">architect</span> named Houdin has spent a few years working on making computer models of the building of the Pyramid. <span class="time" data-times="10.55" data-time="214.37">[03:34.37]</span>And what Houdin believes is that an <span class="highlight">exterior</span> straight ramp was used to <span class="highlight">construct</span> the bottom third of the Pyramid, this ramp would have been <span class="highlight">fairly</span> short. <span class="time" data-times="2.74" data-time="224.92">[03:44.92]</span>It probably rose less than 50 meters. <span class="time" data-times="6.96" data-time="227.66">[03:47.66]</span>Then the rest of the Pyramid was constructed using an <span class="highlight">internal</span> ramp that spiraled around the inside of the Pyramid. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.19" data-time="234.62">[03:54.62]</span>But how can we test this idea? <span class="time" data-times="3.78" data-time="236.81">[03:56.81]</span>Well, there are several ways to look inside the Pyramid.<span class="time" data-times="2.64" data-time="240.59">[04:00.59]</span> One is called microgravimetry. <span class="time" data-times="6.07" data-time="243.23">[04:03.23]</span>Microgravimetry is a <span class="highlight">technique</span> that's used to <span class="highlight">detect</span> voids inside a structure. <span class="time" data-times="6.52" data-time="249.3">[04:09.30]</span>You can then take the <span class="highlight">data</span> and <span class="highlight">generate</span> an <span class="highlight">image</span> that shows any empty spaces in the <span class="highlight">interior</span>. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.77" data-time="255.82">[04:15.82]</span>Well, in 1986, French scientists completed a microgravimetric <span class="highlight">survey</span> of the Pyramid. <span class="time" data-times="4.98" data-time="262.59">[04:22.59]</span>And one of the images they produced showed an empty spiral-shaped <span class="highlight">space</span> inside it. <span class="time" data-times="5.57" data-time="267.57">[04:27.57]</span>The <span class="highlight">shape</span> of that <span class="highlight">space</span> corresponds exactly to what Houdin thought the ramp would look like. <span class="time" data-times="3.05" data-time="273.14">[04:33.14]</span>I think Herodotus would be convinced. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="276.19">[04:36.19]</span>We might very well be at the end of centuries of guessing.  </p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the lecture mainly about?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Building techniques that were common in the ancient world.</p><p>B. Evidence of several early attempts to build a pyramid.</p><p>C. Possible answers to an ancient mystery.</p><p>D. The history of the pyramids of Egypt.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>First of all, the professor proposed the theme of the pyramid, and then said that we know a lot, but we do not know how it was built. Of course, there are many theories. Then the whole article is talking about various theories.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor, what is the main argument against the theory that the stone blocks of the Great Pyramid were lifted into place with cranes?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Wood Cranes would have been too weak to lift the blocks.</p><p>B. There is no evidence of ancient Egyptians ever using cranes.</p><p>C. The use of cranes would have resulted in imprecise dimensions.</p><p>D. There would not have been enough room for a platform for the cranes.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The oldest recorded one is by the Greek historian Herodotus. He visited Egypt around 450 BCE when the pyramid was already two thousand years old. His theory was that cranes were used much like we use cranes today to construct tall buildings, seen Egyptians using cranes made The first proposed theory of of wood was proposed by HERODOTUS, who believed that the ancient Egyptians were pyramids built with wood cranes.</p><p>But the problem with this theory has to do with simple mechanics: a crane needs a wide and sturdy base to stand on or it will fall over. Well, as you get to the top of the pyramid, there's really no place for a crane to Prof. The stone blocks are too narrow to provide a base. Professor immediately put forward a turning point after a brief description of the theory. The problem with this theory is that there is no place for the crane at the top of the pyramid.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor mention a mountain road?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To illustrate an alternative to a steep ramp.</p><p>B. To emphasize the effort needed to more large stone blocks.</p><p>C. To imply that progress on the Great Pyramid was slow.</p><p>D. To describe the shape of the road leading to the Giza Plateau.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The next one has to do with the use of a ramp that would allow workers to drag a stone block up the side of the structure. Another theory is the theory about using slopes.</p><p>OK, so what now? Professor used "well" to elicit the well, the pyramid is built on a flat area called the Giza plateau. The plateau is simply not big enough to accommodate a two-kilometer long ramp.</p><p>The problem with this theory is that the plateau is not as large as to carry a long 2 km slope. Then use the question to draw the answer.</p><p>Professor, if you'd ever driven on a mountain road, you know that it has a lot of twists and turns and bends in it because that's how engineers keep the roads from having to be too steep. The topic is that there are a lot of turns on the mountain road that engineers have to solve the problem of steep hills. In other words, use hillside examples to illustrate how to deal with the steep slope problem.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor talk about the accuracy of the proportions of the Great Pyramid?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To provide background on the principles of microgravimetry.</p><p>B. To discount the possibility that a ramp once spiralled around outside of the pyramid.</p><p>C. To explain the effectiveness of computer models of the pyramid.</p><p>D. To emphasize the difficulty of building a ramp with the correct slope.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>So why not wrap the ramp around the pyramid, building a ramp all it as you go. Sounds like a pretty good idea except it's got a serious problem. After talking about the problem of the mountain road, the professor went back to the topic and said that he used the slope to surround the pyramid. Is it OK? The words that follow are focused, "sounds like" - it sounds like, the subtext is "actually not." Therefore, the professor said later, See, one of the most remarkable things about the great pyramid is how accurate the proportions are. In fact, Professor said that this sentence has already been expressed as an important reason for "not the case", ie, accurate proportion. Finally, the professor Also said, "Well, if you've got a ramp spiraling up from the base of the pyramid, those corners would be buried by that ramp during construction." Therefore, this does not work.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="table"><div class="question"><p>The professor discusses different methods the Egyptians may have used to build the Great Pyramid.
