              <span class="time" data-times="7.81" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in an <span class="underline">archaeology</span> class. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.75" data-time="7.81">[00:07.81]</span>Professor: The Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt might be the most famous building in the world. <span class="time" data-times="2.09" data-time="13.56">[00:13.56]</span>We know exactly when it was built. <span class="time" data-times="7.14" data-time="15.65">[00:15.65]</span> <span class="underline">Construction</span> started in 2547 B.C.E., about 4500 years ago. <span class="time" data-times="1.79" data-time="22.79">[00:22.79]</span>We know who had it built. <span class="time" data-times="1.9" data-time="24.58">[00:24.58]</span>That was the pharaoh Khufu. <span class="time" data-times="3.93" data-time="26.48">[00:26.48]</span>We know who oversaw its <span class="underline">construction</span>-the pharaoh's brother. <span class="time" data-times="5.73" data-time="30.41">[00:30.41]</span>We know so many things about it, but the funny thing is: we still don't know exactly how it was built. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.93" data-time="36.14">[00:36.14]</span>This picture will give you an idea of the size of the Pyramid and the size of the blocks it's made out of. <span class="time" data-times="7.29" data-time="42.07">[00:42.07]</span>About two million stone blocks were used to build the Great Pyramid and they are incredibly <span class="underline">massive</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.13" data-time="49.36">[00:49.36]</span>The <span class="underline">average</span> weight is two and a half tons. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="12.19" data-time="52.49">[00:52.49]</span>The problem that has puzzled scholars for centuries is how were these blocks lifted up the height of this <span class="underline">massive</span> structure and then fit into place and without the <span class="underline">benefit</span> of modern technology. <span class="time" data-times="4.13" data-time="64.68">[01:04.68]</span>Of <span class="underline">course</span>, there've been a lot of theories over the centuries. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.94" data-time="68.81">[01:08.81]</span>The oldest recorded one is by the Greek historian Herodotus.<span class="time" data-times="7.03" data-time="72.75">[01:12.75]</span> He visited Egypt around 450 B.C.E., when the Pyramid was already 2000 years old. <span class="time" data-times="6.37" data-time="79.78">[01:19.78]</span>His <span class="underline">theory</span> was that cranes were used, much like we use cranes today to <span class="underline">construct</span> tall buildings. <span class="time" data-times="3.97" data-time="86.15">[01:26.15]</span>And Herodotus may have seen Egyptians using cranes made of wood. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.66" data-time="90.12">[01:30.12]</span>But the problem with this <span class="underline">theory</span> has to do with simple <span class="underline">mechanics</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.86" data-time="93.78">[01:33.78]</span>A <span class="underline">crane</span> needs a wide and <span class="underline">sturdy</span> <span class="underline">base</span> to stand on or it will fall over. <span class="time" data-times="5.33" data-time="98.64">[01:38.64]</span>Well, as you get toward the top of the Pyramid, there's really no place for a <span class="underline">crane</span> to stand. <span class="time" data-times="3.44" data-time="103.97">[01:43.97]</span>The stone blocks are too narrow to provide a <span class="underline">base</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.29" data-time="107.41">[01:47.41]</span>Well, so much for that <span class="underline">theory</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.96" data-time="109.7">[01:49.70]</span>The next one has to do with the use of a ramp that would allow workers to <span class="underline">drag</span> a stone <span class="underline">block</span> up the side of the structure. <span class="time" data-times="2.72" data-time="116.66">[01:56.66]</span>Of <span class="underline">course</span> the ramp can't be too <span class="underline">steep</span>.<span class="time" data-times="2.42" data-time="119.38">[01:59.38]</span> It has to have a long <span class="underline">gentle</span> <span class="underline">slope</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.11" data-time="121.8">[02:01.80]</span>And that's the problem. <span class="time" data-times="9.42" data-time="123.91">[02:03.91]</span>If you build a ramp with a <span class="underline">slight</span> <span class="underline">slope</span> up to the top of a Pyramid that's over 130 meters high, it would have to be almost two kilometers long. <span class="time" data-times="4.37" data-time="133.33">[02:13.33]</span>Well, the Pyramid is built on a <span class="underline">flat</span> area called the Giza <span class="underline">Plateau</span>.<span class="time" data-times="4.72" data-time="137.7">[02:17.70]</span> The <span class="underline">Plateau</span> is <span class="underline">simply</span> not big enough to <span class="underline">accommodate</span> a two-kilometer-long ramp. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.24" data-time="142.42">[02:22.42]</span>OK. So what now? <span class="time" data-times="10.53" data-time="144.66">[02:24.66]</span>Well, if you've ever driven on a mountain road, you'd know that it has a lot of twists and turns and bends in it, because that's how engineers keep the road from having to be too <span class="underline">steep</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.29" data-time="155.19">[02:35.19]</span>So why not <span class="underline">wrap</span> the ramp around the Pyramid? <span class="time" data-times="2.28" data-time="158.48">[02:38.48]</span>Building the ramp around it as you go? <span class="time" data-times="2.05" data-time="160.76">[02:40.76]</span>Sounds like a <span class="underline">pretty</span> good idea.<span class="time" data-times="2.58" data-time="162.81">[02:42.81]</span> Except it's got a serious problem.<span class="time" data-times="6.07" data-time="165.39">[02:45.39]</span> See...one of the most <span class="underline">remarkable</span> things about the Great Pyramid is how <span class="underline">accurate</span> the proportions are. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.29" data-time="171.46">[02:51.46]</span>The dimensions are almost <span class="underline">perfect</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.94" data-time="173.75">[02:53.75]</span>To get that perfection, the engineers must have had to <span class="underline">measure</span> it repeatedly during <span class="underline">construction</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.79" data-time="179.69">[02:59.69]</span>And the way you'd <span class="underline">measure</span> it is from the four corners of the <span class="underline">base</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.51" data-time="183.48">[03:03.48]</span>Well, if you got a ramp spiraling up from the <span class="underline">base</span> of the Pyramid, those corners would be buried by that ramp during <span class="underline">construction</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.98" data-time="190.99">[03:10.99]</span>Well, who says the ramp has to be on the outside of the Pyramid? <span class="time" data-times="2.77" data-time="194.97">[03:14.97]</span>And now we get to the latest idea. <span class="time" data-times="9.16" data-time="197.74">[03:17.74]</span>If the ramp were on the inside of the Pyramid, the corners at the <span class="underline">base</span> would be <span class="underline">exposed</span>, so the engineers could do their measurements while they were building. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.47" data-time="206.9">[03:26.90]</span>Well, an <span class="underline">architect</span> named Houdin has spent a few years working on making computer models of the building of the Pyramid. <span class="time" data-times="10.55" data-time="214.37">[03:34.37]</span>And what Houdin believes is that an <span class="underline">exterior</span> straight ramp was used to <span class="underline">construct</span> the bottom third of the Pyramid, this ramp would have been <span class="underline">fairly</span> short. <span class="time" data-times="2.74" data-time="224.92">[03:44.92]</span>It probably rose less than 50 meters. <span class="time" data-times="6.96" data-time="227.66">[03:47.66]</span>Then the rest of the Pyramid was constructed using an <span class="underline">internal</span> ramp that spiraled around the inside of the Pyramid. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.19" data-time="234.62">[03:54.62]</span>But how can we test this idea? <span class="time" data-times="3.78" data-time="236.81">[03:56.81]</span>Well, there are several ways to look inside the Pyramid.<span class="time" data-times="2.64" data-time="240.59">[04:00.59]</span> One is called microgravimetry. <span class="time" data-times="6.07" data-time="243.23">[04:03.23]</span>Microgravimetry is a <span class="underline">technique</span> that's used to <span class="underline">detect</span> voids inside a structure. <span class="time" data-times="6.52" data-time="249.3">[04:09.30]</span>You can then take the <span class="underline">data</span> and <span class="underline">generate</span> an <span class="underline">image</span> that shows any empty spaces in the <span class="underline">interior</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.77" data-time="255.82">[04:15.82]</span>Well, in 1986, French scientists completed a microgravimetric <span class="underline">survey</span> of the Pyramid. <span class="time" data-times="4.98" data-time="262.59">[04:22.59]</span>And one of the images they produced showed an empty spiral-shaped <span class="underline">space</span> inside it. <span class="time" data-times="5.57" data-time="267.57">[04:27.57]</span>The <span class="underline">shape</span> of that <span class="underline">space</span> corresponds exactly to what Houdin thought the ramp would look like. <span class="time" data-times="3.05" data-time="273.14">[04:33.14]</span>I think Herodotus would be convinced. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="276.19">[04:36.19]</span>We might very well be at the end of centuries of guessing.  </p>
