            <b>Extinction Episodes of The Past</b>
          </h4>
          <p>It was not until the <span class="highlight">Cambrian</span> period, beginning about 600 million years ago, that a great <span class="highlight question1">proliferation</span> of macroscopic <span class="highlight">species</span> occurred on Earth and produced a <span class="highlight">fossil</span> <span class="highlight">record</span> that allows us to <span class="highlight">track</span> the rise and fall of <span class="highlight">biodiversity</span>. Since the <span class="highlight">Cambrian</span> period, <span class="highlight">biodiversity</span> has generally risen, but there have been some <span class="highlight">notable</span> exceptions. <span class="highlight">Biodiversity</span> collapsed <span class="highlight">dramatically</span> during at <span class="highlight">least</span> five periods because of <span class="highlight">mass</span> extinctions around the globe. The five <span class="highlight">major</span> <span class="highlight">mass</span> extinctions receive most of the <span class="highlight">attention</span>, but they are only one end of a <span class="highlight">spectrum</span> of <span class="highlight">extinction</span> events. <span class="highlight">Collectively</span>, more <span class="highlight">species</span> went <span class="highlight">extinct</span> during smaller events that were less <span class="highlight">dramatic</span> but more frequent. The best known of the five <span class="highlight">major</span> <span class="highlight">extinction</span> events, the one that saw the <span class="highlight">demise</span> of the dinosaurs, is the Cretaceous-Tertiary <span class="highlight">extinction</span>.</p>
          <p>Starting about 280 million years ago, reptiles were the <span class="highlight">dominant</span> large animals in <span class="highlight">terrestrial</span> environments. In <span class="highlight">popular</span> language this was the <span class="highlight">era</span> "when dinosaurs <span class="question4">ruled Earth</span>," when a wide <span class="highlight">variety</span> of <span class="highlight">reptile</span> <span class="highlight">species</span> occupying many <span class="highlight">ecological</span> niches. <span class="question3">However, no group or <span class="highlight">species</span> can <span class="highlight">maintain</span> its dominance <span class="highlight">indefinitely</span>, and when, after over 200 million years, the age of dinosaurs came to a <span class="highlight">dramatic</span> end about 65 million years ago, mammals began to <span class="highlight">flourish</span>, evolving from <span class="highlight">relatively</span> few types of small <span class="highlight">terrestrial</span> animals into the <span class="highlight">myriad</span> of <span class="highlight">diverse</span> <span class="highlight">species</span>, including bats and whales, that we know today.</span> Paleontologists <span class="highlight">label</span> this point in Earth's <span class="highlight">history</span> as the end of the Cretaceous period and the beginning of the <span class="highlight">Tertiary</span> period, often abbreviated as the K-T <span class="highlight">boundary</span>. This time was also <span class="highlight">marked</span> by changes in many other types of organisms. <span class="highlight">Overall</span>, about 38 percent of the families of <span class="highlight">marine</span> animals were lost, with percentages much higher in some groups Ammonoid mollusks went from being very <span class="highlight">diverse</span> and <span class="highlight">abundant</span> to being <span class="highlight">extinct</span>. An extremely <span class="highlight">abundant</span> set of <span class="highlight">planktonic</span> <span class="highlight">marine</span> animals called foraminifera largely disappeared, although they rebounded later. Among plants, the K-T <span class="highlight">boundary</span> saw a sharp but <span class="highlight">brief</span> rise in the <span class="highlight">abundance</span> of <span class="highlight">primitive</span> <span class="highlight">vascular</span> plants such as ferns, <span class="highlight">club</span> mosses, horsetails, and conifers and other gymnosperms. The number of flowering plants (angiosperms) was reduced at this time, but they then began to increase <span class="highlight">dramatically</span>.</p>
          <p>What caused these changes? For many years scientists assumed that a cooling of the <span class="highlight">climate</span> was <span class="highlight">responsible</span>, with dinosaurs being particularly <span class="highlight">vulnerable</span> because, like modern reptiles, they were <span class="highlight">ectothermic</span> (dependent on <span class="highlight">environmental</span> heat, or cold-blooded). It is now widely believed that at <span class="highlight">least</span> some <span class="highlight">species</span> of dinosaurs had a <span class="highlight">metabolic</span> <span class="highlight">rate</span> high enough for them to be endotherms (animals that <span class="highlight">maintain</span> a <span class="highlight">relatively</span> <span class="highlight">consistent</span> body <span class="highlight">temperature</span> by generating heat internally). <span class="highlight">Nevertheless</span>, <span class="highlight">climatic</span> explanations for the K-T <span class="highlight">extinction</span> are not really challenged by the ideas that dinosaurs may have been <span class="highlight">endothermic</span>, because <span class="question6"><span class="highlight">even</span> endotherms can be affected by a <span class="highlight">significant</span> change in the <span class="highlight">climate</span>.</span></p>
          <p>Explanations for the K-T <span class="highlight">extinction</span> were revolutionized in 1980 when a group of <span class="highlight">physical</span> scientists led by Luis Alvarez proposed that 65 million years ago Earth was <span class="highlight">stuck</span> by a
 10-kilometer-wide <span class="highlight">meteorite</span> traveling at 90,000 kilometers per hour. They believed that this <span class="highlight">impact</span> <span class="question7">generated</span> a thick cloud of dust that enveloped Earth, shutting out much of the <span class="highlight">incoming</span> <span class="highlight">solar</span> <span class="highlight">radiation</span> and reducing plant <span class="highlight">photosynthesis</span> to very low levels. Short-term effects might have included huge <span class="highlight">tidal</span> waves and <span class="highlight question8">extensive</span> fires. In other words, a <span class="highlight">series</span> of events arising from a single cataclysmic event caused the <span class="highlight">massive</span> extinctions. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>Initially, the <span class="highlight">meteorite</span> <span class="highlight">theory</span> was based on a single <span class="highlight">line</span> of <span class="highlight">evidence</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>At locations around the globe, geologists had found an unusually high <span class="highlight">concentration</span> of <span class="highlight">iridium</span> in the <span class="highlight">layer</span> of <span class="highlight">sedimentary</span> rocks that was formed about 65 million years ago. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span> <span class="highlight">Iridium</span> is an <span class="highlight">element</span> that is usually uncommon near Earth's surface, but it is <span class="highlight">abundant</span> in some meteorites. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span> <span class="highlight">Therefore</span>, Alvarez and his colleagues concluded that it was likely that the <span class="highlight">iridium</span> in <span class="highlight">sedimentary</span> rocks deposited at the K-T <span class="highlight">boundary</span> had originated in a <span class="highlight">giant</span> <span class="highlight">meteorite</span> or <span class="highlight">asteroid</span>. Most scientist came to accept the <span class="highlight">meteorite</span> <span class="highlight">theory</span> after <span class="highlight">evidence</span> came to light that a <span class="highlight">circular</span> <span class="highlight">formation</span>, 180 kilometers in <span class="highlight">diameter</span> in <span class="highlight">diameter</span> and centered on the north <span class="highlight">coast</span> of the Yucatan Peninsula, was created by a <span class="highlight">meteorite</span> <span class="highlight">impact</span> about 65 million years ago.</p>
