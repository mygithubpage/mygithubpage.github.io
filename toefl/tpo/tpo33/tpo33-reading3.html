Since the <span class="highlight">Cambrian</span> period, <span class="highlight">biodiversity</span> has generally risen, but there have been some <span class="highlight">notable</span> exceptions. <span class="highlight">Biodiversity</span> collapsed <span class="highlight">dramatically</span> during at <span class="highlight">least</span> five periods because of <span class="highlight">mass</span> extinctions around the globe. The five <span class="highlight">major</span><span class="highlight">mass</span> extinctions receive most of the <span class="highlight">attention</span>, but they are only one end of a <span class="highlight">spectrum</span> of <span class="highlight">extinction</span> events. <span class="highlight">Collectively</span>, more <span class="highlight">species</span> went <span class="highlight">extinct</span> during smaller events that were less <span class="highlight">dramatic</span> but more frequent. The best known of the five <span class="highlight">major</span><span class="highlight">extinction</span> events, the one that saw the <span class="highlight">demise</span> of the dinosaurs, is the Cretaceous-Tertiary <span class="highlight">extinction</span>.</p><p>Starting about 280 million years ago, reptiles were the <span class="highlight">dominant</span> large animals in <span class="highlight">terrestrial</span> environments. In <span class="highlight">popular</span> language this was the <span class="highlight">era</span> "when dinosaurs <span class="question4">ruled Earth</span>," when a wide <span class="highlight">variety</span> of <span class="highlight">reptile</span><span class="highlight">species</span> occupying many <span class="highlight">ecological</span> niches. <span class="question3">However, no group or <span class="highlight">species</span> can <span class="highlight">maintain</span> its dominance <span class="highlight">indefinitely</span>, and when, after over 200 million years, the age of dinosaurs came to a <span class="highlight">dramatic</span> end about 65 million years ago, mammals began to <span class="highlight">flourish</span>, evolving from <span class="highlight">relatively</span> few types of small <span class="highlight">terrestrial</span> animals into the <span class="highlight">myriad</span> of <span class="highlight">diverse</span><span class="highlight">species</span>, including bats and whales, that we know today.</span> Paleontologists <span class="highlight">label</span> this point in Earth's <span class="highlight">history</span> as the end of the Cretaceous period and the beginning of the <span class="highlight">Tertiary</span> period, often abbreviated as the K-T <span class="highlight">boundary</span>. This time was also <span class="highlight">marked</span> by changes in many other types of organisms. <span class="highlight">Overall</span>, about 38 percent of the families of <span class="highlight">marine</span> animals were lost, with percentages much higher in some groups Ammonoid mollusks went from being very <span class="highlight">diverse</span> and <span class="highlight">abundant</span> to being <span class="highlight">extinct</span>. An extremely <span class="highlight">abundant</span> set of <span class="highlight">planktonic</span><span class="highlight">marine</span> animals called foraminifera largely disappeared, although they rebounded later. Among plants, the K-T <span class="highlight">boundary</span> saw a sharp but <span class="highlight">brief</span> rise in the <span class="highlight">abundance</span> of <span class="highlight">primitive</span><span class="highlight">vascular</span> plants such as ferns, <span class="highlight">club</span> mosses, horsetails, and conifers and other gymnosperms. The number of flowering plants (angiosperms) was reduced at this time, but they then began to increase <span class="highlight">dramatically</span>.</p><p>What caused these changes? For many years scientists assumed that a cooling of the <span class="highlight">climate</span> was <span class="highlight">responsible</span>, with dinosaurs being particularly <span class="highlight">vulnerable</span> because, like modern reptiles, they were <span class="highlight">ectothermic</span> (dependent on <span class="highlight">environmental</span> heat, or cold-blooded). It is now widely believed that at <span class="highlight">least</span> some <span class="highlight">species</span> of dinosaurs had a <span class="highlight">metabolic</span><span class="highlight">rate</span> high enough for them to be endotherms (animals that <span class="highlight">maintain</span> a <span class="highlight">relatively</span><span class="highlight">consistent</span> body <span class="highlight">temperature</span> by generating heat internally). <span class="highlight">Nevertheless</span>, <span class="highlight">climatic</span> explanations for the K-T <span class="highlight">extinction</span> are not really challenged by the ideas that dinosaurs may have been <span class="highlight">endothermic</span>, because <span class="question6"><span class="highlight">even</span> endotherms can be affected by a <span class="highlight">significant</span> change in the <span class="highlight">climate</span>.</span></p><p>Explanations for the K-T <span class="highlight">extinction</span> were revolutionized in 1980 when a group of <span class="highlight">physical</span> scientists led by Luis Alvarez proposed that 65 million years ago Earth was <span class="highlight">stuck</span> by a
 10-kilometer-wide <span class="highlight">meteorite</span> traveling at 90,000 kilometers per hour. They believed that this <span class="highlight">impact</span><span class="question7">generated</span> a thick cloud of dust that enveloped Earth, shutting out much of the <span class="highlight">incoming</span><span class="highlight">solar</span><span class="highlight">radiation</span> and reducing plant <span class="highlight">photosynthesis</span> to very low levels. Short-term effects might have included huge <span class="highlight">tidal</span> waves and <span class="highlight"><span class="question8">extensive</span></span> fires. In other words, a <span class="highlight">series</span> of events arising from a single cataclysmic event caused the <span class="highlight">massive</span> extinctions. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>Initially, the <span class="highlight">meteorite</span><span class="highlight">theory</span> was based on a single <span class="highlight">line</span> of <span class="highlight">evidence</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>At locations around the globe, geologists had found an unusually high <span class="highlight">concentration</span> of <span class="highlight">iridium</span> in the <span class="highlight">layer</span> of <span class="highlight">sedimentary</span> rocks that was formed about 65 million years ago. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span><span class="highlight">Iridium</span> is an <span class="highlight">element</span> that is usually uncommon near Earth's surface, but it is <span class="highlight">abundant</span> in some meteorites. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span><span class="highlight">Therefore</span>, Alvarez and his colleagues concluded that it was likely that the <span class="highlight">iridium</span> in <span class="highlight">sedimentary</span> rocks deposited at the K-T <span class="highlight">boundary</span> had originated in a <span class="highlight">giant</span><span class="highlight">meteorite</span> or <span class="highlight">asteroid</span>. Most scientist came to accept the <span class="highlight">meteorite</span><span class="highlight">theory</span> after <span class="highlight">evidence</span> came to light that a <span class="highlight">circular</span><span class="highlight">formation</span>, 180 kilometers in <span class="highlight">diameter</span> in <span class="highlight">diameter</span> and centered on the north <span class="highlight">coast</span> of the Yucatan Peninsula, was created by a <span class="highlight">meteorite</span><span class="highlight">impact</span> about 65 million years ago.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">proliferation</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. decline</p><p>B. extinction</p><p>C. increase</p><p>D. migration</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Proliferation: Proliferation, proliferation, corresponding to the C option increase.</p><p>It was not until the Cambrian period, beginning about 600 million years ago, that a great proliferation of macroscopic species occurred on Earth and produced a fossil record that allows us to track the rise and fall of biodiversity.</p><p>Pro's prefix itself also means "many", and context can also help filter answers. In this sentence, there is a clear relationship of succession. Proliferation of the species visible to the naked eye occurs on the earth, and the content of the subsequent infringement refers to the creation of fossils. First of all, you can exclude the A option decline, B option extinction, substituting contradictory content, and D option migration (transition) semantics unreasonable. Only C options are most suitable.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Paragraph 1 supports which of the following statements about life on Earth before the Cambrian period?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Biodiversity levels were steady, as indicated by the fossil record.</p><p>B. Levels of biodiversity could not be tracked.</p><p>C. The most dramatic extinction episode occurred.</p><p>D. Few microscopic species existed.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Before and after the Cambrian period:</p><p>It was not until the Cambrian period, beginning about 600 million years ago, that a great proliferation of macroscopic species occurred on Earth and produced a fossil record that allows us to track the rise and fall of biodiversity.</p><p>The main idea is that it was not until the Cambrian that it was able to monitor biodiversity. The implication is that biodiversity cannot be monitored prior to the Cambrian period and corresponds to Option B.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The dominance of dinosaurs came to an end 65 million years ago, at which time mammals began to flourish and diversify.</p><p>B. Because no group of species can remain dominant forever, mammals became the dominant group when dinosaurs became extinct.</p><p>C. After being the dominant group for more than 200 million years, the age of dinosaurs came to a dramatic end 65 million years ago.</p><p>D. The diverse group of mammals that we know today, including bats and whales, evolved from small terrestrial forms that had been dominated by dinosaurs.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The long sentence is actually a juxtaposition of two long sentences, and some unimportant elements such as inserts, example structures, etc. can be abbreviated into: However, no group or species can maintain its dominance indefinitely, and mammals began to flourish. It is mainly divided into two meanings: The first is that no organism can rule forever, and the second is that after the dinosaurs die, the mammals begin to develop domination, and between the two layers of meaning can form a causal relationship. So only option B satisfies all conditions. The meaning of A is completely wrong; the C option misses the second layer of information; the D option has less first-level meaning and rewrites the non-primary information as the main information, so it is wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 2, why are dinosaurs popularly said to have "<span class="highlight"><span class="question4">ruled Earth</span></span>" during the Cretaceous period?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Dinosaurs were the only species of reptile that existed during the whole of the Cretaceous period.</p><p>B. Dinosaurs won the battle for food resources over mammals during the Cretaceous period.</p><p>C. Dinosaurs survived extinction during the Cretaceous period, whereas many other animal species did not.</p><p>D. Dinosaurs were the physically and ecologically dominant animals during the Cretaceous period.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" D"><p>Targeted to the second sentence with <span class="question4">ruled Earth</span>, and the reason appears in its previous sentence:</p><p>Starting about 280 million years ago, reptiles were the dominant large animals in terrestrial environments. In popular language this was the era "when dinosaurs <span class="question4">ruled Earth</span>," when a wide variety of reptile species occupying many ecological niches.</p><p>From the first sentence, reptiles were dominated by large terrestrial animals 280 million years ago. This is why it is "the age of dinosaurs" and corresponds to the D option. The only option for the A option is too absolute, and there is an inconsistency between the dominant and the original; the B option and the C option are not mentioned.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 2, which of the following species initially increased in number at the K-T boundary?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Dinosaurs</p><p>B. Foraminifera</p><p>C. Ferns</p><p>D. Ammonoid mollusks</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>With K-T boundary positioning, locate to:</p><p>Among the plants, the K-T boundary saw a sharp but brief rise in the abundance of primitive vascular plants such as ferns, club mosses, horsetails, and conifers and other gymnosperms.</p><p>In the positioning sentence mentioned "ferns, club mosses, horsetails, and conifers and other gymnosperms", which echoes the C option. Although ABD has been mentioned in the paragraph, it is not the content of the question.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the author note that "even endotherms can be affected by a significant change in the climate"?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To argue that there was a significant climate at the time that endothermic dinosaurs became extinct</p><p>B. To argue that climate change caused some dinosaurs to evolve as endotherms</p><p>C. To support the view that at least some of the dinosaurs that became extinct were endotherms</p><p>D. To defend climate change as possible explanation for the extinction of dinosaurs </p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The positioning sentence is:</p><p>Nevertheless, climatic explanations for the L-T extinction are not really challenged by the ideas that dinosaurs may have been endothermic.</p><p>Even in the question, it indicates the degree of progression. That is why the latter part of the sentence explains why the climate theory is not being refuted. This echoes the D option.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question7">generated</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. collected</p><p>B. produced</p><p>C. spread</p><p>D. added</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>Generate generates; causes, corresponds to the B option, produces.</p><p>Original text</p><p>It believed that this impact <span class="question7">generated</span> a thick cloud of dust that enveloped Earth, shutting out much of the incoming solar radiation and reducing plant photosynthesis to very low levels.</p><p>Through the context and before and after collocation, the C option spread can be eliminated soon, because if it is thick and add, it is not appropriate to substitute it. In A and B, B is more similar to generate semantics. So choose B.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question8">extensive</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. widespread</p><p>B. sudden</p><p>C. numerous</p><p>D. subsequent</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" A"><p>Extensive: Broad, corresponding to A options, <span class="question8">extensive</span>.</p><p>Original text</p><p>Short-term effects might have huge thidal waves and <span class="question8">extensive</span> fires.</p><p>This question can be speculated using the parallel logic of the original sentence. Obviously, huge and <span class="question8">extensive</span> are juxtaposed, and only the A option and huge can be well-aligned among the 4 options.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, all of the following contributed to the massive extinctions of the K-T period EXCEPT:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. tidal waves</p><p>B. fires</p><p>C. insufficient solar radiation</p><p>D. iridium</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>Tidal waves of option A, fires of option B are located to:</p><p>Short-term effects might have included huge tidal waves and <span class="question8">extensive</span> fires.

But this did not say it. Importance, can find answers near this sentence, the following sentence is the answer:</p><p>Therefore, Alvarez and his colleagues concluded that it was likely that the iridium in sedimentary rocks deposited at the KT boundary had originated in a giant meteorite or asteroid. Most scientist came to accept the meteorite theory after evidence came to light that a circular formation, 180 Kilometers in diameter in diameter and centered on the north coast of the Yucatan Peninsula, was created by a meteorite impact about 65 million years ago.</p><p>Here said that such a high concentration of iridium may be from a large meteor or asteroid. Therefore, its importance is to explain that the impact theory is the cause of the extinction of species.

The K-T extinction 65 million years ago is the best known of the five major extinction episodes since the Cambrian period.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.Collectively, the five major extinction episodes resulted in the elimination of a larger number of species than did all the minor extinction events.</p><p>B.The K-T extinction eliminated the dinosaurs and ammonoid mollusks but was followed by the diversification of mammals and gymnospermous plants.</p><p>C.An extreme cooling of the climate could not have caused the K-T extinction of dinosaurs, because, while most dinosaurs depended on environmental heat, some did not.</p><p>D.The K-T extinction of the dinosaurs is the only mass extinction that has been explained by the impact of a meteorite.</p><p>E.In1980 Luis Alvarez proposed that the K-T extinction was caused by ecological disasters brought about by the impact of a meteorite striking Earth.</p><p>F.A high concentration of iridium in sedimentary rocks at the K-T boundary and a large impact crater in the Yucatan Peninsula from 65 million years ago strongly support Alvarez' hypothesis. </p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="BEF"><p>A wrong. Ive the first major mass extinctions receive most of the attention, but they are only one end of a spectrum of extinction events. Collectively, more species went extinct during smaller events that were less dramatic but more frequent. Species are extinct in smaller but more frequent accidents, so the comparative information in the A option is not valid. So the A option is wrong.</p><p>B correct. Corresponding to the second passage, there is no ruler of immortality. After the dinosaurs are now the world of mammals and plants.</p><p>C wrong. Positioning the third paragraph, the main purpose is that the climate may cause dinosaur extinction. The view of the C option runs counter to the main idea, so it is wrong.</p><p>D wrong. The original does not mention other mass extinctions and there is no reasonable explanation, so the D option is wrong.</p><p>E correct. Corresponding to the fourth paragraph: The hypothesis of asteroids hitting the earth.</p><p>F correct. Corresponding to the fourth paragraph, the important evidence for the asteroid impact on the Earth hypothesis is explained. One of the evidences is the large number of Iridium's occurrence in Earth's rocks. Another evidence is the discovery of huge circular pits.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
