lecture in a <span class="highlight">biology</span> class.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.58" data-time="7.1">[00:07.10]</span>Professor: Ways in which animals <span class="highlight">adapt</span> to their environment are often quite <span class="highlight">ingenious</span> actually. <span class="time" data-times="7.19" data-time="13.68">[00:13.68]</span>And as an example of this, let me tell you about a fish, a group of fish known as the Notothenioids. <span class="time" data-times="8.83" data-time="20.87">[00:20.87]</span>There's over 90 known <span class="highlight">species</span> of Notothenioids and they <span class="highlight">inhabit</span> both <span class="highlight">shallow</span> and very deep waters, mostly around <span class="highlight">Antarctica</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.83" data-time="29.7">[00:29.70]</span>Many are <span class="highlight">fairly</span> small, though the largest <span class="highlight">species</span> can weigh up to 150 kilograms.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.87" data-time="35.53">[00:35.53]</span>Notothenioids can be identified by their large eyes, which are covered by a thick insulating <span class="highlight">layer</span> of <span class="highlight">clear</span><span class="highlight">tissue</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.76" data-time="43.4">[00:43.40]</span>This <span class="highlight">tissue</span> protects their eyes from freezing.<span class="time" data-times="8.17" data-time="46.16">[00:46.16]</span> Remember, the freezing point of ocean water, salt water, is <span class="highlight">lower</span> than for fresh water, <span class="highlight">negative</span> 1.9 <span class="highlight">degree</span> Celsius (-1.9°C). <span class="time" data-times="4.93" data-time="54.33">[00:54.33]</span>So it can get a lot colder for fish in an ocean, say, than in a river or lake.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="10.33" data-time="59.26">[00:59.26]</span>So this means that the ocean waters around <span class="highlight">Antarctica</span> are cold enough to <span class="highlight">freeze</span> most types of fish, but Notothenioids don't <span class="highlight">freeze</span>.<span class="time" data-times="1.87" data-time="69.59">[01:09.59]</span> In fact, they <span class="highlight">thrive</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.64" data-time="71.46">[01:11.46]</span>They <span class="highlight">account</span> for some 95% of all fish in the southern ocean, the ocean that surrounds <span class="highlight">Antarctica</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.44" data-time="78.1">[01:18.10]</span>So, how unusual is that? <span class="time" data-times="3.88" data-time="80.54">[01:20.54]</span>To have a single family of fish dominating an entire ocean. <span class="time" data-times="8.11" data-time="84.42">[01:24.42]</span>I mean, think of...say, <span class="highlight">tropical</span> or <span class="highlight">temperate</span><span class="highlight">marine</span> environments, which have incredibly <span class="highlight">diverse</span> fish populations. <span class="time" data-times="8.21" data-time="92.53">[01:32.53]</span>Coral reefs, for example, support over 4000 types of fish, <span class="highlight">along</span> with sponges, crustaceans, and many other organisms.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.21" data-time="100.74">[01:40.74]</span>So, exactly when and how did the Notothenioids come to <span class="highlight">dominate</span> the southern ocean? <span class="time" data-times="6.53" data-time="106.95">[01:46.95]</span>Well, around 30 million years ago, the waters around <span class="highlight">Antarctica</span> were a lot warmer than they are today. <span class="time" data-times="9.72" data-time="113.48">[01:53.48]</span>Um...at that time, <span class="highlight">Antarctica</span> was connected to South America, which means that warm <span class="highlight">air</span> from the north could flow southward and heat up the <span class="highlight">Antarctica</span> waters. <span class="time" data-times="6.58" data-time="123.2">[02:03.20]</span>Because the water around <span class="highlight">Antarctica</span> then was <span class="highlight">relatively</span> warm, it supported many types of fish.<span class="time" data-times="2.16" data-time="129.78">[02:09.78]</span> And we know this from <span class="highlight">fossil</span><span class="highlight">evidence</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.36" data-time="131.94">[02:11.94]</span>But the 90 or so <span class="highlight">species</span> of Notothenioids that exist today didn't exist at all back then. <span class="time" data-times="4.43" data-time="138.3">[02:18.30]</span>In fact, only one ancestral Notothenioid <span class="highlight">species</span> existed. <span class="time" data-times="6.72" data-time="142.73">[02:22.73]</span>But somewhere between 5 million and 14 million years ago, two <span class="highlight">major</span> changes took place.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.33" data-time="149.45">[02:29.45]</span>First, what we call a <span class="highlight">chance</span><span class="highlight">mutation</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.17" data-time="152.78">[02:32.78]</span>A tiny <span class="highlight">genetic</span> change occurred in that one Notothenioid <span class="highlight">species</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.04" data-time="157.95">[02:37.95]</span>Its DNA allowed for the production of a <span class="highlight">special</span><span class="highlight">protein</span>, a <span class="highlight">protein</span> that prevents the fish from freezing. <span class="time" data-times="8.51" data-time="164.99">[02:44.99]</span>The way this...this anti-freeze <span class="highlight">protein</span> works is: it binds to any ice crystals that form inside the fish. <span class="time" data-times="4.27" data-time="173.5">[02:53.50]</span>This binding <span class="highlight">action</span> prevents the ice crystals from growing larger. <span class="time" data-times="3.45" data-time="177.77">[02:57.77]</span>And this is what prevents Notothenioids from freezing.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="11.56" data-time="181.22">[03:01.22]</span>Now, at that time, the waters the Notothenioids inhabited were still not freezing cold, so the <span class="highlight">protein</span> didn't really make a <span class="highlight">difference</span> as far as the fish's <span class="highlight">survival</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.37" data-time="192.78">[03:12.78]</span>But this would change, because in the same period of geologic time there was a <span class="highlight">shift</span> in the earth's <span class="highlight">continental</span> plates. <span class="time" data-times="9.07" data-time="200.15">[03:20.15]</span><span class="highlight">Continental</span><span class="highlight">drift</span> caused <span class="highlight">Antarctica</span> to move apart from the <span class="highlight">landmass</span> of South America and to <span class="highlight">drift</span> into the Southern Polar <span class="highlight">Region</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="9.4" data-time="209.22">[03:29.22]</span>This resulted in a powerful water <span class="highlight">current</span> encircling <span class="highlight">Antarctica</span>, which prevented the <span class="highlight">Antarctic</span> waters from mixing with warmer water. <span class="time" data-times="10.91" data-time="218.62">[03:38.62]</span>So the southern ocean, <span class="highlight">isolated</span> from that warm <span class="highlight">airflow</span> from the north, cooled down <span class="highlight">drastically</span>, to the kinds of sub-freezing temperatures we <span class="highlight">associate</span> with it today.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.93" data-time="229.53">[03:49.53]</span>Now, most fish <span class="highlight">species</span> couldn't <span class="highlight">survive</span> in this <span class="highlight">frigid</span> environment and they became <span class="highlight">extinct</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.36" data-time="236.46">[03:56.46]</span>But that one Notothenioid <span class="highlight">species</span>, with its <span class="highlight">unique</span><span class="highlight">ability</span> to produce that anti-freeze <span class="highlight">protein</span>, thrived. <span class="time" data-times="3.85" data-time="243.82">[04:03.82]</span>It had <span class="highlight">virtually</span> the entire southern ocean to itself!</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.53" data-time="247.67">[04:07.67]</span>So? Well, there was little or no competition for food or <span class="highlight">space</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.54" data-time="252.2">[04:12.20]</span>You might think of it as...um...as a...a kind of <span class="highlight">ecological</span><span class="highlight">vacuum</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.54" data-time="257.74">[04:17.74]</span>And the Notothenioids exploited fully.<span class="time" data-times="4.83" data-time="260.28">[04:20.28]</span> The <span class="highlight">species</span> migrated into different habitats <span class="highlight">throughout</span> the southern ocean.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.12" data-time="265.11">[04:25.11]</span>And its <span class="highlight">population</span> increased <span class="highlight">dramatically</span>, with various sub-populations migrating into different parts of the ocean. <span class="time" data-times="8.11" data-time="272.23">[04:32.23]</span>Over time these sub-populations in all those different habitats...well, they developed very different <span class="highlight">physical</span> traits. <span class="time" data-times="7.71" data-time="280.34">[04:40.34]</span>They adapted to <span class="highlight">survive</span> in their <span class="highlight">particular</span><span class="highlight">ecological</span><span class="highlight">niche</span>, their...their <span class="highlight">position</span><span class="highlight">within</span> a <span class="highlight">particular</span><span class="highlight">ecosystem</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.2" data-time="288.05">[04:48.05]</span>We call this type of <span class="highlight">species</span><span class="highlight">diversification</span><span class="highlight">within</span> a <span class="highlight">species</span><span class="highlight">adaptive</span><span class="highlight">radiation</span>. <span class="time" data-times="16.06" data-time="294.25">[04:54.25]</span>And what <span class="highlight">adaptive</span><span class="highlight">radiation</span> is: an <span class="highlight">evolutionary</span><span class="highlight">process</span> by which a parent <span class="highlight">species</span> rapidly undergoes changes resulting in various new <span class="highlight">species</span> in order to fill <span class="highlight">multiple</span><span class="highlight">ecological</span> niches. <span class="time" data-times="14.94" data-time="310.31">[05:10.31]</span>So in the case of the Notothenioids, that single <span class="highlight">species</span> started colonizing empty habitats to such an <span class="highlight">extent</span> that it evolved into a <span class="highlight">broad</span><span class="highlight">range</span> of new <span class="highlight">species</span>, the 90 or so Notothenioid <span class="highlight">species</span> that we have today. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="325.25">[05:25.25]</span>So let me <span class="highlight">switch</span> to <span class="highlight">adaptive</span><span class="highlight">radiation</span> with regard to another <span class="highlight">species</span> that's also been very successful.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the lecture mainly about?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.
