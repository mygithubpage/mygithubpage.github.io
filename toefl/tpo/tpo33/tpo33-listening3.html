The use of tree rings to measure water usage rates.</p><p>B. Collecting data that are useful for planning water distribution.</p><p>C. Investigating the history of water use in the Colorado River basin.</p><p>D. The need for more government involvement in water distribution.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The entire article uses the Colorado Basin as an example to illustrate how researchers collect data to allocate water resources.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the student find surprising about the 1922 water-sharing agreement?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It was based on only twenty years of data.</p><p>B. It was approved by all seven states in the region.</p><p>C. It was meant to remain in effect for more than 100 years.</p><p>D. It was based on data from outside the Colorado River basin.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>(Now, researchers had itself gathering data on water flow back in the late 1890s using instruments they placed in the river. When the 1922 water-sharing agreement was made, there were about twenty years of data on water flow available. The average annual flow Was calculated and, well, the agreement was based on that calculation. The same basic agreement is in effect today.</p><p>Female student: Wait! That was all the data they had and they based their decision on that?</p><p>The professor's word now raises the point that from the 1890s to 1922, researchers collected data for 20 years. The girls interrupted the professor and expressed a surprise.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor, what was the problem with the data recorded before the 1970s?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The data were recorded on old instruments.</p><p>B. The recorded data and human observation did not match.</p><p>C. There were gaps in the recorded data.</p><p>D. The data did not reflect the historical changes in the flow of the Colorado River.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>Yes, and we'll see why that was a bad decision in a moment. OK, as that too past, it became clear that measuring river flow was much more complicated than we had thought. a, river has periods of low flow and periods Of high flow and this wasn't taken into consideration when the 1922 agreement was made.</p><p>The professor answered the girls and said that we will immediately see why this is a wrong decision. This sentence first expresses a point of view that this decision is wrong, and then gives reasons, because measuring the flow of children in the river is very complicated, when there is low flow and high flow of children, indicating the reason for determining the error and flow changes related.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What assumption did researchers use to draw conclusions about the Colorado River basin?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Ancient tree ring data can only be obtained from dead trees.</p><p>B. The climate in an area tends to remain constant over time.</p><p>C. Rainfall has a limited impact on water flowing in rivers.</p><p>D. Width of tree rings can correspond to the amount of moisture in an area.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>As we get more data, we look at a different source, a source that was able to tell us several hundreds of years of the river's history: tree rings. OK, let me explain.</p><p>You can also tell how much moisture the tree got during each of those years by looking at the width of the rings. A wide ring means plenty of water while a narrow one pointing less. The important structure, ie another data source, is the tree's annual rings. And explained later, the annual rings not only tell us the age of the tree, but also correspond to the amount of water in the year.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor imply when he describes the early to mid-1900s as the wettest period for the Colorado River in 400 years?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The climate in the Colorado River basin will become wetter in the future.</p><p>B. The 1922 agreement was based on overestimated average river flows.</p><p>C. Water flowing in the Colorado River rises and falls at a predictable rate.</p><p>D. Human activity caused climate change in the Colorado River basin.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Well, the results tell us something we wouldn't have known without this data: that over the past five hundred years or so, the Colorado River Basin has experienced harsh droughts, some worse than any we've ever recorded. They also show that The early to mid-1900s, when most of the data that led to the water-sharing agreement was collected, well, this was the wettest period in the past four hundred years.</p><p>The professor told us that the data show that the basin has experienced severe drought over the past 500 years. The source of data for the agreement is the most humid season. In other words, the agreement to arrange water distribution based on the most humid season will obviously lead to insufficient water during the drought. The agreement overestimates the amount of water</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the professor's attitude toward future water-management plans in the Colorado River basin?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. He believes better methods for collecting data need to be developed.</p><p>B. He does not believe water management will be a concern in the immediate future.</p><p>C. He is optimistic that new data will lead to better planning.</p><p>D. He is not certain all scientists understand the current condition of the Colorado River.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Professor But, today, we can use the past to help us prepare for the future. Professor's expression "help us prepare" is an optimistic expression.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
