              <span class="time" data-times="8.19" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in an <span class="underline">environmental</span> science class. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.48" data-time="8.19">[00:08.19]</span>Professor: I'd like to continue with the topic of managing water resources, but I want to <span class="underline">focus</span> on a <span class="underline">particular</span> case. <span class="time" data-times="7.41" data-time="16.67">[00:16.67]</span>Uh, um, an example of water <span class="underline">management</span> that's made us reconsider the methods we use when we make these decisions. <span class="time" data-times="4.03" data-time="24.08">[00:24.08]</span>So let's look at what's happening in the Colorado River <span class="underline">basin</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.18" data-time="28.11">[00:28.11]</span>The Colorado River <span class="underline">basin</span> is a <span class="underline">region</span> in the Southwest United States. <span class="time" data-times="2.89" data-time="33.29">[00:33.29]</span>Seven states <span class="underline">rely</span> on the Colorado's water. <span class="time" data-times="13.63" data-time="36.18">[00:36.18]</span>And as you can imagine, as the populations of these states began to grow, it became <span class="underline">clear</span> that a system to <span class="underline">distribute</span>, uh, to make sure each <span class="underline">state</span> got its <span class="underline">fair</span> share of water...some kind of system had to be created. <span class="time" data-times="4.13" data-time="49.81">[00:49.81]</span>And in 1922, a water-sharing agreement was made. <span class="time" data-times="1.81" data-time="53.94">[00:53.94]</span>Elizabeth, you have a question? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.32" data-time="55.75">[00:55.75]</span>Student: Well, how exactly do you <span class="underline">figure</span> out how to share a river? <span class="time" data-times="2.84" data-time="60.07">[01:00.07]</span>I mean, you can't...like cut it up into pieces. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.95" data-time="62.91">[01:02.91]</span>Professor: Well, let's start with the first step. <span class="time" data-times="5.77" data-time="64.86">[01:04.86]</span>And that's trying to <span class="underline">figure</span> out how much water on <span class="underline">average</span> flows <span class="underline">through</span> the river each year. <span class="time" data-times="8.58" data-time="70.63">[01:10.63]</span>Now, researchers had started gathering <span class="underline">data</span> on water flow back in the late 1890s using instruments they placed in the river. <span class="time" data-times="7.11" data-time="79.21">[01:19.21]</span>When the 1922 water-sharing agreement was made, there were about twenty years of <span class="underline">data</span> on water flow <span class="underline">available</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.07" data-time="86.32">[01:26.32]</span>The <span class="underline">average</span> <span class="underline">annual</span> flow was calculated. <span class="time" data-times="3.14" data-time="89.39">[01:29.39]</span>And, well, the agreement was based on that <span class="underline">calculation</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.39" data-time="92.53">[01:32.53]</span>The same <span class="underline">basic</span> agreement is in effect today.  </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.56" data-time="95.92">[01:35.92]</span>Student: Wait! That was all the <span class="underline">data</span> they had? <span class="time" data-times="1.64" data-time="98.48">[01:38.48]</span>And they based their decision on that? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.84" data-time="100.12">[01:40.12]</span>Professor: Yes. And we'll why that was a bad decision in a moment. <span class="time" data-times="8.43" data-time="103.96">[01:43.96]</span>OK. As decades passed, it became <span class="underline">clear</span> that measuring river flow was much more <span class="underline">complicated</span> than we had thought. <span class="time" data-times="4.74" data-time="112.39">[01:52.39]</span>See...a river has periods of low flow and periods of high flow. <span class="time" data-times="4.76" data-time="117.13">[01:57.13]</span>And this wasn't taken into <span class="underline">consideration</span> when the 1922 agreement was made. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.11" data-time="121.89">[02:01.89]</span>In the 1970s, the <span class="underline">population</span> of the area was rising while the <span class="underline">amount</span> of water flowing <span class="underline">through</span> the river seemed to be falling. <span class="time" data-times="2.04" data-time="130">[02:10.00]</span>By this time, we had...what? <span class="time" data-times="2.19" data-time="132.04">[02:12.04]</span>A hundred years of recorded <span class="underline">data</span> to look at? <span class="time" data-times="3.09" data-time="134.23">[02:14.23]</span>That's still a <span class="underline">pretty</span> short time for an <span class="underline">ancient</span> river.<span class="time" data-times="9.51" data-time="137.32">[02:17.32]</span>To get more <span class="underline">data</span>, we looked at a different <span class="underline">source</span>-a <span class="underline">source</span> that was able to tell us about hundreds of years of the river's <span class="underline">history</span>-tree rings.<span class="time" data-times="1.64" data-time="146.83">[02:26.83]</span> OK. Let me explain. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.17" data-time="148.47">[02:28.47]</span>You probably know that we can <span class="underline">determine</span> a tree's age by counting the rings on a cross <span class="underline">section</span> of its <span class="underline">trunk</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.59" data-time="154.64">[02:34.64]</span>Each ring represents one year of the tree's life.<span class="time" data-times="5.87" data-time="158.23">[02:38.23]</span> So if you know the year the tree was cut, you can <span class="underline">count</span> inwards and <span class="underline">date</span> each ring all the way back to the center. <span class="time" data-times="7.76" data-time="164.1">[02:44.10]</span>You can also tell how much <span class="underline">moisture</span> the tree got during each of those years by looking at the width of the rings. <span class="time" data-times="4.69" data-time="171.86">[02:51.86]</span>A wide ring means plenty of water while a narrow one indicates less. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.75" data-time="176.55">[02:56.55]</span>Fortunately for us, certain areas of the Colorado River <span class="underline">basin</span> are home to some very old trees, some 800 years old and older. <span class="time" data-times="12.65" data-time="187.3">[03:07.30]</span>Researchers can <span class="underline">drill</span> <span class="underline">core</span> samples, uh, basically get a cross <span class="underline">section</span> of a tree without having to kill it, look at the rings and get a picture of what the <span class="underline">climate</span> was like in the <span class="underline">basin</span> for each of the tree's years. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="12.84" data-time="199.95">[03:19.95]</span>Well, the results tell us something we wouldn't have known without this <span class="underline">data</span>, that over the past 500 years or so, the Colorado River <span class="underline">basin</span> has experienced <span class="underline">severe</span> droughts, some worse than any we've ever recorded. <span class="time" data-times="12.66" data-time="212.79">[03:32.79]</span>They also showed that the early to mid-1900s, when most of the <span class="underline">data</span> that led to the water-sharing agreement was collected...well, this was the wettest period in the past 400 years. <span class="time" data-times="8.12" data-time="225.45">[03:45.45]</span>Well, <span class="underline">obviously</span>, had water <span class="underline">management</span> officials known then what we know now, the 1922 agreement would have been handled differently. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.14" data-time="233.57">[03:53.57]</span>But today we can use the past to help <span class="underline">prepare</span> us for the future. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="238.71">[03:58.71]</span>With the demand for water in the <span class="underline">basin</span> stays increasing and with the real likelihood of <span class="underline">lower</span> flows in the river, if <span class="underline">history</span> is our teacher, we can develop <span class="underline">innovative</span> methods of water <span class="underline">conservation</span> and reevaluate how water is distributed. </p>
