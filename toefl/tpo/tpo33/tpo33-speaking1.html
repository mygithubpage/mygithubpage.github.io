What advice would you give your friend to help make this decision?</p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>I would suggest my friend to ask some college students for help. I mean, they' re the ones who are already involved in these majors,and they should have some first-hand information, like what classes they need to take, whether they' re interesting or not, and if this major is promising. When I graduated from high school, I hesitated between computer science and electronic engineering. I ended up majoring in EE, and find myself hate this major just because the classes I take are not the ones I thought I might be interested in. If I had the chance to ask some of the EE students before I entered college, I' m sure I wouldn' t have this kind of issue.</p></article></div></main></body></html>
