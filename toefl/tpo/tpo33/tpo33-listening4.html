I see. Well, I <span class="highlight">suppose</span> it's a possibility. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.85" data-time="88.13">[01:28.13]</span>Student: Actually, it turns out it's more than a possibility.<span class="time" data-times="9.22" data-time="90.98">[01:30.98]</span> I started doing some research in the library that night and I found out that a biologist at the National Institutes of Health has been looking at that very question recently. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.37" data-time="100.2">[01:40.20]</span>Professor: Well, I guess that's not too surprising. <span class="time" data-times="2.7" data-time="102.57">[01:42.57]</span>And this is great <span class="highlight">stuff</span> actually. <span class="time" data-times="1.58" data-time="105.27">[01:45.27]</span>So what's the verdict? </p><p><span class="time" data-times="8.07" data-time="106.85">[01:46.85]</span>Student: Well, this guy seems to have discovered a <span class="highlight">particular</span><span class="highlight">gene</span> that actually makes it possible for people to <span class="highlight">taste</span> the bitterness in certain green vegetables. <span class="time" data-times="4.23" data-time="114.92">[01:54.92]</span>But people who have a <span class="highlight">mutation</span> in that <span class="highlight">gene</span> cannot <span class="highlight">taste</span> the bitterness. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.54" data-time="119.15">[01:59.15]</span>Professor: Well...that's certainly <span class="highlight">fascinating</span>! <span class="time" data-times="8.28" data-time="122.69">[02:02.69]</span>But...so this biologist is basically claiming that people who like to eat these vegetables actually have some <span class="highlight">sort</span> of <span class="highlight">sensory</span><span class="highlight">deficit</span>? <span class="time" data-times="3.69" data-time="130.97">[02:10.97]</span><span class="highlight">Sort</span> of makes us <span class="highlight">picky</span> eaters than normal ones, doesn't it? <span class="time" data-times="2.82" data-time="134.66">[02:14.66]</span>I mean, that's kind of turning things on their head, isn't it? </p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.21" data-time="137.48">[02:17.48]</span>Student: Well...then again, it wouldn't be the first time, would it? <span class="time" data-times="9.9" data-time="140.69">[02:20.69]</span>Think of it this way: humans originally needed to have a stronger sensitivity to bitter-tasting foods so they could learn what plants were good for them and which ones might be <span class="highlight">poisonous</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.5" data-time="150.59">[02:30.59]</span>But at some point, as people figured out what they could safely eat, this need became less <span class="highlight">crucial</span> and a <span class="highlight">segment</span> of the <span class="highlight">population</span> lost that <span class="highlight">ability</span>. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.73" data-time="159.09">[02:39.09]</span>Professor: OK. Well, you make a <span class="highlight">compelling</span> case. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="162.82">[02:42.82]</span>I can't wait to hear more about this when you <span class="highlight">deliver</span> your <span class="highlight">report</span>. </p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor meet with the student?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To determine if the student has selected an appropriate topic for his class project</p><p>B. To find out if the student is interested in taking part in a genetics project</p><p>C. To discuss the student's experiment on taste perception</p><p>D. To explain what the student should focus on for his class presentation</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>So, like I told you in class, I just wanted to take a few minutes to meet with everyone to make sure your class presentations for next week are all in order and coming along well. And as you know, you're assumed to report This conversation is a professor who proactively asks students to understand whether or not the other person has been prepared for presentation.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the student ask the professor about broccoli?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To get her to describe some of its genetic features</p><p>B. To find out if she is familiar with recent research on vegetable DNA</p><p>C. To introduce an idea that he has had for a research topic</p><p>D. To help explain why he needs extra time to prepare his presentation</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>First of all, the students said they were ready and thought about it when they were eating dinner. Then suddenly asked the teacher whether he likes to eat broccoli. Explain that this thing is related to his PRESENTATION TOPIC. After the teacher was puzzled by the questions asked by students about BROCCOLI, the students summed up their TOPIC.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>What possible causes does the student consider for not liking the taste of vegetables?[choose two answers]</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. A genetic predisposition.</p><p>B. Cooking methods that fail to remove the vegetables' bitter taste.</p><p>C. A bad childhood experience associated with eating vegetables.</p><p>D. Not being served enough vegetables during childhood.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="AC"><p>o, is this just because of some, like, trauma from our childhoods? Some bad experience we've had with vegetables? Students think that besides some childhood experiences, there may be genetic factors that cause some people to hate the taste of vegetables. Professor said this is possible.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the student, why was it advantageous for early humans to be sensitive to bitter tastes?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It helped them to identify vegetables as sources of vitamins.</p><p>B. It helped them to avoid eating foods that were not healthy for them.</p><p>C. It made them less likely to limit their diet to sweet and salty foods.</p><p>D. It allowed them to distinguish between ripe and unripe vegetables.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Student of finally way, humans truly needed to have a stronger sensitivity to bitter-tasting foods so they could learn what plants were good for them and which ones might be poisonous. The student finally explained why people would have genes that taste bitter because early People need to identify toxic and non-toxic.</p></div></div><div class="replay" id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the student imply when he says this:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. He has often disagreed with the professor in the past.</p><p>B. The biologist in question has a history of advocating nontraditional ideas.</p><p>C. Biologists'research methods are sometimes regarded as unusual by other scientists.</p><p>D. Scientific explanations are sometimes contrary to what people might expect.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>But, so this biologist is basically claiming that people who like to eat these vegetables actually have some sort of a sensory deficit?</p><p>Well, then again, it wouldn't be the first time, would it? The student is responding to the teacher's words. The original student was said by her mother to be a picky person, but scientists said that the taste is critical to help identify toxic genes.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
