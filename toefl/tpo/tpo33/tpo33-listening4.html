              <span class="time" data-times="7.57" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to a <span class="underline">conversation</span> between a student and his <span class="underline">biology</span> professor. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.33" data-time="7.57">[00:07.57]</span>Student: Professor Landrea. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.85" data-time="9.9">[00:09.90]</span>Professor: Hi, Dennis. You are right on time. <span class="time" data-times="1.29" data-time="11.75">[00:11.75]</span>Come on in and have a seat. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.53" data-time="13.04">[00:13.04]</span>Student: Great! Thanks. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.4" data-time="16.57">[00:16.57]</span>Professor: So like I told you in class, I just <span class="underline">wanted</span> to take a few minutes to meet with everyone to make sure your class presentations for next week are all in order and coming <span class="underline">along</span> well. <span class="time" data-times="6.57" data-time="26.97">[00:26.97]</span>And as you know, you are supposed to <span class="underline">report</span> on some area of recent research in <span class="underline">genetics</span>, something...you know...<span class="underline">original</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.59" data-time="33.54">[00:33.54]</span>Student: Well, I think I found just the thing! <span class="time" data-times="4.27" data-time="36.13">[00:36.13]</span>It actually occurred to me a <span class="underline">couple</span> nights ago while I was eating dinner in the <span class="underline">cafeteria</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.55" data-time="40.4">[00:40.40]</span>Tell me professor, do you like broccoli? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.7" data-time="42.95">[00:42.95]</span>Professor: Broccoli? You mean the vegetable broccoli? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="0.74" data-time="46.65">[00:46.65]</span>Student: Yeah. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.01" data-time="47.39">[00:47.39]</span>Professor: Well, I guess not really. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.46" data-time="51.4">[00:51.40]</span>Student: Me neither. I have never liked it or most other vegetables for that matter...Brussels sprouts, asparagus, cauliflower...you name it. <span class="time" data-times="3.3" data-time="58.86">[00:58.86]</span>They just <span class="underline">taste</span> bitter and...well...nasty to me.<span class="time" data-times="2.14" data-time="62.16">[01:02.16]</span> My mother always called me a <span class="underline">picky</span> eater. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.34" data-time="64.3">[01:04.30]</span>Professor: OK...And? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.17" data-time="66.64">[01:06.64]</span>Student: And so I got to wondering: I mean, I am <span class="underline">obviously</span> not the only person like this. <span class="time" data-times="4.31" data-time="71.81">[01:11.81]</span>So is this just because of some...like <span class="underline">trauma</span> from our childhoods? <span class="time" data-times="2.49" data-time="76.12">[01:16.12]</span>Some bad experience we've had with vegetables? <span class="time" data-times="5.37" data-time="78.61">[01:18.61]</span>Or could there be some <span class="underline">genetic</span> explanation for why some people are <span class="underline">picky</span> eaters and others aren't? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.15" data-time="83.98">[01:23.98]</span>Professor: OK. I see. Well, I <span class="underline">suppose</span> it's a possibility. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.85" data-time="88.13">[01:28.13]</span>Student: Actually, it turns out it's more than a possibility.<span class="time" data-times="9.22" data-time="90.98">[01:30.98]</span> I started doing some research in the library that night and I found out that a biologist at the National Institutes of Health has been looking at that very question recently. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.37" data-time="100.2">[01:40.20]</span>Professor: Well, I guess that's not too surprising. <span class="time" data-times="2.7" data-time="102.57">[01:42.57]</span>And this is great <span class="underline">stuff</span> actually. <span class="time" data-times="1.58" data-time="105.27">[01:45.27]</span>So what's the verdict? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.07" data-time="106.85">[01:46.85]</span>Student: Well, this guy seems to have discovered a <span class="underline">particular</span> <span class="underline">gene</span> that actually makes it possible for people to <span class="underline">taste</span> the bitterness in certain green vegetables. <span class="time" data-times="4.23" data-time="114.92">[01:54.92]</span>But people who have a <span class="underline">mutation</span> in that <span class="underline">gene</span> cannot <span class="underline">taste</span> the bitterness. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.54" data-time="119.15">[01:59.15]</span>Professor: Well...that's certainly <span class="underline">fascinating</span>! <span class="time" data-times="8.28" data-time="122.69">[02:02.69]</span>But...so this biologist is basically claiming that people who like to eat these vegetables actually have some <span class="underline">sort</span> of <span class="underline">sensory</span> <span class="underline">deficit</span>? <span class="time" data-times="3.69" data-time="130.97">[02:10.97]</span> <span class="underline">Sort</span> of makes us <span class="underline">picky</span> eaters than normal ones, doesn't it? <span class="time" data-times="2.82" data-time="134.66">[02:14.66]</span>I mean, that's kind of turning things on their head, isn't it? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.21" data-time="137.48">[02:17.48]</span>Student: Well...then again, it wouldn't be the first time, would it? <span class="time" data-times="9.9" data-time="140.69">[02:20.69]</span>Think of it this way: humans originally needed to have a stronger sensitivity to bitter-tasting foods so they could learn what plants were good for them and which ones might be <span class="underline">poisonous</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.5" data-time="150.59">[02:30.59]</span>But at some point, as people figured out what they could safely eat, this need became less <span class="underline">crucial</span> and a <span class="underline">segment</span> of the <span class="underline">population</span> lost that <span class="underline">ability</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.73" data-time="159.09">[02:39.09]</span>Professor: OK. Well, you make a <span class="underline">compelling</span> case. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="162.82">[02:42.82]</span>I can't wait to hear more about this when you <span class="underline">deliver</span> your <span class="underline">report</span>. </p>
