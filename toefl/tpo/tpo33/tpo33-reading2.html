Much of the new <span class="highlight">construction</span> during the 1850s occurred west of the Appalachian Mountains ï¿½ over 2,000 miles in the states of Ohio and Illinois alone.</p><p>The effect of the new <span class="highlight">railroad</span> lines rippled outward <span class="highlight">through</span> the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. Farmers <span class="highlight">along</span> the tracks began to <span class="highlight">specialize</span> in <span class="highlight">corps</span> that they could <span class="highlight">market</span> in <span class="highlight">distant</span> locations. With their profits they purchased manufactured goods that earlier they might have made at home. Before the <span class="highlight">railroad</span> reached Tennessee, the <span class="highlight">state</span> produced about 25,000 bushels (or 640 tons) of wheat, which sold for less than 50 cents a bushel. Once the <span class="highlight">railroad</span> came, farmers in the same counties grew 400,000 bushels (over 10,000 tons) and sold their crop at a dollar a bushel.</p><p>The new <span class="highlight">railroad</span> networks shifted the direction of western <span class="highlight">trade</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> In 1840 most northwestern <span class="highlight">grain</span> was shipped south down the Mississippi River to the <span class="highlight"><span class="question3">bustling</span></span> port of New Orleans.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> But low water made <span class="highlight">steamboat</span> travel <span class="highlight">hazardous</span> in summer, and ice shut down traffic in winter. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>Products such as lard, tallow, and cheese quickly spoiled if stored in New Orleans' hot and 
 <span class="highlight">humid</span> warehouses. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span> Increasingly, traffic from the Midwest flowed west to east, over the new rail lines. Chicago became the <span class="highlight">region</span>'s hub, linking the farms of the upper Midwest to New York and 
 other eastern cities by more than 2,000 miles of <span class="highlight">track</span> in 1855. Thus while the value of goods shipped by river to New Orleans continued to increase, the South's <span class="highlight">overall</span> share of western <span class="highlight">trade</span> 
 dropped <span class="highlight">dramatically</span>.</p><p>A sharp rise in demand for <span class="highlight">grain</span><span class="highlight">abroad</span> also encouraged farmers in the Northeast and Midwest to become more commercially oriented. Wheat, which in 1845 commanded $1.08 a bushel in New York City, fetched $2.46 in 1855; in <span class="highlight">similar</span><span class="highlight">fashion</span> the price of corn nearly doubled. Farmers responded by specializing in cash crops, borrowing to <span class="highlight">purchase</span> more land, and investing in equipment to increase <span class="highlight">productivity</span>.</p><p>As <span class="highlight">railroad</span> lines fanned out from Chicago, farmers began to <span class="highlight">acquire</span> open <span class="highlight">prairie</span> land in Illinois and then Iowa, putting the <span class="highlight">fertile</span>, deep black soil into production. <span class="highlight">Commercial</span><span class="highlight">agriculture</span><span class="question7">transformed</span> this <span class="highlight">remarkable</span> treeless environment. To settlers <span class="highlight">accustomed</span> to eastern woodlands, the thousands of <span class="highlight">square</span> miles of tall grass were an <span class="highlight">awesome</span> sight. <span class="question9">Indian grass, Canada wild <span class="highlight">rye</span>, and native big bluestem all grew higher than a person.</span> Because eastern plows could not <span class="highlight">penetrate</span> the densely tangled roots of <span class="highlight">prairie</span> grass, the earliest settlers <span class="question8">erected</span> farms <span class="highlight">along</span> the <span class="highlight">boundary</span> separating the forest from the <span class="highlight">prairie</span>. In 1837, however, John Deere patented a sharp-cutting <span class="highlight">steel</span><span class="highlight">plow</span> that sliced <span class="highlight">through</span> the sod without soil sticking to the <span class="highlight">blade</span>. Cyrus McCormick <span class="highlight">refined</span> a <span class="highlight">mechanical</span> reaper that harvested fourteen times more wheat with the same <span class="highlight">amount</span> of labor. By the 1850s McCormick was selling 1,000 reapers a year and could not keep up with demand, while Deere turned out 10,000 plows annually.</p><p>The new <span class="highlight">commercial</span> farming fundamentally altered the Midwestern <span class="highlight">landscape</span> and the environment. Native Americans had grown corn in the <span class="highlight">region</span> for years, but never in such large fields as did later settlers who became farmers, whose <span class="question11">surpluses</span> were shipped east. <span class="highlight">Prairie</span> farmers also introduced new crops that were not part of the earlier <span class="highlight">ecological</span> system, <span class="highlight">notably</span> wheat, <span class="highlight">along</span> with fruits and vegetables. Native grasses were replaced by a small number of plants <span class="highlight">cultivated</span> as commodities. Corn had the best yields, but it was <span class="highlight">primarily</span> used to feed <span class="highlight">livestock</span>. Because bread played a key role in the American and European <span class="highlight">diet</span>, wheat became the <span class="highlight">major</span> cash crop. Tame grasses replaced native grasses in pastures for making <span class="highlight">hay</span>.</p><p>Western farmers altered the <span class="highlight">landscape</span> by reducing the <span class="highlight">annual</span> fires that had kept the <span class="highlight">prairie</span> free from trees. In the <span class="highlight">absence</span> of these fires, trees reappeared on land not in <span class="highlight">cultivation</span> and, if undisturbed, <span class="highlight">eventually</span> formed woodlots. The earlier unbroken <span class="highlight">landscape</span> gave way to <span class="highlight">independent</span> farms, each fenced off in a <span class="highlight">precise</span> checkerboard <span class="highlight">pattern</span>. It was an <span class="highlight">artificial</span><span class="highlight">ecosystem</span> of animals, woodlots, and crops, whose large, <span class="highlight">uniform</span><span class="highlight">layout</span> made western farms more <span class="highlight">efficient</span> than the more-irregular farms in the East.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 1, each of the following is true about railroad track in the United States EXCEPT:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. In 1850 the United State had less than 10,000 miles of railroad track.</p><p>B. By the end of the 1850s, hio and lllinois contained more railroad track than any other state in the country.</p><p>C.

By 1860 there were more miles of railroad track in the United States than in any other country.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>A corresponds to By 1850 the United States possessed roughly 9,000 miles of railroad track;</p><p>D corresponds to ten years later it had over 30,000 miles, more than the rest of the world combined.</p><p></p><p>C corresponds to Much of the new construction during the 1850s occurred west of the Appalachian Mountains ï¿½ over 2,000 miles in the states of Ohio and Illinois alone.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>It can be inferred from paragraph 2 that the new railroads had which of the following effects on farm communities?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Most new farms were located along the tracks.</p><p>B. Farmers began to grow wheat as a commercial corp.</p><p>C. Many farmer decided to grow a wider variety of crops.</p><p>D. Demand for manufactured goods increased among farmers.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>Position the effect of the new railroad lines rippled outward through</p><p>The economy. Farmers along the tracks began to specialize in corps that they could market in distant locations. With their profits they purchased manufactured goods that earlier they might have made at home. It means that because the railway construction has driven the economy, the farmers have started to have money. Then, they began to buy handmade products. Therefore, it can be inferred that when farmers have money, they have the desire and demand to buy things.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question3">bustling</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. famous</p><p>B. important</p><p>C. growing</p><p>D. busy</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" D"><p>D <span class="question3">bustling</span>: Busy, <span class="question3">bustling</span>, corresponds to the D option, busy.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 3, in what way did the new rail networks change western trade?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Northwestern farmers almost completely stopped shipping goods by steamboat.</p><p>B. Many western goods began to be shipped east by way of Chicago rather than south to New rleans.</p><p>C. Chicago largely replaced New York and other eastern cities as the final market for goods for the West.</p><p>D. The value of goods shipped west soon became greater than the value of goods shipped east.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The new railroad networks shifted the direction of western trade. Chicago became the region's hub, linking the farms of the upper Midwest to New York and other eastern cities by more than 2,000 miles of track in 1855. In the direction of Western trade, Chicago became a trade center, replacing the original New Orleans. So the answer is B.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 3, what was a disadvantage of shipping goods from northwestern areas to New Orleans?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. There was no reliable way to get goods from New Orleans to eastern cities.</p><p>B. The cost of shipping goods by river to New Orleans continued to increase.</p><p>C. Goods shipped from New Orleans' neighboring areas had a significant competitive advantage because of their lower transportation costs.</p><p>D. the temperatures and humidity.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The title is factual information. The question asked what was a disadvantage of transporting cargo from the northwest to New Orleans. Therefore, we use the keyword disadvantage to locate negative information, or logically related words with negative and turning meanings. In this paragraph, you see the word "but" at the beginning of the third sentence, indicating that the content behind may be related to the topic. The third sentence says that both the summer temperature and the winter temperature may affect the waterway and obstruct navigation. The fourth sentence says that with food shipped by ship, food may be broken in a hot and humid environment. Corresponds to the two points of temperature and humidity in the D option. Therefore, the D option is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Paragraph 4 supports the idea that the price of wheat more than doubled between 1845 and 1855 because</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. the price of corn nearly doubled during that same period</p><p>B. demand for grain increased sharply outside the United States</p><p>C. farmers in the Northeast and Midwest began to specialize in cash crops</p><p>D. many farmers had borrowed heavily to purchase land and equipment for raising wheat</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Food demand in foreign countries soared, and the final result of the segment was an increase in prices.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question7">transformed</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. dominated</p><p>B. changed</p><p>C. improved</p><p>D. created</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>B transform: change, correspond to B option, change, change.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question8">erected</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. looked for</p><p>B. lived on</p><p>C. preferred</p><p>D. built</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" D"><p>D erect: create, corresponding to the D option build (build, build).</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does author point out that "<span class="highlight">Indian grass, Canada wild rye, and native big bluestem all grew higher than a person</span>"?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To provide a reason why people from the eastern woodlands of the United States were impressed when they saw the prairie</p><p>B. To identify an obstacles to the development of the railroad lines fanning out from Chicago</p><p>C. To explain why the transformation of the prairies by commercial agriculture was so remarkable</p><p>D. To provide evidence supporting the claim that the prairies had fertile, deep black soil</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="Indian grass, Canada wild rye, and native big bluestem all grew higher than a person A"><p>The title refers to the first sentence of the highlighted sentence. The meaning of these two sentences is that people who are accustomed to the Eastern Forest will be surprised when they see the tall grassland, because the grass is higher than people. Option A follows the original meaning. The other three options are not suitable.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 5, the first settlers generally did not farm open prairie land because</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. they could not plow it effectively with the tools that were available</p><p>B. prairie land was usually very expensive to buy</p><p>C. the soil along boundaries between the forest and the prairie was more fertile than the soil of the open prairie</p><p>D. the railroad lines had not yet reached the open prairie when the first settlers arrived</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The reason is that Eastern plows could not penetrate the densely tangled roots of prairie grass, the earliest settlers <span class="question8">erected</span> farms along the boundary, separating the forest from the prairie. The reason is that the plough cannot penetrate the grassland, so the answer could only be A.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question11">surpluses</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. extra goods</p><p>B. commercial goods</p><p>C. unprocessed goods</p><p>D. transportable goods</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" A"><p>A <span class="question11">surpluses</span>: remaining/extra stuff, corresponding to option extra, additional.</p><p>Original text</p><p>Native Americans had grown corn in the region for years, but never in such large fields as did later settlers who became farmers, whose <span class="question11">surpluses</span> were packaged east.</p><p>Guessing through the semantics of this sentence, the first half of the sentence is to say that later farmers used a lot of land to plant their <span class="question11">surpluses</span> and were shipped to the East. B options commercial goods (commercial items), C options unprocessed goods (raw goods), D options of transportable goods (transportable goods), and context are not relevant, only extra goods can be good and large fields echo. You can also look at the structure of <span class="question11">surpluses</span> themselves. Sur has "exceeded, mean", and extra echoes.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 7, prairie farmers changed the landscape by doing all of the following EXCEPT</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Reducing annual fires</p><p>B. Dividing the land into large, regularly-shaped lots</p><p>C. Planting trees that eventually formed woodlots</p><p>D. Fencing off their farms</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Localization sentences Western farmers altered the landscape by reducing the annual fires that had kept the prairie free from trees. Corresponding to the D option. The earlier unbroken landscape gave to independent farms, each fenced off in a precise checkerboard pattern. It was an artificial ecosystem of animals, woodlots, and crops, whose large, uniform layout made western farms more efficient than the more-irregular farms in The East. checkerboard pattern The checkerboard pattern corresponds to the B option. The C option is wrong without mentioning planting trees.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The problems were not limited to routes of transport..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The original sentence means that the problem is not only confined to road transport, so we can infer that the next sentence of the sentence should refer to other issues, so the third box meets the requirements, the waterway issues are addressed before, and the weather is mentioned later. And humidity issues. The inserted sentence just plays a role in the connection.</p></div></div><div id="question14" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>The huge expansion of rail lines in Midwestern United States during the 185os had major economic and environmental effects.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.Construction of new rail lines into the Midwest had been effectively stopped by the Appalachian Mountains, but by 1850 improved construction technology had made further advances possible.</p><p>B.Rail lines to Chicago and on to the East made it easier to get Midwestern goods to distant markets, while growing demand encouraged crop specialization and led to higher crop prices.</p><p>C.Because of the growing volume of traffic coming by rail from the Northeast and Midwest, the value of goods arriving in New rleans for shipment to markets abroad increased dramatically.</p><p>D.Access to rail lines combined with the development of more-efficient farming equipment allowed a fertile land of the open prairies to be used for large-scale commercial agriculture.</p><p>E.Reduction of annual prairie fires allowed trees to reappear, and native grasses were replaced by a few commercially grown plants as previously unbroken grasslands were divided into large fenced fields.</p><p>F.Native Americans had grown corn on the prairies for years but had not produced large surpluses because the varieties they planted had far poorer yields than those introduced by commercial farmers.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="BDE"><p>A wrong. Positioning the first paragraph did not mention that the new railway construction was blocked by the Appalachian Mountains.</p><p>B correct. Corresponding to the second and fifth paragraphs, the development of the railway has led the economy, farmers have acquired land, improved agricultural implements, and increased crop yields.</p><p>C wrong. The last half of the C option is correct and is the main thrust of paragraph 4. However, the first half of this option is an example of the third paragraph. Its purpose should be the first sentence of the paragraph. The new railroad networks shifted the direction of western trade. .</p><p>D correct. Corresponding to the thrust of the eighth paragraph, farmers changed the landscape through various methods to develop agriculture.</p><p>E correct. Corresponding to the third paragraph, The new railroad networks shifted the direction of western trade. Chicago became the region's hub, linking the farms of the upper Midwest to New York and other eastern cities by more than 2,000 miles of track in 1855. Value of goods shipped by river to New Orleans continued to increase, the South's overall share of western trade dropped tap. The decline of water transport and the rise of rail transport boom.</p><p>F wrong. Positioning the sixth paragraph, Native Americans had grown corn in the region for years, but never in such large fields as did settlers who did become farmers, whose <span class="question11">surpluses</span> were shipped east. The first sentence of the paragraph was not related to new commercial farming, but did not mention that the variety was not good.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
