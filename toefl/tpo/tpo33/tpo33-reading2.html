Much of the new <span class="highlight">construction</span> during the 1850s occurred west of the Appalachian Mountains – over 2,000 miles in the states of Ohio and Illinois alone.</p><p>The effect of the new <span class="highlight">railroad</span> lines rippled outward <span class="highlight">through</span> the <span class="highlight">economy</span>. Farmers <span class="highlight">along</span> the tracks began to <span class="highlight">specialize</span> in <span class="highlight">corps</span> that they could <span class="highlight">market</span> in <span class="highlight">distant</span> locations. With their profits they purchased manufactured goods that earlier they might have made at home. Before the <span class="highlight">railroad</span> reached Tennessee, the <span class="highlight">state</span> produced about 25,000 bushels (or 640 tons) of wheat, which sold for less than 50 cents a bushel. Once the <span class="highlight">railroad</span> came, farmers in the same counties grew 400,000 bushels (over 10,000 tons) and sold their crop at a dollar a bushel.</p><p>The new <span class="highlight">railroad</span> networks shifted the direction of western <span class="highlight">trade</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> In 1840 most northwestern <span class="highlight">grain</span> was shipped south down the Mississippi River to the <span class="highlight"><span class="question3">bustling</span></span>port of New Orleans.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> But low water made <span class="highlight">steamboat</span> travel <span class="highlight">hazardous</span> in summer, and ice shut down traffic in winter. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>Products such as lard, tallow, and cheese quickly spoiled if stored in New Orleans' hot and 
 <span class="highlight">humid</span> warehouses. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span> Increasingly, traffic from the Midwest flowed west to east, over the new rail lines. Chicago became the <span class="highlight">region</span>'s hub, linking the farms of the upper Midwest to New York and 
 other eastern cities by more than 2,000 miles of <span class="highlight">track</span> in 1855. Thus while the value of goods shipped by river to New Orleans continued to increase, the South's <span class="highlight">overall</span> share of western <span class="highlight">trade</span> 
 dropped <span class="highlight">dramatically</span>.</p><p>A sharp rise in demand for <span class="highlight">grain</span><span class="highlight">abroad</span> also encouraged farmers in the Northeast and Midwest to become more commercially oriented. Wheat, which in 1845 commanded $1.08 a bushel in New York City, fetched $2.46 in 1855; in <span class="highlight">similar</span><span class="highlight">fashion</span> the price of corn nearly doubled. Farmers responded by specializing in cash crops, borrowing to <span class="highlight">purchase</span> more land, and investing in equipment to increase <span class="highlight">productivity</span>.</p><p>As <span class="highlight">railroad</span> lines fanned out from Chicago, farmers began to <span class="highlight">acquire</span> open <span class="highlight">prairie</span> land in Illinois and then Iowa, putting the <span class="highlight">fertile</span>, deep black soil into production. <span class="highlight">Commercial</span><span class="highlight">agriculture</span><span class="question7">transformed </span>this <span class="highlight">remarkable</span> treeless environment. To settlers <span class="highlight">accustomed</span> to eastern woodlands, the thousands of <span class="highlight">square</span> miles of tall grass were an <span class="highlight">awesome</span> sight. <span class="question9">Indian grass, Canada wild <span class="highlight">rye</span>, and native big bluestem all grew higher than a person. </span>Because eastern plows could not <span class="highlight">penetrate</span> the densely tangled roots of <span class="highlight">prairie</span> grass, the earliest settlers <span class="question8">erected </span>farms <span class="highlight">along</span> the <span class="highlight">boundary</span> separating the forest from the <span class="highlight">prairie</span>. In 1837, however, John Deere patented a sharp-cutting <span class="highlight">steel</span><span class="highlight">plow</span> that sliced <span class="highlight">through</span> the sod without soil sticking to the <span class="highlight">blade</span>. Cyrus McCormick <span class="highlight">refined</span> a <span class="highlight">mechanical</span> reaper that harvested fourteen times more wheat with the same <span class="highlight">amount</span> of labor. By the 1850s McCormick was selling 1,000 reapers a year and could not keep up with demand, while Deere turned out 10,000 plows annually.</p><p>The new <span class="highlight">commercial</span> farming fundamentally altered the Midwestern <span class="highlight">landscape</span> and the environment. Native Americans had grown corn in the <span class="highlight">region</span> for years, but never in such large fields as did later settlers who became farmers, whose <span class="question11">surpluses </span>were shipped east. <span class="highlight">Prairie</span> farmers also introduced new crops that were not part of the earlier <span class="highlight">ecological</span> system, <span class="highlight">notably</span> wheat, <span class="highlight">along</span> with fruits and vegetables. Native grasses were replaced by a small number of plants <span class="highlight">cultivated</span> as commodities. Corn had the best yields, but it was <span class="highlight">primarily</span> used to feed <span class="highlight">livestock</span>. Because bread played a key role in the American and European <span class="highlight">diet</span>, wheat became the <span class="highlight">major</span> cash crop. Tame grasses replaced native grasses in pastures for making <span class="highlight">hay</span>.</p><p>Western farmers altered the <span class="highlight">landscape</span> by reducing the <span class="highlight">annual</span> fires that had kept the <span class="highlight">prairie</span> free from trees. In the <span class="highlight">absence</span> of these fires, trees reappeared on land not in <span class="highlight">cultivation</span> and, if undisturbed, <span class="highlight">eventually</span> formed woodlots. The earlier unbroken <span class="highlight">landscape</span> gave way to <span class="highlight">independent</span> farms, each fenced off in a <span class="highlight">precise</span> checkerboard <span class="highlight">pattern</span>. It was an <span class="highlight">artificial</span><span class="highlight">ecosystem</span> of animals, woodlots, and crops, whose large, <span class="highlight">uniform</span><span class="highlight">layout</span> made western farms more <span class="highlight">efficient</span> than the more-irregular farms in the East.</p></article></div><div id="question"><div id="question1"><p>According to paragraph 1, each of the following is true about railroad track in the United States EXCEPT:</p><label class="my-label"><span>A.
