          </h4>

            <span class="highlight">Evidence</span> suggests that an important <span class="highlight">stimulus</span> behind the rise of early civilizations was the <span class="highlight">development</span> of settled <span class="highlight">agriculture</span>, which unleashed a <span class="highlight">series</span> of changes in the <span class="highlight">organization</span> of human communities that <span class="question1">culminated in</span> the rise of large <span class="highlight">ancient</span> empires.</p>
          <p>The <span class="highlight">exact</span> time and place that crops were first <span class="highlight">cultivated</span> successfully is uncertain. Many prehistorians believe that farming may have emerged in dependently in several different areas of the world when small communities, driven by increasing <span class="highlight">population</span> and a <span class="highlight">decline</span> in <span class="highlight">available</span> food resources, began to plant seeds in the ground in an effort to <span class="highlight">guarantee</span> their <span class="highlight">survival</span>. The first farmers, who may have lived as long as 10,000 years ago, <span class="question3">undoubtedly </span>used simple techniques and still relied <span class="highlight">primarily</span> on other forms of food production, such as hunting, foraging, or pastoralism. The real <span class="highlight">breakthrough</span> took place when farmers began to <span class="highlight">cultivate</span> crops <span class="highlight">along</span> the floodplains of river systems. The <span class="highlight">advantage</span> was that crops grown in such areas were not as dependent on <span class="highlight">rainfall</span> and <span class="highlight">therefore</span> produced a more <span class="highlight">reliable</span> <span class="highlight">harvest</span>. An <span class="highlight">additional</span> <span class="highlight">benefit</span> was that the <span class="highlight">sediment</span> carried by the river waters deposited nutrients in the soil, thus enabling the farmer to <span class="highlight">cultivate</span> a single <span class="highlight">plot</span> of ground for many years without moving to a new location. Thus, the first truly <span class="highlight">sedentary</span> (that is, nonmigratory) societies were born. As time went on, such communities <span class="highlight">gradually</span> learned how to direct the flow of water to <span class="highlight"><span class="question5">enhance</span> </span>the <span class="highlight">productive</span> <span class="highlight">capacity</span> of the land, while the <span class="highlight">introduction</span> of the iron <span class="highlight">plow</span> <span class="highlight">eventually</span> led to the <span class="highlight">cultivation</span> of heavy soils not <span class="highlight">previously</span> <span class="highlight">susceptible</span> to <span class="highlight">agriculture</span>.</p>
          <p>The <span class="highlight">spread</span> of this river <span class="highlight">valley</span> <span class="highlight">agriculture</span> in various parts of Asia and Africa was the decisive <span class="highlight">factor</span> in the rise of the first civilizations. The increase in food production in these regions led to a <span class="highlight">significant</span> growth in <span class="highlight">population</span>, while efforts to control the flow of water to maximize the <span class="highlight">irrigation</span> of <span class="highlight">cultivated</span> areas and to protect the <span class="highlight">local</span> inhabitants from <span class="highlight">hostile</span> forces outside the <span class="highlight">community</span> <span class="question6">provoked </span>the first steps toward <span class="highlight">cooperative</span> activities on a large <span class="highlight">scale</span>. The need to oversee the entire <span class="highlight">process</span> brought about the <span class="highlight">emergence</span> of an elite that was <span class="highlight">eventually</span> transformed into a <span class="highlight">government</span>.</p>
          <p>The first <span class="highlight">clear</span> steps in the rise of the first civilizations took place in the fourth and third <span class="highlight">millennia</span> B.C. in <span class="highlight">Mesopotamia</span>, northern Africa, India, and China. How the first governments took <span class="highlight">shape</span> in these areas is not certain, but anthropologists studying the <span class="highlight">evolution</span> of human communities in various parts of the world have discovered that one <span class="highlight">common</span> <span class="highlight">stage</span> in the <span class="highlight">process</span> is the <span class="highlight">emergence</span> of what are called "big men" <span class="highlight">within</span> a single village or a collection of villages. By means of their <span class="highlight">military</span> prowess, <span class="highlight">dominant</span> personalities, or <span class="highlight">political</span> talents, these people <span class="highlight">gradually</span> <span class="highlight">emerge</span> as the leaders of that <span class="highlight">community</span>. In time, the "big men" become <span class="highlight">formal</span> symbols of <span class="highlight">authority</span> and pass on that <span class="highlight">authority</span> to others <span class="highlight">within</span> their own family. As the communities continue to grow in size and <span class="highlight">material</span> wealth, the "big men" <span class="highlight">assume</span> <span class="highlight">hereditary</span> <span class="highlight">status</span>, and their allies and family members are transformed into a <span class="highlight">hereditary</span> monarchy.</p>
          <p>The <span class="highlight">appearance</span> of these <span class="highlight">sedentary</span> societies had a <span class="highlight">major</span> <span class="highlight">impact</span> on the social organizations, <span class="highlight">religious</span> beliefs, and way of life of the peoples living <span class="highlight">within</span> their boundaries. 
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>With the increase in <span class="highlight">population</span> and the <span class="highlight">development</span> of <span class="highlight">centralized</span> <span class="highlight">authority</span> came the <span class="highlight">emergence</span> of the cities.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span><span class="question10">While some of these <span class="highlight">urban</span> centers were identified with a <span class="highlight">particular</span> <span class="highlight">economic</span> <span class="highlight">function</span>, such as <span class="highlight">proximity</span> to gold or iron deposits or a <span class="highlight">strategic</span> location on a <span class="highlight">major</span> <span class="highlight">trade</span> <span class="highlight">route</span>, others served <span class="highlight">primarily</span> as administrative centers or the site of temples for the <span class="highlight">official</span> <span class="highlight">cult</span> or other <span class="highlight">ritual</span> observances. </span><span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span> <span class="highlight">Within</span> these cities,
new forms of <span class="highlight">livelihood</span> appeared to satisfy the growing need for social services and consumer goods. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>Some people became artisans or merchants, while others became warriors, scholars, or priests. In some cases, the <span class="highlight">physical</span> <span class="highlight">division</span> <span class="highlight">within</span> the first cities reflected the <span class="highlight">strict</span> <span class="highlight">hierarchical</span> <span class="highlight">character</span> of the society as a whole, with a royal palace surrounded by an imposing wall and <span class="highlight">separate</span> from the <span class="highlight">remainder</span> of the <span class="highlight">urban</span> <span class="highlight">population</span>. In other instances, such as the Indus River <span class="highlight">Valley</span>, the cities lacked a royal <span class="highlight">precinct</span> and the ostentatious palaces that <span class="highlight">marked</span> their contemporaries elsewhere.</p>
