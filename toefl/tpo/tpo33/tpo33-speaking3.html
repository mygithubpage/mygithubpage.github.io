          <h4 class="w3-center">Bicycle Borrowing Program It's great that the university has a program where students can borrow bicycles from the gym. However, two changes would make the program more convenient. First, the borrowing period should be shortened to four hours maximum so that more bikes would be available when students want to borrow them. Second, currently, students who borrow bikes have to leave a cash deposit, which is returned to them when they return the bikes, but I think students should be required to leave their student identification cards instead, so they don't have to remember to bring cash.</h4>

        <h3>Listening Text</h3>
        <article>
          <p>Now listen to two students discussing the letter.</p>
          <p>(woman) Hey, did you read that letter? What do you think?</p>
          <p>(man) Yeah, I read it. I understand what she's saying but I really don't agree with her suggestions.</p>
          <p>(woman) How come?</p>
          <p>(man) Well, students often need to borrow the bikes for longer periods of time, sometimes a whole day.</p>
          <p>(woman) What for?</p>
          <p>(man) Well, like, to do stuff off-campus, for instance, my friends and I on the weekends, sometimes we like to ride bikes to the state park outside of town and do some hiking there. And it basically takes a whole day. It's night time by the time when we get back.</p>
          <p>(woman) So if you had less time you wouldn't be able to do that.</p>
          <p>(man) Right, and also her other suggestion doesn't seem practical to me.</p>
          <p>(woman) The card thing?</p>
          <p>(man) Yeah, that's not gonna work. What if you want to enter a campus building? Even though you can get into most of the classroom buildings without a card, there are certain buildings on campus where you need to show your card to get in, like the library and dining hall.</p>
          <p>(woman) Yeah, that's true, so students wouldn't be able to go to any of those places till they got their cards back.</p>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>Well according to the proposal, the student is asking for two changes to make the university bicycle-borrowing-program more convenient. However the man disagrees with the proposal for two main reasons. First of all the man says that the students usually borrow the bikes for a longer time, sometimes for a whole day because they go off campus. For example the man usually rides with his friends out of town on weekends for some hiking and goes back late, so if they have less time they wouldn't be able to return their bikes. Second the man also points out that leaving students' ID is not a good idea either, simply because the students can not go to some other facilities on campus without their IDs, which means if one borrows a bike he or she can't be able to get access to like the library and dining hall, till he or she returns the bike. It is not at all convenient and practical. So the man disagrees with the letter for the reasons stated above. (172 words)</p>
