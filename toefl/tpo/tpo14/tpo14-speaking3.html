I disagree with this policy. I think students should be allowed to eat in class. This change would be good for two reasons. For one thing, if students were permitted to eat, they would be able to concentrate better, because students often get hungry during long classes, and hunger makes it difficult to concentrate. Also, if food were allowed in classroom, it would be possible for us to have in-class parties on the last day of class – with snack foods and beverages – to celebrate the end of each semester.

It will interfere with everyone's concentration. You wouldn't be able to pay attention with all the noises going on.</p><p>(woman) OK, I guess I will have to agree with you on that, but what about her other reason? It would be nice to be able to have some fun at the end of the semester, right?</p><p>(man) No, there's a problem with that, too.</p><p>(woman) Why?</p><p>(man) Well, I don't think it's appropriate to use class time for that kind of thing. I mean, the last class is usually pretty important, that's when we do a lot of reviewing for final exams.</p><p>(woman) True!</p><p>(man) If we use that time for that, we probably wouldn't have time to do as much reviewing, which means we wouldn't be as well prepared for exams.</p><p>(woman) Yeah, I haven't thought of that.</p></article></section><section id="question"><h4>Question</h4><p>The man expresses his opinion about the proposal in the newspaper. Briefly summarize the proposal, then state the man's opinion and explain the reasons he gives for holding that opinion. </p></section><section id="sample-response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><article><p>Well, the proposal says that the students should be allowed to eat in their classrooms for two reasons: first eating in the classroom will help students concentrate, and second people could take food to the classroom for a party on the last day of class. However the man disagrees with the proposal for two main reasons. For one thing, he holds the opinion that eating in the classroom will be so distracting that students just won't get concentrated at all while listening to the munching, biting, or crinkling around. He thinks eating in the classroom is indeed bothering for the students who needs concentration. Also, he argues that students won't have time for the in-class party since the last class is usually important and they couldn't afford to waste time parting instead of getting ready for the finals. So the man disagrees with the proposal. (145 words)</p></article></section></main></body></html>
