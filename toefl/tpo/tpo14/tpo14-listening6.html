            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.48" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in an archeology class.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.03" data-time="4.48">[00:04.48]</span>
              <span class="underline">Female</span> Professor: When we think of large <span class="underline">monumental</span> structures built by early societies, an Egyptian <span class="underline">pyramid</span> probably comes to <span class="underline">mind</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.65" data-time="12.51">[00:12.51]</span>But there are some <span class="underline">even</span> earlier structures in the British Isles also <span class="underline">worth</span> discussing. <span class="time" data-times="10.5" data-time="18.16">[00:18.16]</span>And <span class="underline">besides</span> the well-known Circle of <span class="underline">Mass</span> of Stones of Stonehenge, which don't get me wrong is <span class="underline">remarkable</span> enough, well, other <span class="underline">impressive</span> <span class="underline">Neolithic</span> structures are found there, too.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="12.54" data-time="28.66">[00:28.66]</span>Oh, yes, we're talking about the <span class="underline">Neolithic</span> period here, also called the New Stone Age, which was the time before stone tools began to be replaced by tools made of <span class="underline">bronze</span> and other metals. <span class="time" data-times="15.07" data-time="41.2">[00:41.20]</span>It was about five thousand years ago, <span class="underline">even</span> before the first Egyptian <span class="underline">pyramid</span>; that's some amazing <span class="underline">Neolithic</span> monuments, tombs were erected at various sites around Ireland, Great Britain and coastal islands nearby.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="19.33" data-time="56.27">[00:56.27]</span>I am referring, in <span class="underline">particular</span>, to structures that, in some cases, look like ordinary natural hills but were <span class="underline">definitely</span> built by humans, well-organized communities of humans, to <span class="underline">enclose</span> a <span class="underline">chamber</span> or a room <span class="underline">within</span> stone walls, and sometimes with a high, cleverly designed ceiling of overlapping stones. <span class="time" data-times="11.91" data-time="75.6">[01:15.60]</span>These structures are called <span class="underline">Passage</span> Graves, because the <span class="underline">inner</span> <span class="underline">chamber</span>, sometimes several chambers in fact, could only be entered from outside <span class="underline">through</span> a narrow <span class="underline">passage</span> way.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.77" data-time="87.51">[01:27.51]</span>
              <span class="underline">Male</span> Student: Excuse me, professor, but you said <span class="underline">passage</span> graves, were these just monuments to honor the dead buried there? <span class="time" data-times="3.25" data-time="95.28">[01:35.28]</span>Or were they designed to be used, somehow, by the living.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.1" data-time="98.53">[01:38.53]</span>Professor: Ah, yes! Good question, Michael. <span class="time" data-times="16.82" data-time="100.63">[01:40.63]</span> <span class="underline">Besides</span> being built as tombs, some of these <span class="underline">passage</span> graves were <span class="underline">definitely</span> what we might call <span class="underline">Astronomical</span> Calendars, with chambers that were flooded with sunlight on certain <span class="underline">special</span> days of the year, which must have seemed <span class="underline">miraculous</span> and inspired a good <span class="underline">deal</span> of <span class="underline">religious</span> <span class="underline">wonder</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.83" data-time="117.45">[01:57.45]</span>But research indicates that not just light but also the physics of <span class="underline">sound</span> helped enhanced these <span class="underline">religious</span> experiences.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="0.73" data-time="126.28">[02:06.28]</span>Student: How so?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.98" data-time="127.01">[02:07.01]</span>Professor: Well, first the echoes. <span class="time" data-times="12.35" data-time="128.99">[02:08.99]</span>When a <span class="underline">religious</span> leader started chanting, with echoes bouncing off the stone walls over and over again, it must have seemed like a whole <span class="underline">chorus</span> of other voices, spirits of gods maybe joining in.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.85" data-time="141.34">[02:21.34]</span>But <span class="underline">even</span> more <span class="underline">intriguing</span> is what physicists called Standing Waves. <span class="time" data-times="10.77" data-time="148.19">[02:28.19]</span>Basically, the phenomena of standing waves occurs when <span class="underline">sound</span> waves of the same <span class="underline">frequency</span> <span class="underline">reflect</span> off the walls and meet from <span class="underline">opposite</span> directions. <span class="time" data-times="5.79" data-time="158.96">[02:38.96]</span>So the <span class="underline">volume</span> seems to <span class="underline">alternate</span> between very loud and very <span class="underline">soft</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.46" data-time="164.75">[02:44.75]</span>You can stand quite near a man singing in a loud voice and <span class="underline">hardly</span> hear him. <span class="time" data-times="4.18" data-time="170.21">[02:50.21]</span>Yet, step a little further away, and his voice is almost deafening.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.68" data-time="174.39">[02:54.39]</span>As you move around the <span class="underline">chamber</span>, the <span class="underline">volume</span> of the <span class="underline">sound</span> goes way up and way down depending on where you are in these standing waves. <span class="time" data-times="5.53" data-time="184.07">[03:04.07]</span>And often the acoustics make it hard to <span class="underline">identify</span> where sounds are coming from. <span class="time" data-times="6.68" data-time="189.6">[03:09.60]</span>It's as if powerful voices are speaking to you, or chanting from inside your own head. <span class="time" data-times="4.94" data-time="196.28">[03:16.28]</span>This had to <span class="underline">engender</span> a powerful <span class="underline">sense</span> of awe in <span class="underline">Neolithic</span> worshipers.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.02" data-time="201.22">[03:21.22]</span>And another bit of physics at play here is something called <span class="underline">resonance</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.75" data-time="206.24">[03:26.24]</span>I'm no physicist but, well, I imagine you've all blown <span class="underline">air</span> over the top of an empty bottle and heard the <span class="underline">sound</span> it makes. <span class="time" data-times="8.09" data-time="212.99">[03:32.99]</span>And you've probably noticed that, depending on its size, each empty bottle plays one <span class="underline">particular</span> <span class="underline">musical</span> note.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.42" data-time="221.08">[03:41.08]</span>Or as a physicist might put it, each bottle resonates at a <span class="underline">particular</span> <span class="underline">frequency</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.46" data-time="227.5">[03:47.50]</span>Well, that's true of these chambers, too. <span class="time" data-times="13.74" data-time="229.96">[03:49.96]</span>If you make a <span class="underline">constant</span> noise inside the <span class="underline">chamber</span>, maybe by steadily beating a drum at a certain <span class="underline">rate</span>, a <span class="underline">particular</span> <span class="underline">frequency</span> of <span class="underline">sound</span> will <span class="underline">resonate</span>, will ring out intensely depending on the size of the <span class="underline">chamber</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.82" data-time="243.7">[04:03.70]</span>In some of the larger chambers, though, this intensified <span class="underline">sound</span> maybe too deep for us to hear. <span class="time" data-times="7.79" data-time="249.52">[04:09.52]</span>We can feel it, we're mysteriously agitated by it, but it's not a <span class="underline">sound</span> our ears can hear! <span class="time" data-times="10.55" data-time="257.31">[04:17.31]</span>The psychological effects of all these <span class="underline">extraordinary</span> sounds can be <span class="underline">profound</span>, especially when they <span class="underline">seem</span> so disconnected from the human doing the drumming or chanting.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.09" data-time="267.86">[04:27.86]</span>And there can be observable <span class="underline">physical</span> effects on people, too. <span class="time" data-times="6.83" data-time="271.95">[04:31.95]</span>In fact, the sounds can cause headaches, feeling of dizziness, increased heart <span class="underline">rate</span>, that <span class="underline">sort</span> of thing, you see. <span class="time" data-times="12.92" data-time="278.78">[04:38.78]</span>Anyway, what was experienced inside one of these <span class="underline">passage</span> graves clearly could be far more <span class="underline">intense</span> than the everyday reality outside, which made them very <span class="underline">special</span> places.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.59" data-time="291.7">[04:51.70]</span>But back to your question, Michael, as to whether these graves were designed to be used by the living, well, certainly with regard to <span class="underline">astronomical</span> or <span class="underline">calendar</span> <span class="underline">function</span> that seems <span class="underline">pretty</span> <span class="underline">obvious</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="302.29">[05:02.29]</span>And I <span class="underline">wanna</span> go into more <span class="underline">detail</span> on that now.</p>
