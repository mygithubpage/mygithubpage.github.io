Good question, Michael. <span class="time" data-times="16.82" data-time="100.63">[01:40.63]</span><span class="highlight">Besides</span> being built as tombs, some of these <span class="highlight">passage</span> graves were <span class="highlight">definitely</span> what we might call <span class="highlight">Astronomical</span> Calendars, with chambers that were flooded with sunlight on certain <span class="highlight">special</span> days of the year, which must have seemed <span class="highlight">miraculous</span> and inspired a good <span class="highlight">deal</span> of <span class="highlight">religious</span><span class="highlight">wonder</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.83" data-time="117.45">[01:57.45]</span>But research indicates that not just light but also the physics of <span class="highlight">sound</span> helped enhanced these <span class="highlight">religious</span> experiences.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="0.73" data-time="126.28">[02:06.28]</span>Student: How so?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="1.98" data-time="127.01">[02:07.01]</span>Professor: Well, first the echoes. <span class="time" data-times="12.35" data-time="128.99">[02:08.99]</span>When a <span class="highlight">religious</span> leader started chanting, with echoes bouncing off the stone walls over and over again, it must have seemed like a whole <span class="highlight">chorus</span> of other voices, spirits of gods maybe joining in.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.85" data-time="141.34">[02:21.34]</span>But <span class="highlight">even</span> more <span class="highlight">intriguing</span> is what physicists called Standing Waves. <span class="time" data-times="10.77" data-time="148.19">[02:28.19]</span>Basically, the phenomena of standing waves occurs when <span class="highlight">sound</span> waves of the same <span class="highlight">frequency</span><span class="highlight">reflect</span> off the walls and meet from <span class="highlight">opposite</span> directions. <span class="time" data-times="5.79" data-time="158.96">[02:38.96]</span>So the <span class="highlight">volume</span> seems to <span class="highlight">alternate</span> between very loud and very <span class="highlight">soft</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.46" data-time="164.75">[02:44.75]</span>You can stand quite near a man singing in a loud voice and <span class="highlight">hardly</span> hear him. <span class="time" data-times="4.18" data-time="170.21">[02:50.21]</span>Yet, step a little further away, and his voice is almost deafening.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="9.68" data-time="174.39">[02:54.39]</span>As you move around the <span class="highlight">chamber</span>, the <span class="highlight">volume</span> of the <span class="highlight">sound</span> goes way up and way down depending on where you are in these standing waves. <span class="time" data-times="5.53" data-time="184.07">[03:04.07]</span>And often the acoustics make it hard to <span class="highlight">identify</span> where sounds are coming from. <span class="time" data-times="6.68" data-time="189.6">[03:09.60]</span>It's as if powerful voices are speaking to you, or chanting from inside your own head. <span class="time" data-times="4.94" data-time="196.28">[03:16.28]</span>This had to <span class="highlight">engender</span> a powerful <span class="highlight">sense</span> of awe in <span class="highlight">Neolithic</span> worshipers.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.02" data-time="201.22">[03:21.22]</span>And another bit of physics at play here is something called <span class="highlight">resonance</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.75" data-time="206.24">[03:26.24]</span>I'm no physicist but, well, I imagine you've all blown <span class="highlight">air</span> over the top of an empty bottle and heard the <span class="highlight">sound</span> it makes. <span class="time" data-times="8.09" data-time="212.99">[03:32.99]</span>And you've probably noticed that, depending on its size, each empty bottle plays one <span class="highlight">particular</span><span class="highlight">musical</span> note.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.42" data-time="221.08">[03:41.08]</span>Or as a physicist might put it, each bottle resonates at a <span class="highlight">particular</span><span class="highlight">frequency</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.46" data-time="227.5">[03:47.50]</span>Well, that's true of these chambers, too. <span class="time" data-times="13.74" data-time="229.96">[03:49.96]</span>If you make a <span class="highlight">constant</span> noise inside the <span class="highlight">chamber</span>, maybe by steadily beating a drum at a certain <span class="highlight">rate</span>, a <span class="highlight">particular</span><span class="highlight">frequency</span> of <span class="highlight">sound</span> will <span class="highlight">resonate</span>, will ring out intensely depending on the size of the <span class="highlight">chamber</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.82" data-time="243.7">[04:03.70]</span>In some of the larger chambers, though, this intensified <span class="highlight">sound</span> maybe too deep for us to hear. <span class="time" data-times="7.79" data-time="249.52">[04:09.52]</span>We can feel it, we're mysteriously agitated by it, but it's not a <span class="highlight">sound</span> our ears can hear! <span class="time" data-times="10.55" data-time="257.31">[04:17.31]</span>The psychological effects of all these <span class="highlight">extraordinary</span> sounds can be <span class="highlight">profound</span>, especially when they <span class="highlight">seem</span> so disconnected from the human doing the drumming or chanting.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.09" data-time="267.86">[04:27.86]</span>And there can be observable <span class="highlight">physical</span> effects on people, too. <span class="time" data-times="6.83" data-time="271.95">[04:31.95]</span>In fact, the sounds can cause headaches, feeling of dizziness, increased heart <span class="highlight">rate</span>, that <span class="highlight">sort</span> of thing, you see. <span class="time" data-times="12.92" data-time="278.78">[04:38.78]</span>Anyway, what was experienced inside one of these <span class="highlight">passage</span> graves clearly could be far more <span class="highlight">intense</span> than the everyday reality outside, which made them very <span class="highlight">special</span> places.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="10.59" data-time="291.7">[04:51.70]</span>But back to your question, Michael, as to whether these graves were designed to be used by the living, well, certainly with regard to <span class="highlight">astronomical</span> or <span class="highlight">calendar</span><span class="highlight">function</span> that seems <span class="highlight">pretty</span><span class="highlight">obvious</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="302.29">[05:02.29]</span>And I <span class="highlight">wanna</span> go into more <span class="highlight">detail</span> on that now.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor mainly discuss?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The role of physics in the discovery of Neolithic religious sites.</p><p>B. The sound effects that Neolithic people could experience in passage graves.</p><p>C. Evidence that passage graves were designed to function as calendars.</p><p>D. A debate about the role of sound in passage grave ceremonies.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The full text discusses passage graves and proposes several acoustic phenomena, so the answer is B.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor mention an Egyptian pyramid?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To contrast its purpose with that of monuments found in the British Isles.</p><p>B. To compare the architectural styles of two Neolithic cultures.</p><p>C. To describe the outer shape of passage graves in Great Britain and Ireland.</p><p>D. To help students understand how long ago passage graves were built.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>When we think of large monumental structures built by early societies, an Egyptian pyramid probably comes to mind</p><p>The article clearly mentions that pass grave existed about 5,000 years ago. Compared with the Pyramid, it is still older than the oldest pyramid. Therefore, how long ago in the D option and this echo.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor,what is one effect produced by standing waves in a passage grave chamber?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Light fills the chamber on certain days of the year.</p><p>B. Drums resonate loudly without being played by humans.</p><p>C. The floor and walls of the chamber seem to shake.</p><p>D. The intensity of sound varies greatly throughout the chamber.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>As you move around the chamber, the volume of the sound goes way up and way down, depending on where you are in these standing waves.</p><p>After proposing the concept of standing waves, the professor said that So, the volume seems to alternate between very loud and very soft. So later put forward a small conclusion about SW: the volume will change. The answer for D is synonymous, so it is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor mention a bottle?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To illustrate the shape of the interior of a passage grave</p><p>B. To describe part of a Neolithic burial ceremony</p><p>C. To help explain how resonance is produced</p><p>D. To give an example of an artifact found in a Neolithic site</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>I am no physicist, but well I imagine you have all blown air over the top of an empty bottle and heard the sound it makes.</p><p>After the completion of the resonance, the professor mentioned the bottle as an example. It is obviously to illustrate how the resonance was generated.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor,what characteristic of passage graves has led researchers to the conclusion that they were intentionally designed for use by the living?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Their location in the ceremonial areas of Neolithic communities</p><p>B. Their ability to function as astronomical calendars</p><p>C. The structure of their high ceilings</p><p>D. The remains of drums found in their chambers</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>But back to your question, Michael, as to dirty these Graves were designed to be used by the living. Well, certainly, with regard to astronomical or calendar function.</p><p>The pretty obvious affirmation in Passage Graves has the function of astronomical calendar.</p></div></div><div class="replay" id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor imply when she says this:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. She is confident that no more examples should be necessary.</p><p>B. She is eager to find out whether the students can provide other examples.</p><p>C. She wonders whether her explanation may be too difficult to understand.</p><p>D. She is surprised that her students have understood her point so quickly.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>Severe hearing is equivalent to "etc." or "and so on," which means that you don't have to go into details.
