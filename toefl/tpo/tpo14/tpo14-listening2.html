lecture in a <span class="highlight">psychology</span> class. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="11.34" data-time="5.42">[00:05.42]</span><span class="highlight">Female</span> Professor: We've said that the <span class="highlight">term</span> "<span class="highlight">cognition</span>" refers to <span class="highlight">mental</span> states like knowing and believing, and to <span class="highlight">mental</span> processes we use to arrive at those states. <span class="time" data-times="5.6" data-time="16.76">[00:16.76]</span>So, for example, reasoning is a <span class="highlight">cognitive</span><span class="highlight">process</span>, so is <span class="highlight">perception</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.52" data-time="22.36">[00:22.36]</span>We use information that we <span class="highlight">perceive</span><span class="highlight">through</span> our senses to help us make decisions, to arrive at beliefs and so on. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="8.1" data-time="29.88">[00:29.88]</span>And then there are memory and imagination which <span class="highlight">relate</span> to the knowledge of things that happen in the past or may happen in the future. <span class="time" data-times="8.57" data-time="37.98">[00:37.98]</span>So, perceiving, remembering, imagining are all <span class="highlight">internal</span><span class="highlight">mental</span> processes that <span class="highlight">lead</span> to knowing or believing. <span class="time" data-times="7.89" data-time="46.55">[00:46.55]</span>Yet, each of these processes has limitations and can <span class="highlight">lead</span> us to hold mistaken beliefs or make false predictions. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="1.67" data-time="54.44">[00:54.44]</span>Take memory for example. <span class="time" data-times="5.2" data-time="56.11">[00:56.11]</span>Maybe you've heard of studies in which people hear a <span class="highlight">list</span> of related words. <span class="time" data-times="8.02" data-time="61.31">[01:01.31]</span>Um, let's say a <span class="highlight">list</span> of different kinds of fruit, after hearing this <span class="highlight">list</span>, they're presented with several <span class="highlight">additional</span> words. <span class="time" data-times="4.26" data-time="69.33">[01:09.33]</span>In this case, we'll say the <span class="highlight">additional</span> words were "<span class="highlight">blanket</span>" and "cherry". <span class="time" data-times="3.16" data-time="73.59">[01:13.59]</span>Neither of these words was on the <span class="highlight">original</span><span class="highlight">list</span>. <span class="time" data-times="10.29" data-time="76.75">[01:16.75]</span>And while people will <span class="highlight">claim</span> correctly that "<span class="highlight">blanket</span>" was not on the <span class="highlight">original</span><span class="highlight">list</span>, they'll also <span class="highlight">claim</span> incorrectly that the word "cherry" was on the <span class="highlight">list</span>. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.96" data-time="87.04">[01:27.04]</span>Most people are convinced they heard the word "cherry" on the <span class="highlight">original</span><span class="highlight">list</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.25" data-time="92">[01:32.00]</span>Why did they make such a simple mistake? <span class="time" data-times="8.57" data-time="94.25">[01:34.25]</span>Well, we think because the words on the <span class="highlight">list</span> were so closely related, the brain stored only the gist of what it heard. <span class="time" data-times="4.28" data-time="102.82">[01:42.82]</span>For example, that all the items on the <span class="highlight">list</span> were types of fruit. <span class="time" data-times="8.27" data-time="107.1">[01:47.10]</span>When we tap our memory, our brains often fill in details and quite often these details are actually false. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.57" data-time="115.37">[01:55.37]</span>We also see this fill-in <span class="highlight">phenomenon</span> with <span class="highlight">perception</span>. <span class="time" data-times="10.31" data-time="119.94">[01:59.94]</span><span class="highlight">Perception</span> is the <span class="highlight">faculty</span> that allows us to <span class="highlight">process</span> information in the present, as we take it in via our senses. <span class="time" data-times="8.04" data-time="130.25">[02:10.25]</span>Again, studies have shown that people will fill in information that they thought they perceived <span class="highlight">even</span> when they didn't. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.63" data-time="138.29">[02:18.29]</span>For example, experiments have been done where a person hears a sentence but that's missing the word that logically completes it. <span class="time" data-times="3.76" data-time="145.92">[02:25.92]</span>They'll <span class="highlight">claim</span> to hear that word <span class="highlight">even</span> though it was never said. <span class="time" data-times="6.12" data-time="149.68">[02:29.68]</span>So, if I were to say, uh, "The Sun rises in the" and then fail to complete the sentence. <span class="time" data-times="3.8" data-time="155.8">[02:35.80]</span>People will often <span class="highlight">claim</span> to have heard the word "east". </p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.68" data-time="159.6">[02:39.60]</span>In <span class="highlight">Cognitive</span><span class="highlight">Psychology</span>, we have a phrase for this kind of inaccurate filling-in of details. <span class="time" data-times="2.27" data-time="165.28">[02:45.28]</span>It's called a <span class="highlight">blind</span><span class="highlight">spot</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.88" data-time="167.55">[02:47.55]</span>The <span class="highlight">term</span> originally <span class="highlight">refer</span> to the place in our eyes where the optic nerve connects the back of the eye to the brain. <span class="time" data-times="4.56" data-time="174.43">[02:54.43]</span>There are no photo receptors in the area where the nerve connects to the eye. <span class="time" data-times="4.89" data-time="178.99">[02:58.99]</span>So that <span class="highlight">particular</span> area of the eye is incapable of detecting images. <span class="time" data-times="3.24" data-time="183.88">[03:03.88]</span>It produces a <span class="highlight">blind</span><span class="highlight">spot</span> in our <span class="highlight">field</span> of <span class="highlight">vision</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.6" data-time="187.12">[03:07.12]</span>We aren't <span class="highlight">aware</span> of it because the brain fills in what it thinks belongs in the <span class="highlight">image</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.96" data-time="192.72">[03:12.72]</span>So the picture always appears complete to us. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.6" data-time="195.68">[03:15.68]</span>But the <span class="highlight">term</span><span class="highlight">blind</span><span class="highlight">spot</span> has also taken on a more general meaning. <span class="time" data-times="5.65" data-time="200.28">[03:20.28]</span>It refers to people being unaware of a <span class="highlight">bias</span> that may <span class="highlight">affect</span> their judgment about a <span class="highlight">subject</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.6" data-time="205.93">[03:25.93]</span>And the same <span class="highlight">blind</span><span class="highlight">spot</span><span class="highlight">phenomenon</span> that affects memory and <span class="highlight">perception</span> also affects imagination. <span class="time" data-times="6.19" data-time="212.53">[03:32.53]</span>Imagination is a <span class="highlight">faculty</span> that some people use to <span class="highlight">anticipate</span> future events in their lives. <span class="time" data-times="7.53" data-time="218.72">[03:38.72]</span>But the <span class="highlight">ease</span> with which we imagine details can <span class="highlight">lead</span> to unrealistic expectations and can <span class="highlight">bias</span> our decisions. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.47" data-time="226.25">[03:46.25]</span>So, um, Peter, <span class="highlight">suppose</span> I ask you to imagine a lunch salad, no problem, right? <span class="time" data-times="3.19" data-time="233.72">[03:53.72]</span>But I <span class="highlight">bet</span> you'd imagine <span class="highlight">specific</span> ingredients. <span class="time" data-times="5.33" data-time="236.91">[03:56.91]</span>Did yours have tomatoes? Onion? Lettuce? <span class="highlight">Mine</span> did. <span class="time" data-times="17.23" data-time="242.24">[04:02.24]</span>Our brains fill in all sorts of details that might not be part of other people's <span class="highlight">image</span> of the salad, which could <span class="highlight">lead</span> to disappointment for us if the next time we order a salad in a restaurant we have our imagined salad in <span class="highlight">mind</span> that's not necessarily what we'll get on our <span class="highlight">plate</span>. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.12" data-time="259.47">[04:19.47]</span>The problem is not that we imagine things but that we <span class="highlight">assume</span> what we've imagined is <span class="highlight">accurate</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="265.59">[04:25.59]</span>We should be <span class="highlight">aware</span> that our imagination has this built-in feature "the <span class="highlight">blind</span><span class="highlight">spot</span>", which makes our predictions fall short of reality. </p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the lecture mainly about?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The differences between imagination and perception.</p><p>B. Cognitive functions that improve decision making.</p><p>C. Cognitive functions that assist in problem solving.</p><p>D. Common limitations with regard to several cognitive functions.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>Yet, each of these processes has limitations and can lead us to hold mistaken beliefs or make false predictions</p><p>At the beginning of the lecture, it has been suggested that the perception is flawed. Take memory for example to start a specific discussion and examples.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor mention a study with a word list?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To illustrate a type of mistake that people make when recalling details.</p><p>B. To offer an example of a well-designed study in cognitive psychology.</p><p>C. To demonstrate the limited effect imagination has on memory.</p><p>D. To prove that imagination leads to poor decision making.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>When we tap our memory, our brains often fill in details and often often these details are actually false.</p><p>To illustrate the above point of view, before mentioning the memory of the word list, the professor put forward: "Yet, each of these processes has limitations, and can lead us to hold mistaken believes or make false predictions." The purpose of the example is also to show that people make wrong judgments.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What was demonstrated by the study on perception that the professor mentions?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. People who misheard sentences were most likely to make poor decisions.</p><p>B. Decision making is ultimately influenced by many factors.</p><p>C. The brain can automatically supply details that were not actually perceived.</p><p>D. Words that are heard last are the most easily remembered.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Again, studies have shown that people would fill in information that they thought they perceived even when they didn`t.</p><p>The brain automatically fills in missing information in the blind spot, which is the missing word in the sentence in the example, such as east.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor mention the area where the optic nerve connects to the back of the eye?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To explain why many people do not understand the concept of blind spots.</p><p>B. To illustrate how visual blind spots interfere with the processing of written words.</p><p>C. To explain the origin of a concept that is used in the study of cognition.</p><p>D. To show how visual perception works.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The term originally refers to the place in our eyes where the optic nerve connects the back of the eye to the brain.</p><p>When it comes to the noun "blind spot," the professor mentioned the origin of the word, which is the blind spot of the human eye, so the answer is C.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What point does the professor make about imagination?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It is inadequate for accurately predicting future events.</p><p>B. It is difficult to study with experiments.</p><p>C. It is a process that is unrelated to perception or memory.</p><p>D. It is a relatively new area of study in cognition.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>We should be aware that our imagination has this built-in feature, the blind spot, which makes our predictions fall short of reality.</p><p>When talking about imagination, the professor said: "But the ease with which we imagine more can lead to unrealistic expectations and can bias our decisions." That is, the existence of imagination will affect our prediction of the future and make us produce certain results. The degree of prejudice ultimately affects our decision-making.</p></div></div><div class="replay" id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor say this:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To find out if Peter followed her instructions</p><p>B. To illustrate a point she wants to make about imagination</p><p>C. To point out that all salads have some ingredients in common</p><p>D. To show the relation between memory and imagination</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Did yours have tomatoes, onion, lettuce? Mine did.</p><p>The professor asked one of the students to imagine a salad to support his previously mentioned opinion on the influence of imagination, so the answer was B. This example is originally fictional and has nothing to do with memory, so D is wrong. This sentence is not to confirm whether the student is attending class and A is wrong. The C option has nothing to do.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
