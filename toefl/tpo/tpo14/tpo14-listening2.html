lecture in a <span class="highlight">psychology</span> class. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="11.34" data-time="5.42">[00:05.42]</span><span class="highlight">Female</span> Professor: We've said that the <span class="highlight">term</span> "<span class="highlight">cognition</span>" refers to <span class="highlight">mental</span> states like knowing and believing, and to <span class="highlight">mental</span> processes we use to arrive at those states. <span class="time" data-times="5.6" data-time="16.76">[00:16.76]</span>So, for example, reasoning is a <span class="highlight">cognitive</span><span class="highlight">process</span>, so is <span class="highlight">perception</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.52" data-time="22.36">[00:22.36]</span>We use information that we <span class="highlight">perceive</span><span class="highlight">through</span> our senses to help us make decisions, to arrive at beliefs and so on. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="8.1" data-time="29.88">[00:29.88]</span>And then there are memory and imagination which <span class="highlight">relate</span> to the knowledge of things that happen in the past or may happen in the future. <span class="time" data-times="8.57" data-time="37.98">[00:37.98]</span>So, perceiving, remembering, imagining are all <span class="highlight">internal</span><span class="highlight">mental</span> processes that <span class="highlight">lead</span> to knowing or believing. <span class="time" data-times="7.89" data-time="46.55">[00:46.55]</span>Yet, each of these processes has limitations and can <span class="highlight">lead</span> us to hold mistaken beliefs or make false predictions. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="1.67" data-time="54.44">[00:54.44]</span>Take memory for example. <span class="time" data-times="5.2" data-time="56.11">[00:56.11]</span>Maybe you've heard of studies in which people hear a <span class="highlight">list</span> of related words. <span class="time" data-times="8.02" data-time="61.31">[01:01.31]</span>Um, let's say a <span class="highlight">list</span> of different kinds of fruit, after hearing this <span class="highlight">list</span>, they're presented with several <span class="highlight">additional</span> words. <span class="time" data-times="4.26" data-time="69.33">[01:09.33]</span>In this case, we'll say the <span class="highlight">additional</span> words were "<span class="highlight">blanket</span>" and "cherry". <span class="time" data-times="3.16" data-time="73.59">[01:13.59]</span>Neither of these words was on the <span class="highlight">original</span><span class="highlight">list</span>. <span class="time" data-times="10.29" data-time="76.75">[01:16.75]</span>And while people will <span class="highlight">claim</span> correctly that "<span class="highlight">blanket</span>" was not on the <span class="highlight">original</span><span class="highlight">list</span>, they'll also <span class="highlight">claim</span> incorrectly that the word "cherry" was on the <span class="highlight">list</span>. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.96" data-time="87.04">[01:27.04]</span>Most people are convinced they heard the word "cherry" on the <span class="highlight">original</span><span class="highlight">list</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.25" data-time="92">[01:32.00]</span>Why did they make such a simple mistake? <span class="time" data-times="8.57" data-time="94.25">[01:34.25]</span>Well, we think because the words on the <span class="highlight">list</span> were so closely related, the brain stored only the gist of what it heard. <span class="time" data-times="4.28" data-time="102.82">[01:42.82]</span>For example, that all the items on the <span class="highlight">list</span> were types of fruit. <span class="time" data-times="8.27" data-time="107.1">[01:47.10]</span>When we tap our memory, our brains often fill in details and quite often these details are actually false. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.57" data-time="115.37">[01:55.37]</span>We also see this fill-in <span class="highlight">phenomenon</span> with <span class="highlight">perception</span>. <span class="time" data-times="10.31" data-time="119.94">[01:59.94]</span><span class="highlight">Perception</span> is the <span class="highlight">faculty</span> that allows us to <span class="highlight">process</span> information in the present, as we take it in via our senses. <span class="time" data-times="8.04" data-time="130.25">[02:10.25]</span>Again, studies have shown that people will fill in information that they thought they perceived <span class="highlight">even</span> when they didn't. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.63" data-time="138.29">[02:18.29]</span>For example, experiments have been done where a person hears a sentence but that's missing the word that logically completes it. <span class="time" data-times="3.76" data-time="145.92">[02:25.92]</span>They'll <span class="highlight">claim</span> to hear that word <span class="highlight">even</span> though it was never said. <span class="time" data-times="6.12" data-time="149.68">[02:29.68]</span>So, if I were to say, uh, "The Sun rises in the" and then fail to complete the sentence. <span class="time" data-times="3.8" data-time="155.8">[02:35.80]</span>People will often <span class="highlight">claim</span> to have heard the word "east". </p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.68" data-time="159.6">[02:39.60]</span>In <span class="highlight">Cognitive</span><span class="highlight">Psychology</span>, we have a phrase for this kind of inaccurate filling-in of details. <span class="time" data-times="2.27" data-time="165.28">[02:45.28]</span>It's called a <span class="highlight">blind</span><span class="highlight">spot</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.88" data-time="167.55">[02:47.55]</span>The <span class="highlight">term</span> originally <span class="highlight">refer</span> to the place in our eyes where the optic nerve connects the back of the eye to the brain. <span class="time" data-times="4.56" data-time="174.43">[02:54.43]</span>There are no photo receptors in the area where the nerve connects to the eye. <span class="time" data-times="4.89" data-time="178.99">[02:58.99]</span>So that <span class="highlight">particular</span> area of the eye is incapable of detecting images. <span class="time" data-times="3.24" data-time="183.88">[03:03.88]</span>It produces a <span class="highlight">blind</span><span class="highlight">spot</span> in our <span class="highlight">field</span> of <span class="highlight">vision</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.6" data-time="187.12">[03:07.12]</span>We aren't <span class="highlight">aware</span> of it because the brain fills in what it thinks belongs in the <span class="highlight">image</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.96" data-time="192.72">[03:12.72]</span>So the picture always appears complete to us. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.6" data-time="195.68">[03:15.68]</span>But the <span class="highlight">term</span><span class="highlight">blind</span><span class="highlight">spot</span> has also taken on a more general meaning. <span class="time" data-times="5.65" data-time="200.28">[03:20.28]</span>It refers to people being unaware of a <span class="highlight">bias</span> that may <span class="highlight">affect</span> their judgment about a <span class="highlight">subject</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.6" data-time="205.93">[03:25.93]</span>And the same <span class="highlight">blind</span><span class="highlight">spot</span><span class="highlight">phenomenon</span> that affects memory and <span class="highlight">perception</span> also affects imagination. <span class="time" data-times="6.19" data-time="212.53">[03:32.53]</span>Imagination is a <span class="highlight">faculty</span> that some people use to <span class="highlight">anticipate</span> future events in their lives. <span class="time" data-times="7.53" data-time="218.72">[03:38.72]</span>But the <span class="highlight">ease</span> with which we imagine details can <span class="highlight">lead</span> to unrealistic expectations and can <span class="highlight">bias</span> our decisions. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.47" data-time="226.25">[03:46.25]</span>So, um, Peter, <span class="highlight">suppose</span> I ask you to imagine a lunch salad, no problem, right? <span class="time" data-times="3.19" data-time="233.72">[03:53.72]</span>But I <span class="highlight">bet</span> you'd imagine <span class="highlight">specific</span> ingredients. <span class="time" data-times="5.33" data-time="236.91">[03:56.91]</span>Did yours have tomatoes? Onion? Lettuce? <span class="highlight">Mine</span> did. <span class="time" data-times="17.23" data-time="242.24">[04:02.24]</span>Our brains fill in all sorts of details that might not be part of other people's <span class="highlight">image</span> of the salad, which could <span class="highlight">lead</span> to disappointment for us if the next time we order a salad in a restaurant we have our imagined salad in <span class="highlight">mind</span> that's not necessarily what we'll get on our <span class="highlight">plate</span>. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.12" data-time="259.47">[04:19.47]</span>The problem is not that we imagine things but that we <span class="highlight">assume</span> what we've imagined is <span class="highlight">accurate</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="265.59">[04:25.59]</span>We should be <span class="highlight">aware</span> that our imagination has this built-in feature "the <span class="highlight">blind</span><span class="highlight">spot</span>", which makes our predictions fall short of reality. </p></p></article></section><div id="question"><div id="question1"><p>What is the lecture mainly about?</p><label class="my-label"><span>A.
