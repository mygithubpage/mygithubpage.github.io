Explain why.</p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>I enjoy biography most, because reading biography tells me a life story of a great person. I get to know the great person's ups and downs during his or her life and how he or she managed to get through all the difficulties. For example, the biography of Steve Jobs recounts how he was kicked out of Apple. But he continued his career in Computer Science and founded Pixar which created the world-famous film, Toy. Besides, he was invited back to Apple and saved Apple by introducing Ipod. I specially enjoy this part of his life, his great second-coming. I gain inspiration from his experience and from many other biographies and that's why I enjoy reading biography most.</p></article></div></main></body></html>
