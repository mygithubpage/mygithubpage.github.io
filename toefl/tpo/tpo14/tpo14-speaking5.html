          <p>Listen to a conversation between two students</p>
          <p>(woman) Hey, Matt, how's it going?</p>
          <p>(man) Uh, so so. I've got a problem with my housing next semester and I have to make a decision soon.</p>
          <p>(woman) What's going on?</p>
          <p>(man) Well, I lived in the dormitory, and I've got a great roommate for the last two year, but he's moving off campus next semester.</p>
          <p>(woman) Oh! So?</p>
          <p>(man) So now I have to make a big decision. You know, about my living arrangements.</p>
          <p>(woman) Well, couldn't you just get a new roommate? Doesn't the university automatically assign someone to take his place?</p>
          <p>(man) Yeah, they do. The thing is, I am concerned about sharing a room with somebody new. There could be problems, like, what if he wanted to go to sleep at ten o'clock? I am used to studying late at night and that would throw off my whole study schedule.</p>
          <p>(woman) I guess that's possible. But it is convenient to be on campus, easy to get to class and all. What else could you do?</p>
          <p>(man) Well, My roommate found a house off campus with some other friends and there's another bedroom available. I could have it, but I have to let them know by the end of the week.</p>
          <p>(woman) A house sounds like a good idea. It'd be fun to live with the group of people.</p>
          <p>(man) True, and it would definitely be economical with everyone splitting the rent, but it's just that this house is really far from campus. I'd have to wake up much earlier to get to class. It'd just be a lot more inconvenient than living in the dorm.</p>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>The man's having a trouble with his living arrangements because his roommate is moving off campus. Accordingly, there are two solutions for his problem: firstly, he could wait for the university to assign someone to take his roommate's place. And second, he could move out and share a house off campus with his roommate. I think the man should move to his roommate for two reasons. Firstly, it'll be more economical to rent a house with his roommates and some other friends. I guess it'll be even cheaper than staying in the dormitory. Besides, they could buy a second-hand car to ride together to the campus and share the gas fee, which will balance their life expense too. Last but not least, the man gets along with his roommate, and they could help each other with studying without wasting time on getting used to each other's living habits or trivial things like that. So I strongly recommend the second solution. (160 words)</p>
