Preparing for a career in journalism</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The proportion of the full text is placed on the job search. Changing the profession is only the beginning of the topic. So the answer is D.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the advisor discourage the student from transferring to another university?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. His current university is highly respected by newspaper editors.</p><p>B. His current university will soon offer a major in journalism.</p><p>C.

B is wrong, did not mention people. C is wrong because the local court is obviously something of political science.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the student imply when he says this:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. He was surprised by the amount of effort required to write a newspaper article.</p><p>B. He feels that some of the editor's changes were unnecessary.</p><p>C.

He will try to make sure his future articles are more accurate.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>"I didn't even recognize a few paragraphs of my original writing." Emotionally speaking, this performance is surprising. It looks like A is more appropriate, but from the context of context, the above article is praised by others for his excellent article. He went on to say that he had actually been changed a lot, that is to say that in fact it is not all his credit, others helped change a lot, so the correct option should be C. B mistakes, heavy sentences just said that editor changed a lot, but did not say that the change is useless, the following also pointed out that others told him why he modified. D mistakes, heavy hearing only said that this time was changed a lot, did not indicate that the next time to write good wishes.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
