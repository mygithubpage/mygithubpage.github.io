              <span class="time" data-times="2.24" data-time="11.29">[00:11.29]</span>Student: I know, I've been really busy. <span class="time" data-times="2.35" data-time="13.53">[00:13.53]</span>A friend of <span class="underline">mine</span> works on the school paper. <span class="time" data-times="1.88" data-time="15.88">[00:15.88]</span>He asked me if I'd like to try reporting. <span class="time" data-times="2.14" data-time="17.76">[00:17.76]</span>So I did and I really love it. </p>
            <p>

              <span class="time" data-times="7.83" data-time="105.25">[01:45.25]</span>Advisor: It's not that they don't look at it; it's, well, having a <span class="underline">degree</span> in something other than <span class="underline">Journalism</span> should actually work to your <span class="underline">advantage</span>. </p>
