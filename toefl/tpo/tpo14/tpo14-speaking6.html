But if you go down to the deepest parts of the ocean, it's cold and dark, and there's not a lot of living down there, so food is very scarce. So organisms that live down at these great depths have developed special adaptations to help them survive in this environment where food is so hard to find.For example, many deep-sea organisms have body features that enable them to eat prey that are larger than themselves. A good example, um, there's a species of eel that has an enormous mouth and a large stomach that's capable of expanding. And these unusual features allow this eel to eat prey larger than itself. That's a big advantage because if the eel eats something big, that's a lot of food, a lot of nutrition. So the eel can go for quite a while before it has to find food again. Another helpful adaptation in some deep-sea organisms is the ability to generate light. And some organisms use that light to help them capture food. For example, there's a kind of fish called the angler fish. And on its head, this fish has a little structure that produces light that glows in the dark. This little structure, this little light, is positioned close to the fish's mouth. Other fish are attracted to this light, they think it's something small they can eat, so they swim straight toward it. And that brings them close enough for the angler fish to capture them and eat them.</p></article><section id="question"><h4>Question</h4><p>Using the examples of the eel and the angler fish, explain two types of adaptations that help animals survive in the deepest parts of the ocean. </p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>Because the deeper part of the ocean is cold and dark, food source there is scarce, so deep sea organisms develop some adaptations to survive. For example, many organisms have physical features that help them to eat preys that are bigger even than them selves, like a kind of eel. The eel has a huge mouth and a large stomach that can expand, so it can eat a large prey that turns into plenty of energy and nutrition to help it sustain for quite a while, before it needs to eat again. Another is the ability to generate light that can be used to capture prey. For example, angler fish has a light-generating structure on its head that is close to its mouth. And when it glows in the dark, other organisms may assume it's something to eat and are therefore attracted by it. But when they get close enough, the angler fish will catch and eat them.
