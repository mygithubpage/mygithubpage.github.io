a lecture in an <span class="highlight">Astronomy</span> class.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="10.63" data-time="4">[00:04.00]</span><span class="highlight">Male</span> Professor: OK, last time we talked about <span class="highlight">ancient</span> agricultural civilizations that observed the stars and then used those observations to keep <span class="highlight">track</span> of the seasons. <span class="time" data-times="9.48" data-time="14.63">[00:14.63]</span>But, today I want to talk about the importance of stars for early seafarers, about how the fixed patterns of stars were used as navigational aids.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.23" data-time="24.11">[00:24.11]</span>OK, you've all heard about the Viking and their <span class="highlight">impressive</span><span class="highlight">navigation</span> skills. <span class="time" data-times="9.5" data-time="29.34">[00:29.34]</span>But the seafaring peoples of the <span class="highlight">Pacific</span> islands, the Polynesians and the Micronesians, were quite possibly the world's greatest navigators. <span class="time" data-times="14.68" data-time="38.84">[00:38.84]</span>Long before the <span class="highlight">development</span> of <span class="highlight">advanced</span> navigational tools in Europe, <span class="highlight">Pacific</span> islanders were traveling from New Zealand to Hawaii and back again, using nothing but the stars as their <span class="highlight">navigation</span> instruments.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="8.26" data-time="53.52">[00:53.52]</span>Um, the key to the <span class="highlight">Pacific</span> islanders' success was probably their location near the <span class="highlight">equator</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.86" data-time="61.78">[01:01.78]</span>What that meant was that the sky could be partitioned, divided up, much more symmetrically than it could farther away from the <span class="highlight">equator</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="16.82" data-time="70.64">[01:10.64]</span>Unlike the Vikings, uh, early observers of the stars in Polynesia were really anywhere <span class="highlight">along</span> the <span class="highlight">equator</span>, would feel that they were at the very center of things: with the sky to the north and the sky to the south behaving identically. <span class="time" data-times="5.3" data-time="87.46">[01:27.46]</span>They could see stars going straight up in the east and straight down in the west. <span class="time" data-times="9.14" data-time="92.76">[01:32.76]</span>So, it was easier to <span class="highlight">discern</span> the order in the sky than farther north or farther south, where everything would <span class="highlight">seem</span> more <span class="highlight">chaotic</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.35" data-time="101.9">[01:41.90]</span>Take the case of the Gilbert Islands. <span class="time" data-times="13.86" data-time="104.25">[01:44.25]</span>They are part of Polynesia and lie very close to the <span class="highlight">equator</span>, and the people there were able to divide the sky into <span class="highlight">symmetrical</span> boxes, according to the main directions, north, east, south and west. <span class="time" data-times="8.85" data-time="118.11">[01:58.11]</span>And they could precisely <span class="highlight">describe</span> the location of the star by indicating its <span class="highlight">position</span> in one of those <span class="highlight">imaginary</span> boxes. <span class="time" data-times="5.23" data-time="126.96">[02:06.96]</span>And they realized that you had to know the stars in order to <span class="highlight">navigate</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.25" data-time="132.19">[02:12.19]</span>In fact, there is only one word for both in the Gilbert Islands. <span class="time" data-times="3.99" data-time="136.44">[02:16.44]</span>When you <span class="highlight">wanted</span> a star expert, you asked for a <span class="highlight">navigator</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.22" data-time="140.43">[02:20.43]</span>Um, islanders from all over the <span class="highlight">Pacific</span> learned to use the stars for <span class="highlight">navigation</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.92" data-time="146.65">[02:26.65]</span>And they passed this knowledge down from <span class="highlight">generation</span> to <span class="highlight">generation</span>. <span class="time" data-times="12.36" data-time="150.57">[02:30.57]</span>Some of them utilized stone structures called "stone canoes", uh, and these, uh, canoes were on land, of <span class="highlight">course</span>, and you can still see them on some islands today.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="11.18" data-time="162.93">[02:42.93]</span>They were positioned as if they were <span class="highlight">heading</span> in the direction of the points on the sea <span class="highlight">horizon</span> where certain stars would <span class="highlight">appear</span> and disappear during the night. <span class="time" data-times="10.1" data-time="174.11">[02:54.11]</span>And, uh, young would-be navigators sat by the stones at night and turned in different directions to memorize the constellations they saw. <span class="time" data-times="5.36" data-time="184.21">[03:04.21]</span>So they could <span class="highlight">recognize</span> them and <span class="highlight">navigate</span>, uh, by them later on when they went out to sea.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.35" data-time="189.57">[03:09.57]</span>One important way the Polynesians had for orienting themselves was by using <span class="highlight">Zenith</span> stars. <span class="time" data-times="16.14" data-time="196.92">[03:16.92]</span>A <span class="highlight">Zenith</span> star was a really bright star that would pass directly overhead at a <span class="highlight">particular</span><span class="highlight">latitude</span>, uh, at a <span class="highlight">particular</span> distance from the <span class="highlight">equator</span>, often at <span class="highlight">latitude</span> associates with some, uh, <span class="highlight">particular</span><span class="highlight">Pacific</span> island.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="10.08" data-time="213.06">[03:33.06]</span>So the Polynesians could <span class="highlight">estimate</span> their <span class="highlight">latitude</span> just by looking straight up, by observing whether a certain <span class="highlight">Zenith</span> star pass directly overhead at night. <span class="time" data-times="5.27" data-time="223.14">[03:43.14]</span>They'd know if they had reached the same <span class="highlight">latitude</span> as a <span class="highlight">particular</span> island they were trying to get to.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="10.37" data-time="228.41">[03:48.41]</span>Um, another <span class="highlight">technique</span> used by the Polynesians was to look for a star pair – that's two stars that arise at the same time, or set at the same time. <span class="time" data-times="8.98" data-time="238.78">[03:58.78]</span>And navigators could use this pair of stars as <span class="highlight">reference</span> points, because they rise or set together only at <span class="highlight">specific</span> latitudes. <span class="time" data-times="9.7" data-time="247.76">[04:07.76]</span>So navigators might see one star pair <span class="highlight">setting</span> together and, uh, would know how far north or south of the <span class="highlight">equator</span> they were.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="8.73" data-time="257.46">[04:17.46]</span>And if they kept on going, the next night they saw the pair of stars <span class="highlight">setting</span> separately, then they would know they were at a different <span class="highlight">degree</span> of <span class="highlight">latitude</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.07" data-time="266.19">[04:26.19]</span>So looking at rising or <span class="highlight">setting</span> star pairs is a good <span class="highlight">technique</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.53" data-time="270.26">[04:30.26]</span>Um, actually it makes more <span class="highlight">sense</span> with <span class="highlight">setting</span> stars. <span class="time" data-times="3.79" data-time="273.79">[04:33.79]</span>They can be watched <span class="highlight">instead</span> of trying to guess when they'll rise.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.5" data-time="277.58">[04:37.58]</span>Uh, OK, I think all these showed that navigating does <span class="highlight">require</span><span class="highlight">fancy</span> navigational instruments. <span class="time" data-times="10.97" data-time="285.08">[04:45.08]</span>The peoples of the <span class="highlight">Pacific</span> islands had such expert knowledge of <span class="highlight">astronomy</span> as well as <span class="highlight">navigation</span> that they were able to <span class="highlight">navigate</span> over <span class="highlight">vast</span> stretches of Open Ocean. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="296.05">[04:56.05]</span>Uh, it's <span class="highlight">even</span> possible that Polynesians navigators had already sailed to the Americas centuries before Columbus.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor mainly discuss?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. How the seafaring skills of Polynesians resembled those of the Vikings.</p><p>B. How Pacific Islanders were able to navigate without instruments.</p><p>C. How the patterns of stars differ to the north and south of the equator.</p><p>D. How navigational instruments developed over time.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The beginning of the lecture has already been put forward: "But today I want to talk about the importance of stars for early seafarers, about how the fixed patterns of stars were used as navigational aids." So the answer is B.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the advantage of observing stars from a location near the equator?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The horizon tends to be clearer there than anywhere else.</p><p>B. More stars rise and set in pairs there than anywhere else.</p><p>C. Zenith stars shine even brighter there than they do farther north or south.</p><p>D. The sky appears more orderly there than it does farther north or south.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>What that meant was that the sky could be partitioned, divided up, much more symmetrically than it could farther away from the equator</p><p>When it comes to the pacific islander, they said that their geographical position is superior and it is easier to observe the movement of the stars so the correct answer is D.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor say about the people of the Gilbert Islands?Click on 2 answers.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They developed a method for describing the locations of stars.</p><p>B. They regularly traded with the peoples of Hawaii and New Zealand.</p><p>C. They were the first to recognize the usefulness of zenith stars.</p><p>D. They considered a navigator to be the same as an astronomer.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="AD"><p>In the speech they could clearly describe the location of the star by indicating its position in one of those imaginary boxes for the A option, and When you wanted a star expert, you asked for an navigator for the D option.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor mention stone canoes?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To point out some of the monuments that can be found on Pacific islands.</p><p>B. To give an example of an early method of transporting goods.</p><p>C. To illustrate a method used for teaching young Polynesians to navigate.</p><p>D. To compare Polynesian navigational tools to those of the Vikings.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The example of stone canoes is to support the concept of "they passed this knowledge down from generation to generation." That is, Polynesians teach the next generation of navigation technology, which is stargazing technology. So the answer is C.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What did the technique using zenith stars have in common with the technique using star pairs?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Both could help identify a location relative to the equator.</p><p>B. Both seem to have been used to determine the positioning of stone canoes.</p><p>C. Both were first developed by the Vikings.</p><p>D. Both were used as calendars to help keep track of the seasons.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A zenith star was a really bright star that would pass directly overhead at a particular latitude...at a particular distance from the equator, often at a latitude associated with some particular Pacific island.(zenith)</p><p>Because they rise or set together only at specific latitudes. So navigators might see one star pair setting together. And, uh...would know how far north or south of the equator they were. (star pairs)</p><p>Professors who described the navigation techniques of the Polynesians gave two methods: Both methods correct the course by determining the star in the sky and determine their relative position to the equator, so the answer is A. None of the other options are mentioned.</p></div></div><div class="replay" id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What can be inferred about the professor when he says this:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. He questions whether the technique is useful.</p><p>B. He wants to clarify a point about the technique.</p><p>C. He wants the students to guess how the technique works.</p><p>D. He wants the students to experiment with the technique.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Listening is actually a professor's evaluation of the star pairs technique, which is his own point of view. So answer B is correct, and the professor just stated his point of view. The CD was wrong. The sentence did not express any requirement of the professor for the student; A mistake, the professor just put forward an opinion and did not directly question the practicality of the technology.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
