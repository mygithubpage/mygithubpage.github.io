lecture in an <span class="highlight">Astronomy</span> class.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="10.63" data-time="4">[00:04.00]</span><span class="highlight">Male</span> Professor: OK, last time we talked about <span class="highlight">ancient</span> agricultural civilizations that observed the stars and then used those observations to keep <span class="highlight">track</span> of the seasons. <span class="time" data-times="9.48" data-time="14.63">[00:14.63]</span>But, today I want to talk about the importance of stars for early seafarers, about how the fixed patterns of stars were used as navigational aids.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.23" data-time="24.11">[00:24.11]</span>OK, you've all heard about the Viking and their <span class="highlight">impressive</span><span class="highlight">navigation</span> skills. <span class="time" data-times="9.5" data-time="29.34">[00:29.34]</span>But the seafaring peoples of the <span class="highlight">Pacific</span> islands, the Polynesians and the Micronesians, were quite possibly the world's greatest navigators. <span class="time" data-times="14.68" data-time="38.84">[00:38.84]</span>Long before the <span class="highlight">development</span> of <span class="highlight">advanced</span> navigational tools in Europe, <span class="highlight">Pacific</span> islanders were traveling from New Zealand to Hawaii and back again, using nothing but the stars as their <span class="highlight">navigation</span> instruments.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="8.26" data-time="53.52">[00:53.52]</span>Um, the key to the <span class="highlight">Pacific</span> islanders' success was probably their location near the <span class="highlight">equator</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.86" data-time="61.78">[01:01.78]</span>What that meant was that the sky could be partitioned, divided up, much more symmetrically than it could farther away from the <span class="highlight">equator</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="16.82" data-time="70.64">[01:10.64]</span>Unlike the Vikings, uh, early observers of the stars in Polynesia were really anywhere <span class="highlight">along</span> the <span class="highlight">equator</span>, would feel that they were at the very center of things: with the sky to the north and the sky to the south behaving identically. <span class="time" data-times="5.3" data-time="87.46">[01:27.46]</span>They could see stars going straight up in the east and straight down in the west. <span class="time" data-times="9.14" data-time="92.76">[01:32.76]</span>So, it was easier to <span class="highlight">discern</span> the order in the sky than farther north or farther south, where everything would <span class="highlight">seem</span> more <span class="highlight">chaotic</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.35" data-time="101.9">[01:41.90]</span>Take the case of the Gilbert Islands. <span class="time" data-times="13.86" data-time="104.25">[01:44.25]</span>They are part of Polynesia and lie very close to the <span class="highlight">equator</span>, and the people there were able to divide the sky into <span class="highlight">symmetrical</span> boxes, according to the main directions, north, east, south and west. <span class="time" data-times="8.85" data-time="118.11">[01:58.11]</span>And they could precisely <span class="highlight">describe</span> the location of the star by indicating its <span class="highlight">position</span> in one of those <span class="highlight">imaginary</span> boxes. <span class="time" data-times="5.23" data-time="126.96">[02:06.96]</span>And they realized that you had to know the stars in order to <span class="highlight">navigate</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.25" data-time="132.19">[02:12.19]</span>In fact, there is only one word for both in the Gilbert Islands. <span class="time" data-times="3.99" data-time="136.44">[02:16.44]</span>When you <span class="highlight">wanted</span> a star expert, you asked for a <span class="highlight">navigator</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.22" data-time="140.43">[02:20.43]</span>Um, islanders from all over the <span class="highlight">Pacific</span> learned to use the stars for <span class="highlight">navigation</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.92" data-time="146.65">[02:26.65]</span>And they passed this knowledge down from <span class="highlight">generation</span> to <span class="highlight">generation</span>. <span class="time" data-times="12.36" data-time="150.57">[02:30.57]</span>Some of them utilized stone structures called "stone canoes", uh, and these, uh, canoes were on land, of <span class="highlight">course</span>, and you can still see them on some islands today.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="11.18" data-time="162.93">[02:42.93]</span>They were positioned as if they were <span class="highlight">heading</span> in the direction of the points on the sea <span class="highlight">horizon</span> where certain stars would <span class="highlight">appear</span> and disappear during the night. <span class="time" data-times="10.1" data-time="174.11">[02:54.11]</span>And, uh, young would-be navigators sat by the stones at night and turned in different directions to memorize the constellations they saw. <span class="time" data-times="5.36" data-time="184.21">[03:04.21]</span>So they could <span class="highlight">recognize</span> them and <span class="highlight">navigate</span>, uh, by them later on when they went out to sea.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.35" data-time="189.57">[03:09.57]</span>One important way the Polynesians had for orienting themselves was by using <span class="highlight">Zenith</span> stars. <span class="time" data-times="16.14" data-time="196.92">[03:16.92]</span>A <span class="highlight">Zenith</span> star was a really bright star that would pass directly overhead at a <span class="highlight">particular</span><span class="highlight">latitude</span>, uh, at a <span class="highlight">particular</span> distance from the <span class="highlight">equator</span>, often at <span class="highlight">latitude</span> associates with some, uh, <span class="highlight">particular</span><span class="highlight">Pacific</span> island.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="10.08" data-time="213.06">[03:33.06]</span>So the Polynesians could <span class="highlight">estimate</span> their <span class="highlight">latitude</span> just by looking straight up, by observing whether a certain <span class="highlight">Zenith</span> star pass directly overhead at night. <span class="time" data-times="5.27" data-time="223.14">[03:43.14]</span>They'd know if they had reached the same <span class="highlight">latitude</span> as a <span class="highlight">particular</span> island they were trying to get to.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="10.37" data-time="228.41">[03:48.41]</span>Um, another <span class="highlight">technique</span> used by the Polynesians was to look for a star pair – that's two stars that arise at the same time, or set at the same time. <span class="time" data-times="8.98" data-time="238.78">[03:58.78]</span>And navigators could use this pair of stars as <span class="highlight">reference</span> points, because they rise or set together only at <span class="highlight">specific</span> latitudes. <span class="time" data-times="9.7" data-time="247.76">[04:07.76]</span>So navigators might see one star pair <span class="highlight">setting</span> together and, uh, would know how far north or south of the <span class="highlight">equator</span> they were.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="8.73" data-time="257.46">[04:17.46]</span>And if they kept on going, the next night they saw the pair of stars <span class="highlight">setting</span> separately, then they would know they were at a different <span class="highlight">degree</span> of <span class="highlight">latitude</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.07" data-time="266.19">[04:26.19]</span>So looking at rising or <span class="highlight">setting</span> star pairs is a good <span class="highlight">technique</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.53" data-time="270.26">[04:30.26]</span>Um, actually it makes more <span class="highlight">sense</span> with <span class="highlight">setting</span> stars. <span class="time" data-times="3.79" data-time="273.79">[04:33.79]</span>They can be watched <span class="highlight">instead</span> of trying to guess when they'll rise.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.5" data-time="277.58">[04:37.58]</span>Uh, OK, I think all these showed that navigating does <span class="highlight">require</span><span class="highlight">fancy</span> navigational instruments. <span class="time" data-times="10.97" data-time="285.08">[04:45.08]</span>The peoples of the <span class="highlight">Pacific</span> islands had such expert knowledge of <span class="highlight">astronomy</span> as well as <span class="highlight">navigation</span> that they were able to <span class="highlight">navigate</span> over <span class="highlight">vast</span> stretches of Open Ocean. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="296.05">[04:56.05]</span>Uh, it's <span class="highlight">even</span> possible that Polynesians navigators had already sailed to the Americas centuries before Columbus.</p></p></article></section><div id="question"><div id="question1"><p>What does the professor mainly discuss?</p><label
