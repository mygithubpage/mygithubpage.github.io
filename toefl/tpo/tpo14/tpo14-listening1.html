To ask how to look up books on the library's computer system.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>U, I am looking for this book---the American judicial system. And I can't seem to find it anywhere. I need to read a chapter for my political science class. The correct answer is B.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why is the student having a problem getting the book she wants?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

When asked where the book was going, the administrator said that all the books were in the hall. The reason why the female students could not be found was that someone else was watching.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>Why does the man think a student job in the library is available?Click on 2 answers.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. An employee recently stopped working at the library.</p><p>B. One position has been open since the beginning of the semester.</p><p>C.

(A option)</p><p>But I guess everyone who wants a job has one by now. (D option)</p><p>The library lacked employees because a buddy recently resigned; many people wanted to work in the library at the beginning of the semester, but now everyone has found a job, so after a step-by-step reasoning, there are not many people looking for a job now. Because they all have. In summary, the correct answers are A and D respectively.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is a potential problem with the available job in the library?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The position is only a temporary one.</p><p>B. The position is for fewer hours per week than other student jobs.</p><p>C. There may not be flexibility to select convenient working hours.</p><p>D. The librarian may prefer to hire a student with previous library work experience.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>But since you'd be starting so late in the semester, I'm not sure how that would work for you.</p><p>When asked about the details of the work, the librarian said that students were free to choose their working hours, but now that the semester has begun so long, they may not be able to choose freely.</p></div></div><div class="replay" id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Listen again to part of the conversation.Then answer the question.Why does the man say this:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

To reinforce the reason why so many books are not on the shelves</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>What if someone who is not in the class wants to use the book?</p><p>As mentioned earlier, teachers have the right to book "partial" books in the library. That is to say, there are still some books that can be borrowed by non-attendants. The question of girls before heavy hearing is as follows: "What if someone who is not in the class wants to use the book?" Therefore, the librarian's words are solutions to the problems raised by the female students. The answer is B.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
