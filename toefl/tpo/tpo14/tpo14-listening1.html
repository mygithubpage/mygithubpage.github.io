            <span class="time" data-times="4.23" data-time="24.95">[00:24.95]</span>Student: Yeah, I <span class="highlight">even</span> <span class="highlight">checked</span> other shelves and tables next to where the book should be.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.34" data-time="29.18">[00:29.18]</span>Library Employee: Well, it's still here in the library, so people must be using it. <span class="time" data-times="2.79" data-time="33.52">[00:33.52]</span>You know, this seems to be a very <span class="highlight">popular</span> book title. <span class="time" data-times="6.43" data-time="36.31">[00:36.31]</span>We show six copies, none are <span class="highlight">checked</span> out, and yet you didn't <span class="highlight">even</span> find one copy on the shelves. <span class="time" data-times="1.73" data-time="42.74">[00:42.74]</span>Is it a big class?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.9" data-time="44.47">[00:44.47]</span>Student: Maybe about seventy-five?</p>

          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="8.44" data-time="52.9">[00:52.90]</span>Student: I know you have to read reserved books in the library and that you have time limits, but I didn't know that I could ask a professor to put a book on <span class="highlight">reserve</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.25" data-time="61.34">[01:01.34]</span>I mean, I thought the professors make that kind of decision at the beginning of the <span class="highlight">semester</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.96" data-time="65.59">[01:05.59]</span>Library Employee: No, they can put books on <span class="highlight">reserve</span> at any time during the <span class="highlight">semester</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.57" data-time="69.55">[01:09.55]</span>Student: You know, reserving books seems a bit unfair. <span class="time" data-times="2.95" data-time="73.12">[01:13.12]</span>What if someone who's not in the class wants to use the book?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.82" data-time="76.07">[01:16.07]</span>Library Employee: That's why I said some copies!</p>

            <span class="time" data-times="3.92" data-time="78.89">[01:18.89]</span>Student: Ah! Well, I'll certainly talk to my professor about it tomorrow. <span class="time" data-times="1.43" data-time="82.81">[01:22.81]</span>But what am I going to do tonight?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.12" data-time="84.24">[01:24.24]</span>Library Employee: I guess you could walk around the Poli/Sci <span class="highlight">section</span> and look at the books waiting to be re-shelved.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.93" data-time="90.36">[01:30.36]</span>Student: There do <span class="highlight">seem</span> to be more than normal.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.24" data-time="93.29">[01:33.29]</span>Library Employee: We're a little short-staffed right now. <span class="time" data-times="4.96" data-time="95.53">[01:35.53]</span>Someone <span class="highlight">quit</span> recently, so things aren't getting re-shelved as quickly as usual. <span class="time" data-times="6.48" data-time="100.49">[01:40.49]</span>I don't think they've hired a replacement yet, so, yeah, the un-shelved books can get a bit out of hand.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.7" data-time="106.97">[01:46.97]</span>Student: This may <span class="highlight">sound</span> a bit <span class="highlight">weird</span>, but, I've been thinking about getting a job. <span class="time" data-times="2.97" data-time="111.67">[01:51.67]</span>Um, I've never worked in a library before, but...</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.74" data-time="114.64">[01:54.64]</span>Library Employee: That's not a requirement. <span class="time" data-times="1.61" data-time="116.38">[01:56.38]</span>The job might still be open. <span class="time" data-times="7.32" data-time="117.99">[01:57.99]</span>At the beginning of the <span class="highlight">semester</span>, we were swamped with applications, but, I guess everyone who wants a job has one by now.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.57" data-time="125.31">[02:05.31]</span>Student: What can you tell me about the job?</p>

            <span class="time" data-times="4.83" data-time="126.88">[02:06.88]</span>Library Employee: Well, we work between six and ten hours a week, so it's a <span class="highlight">reasonable</span> <span class="highlight">amount</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.46" data-time="131.71">[02:11.71]</span>Usually we can pick the hours we want to work, but since you'll be starting so late in the <span class="highlight">semester</span>, I'm not sure how that would work for you. <span class="time" data-times="5.33" data-time="140.17">[02:20.17]</span>And, uh, we get paid the normal university rates for student employees.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.57" data-time="145.5">[02:25.50]</span>Student: So, who do I talk to?</p>

            <span class="time" data-times="3.32" data-time="147.07">[02:27.07]</span>Library Employee: I guess you'd talk to Dr. Jenkins, the head <span class="highlight">librarian</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="150.39">[02:30.39]</span>She does the hiring.</p>
