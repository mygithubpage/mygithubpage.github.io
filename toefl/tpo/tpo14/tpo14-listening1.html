              <span class="time" data-times="4.34" data-time="29.18">[00:29.18]</span>Library Employee: Well, it's still here in the library, so people must be using it. <span class="time" data-times="2.79" data-time="33.52">[00:33.52]</span>You know, this seems to be a very <span class="underline">popular</span> book title. <span class="time" data-times="6.43" data-time="36.31">[00:36.31]</span>We show six copies, none are <span class="underline">checked</span> out, and yet you didn't <span class="underline">even</span> find one copy on the shelves. <span class="time" data-times="1.73" data-time="42.74">[00:42.74]</span>Is it a big class?</p>

              <span class="time" data-times="3.96" data-time="65.59">[01:05.59]</span>Library Employee: No, they can put books on <span class="underline">reserve</span> at any time during the <span class="underline">semester</span>.</p>

              <span class="time" data-times="3.57" data-time="69.55">[01:09.55]</span>Student: You know, reserving books seems a bit unfair. <span class="time" data-times="2.95" data-time="73.12">[01:13.12]</span>What if someone who's not in the class wants to use the book?</p>
            <p>

              <span class="time" data-times="6.12" data-time="84.24">[01:24.24]</span>Library Employee: I guess you could walk around the Poli/Sci <span class="underline">section</span> and look at the books waiting to be re-shelved.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.93" data-time="90.36">[01:30.36]</span>Student: There do <span class="underline">seem</span> to be more than normal.</p>

            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.7" data-time="106.97">[01:46.97]</span>Student: This may <span class="underline">sound</span> a bit <span class="underline">weird</span>, but, I've been thinking about getting a job. <span class="time" data-times="2.97" data-time="111.67">[01:51.67]</span>Um, I've never worked in a library before, but...</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.74" data-time="114.64">[01:54.64]</span>Library Employee: That's not a requirement. <span class="time" data-times="1.61" data-time="116.38">[01:56.38]</span>The job might still be open. <span class="time" data-times="7.32" data-time="117.99">[01:57.99]</span>At the beginning of the <span class="underline">semester</span>, we were swamped with applications, but, I guess everyone who wants a job has one by now.</p>
