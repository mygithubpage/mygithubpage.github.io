            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.08" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in a <span class="underline">biology</span> class. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.67" data-time="5.08">[00:05.08]</span>
              <span class="underline">Female</span> Professor: Almost all animals have some way of regulating their body <span class="underline">temperature</span>, <span class="underline">otherwise</span> they wouldn't <span class="underline">survive</span> <span class="underline">extreme</span> hot or cold conditions. <span class="time" data-times="9.63" data-time="13.75">[00:13.75]</span>Sweating, panting, swimming to cooler or warmer water, ducking into somewhere cool like a <span class="underline">burrow</span> or a hole under a rock, these are just a few. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.61" data-time="23.38">[00:23.38]</span>And that <span class="underline">spot</span> is colder or warmer than the surrounding environment because it's a microclimate. <span class="time" data-times="9.32" data-time="29.99">[00:29.99]</span>A microclimate is a group of <span class="underline">climate</span> conditions that <span class="underline">affect</span> a localized area, weather features like <span class="underline">temperature</span>, wind, <span class="underline">moisture</span> and so on. <span class="time" data-times="9.75" data-time="39.31">[00:39.31]</span>And when I say localized, I mean really localized because microclimates can be, as the name suggests, <span class="underline">pretty</span> small, <span class="underline">even</span> less than a <span class="underline">square</span> meter! <span class="time" data-times="4.36" data-time="49.06">[00:49.06]</span>And microclimates are affected by huge number of other variables. <span class="time" data-times="3.79" data-time="53.42">[00:53.42]</span> <span class="underline">Obviously</span> weather conditions in the surrounding area are a <span class="underline">factor</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.6" data-time="57.21">[00:57.21]</span>But other aspects of the location, like, um, the <span class="underline">elevation</span> of the land, the plant life nearby and so on have a <span class="underline">substantial</span> effect on microclimates. <span class="time" data-times="6.33" data-time="67.81">[01:07.81]</span>And, of <span class="underline">course</span>, the human <span class="underline">development</span> in the area, um, a road will <span class="underline">affect</span> nearby microclimate. <span class="time" data-times="6.63" data-time="74.14">[01:14.14]</span>It's also interesting to note that microclimates that are near each other can have very different conditions. <span class="time" data-times="8.11" data-time="80.77">[01:20.77]</span>In the forest, for example, there can be a number of very different microclimates close to each other because of all the variables I just mentioned. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.59" data-time="88.88">[01:28.88]</span>
              <span class="underline">Male</span> Student: So how does a hole in the ground, a <span class="underline">burrow</span>, stay cool in a hot <span class="underline">climate</span>? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.52" data-time="93.47">[01:33.47]</span>Professor: Well, since cold <span class="underline">air</span> sinks and these spots are shaded, they are usually much cooler than the surrounding area. <span class="time" data-times="6.95" data-time="100.99">[01:40.99]</span>And these spots are so important because many animals <span class="underline">rely</span> on microclimates to <span class="underline">regulate</span> their body <span class="underline">temperature</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.5" data-time="107.94">[01:47.94]</span>Um, for <span class="underline">instance</span>, there's a <span class="underline">species</span> of <span class="underline">squirrel</span> in the western part of the United States. <span class="time" data-times="3.14" data-time="113.44">[01:53.44]</span>They can get really hot when they're out foraging for food. <span class="time" data-times="2.21" data-time="116.58">[01:56.58]</span>So they need a way to cool down. <span class="time" data-times="1.28" data-time="118.79">[01:58.79]</span>So what would they do? <span class="time" data-times="1.84" data-time="120.07">[02:00.07]</span>They go back to their own <span class="underline">burrow</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.34" data-time="121.91">[02:01.91]</span>Once they get there, their body temperatures <span class="underline">decrease</span> very very quickly. <span class="time" data-times="3.42" data-time="126.25">[02:06.25]</span>The <span class="underline">trip</span> to the <span class="underline">burrow</span> prevents the <span class="underline">squirrel</span> from getting too hot. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.7" data-time="129.67">[02:09.67]</span>Student: But squirrels are mammals, right? <span class="time" data-times="3.45" data-time="131.37">[02:11.37]</span>I thought mammals <span class="underline">regulate</span> their <span class="underline">temperature</span> internally. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.94" data-time="134.82">[02:14.82]</span>Professor: Mammals do have the <span class="underline">ability</span> to <span class="underline">regulate</span> their body <span class="underline">temperature</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.6" data-time="138.76">[02:18.76]</span>But not all can do it to the same <span class="underline">degree</span>, or <span class="underline">even</span> the same way. <span class="time" data-times="9.3" data-time="143.36">[02:23.36]</span>Like when you walk outside on a hot day, you perspire and your body cools itself down, a <span class="underline">classic</span> example of how a <span class="underline">mammal</span> regulates its own body <span class="underline">temperature</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.03" data-time="152.66">[02:32.66]</span>But one <span class="underline">challenge</span> the squirrels face, well, many small mammals do, is that because of their size, sweating will make them lose too much <span class="underline">moisture</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.77" data-time="162.69">[02:42.69]</span>They <span class="underline">dehydrate</span>. But, on the other hand, their small size allows them to fit into very tiny spaces. <span class="time" data-times="4.36" data-time="169.46">[02:49.46]</span>So for small mammals, microclimates can make a big <span class="underline">difference</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.71" data-time="173.82">[02:53.82]</span>They <span class="underline">rely</span> on microclimates for <span class="underline">survival</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.47" data-time="176.53">[02:56.53]</span>Student: So cold-blooded animals like reptiles, they can't control their own body <span class="underline">temperature</span>, so I can imagine the effect of microclimate would have on them. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.8" data-time="185">[03:05.00]</span>Professor: Yes! Many reptiles and insects <span class="underline">rely</span> on microclimates to control their body <span class="underline">temperature</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.75" data-time="190.8">[03:10.80]</span>A lot of reptiles use burrows or stay under rocks to cool down. <span class="time" data-times="3.3" data-time="195.55">[03:15.55]</span>Of <span class="underline">course</span> with reptiles, it's a balancing act. <span class="time" data-times="5.35" data-time="198.85">[03:18.85]</span>Staying in the heat for too long can <span class="underline">lead</span> to problems, but staying in the cold can do the same. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.96" data-time="204.2">[03:24.20]</span>So reptiles have to be really <span class="underline">precise</span> about where they spend their time, <span class="underline">even</span> how they <span class="underline">position</span> their bodies. <span class="time" data-times="2.61" data-time="210.16">[03:30.16]</span>And when I say they're <span class="underline">precise</span> I mean it! <span class="time" data-times="9.92" data-time="212.77">[03:32.77]</span>Some snakes will search out a place under a rock of a <span class="underline">specific</span> thickness, because too thin a rock doesn't keep them cool enough, and too thick a rock will cause them to get too cold. <span class="time" data-times="4.81" data-time="222.69">[03:42.69]</span>That <span class="underline">level</span> of precision is <span class="underline">critical</span> to the snake for maintaining its body <span class="underline">temperature</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.46" data-time="227.5">[03:47.50]</span>And <span class="underline">even</span> <span class="underline">microscopic</span> organisms <span class="underline">rely</span> on microclimate for <span class="underline">survival</span>. <span class="time" data-times="10.19" data-time="231.96">[03:51.96]</span>Think about this: decomposing leaves create heat that warms the soil; the warm soil, in turn, affects the growth, the conditions of organisms there. <span class="time" data-times="4.92" data-time="242.15">[04:02.15]</span>And those organisms then <span class="underline">affect</span> the <span class="underline">rate</span> of <span class="underline">decomposition</span> of the leaves. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.73" data-time="247.07">[04:07.07]</span>So a microclimate can be something so small and so easily disturbed that <span class="underline">even</span> a tiny change can have a big <span class="underline">impact</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="254.8">[04:14.80]</span>If someone on a <span class="underline">hike</span> knocks a <span class="underline">couple</span> of rocks over, they could be unwittingly destroying a microclimate that an animal or <span class="underline">organism</span> relies on. </p>
