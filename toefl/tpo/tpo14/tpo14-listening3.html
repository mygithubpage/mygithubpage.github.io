The size of the animal population in the area</p><p>B. The number of other microclimates in the area</p><p>C. The elevation of the land where the microclimate is located</p><p>D. Human activity in the area where the microclimate is located</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="CD"><p>But other aspects of the location like, um... the elevation of the land, the plant life nearby, and so on, have a substantial effect on microclimates. And of course the human development in the area, um, a road will affect a nearby Microclimate.</p><p>The professor pointed out that there are many factors that affect microclimates. Among them are several points: the elevation of the land and And of course the human development in the area, corresponding to the option CD.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What point does the professor make when she mentions squirrels?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Studying squirrels has helped biologists identify different microclimates.</p><p>B. Mammals have more than one way of regulating their body temperature.</p><p>C. Smaller animals have more success than larger animals in adapting to different microclimates.</p><p>D. Squirrels do not rely on microclimates as much as other mammals do.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Mammals do have the ability to regulate their body temperature, but not all can do it to the same degree, or even the same way.</p><p>When we talked about mammals, the professor affirmed the views of the classmates. In other words, they could adjust their body temperature internally. At the same time, they could also use mc's help: "but not all can do it to the same degree, or even the same way." In summary, the correct answer is B.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor imply about the reptiles and microclimates?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Microclimates can be both helpful and harmful to reptiles.</p><p>B. Microclimates are one of the many ways reptiles control their body temperature.</p><p>C.

Many reptiles spend most of their time in one type of microclimate.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>Staying in the heat for too long can lead to problems, but staying in the cold can do the same.</p><p>When talking about reptiles, the professor mentioned that amphibians will be harmed in overheated or under-cooled environments. A's answer is a synonym substitution option, so it is correct. B is wrong, because the article does not mention the way in which amphibians control body temperature except rely on microclimates.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor,how do decomposing leaves affect microclimates?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Decomposing leaves form layers that prevent sunlight from warming the ground below the leaves.</p><p>B. Decomposing leaves insulate burrows,keeping the burrows cool.</p><p>C. Decomposing leaves generate heat,creating a warm microclimate.</p><p>D. Decomposing leaves bring moisture to dry microclimates.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>When referring to corrupt leaves, the professor said in the first sentence: "Think about this, decomposing leaves create heat that warms the soil" So the correct option is C.</p></div></div><div class="replay" id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the student say this?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.
