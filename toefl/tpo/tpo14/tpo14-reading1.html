The <span class="highlight">Independent</span> Television <span class="highlight">Commission</span>, regulator of television advertising in the United <span class="highlight">Kingdom</span>, has criticized advertisers for "misleadingness"-creating a wrong <span class="highlight">impression</span> either <span class="highlight">intentionally</span> or unintentionally-in an effort to control advertisers' use of techniques that make it difficult for children to judge the true size, <span class="highlight">action</span>, performance, or <span class="highlight">construction</span> of a toy.</p><p>General <span class="highlight">concern</span> about misleading tactics that advertisers <span class="highlight">employ</span> is centered on the use of exaggeration. Consumer protection groups and parents believe that children are largely ill-equipped to <span class="highlight">recognize</span> such techniques and that often exaggeration is used at the expense of product information. Claims such as "the best" or "better than" can be subjective and misleading; <span class="highlight">even</span> adults may be unsure as to their meaning. They <span class="highlight">represent</span> the advertiser's opinions about the qualities of their products or <span class="highlight">brand</span> and, as a <span class="highlight">consequence</span>, are difficult to <span class="highlight"><span class="question2">verify</span>. </span>Advertisers sometimes <span class="highlight">offset</span> or counterbalance an exaggerated <span class="highlight">claim</span> with a disclaimer-a qualification or condition on the <span class="highlight">claim</span>. For example, the <span class="highlight">claim</span> that breakfast <span class="highlight">cereal</span> has a health <span class="highlight">benefit</span> may be accompanied by the disclaimer "when part of a nutritionally <span class="highlight">balanced</span> breakfast." However, research has shown that children often have difficulty understanding disclaimers: children may <span class="highlight">interpret</span> the phrase "when part of a nutritionally <span class="highlight">balanced</span> breakfast" to mean that the <span class="highlight">cereal</span> is required as a necessary part of a <span class="highlight">balanced</span> breakfast. The author George Comstock suggested that less than a quarter of children between the ages of six and eight years old understood <span class="highlight">standard</span> disclaimers used in many toy advertisements and that disclaimers are more <span class="highlight">readily</span> comprehended when presented in both <span class="highlight">audio</span> and <span class="highlight">visual</span> formats. <span class="highlight">Nevertheless</span>, disclaimers are mainly presented in <span class="highlight">audio</span><span class="highlight">format</span> only.</p><p><span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span><span class="highlight">Fantasy</span> is one of the more <span class="highlight">common</span> techniques in advertising that could possibly mislead a young <span class="highlight">audience</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>Child-oriented advertisements are more likely to include magic
and <span class="highlight">fantasy</span> than advertisements aimed at adults. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>In a <span class="highlight">content</span><span class="highlight">analysis</span> of Canadian television, the author Stephen Kline observed that nearly all 
commercials for <span class="highlight">character</span> toys featured <span class="highlight">fantasy</span> play. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>Children have strong imaginations and the use of <span class="highlight">fantasy</span> brings their ideas to life, but children may not be 
<span class="highlight"><span class="question6">adept</span></span>enough to realize that what they are viewing is unreal. <span class="highlight">Fantasy</span> situations and settings are frequently used to <span class="highlight">attract</span> children's <span class="highlight">attention</span>, particularly in food advertising. Advertisements for breakfast cereals have, for many years, been found to be especially fond of <span class="highlight">fantasy</span> techniques, with almost nine out of ten including such <span class="highlight">content</span>. Generally, 
there is uncertainty as to whether very young children can <span class="highlight">distinguish</span> between <span class="highlight">fantasy</span> and reality in advertising. <span class="question8">Certainly, <span class="highlight">rational</span> appeals in advertising aimed at children are limited, as most advertisements use <span class="highlight">emotional</span> and indirect appeals to psychological states or associations.</span></p><p>The use of celebrities such as singers and movie stars is <span class="highlight">common</span> in advertising. The intention is for the positively perceived <span class="question9">attributes </span>of the celebrity to be transferred to the advertised product and for the two to become automatically linked in the <span class="highlight">audience</span>'s <span class="highlight">mind</span>. In children's advertising, the "celebrities" are often animated figures from <span class="highlight">popular</span> cartoons. In the recent past, the role of celebrities in advertising to children has often been conflated with the <span class="highlight">concept</span> of <span class="highlight">host</span> selling. <span class="highlight">Host</span> selling involves blending advertisements with <span class="highlight">regular</span> programming in a way that makes it difficult to <span class="highlight">distinguish</span> one from the other. <span class="highlight">Host</span> selling occurs, for example, when a children's show about a cartoon lion contains an ad in which the same lion promotes a breakfast <span class="highlight">cereal</span>. The psychologist Dale Kunkel showed that the practice of <span class="highlight">host</span> selling reduced children's <span class="highlight">ability</span> to <span class="highlight">distinguish</span> between advertising and program <span class="highlight">material</span>. It was also found that older children responded more positively to products in <span class="highlight">host</span> selling advertisements.</p><p>Regarding the <span class="highlight">appearance</span> of celebrities in advertisements that do not <span class="highlight">involve</span><span class="highlight">host</span> selling, the <span class="highlight">evidence</span> is mixed. Researcher Charles Atkin found that children believe that the characters used to <span class="highlight">advertise</span> breakfast cereals are <span class="highlight">knowledgeable</span> about cereals, and children accept such characters as <span class="highlight"><span class="question11">credible</span></span>sources of nutritional information. This finding was <span class="highlight">even</span> more <span class="highlight">marked</span> for heavy viewers of television. In <span class="highlight">addition</span>, children feel validated in their choice of a product when a celebrity endorses that product. A study of children in Hong Kong, however, found that the presence of celebrities in advertisements could negatively <span class="highlight">affect</span> the children's perceptions of a product if the children did not like the celebrity in question.</p></article></div><div id="question"><div id="question1"><p>Which of the following is NOT mentioned in paragraph 1 as being a difficult judgment for children to make about advertised toys?</p><label class="my-label"><span>A.
