The <span class="highlight">Independent</span> Television <span class="highlight">Commission</span>, regulator of television advertising in the United <span class="highlight">Kingdom</span>, has criticized advertisers for "misleadingness"-creating a wrong <span class="highlight">impression</span> either <span class="highlight">intentionally</span> or unintentionally-in an effort to control advertisers' use of techniques that make it difficult for children to judge the true size, <span class="highlight">action</span>, performance, or <span class="highlight">construction</span> of a toy.</p><p>General <span class="highlight">concern</span> about misleading tactics that advertisers <span class="highlight">employ</span> is centered on the use of exaggeration. Consumer protection groups and parents believe that children are largely ill-equipped to <span class="highlight">recognize</span> such techniques and that often exaggeration is used at the expense of product information. Claims such as "the best" or "better than" can be subjective and misleading; <span class="highlight">even</span> adults may be unsure as to their meaning. They <span class="highlight">represent</span> the advertiser's opinions about the qualities of their products or <span class="highlight">brand</span> and, as a <span class="highlight">consequence</span>, are difficult to <span class="highlight"><span class="question2">verify</span></span>. Advertisers sometimes <span class="highlight">offset</span> or counterbalance an exaggerated <span class="highlight">claim</span> with a disclaimer-a qualification or condition on the <span class="highlight">claim</span>. For example, the <span class="highlight">claim</span> that breakfast <span class="highlight">cereal</span> has a health <span class="highlight">benefit</span> may be accompanied by the disclaimer "when part of a nutritionally <span class="highlight">balanced</span> breakfast." However, research has shown that children often have difficulty understanding disclaimers: children may <span class="highlight">interpret</span> the phrase "when part of a nutritionally <span class="highlight">balanced</span> breakfast" to mean that the <span class="highlight">cereal</span> is required as a necessary part of a <span class="highlight">balanced</span> breakfast. The author George Comstock suggested that less than a quarter of children between the ages of six and eight years old understood <span class="highlight">standard</span> disclaimers used in many toy advertisements and that disclaimers are more <span class="highlight">readily</span> comprehended when presented in both <span class="highlight">audio</span> and <span class="highlight">visual</span> formats. <span class="highlight">Nevertheless</span>, disclaimers are mainly presented in <span class="highlight">audio</span><span class="highlight">format</span> only.</p><p><span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span><span class="highlight">Fantasy</span> is one of the more <span class="highlight">common</span> techniques in advertising that could possibly mislead a young <span class="highlight">audience</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>Child-oriented advertisements are more likely to include magic
and <span class="highlight">fantasy</span> than advertisements aimed at adults. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>In a <span class="highlight">content</span><span class="highlight">analysis</span> of Canadian television, the author Stephen Kline observed that nearly all 
commercials for <span class="highlight">character</span> toys featured <span class="highlight">fantasy</span> play. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>Children have strong imaginations and the use of <span class="highlight">fantasy</span> brings their ideas to life, but children may not be 
<span class="highlight"><span class="question6">adept</span></span> enough to realize that what they are viewing is unreal. <span class="highlight">Fantasy</span> situations and settings are frequently used to <span class="highlight">attract</span> children's <span class="highlight">attention</span>, particularly in food advertising. Advertisements for breakfast cereals have, for many years, been found to be especially fond of <span class="highlight">fantasy</span> techniques, with almost nine out of ten including such <span class="highlight">content</span>. Generally, 
there is uncertainty as to whether very young children can <span class="highlight">distinguish</span> between <span class="highlight">fantasy</span> and reality in advertising. <span class="question8">Certainly, <span class="highlight">rational</span> appeals in advertising aimed at children are limited, as most advertisements use <span class="highlight">emotional</span> and indirect appeals to psychological states or associations.</span></p><p>The use of celebrities such as singers and movie stars is <span class="highlight">common</span> in advertising. The intention is for the positively perceived <span class="question9">attributes</span> of the celebrity to be transferred to the advertised product and for the two to become automatically linked in the <span class="highlight">audience</span>'s <span class="highlight">mind</span>. In children's advertising, the "celebrities" are often animated figures from <span class="highlight">popular</span> cartoons. In the recent past, the role of celebrities in advertising to children has often been conflated with the <span class="highlight">concept</span> of <span class="highlight">host</span> selling. <span class="highlight">Host</span> selling involves blending advertisements with <span class="highlight">regular</span> programming in a way that makes it difficult to <span class="highlight">distinguish</span> one from the other. <span class="highlight">Host</span> selling occurs, for example, when a children's show about a cartoon lion contains an ad in which the same lion promotes a breakfast <span class="highlight">cereal</span>. The psychologist Dale Kunkel showed that the practice of <span class="highlight">host</span> selling reduced children's <span class="highlight">ability</span> to <span class="highlight">distinguish</span> between advertising and program <span class="highlight">material</span>. It was also found that older children responded more positively to products in <span class="highlight">host</span> selling advertisements.</p><p>Regarding the <span class="highlight">appearance</span> of celebrities in advertisements that do not <span class="highlight">involve</span><span class="highlight">host</span> selling, the <span class="highlight">evidence</span> is mixed. Researcher Charles Atkin found that children believe that the characters used to <span class="highlight">advertise</span> breakfast cereals are <span class="highlight">knowledgeable</span> about cereals, and children accept such characters as <span class="highlight"><span class="question11">credible</span></span> sources of nutritional information. This finding was <span class="highlight">even</span> more <span class="highlight">marked</span> for heavy viewers of television. In <span class="highlight">addition</span>, children feel validated in their choice of a product when a celebrity endorses that product. A study of children in Hong Kong, however, found that the presence of celebrities in advertisements could negatively <span class="highlight">affect</span> the children's perceptions of a product if the children did not like the celebrity in question.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the following is NOT mentioned in paragraph 1 as being a difficult judgment for children to make about advertised toys?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

How the toys are made</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B EXCEPT questions, exclusion method, all answers are concentrated in the last sentence, A's big corresponds to size, correct, not selected; B's cost does not correspond to, wrong, selected; C's do corresponds to performance, correct, not selected; D's made Corresponding construction, correct, not selected.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question2">verify</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. establish the truth of</p><p>B. approve of</p><p>C. understand</p><p>D. criticize</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" A"><p>A <span class="question2">verify</span>: <span class="question2">verify</span>, prove. A is the fact that ... is established; B is consent; C is understanding; D option is criticism. So A's establishment of the truth is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>In paragraph 2, what is one reason that claims such as "the best" or "better than" can be misleading?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They represent the opinions of adults, which are often different from those of children.</p><p>B. They generally involve comparisons among only a small group of products.</p><p>C. They reflect the attitudes of consumer protection groups rather than those of actual consumers.</p><p>D. They reflect the advertiser's viewpoint about the product.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D, because the next sentence of the it refers to the better than and best of the previous sentence, the previous look, saying that best and better than represents the manufacturer's views on their products and brands, the results of its authenticity is difficult to judge, which is misleading The reason, so the answer is D.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Cereal advertisements that include the statement "<span class="highlight">when part of a nutritionally balanced breakfast</span>" are trying to suggest that</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. the cereal is a desirable part of a healthful, balanced breakfast</p><p>B. the cereal contains equal amounts of all nutrients</p><p>C. cereal is a healthier breakfast than other foods are</p><p>D. the cereal is the most nutritious part of the breakfast meal</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="when part of a nutritionally balanced breakfast A"><p>A rhetorical purpose question, where the rhetorical point is a sentence, is simply to say an example, and begins with a for example, apparently to prove the previous sentence. The preceding sentence says that advertisers sometimes use a disclaimer to balance their exaggeration. Then say for instance blabla, so this rhetorical point should be a disclaimer, so the answer is A, and only if this morning's cereal is available is it nutritious.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 2, all of the following are true of disclaimers made in advertisements EXCEPT:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They are qualifications or conditions put on a claim.</p><p>B. They may be used to balance exaggerations</p><p>C. They are usually presented in both audio and visual formats.</p><p>D. They are often difficult for children to understand.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C This EXCEPT question is significantly faster with positive selection. With the disclaimer as the key word to position the fifth sentence, answers A and B appear in the fifth sentence, both are correct and not selected; the answer D appears in the seventh sentence (however sentence), so it is correct and not selected; C the original answer is not Say, wrong, choose.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question6">adept</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. responsible</p><p>B. skillful</p><p>C. patient</p><p>D. curious</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>B <span class="question6">adept</span>: Skilled, experienced. A is responsible and reliable; B is skilled; C is patient; D is curious. So answer B's skillful is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Paragraph 3 indicates that there is uncertainty about which of the following issues involving children and fantasy in advertising?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Whether children can tell if what they are seeing in an advertisement is real or fantasy</p><p>B. Whether children can differentiate fantasy techniques from other techniques used in advertising</p><p>C. Whether children realize how commonly fantasy techniques are used in advertising aimed at them</p><p>D. Whether children are attracted to advertisements that lack fantasy</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A, with an uncertain keyword positioning to the penultimate sentence, says that we are not sure if the child can distinguish whether something in the ad is true or not, so the answer is A. B's other techniques, C's common and D's lack fantasy did not say anything.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Rational appeals in advertising are certainly limited by children's emotional immaturity and the indirect nature of their associations.</p><p>B. Indirect appeals to children's psychological states or associations can limit the effectiveness of rational appeals in advertising.</p><p>C. Rational appeals play a much smaller role in advertisements for children than emotional appeals and psychological associations do.</p><p>D. Rational appeals in advertising aimed at children should certainly be limited until the children are emotionally and psychologically ready.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The structure of the C original sentence is: less rational, not rational, so the answer is obviously C. A's emotional immaturity did not say; B's predicate limit is stolen, and there is no comparison between the two; D also said that limit, but the meaning of the expression with the until out of the larger, so wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question9">attributes</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. evaluations</p><p>B. attitudes</p><p>C. actions</p><p>D. characteristics</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" D"><p>D attribute: Features, characteristics. A is an assessment; B is an attitude; C is an action; D is a feature. So the answer D is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>In paragraph 4, why does the author mention a show about a cartoon lion in which an advertisement appears featuring the same lion character?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To help explain what is meant by the term "host selling" and why it can be misleading to children</p><p>B. To explain why the role of celebrities in advertising aimed at children has often been confused with host selling</p><p>C. To compare the effectiveness of using animated figures with the effectiveness of using celebrities in advertisements aimed at children</p><p>D. To indicate how Kunkel first became interested in studying the effects of host selling on children</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The topic of the function, the rhetorical point of the sentence is just to say an example, and contains a for example, obviously to prove the previous sentence, the previous sentence introduced a new concept called host selling, so the answer is A describes what is the host Selling. Because the previous sentence says host selling makes it difficult for children to distinguish between real TV shows and advertisements, it is misleading.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question11">credible</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. helpful</p><p>B. believable</p><p>C. valuable</p><p>D. familiar</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>B <span class="question11">credible</span>: Trusted. (Think of a credit card credit card, so cred is related to the letter.) A is helpful; B is <span class="question11">credible</span>; C is valuable; D is familiar and common. So the answer is B's belief.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 5, what did a study of children in Hong Kong show about the use of celebrities in advertisements aimed at children?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

It can have a negative effect if the celebrities are not popular with children.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>With Hong Kong positioning to the last sentence: A study of children in Hong Kong, however, found that the presence of celebrities in advertisements could negatively affect the children's perceptions of a product if the children did not like the celebrity in question. The correct answer is obviously D, D is a synonymous rewrite of the last sentence.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Another aspect of advertising that may especially influence children is fantasy..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A another tells you that this sentence leads to a new point of view (which is an obvious starting point), possibly at the beginning of the paragraph, or in the paragraph, depending on whether or not the paragraph has a previous viewpoint that corresponds to another. From the content of the inserted sentence, another point of view derived is fantasy. After reading the ABCD, it was found that there was no first point of view (usually possible to use the word first to guide), the whole is discussing the impact of fantasy on children, so, A should be placed in the first paragraph.</p></div></div><div id="question14" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>
