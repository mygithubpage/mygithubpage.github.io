one must first <span class="highlight">consider</span> their environment, which we think of as "jungle" or "<span class="highlight">tropical</span> rainforest."  <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>This view is inaccurate, and the <span class="highlight">reason</span> proves to be important.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>Properly speaking, <span class="highlight">tropical</span> rainforests grow in high-rainfall <span class="highlight">equatorial</span> areas that <span class="highlight">remain</span> wet or <span class="highlight">humid</span> all year round. But the Maya homeland lies more than sixteen hundred 
kilometers from the <span class="highlight">equator</span>, at latitudes 17 to 22 degrees north, in a <span class="highlight">habitat</span> termed a "<span class="highlight">seasonal</span><span class="highlight">tropical</span> forest."  <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>That is, while there does <span class="highlight">tend</span> to be a rainy <span class="highlight">season</span> from May to October, 
there is also a dry <span class="highlight">season</span> from January <span class="highlight">through</span> April. If one focuses on the wet months, one calls the Maya homeland a "<span class="highlight">seasonal</span><span class="highlight">tropical</span> forest"; if one focuses on the dry months, 
one could <span class="highlight">instead</span><span class="highlight">describe</span> it as a "<span class="highlight">seasonal</span><span class="highlight">desert</span>."  <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p><p>From north to south in the Yucatan <span class="highlight">Peninsula</span>, where the Maya lived, <span class="highlight">rainfall</span> ranges from 18 to 100 inches (457 to 2,540 millimeters) per year, and the soils become thicker, so that the southern <span class="highlight">peninsula</span> was agriculturally more <span class="highlight">productive</span> and supported denser populations. But <span class="highlight">rainfall</span> in the Maya homeland is unpredictably <span class="highlight">variable</span> between years; some recent years have had three or four times more rain than other years. As a result, modern farmers attempting to grow corn in the <span class="highlight">ancient</span> Maya homelands have faced frequent crop failures, especially in the north. The <span class="highlight">ancient</span> Maya were <span class="highlight">presumably</span> more experienced and did better, but <span class="highlight">nevertheless</span> they too must have faced risks of crop failures from droughts and hurricanes.</p><p>Although southern Maya areas received more <span class="highlight">rainfall</span> than northern areas, problems of water were <span class="question4">paradoxically</span> more <span class="highlight">severe</span> in the wet south. While that made things hard for <span class="highlight">ancient</span> Maya living in the south, it has also made things hard for modern archaeologists who have difficulty understanding why <span class="highlight">ancient</span> droughts caused bigger problems in the wet south than in the dry north. <span class="question5">The likely explanation</span> is that an area of <span class="highlight">underground</span> freshwater underlies the Yucatan <span class="highlight">Peninsula</span>, but surface <span class="highlight">elevation</span> increases from north to south, so that as one moves south the land surface lies increasingly higher above the water table. In the northern <span class="highlight">peninsula</span> the <span class="highlight">elevation</span> is <span class="highlight">sufficiently</span> low that the <span class="highlight">ancient</span> Maya were able to <span class="highlight">reach</span> the water table at deep sinkholes called cenotes, or at deep caves. In low-elevation north coastal areas without sinkholes, the Maya would have been able to get down to the water table by digging wells up to 75 feet (22 meters) deep. But much of the south lies too high above the water table for cenotes or wells to <span class="highlight">reach</span> down to it. Making matters worse, most of the Yucatan <span class="highlight">Peninsula</span> consists of karst, a <span class="highlight">porous</span> sponge-like <span class="highlight">limestone</span><span class="highlight">terrain</span> where rain runs straight into the ground and where little or no surface water remains <span class="highlight">available</span>.</p><p>How did those <span class="highlight"><span class="highlight">dense</span></span> southern Maya populations <span class="highlight">deal</span> with the resulting water problem? It <span class="highlight">initially</span> surprises us that many of their cities were not built next to the rivers but <span class="highlight">instead</span> on high <span class="highlight">terrain</span> in rolling uplands. <span class="question8">The explanation is that the Maya excavated depressions, or modified natural depressions, and then plugged up leaks in the karst by plastering the bottoms of the depressions in order to create reservoirs, which collected rain from large plastered catchment basins and stored it for use in the dry <span class="highlight">season</span>.</span> For example, reservoirs at the Maya city of Tikal held enough water to meet the drinking water needs of about 10,000 people for a period of 18 months. At the city of Coba the Maya built dikes around a lake in order to <span class="highlight">raise</span> its <span class="highlight">level</span> and make their water <span class="highlight">supply</span> more <span class="highlight">reliable</span>. But the inhabitants of Tikal and other cities dependent on reservoirs for drinking water would still have been in deep trouble if 18 months passed without rain in a <span class="highlight"><span class="question10">prolonged</span></span><span class="highlight">drought</span>. A shorter <span class="highlight">drought</span> in which they <span class="question11">exhausted</span> their stored food supplies might already have gotten them in deep trouble, because growing crops required rain rather than reservoirs.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the author call the Mayan homeland both a "seasonal tropical forest" and "seasonal desert"?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To illustrate how the climate of the Mayan homeland varied from region to region</p><p>B. To explain how the climate of the Mayan homeland is similar to that of a jungle or tropical rainforest</p><p>C. To emphasize the vast size of the area that comprised the Mayan homeland in ancient times</p><p>D. To make the point that the Mayan homeland is climatically more complex than is generally assumed</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The title of the function, the sentence where the rhetorical point is located is just an example. In the past, the previous sentence said that there was a dry season in the rainy season. Therefore, the answer is D, and the climate in Maya is complex and changeable. A. Didn't say the original in different regions; B didn't say dry season, wrong; C explained maya area.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the following is NOT mentioned in paragraph 2 as a difference between the northern and southern Yucatan Peninsula?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The annual rainfall was greater in the south.</p><p>B. The population density was lower in the north.</p><p>C. Agricultural productivity was greater in the south</p><p>D. Rainfall was more unpredictable and variable in the south.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D EXCEPT questions, exclusion. A's rainfall keyword positioning to the first sentence, from north to south 18 to 100 inches, is obviously North Xiaonan University, so A correct, not selected; B's population density keywords positioning to the first sentence, said southern denser , so the northern density is small and correct, not selected; C's productivity keyword positioning to the first sentence, said the southern more productive, correct, not selected; so the answer is D.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the following statements about ancient and modem agriculture in the Yucatan Peninsula is supported by paragraph 2?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Modern agricultural methods have solved many of the ancient problems of farming in the Yucatan Peninsula.</p><p>B. Ancient Mayan farmers may have been somewhat more successful at farming in the Yucatan Peninsula than farmers are today.</p><p>C. Farming today is easier than in the past because environmental changes in the Yucatan Peninsula have increased available rainfall</p><p>D. The Yucatan soils in which ancient farmers worked were richer, more productive, and thicker than they are today.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B, as the proper noun appears in the first sentence, so the whole paragraph is talking about this place, obviously not suitable for keywords, with ancient and modern keyword positioning to the bottom of the sentence, saying that modern and ancient Mayans will also encounter To the same problem, but to a certain extent, the ancients solved better than modern people, so the answer is B. A said that modern people have solved the problems of the previous generation and said that they are opposed; neither C and D have said anything.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question4">paradoxically</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. usually</p><p>B. surprisingly</p><p>C. understandably</p><p>D. predictably</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>B <span class="question4">paradoxically</span>: <span class="question4">paradoxically</span>, abnormally. A is common; B is surprising, unexpected; C is understandable; D is predictable. So the correct answer is B.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The phrase "<span class="highlight"><span class="question5">The likely explanation</span></span>" in the passage refers to the explanation for why</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. the southern Maya areas received more rainfall than the northern areas</p><p>B. modern archaeologists have difficulty understanding ancient droughts</p><p>C. water problems were most severe in the wet south</p><p>D. land surface in the south is so high above the water table</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" C"><p>C. Which explanation could explain which question, according to the common sense, must be given a question before giving a possible explanation. In the past, the previous question was asked, and the previous question raised a question as to why the problem of water shortage in the previously wet southern region was worse than dryness. The northern region is more serious, so the answer is C. If you are not sure, you can look at the contents of the exposition of this sentence and also explain why the south is rather short of water.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the following statements about the availability of water in the Mayan homeland is supported by paragraph 3?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The construction of wells was an uncommon practice in both the north and the south because it was too difficult to dig through the karst.</p><p>B. In most areas in the north and the south, rainwater was absorbed directly into the porous karst.</p><p>C. The water table was an important resource for agriculture in both the north and the south of the Yucatan Peninsula.</p><p>D. The lack of surface water in both the north and the south was probably due to the fact that most of it was quickly used up for agricultural purposes.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B. The whole paragraph supports the following, so it is best to use the elimination method. A's well keyword positioning to the penultimate sentence and the penultimate sentence, the original said that drilling wells in the north is easy, the southern hard, so A wrong; B's karst keyword positioning to the last sentence, said that most areas are karst Landforms, so B is correct; C's water table is positioned to the third sentence and the penultimate sentence, did not mention the importance, so C is wrong; D in the original text does not correspond.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 3, why was the southern Mayan homeland hard to farm?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The presence of numerous sinkholes and wells interfered with farming.</p><p>B. Southern soil lacked the depth crops needed for growth.</p><p>C. Underground water was too far below the surface to reach.</p><p>D. The presence of karst caused frequent flooding.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The only direct description of the southern dilemma in this paragraph is the third sentence and the last two sentences, which describe two characteristics: 1) high above water table, unable to drill for water; 2) high permeability, little surface water left . Therefore, the C option is correct. A sinkhole keyword positioning to the penultimate fourth sentence, the original did not say sinkhole interfered with the development of agriculture, so A wrong; B did not say in the article, wrong; D flooding original did not say.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Southern Maya populations obtained the water they needed for the dry season by collecting and storing rainwater in sealed depressions.</p><p>B. The Maya are credited with creating methods for modifying natural rainwater and storing it.</p><p>C. Leaks in the karst caused difficulties in the creation of reservoirs, which were needed to store water for the dry season.</p><p>D. Southern Mayans were more successful at collecting rain than storing it during dry seasons.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The structure of the original text of the A is that the Maya dug depression or rested the depression that was originally there to hold the water. A fully embodies this structure, correct; B steals the concept, the original says modify is depression, not rain; C changes the subject of the original text completely and wrongly; the original has no comparison, so D is wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What can be inferred from paragraph 4 about how residents of Tikal met their needs for water and food during most periods of drought?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They depended upon water and food that had been stored for use during the dry season.</p><p>B. They obtained drinking water and water for crop irrigation from Coba dikes.</p><p>C. They located their population centers near a lake where water was available for drinking and watering crops.</p><p>D. They moved locations every 18 months to find new croplands and water sources.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A uses the proper nouns and the toughing keyword to locate the penultimate sentence, saying that they are relying on reservoir, so the answer is A, they stored; B's Coba dikes, C's lake and D's new croplands did not say.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question10">prolonged</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. unusual</p><p>B. unexpected</p><p>C. extended</p><p>D. disastrous</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" C"><p>C <span class="question10">prolonged</span>: extended, long-term. A is unusual; B is unexpected; C is <span class="question10">prolonged</span>; D is catastrophic. So answer C.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question11">exhausted</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. used up</p><p>B. reduced</p><p>C. wasted</p><p>D. relied upon</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" A"><p>A : exhaust: Consumed and used up. A is used up and <span class="question11">exhausted</span>; B is reduced; C is wasted; D is dependent. So the answer is A.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The difference between the two climates challenged the Maya who had to deal with both..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D, three transition points, noun difference, noun two climates and pronouns both, two points must be mentioned before the correct insertion point. The author did not finish the two climates until D, so the answer is only D.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="table"><div class="question"><p>Select from the seven phrases below the phrases that correctly characterize the southern Mayan homeland and the phrases that correctly characterize the northern Mayan homeland.

Therefore, please use the exclusion method for those who are unclear. Use the proper nouns in the city option as keywords to locate the second-last sentence of the fourth paragraph. Look at the beginning and find that the whole paragraph is saying south, so this belongs to south. Predictable rainfall keyword positioning to the second paragraph, found that the original did not say North and South, this is not an option for any column. The water table keyword positioning to the third sentence of the penultimate sentence, said that the south water table is high, so this option should belong to south. Targeting the reservoirs to the third paragraph of the fourth paragraph, speaking of T City, that is, this option should be the same column as the first option, so it should also belong to south. With wells as the key word to the second and last sentences of the third paragraph, it is easy to drill wells in the north and not easy in the south, so this should belong to the north. The tunable option was not originally described, not an option in any of the columns. The keyword "layer of soil" is used to locate the first sentence of the second paragraph. It is said that from north to south, the soil layer is getting thicker and the north is thinner, so this option should be north.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
