            <b>Maya Water Problems</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>To understand the <span class="highlight">ancient</span> Mayan people who lived in the area that is today southern Mexico and Central America and the <span class="highlight">ecological</span> difficulties they faced,
one must first <span class="highlight">consider</span> their environment, which we think of as "jungle" or "<span class="highlight">tropical</span> rainforest."  <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>This view is inaccurate, and the <span class="highlight">reason</span> proves to be important.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>Properly speaking, <span class="highlight">tropical</span> rainforests grow in high-rainfall <span class="highlight">equatorial</span> areas that <span class="highlight">remain</span> wet or <span class="highlight">humid</span> all year round. But the Maya homeland lies more than sixteen hundred 
kilometers from the <span class="highlight">equator</span>, at latitudes 17 to 22 degrees north, in a <span class="highlight">habitat</span> termed a "<span class="highlight">seasonal</span> <span class="highlight">tropical</span> forest."  <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>That is, while there does <span class="highlight">tend</span> to be a rainy <span class="highlight">season</span> from May to October, 
there is also a dry <span class="highlight">season</span> from January <span class="highlight">through</span> April. If one focuses on the wet months, one calls the Maya homeland a "<span class="highlight">seasonal</span> <span class="highlight">tropical</span> forest"; if one focuses on the dry months, 
one could <span class="highlight">instead</span> <span class="highlight">describe</span> it as a "<span class="highlight">seasonal</span> <span class="highlight">desert</span>."  <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p>
          <p>From north to south in the Yucatan <span class="highlight">Peninsula</span>, where the Maya lived, <span class="highlight">rainfall</span> ranges from 18 to 100 inches (457 to 2,540 millimeters) per year, and the soils become thicker, so that the southern <span class="highlight">peninsula</span> was agriculturally more <span class="highlight">productive</span> and supported denser populations. But <span class="highlight">rainfall</span> in the Maya homeland is unpredictably <span class="highlight">variable</span> between years; some recent years have had three or four times more rain than other years. As a result, modern farmers attempting to grow corn in the <span class="highlight">ancient</span> Maya homelands have faced frequent crop failures, especially in the north. The <span class="highlight">ancient</span> Maya were <span class="highlight">presumably</span> more experienced and did better, but <span class="highlight">nevertheless</span> they too must have faced risks of crop failures from droughts and hurricanes.</p>
          <p>Although southern Maya areas received more <span class="highlight">rainfall</span> than northern areas, problems of water were <span class="question4">paradoxically </span>more <span class="highlight">severe</span> in the wet south. While that made things hard for <span class="highlight">ancient</span> Maya living in the south, it has also made things hard for modern archaeologists who have difficulty understanding why <span class="highlight">ancient</span> droughts caused bigger problems in the wet south than in the dry north. <span class="question5">The likely explanation </span>is that an area of <span class="highlight">underground</span> freshwater underlies the Yucatan <span class="highlight">Peninsula</span>, but surface <span class="highlight">elevation</span> increases from north to south, so that as one moves south the land surface lies increasingly higher above the water table. In the northern <span class="highlight">peninsula</span> the <span class="highlight">elevation</span> is <span class="highlight">sufficiently</span> low that the <span class="highlight">ancient</span> Maya were able to <span class="highlight">reach</span> the water table at deep sinkholes called cenotes, or at deep caves. In low-elevation north coastal areas without sinkholes, the Maya would have been able to get down to the water table by digging wells up to 75 feet (22 meters) deep. But much of the south lies too high above the water table for cenotes or wells to <span class="highlight">reach</span> down to it. Making matters worse, most of the Yucatan <span class="highlight">Peninsula</span> consists of karst, a <span class="highlight">porous</span> sponge-like <span class="highlight">limestone</span> <span class="highlight">terrain</span> where rain runs straight into the ground and where little or no surface water remains <span class="highlight">available</span>.</p>
          <p>How did those <span class="highlight"><span class="highlight">dense</span></span> southern Maya populations <span class="highlight">deal</span> with the resulting water problem? It <span class="highlight">initially</span> surprises us that many of their cities were not built next to the rivers but <span class="highlight">instead</span> on high <span class="highlight">terrain</span> in rolling uplands. <span class="question8">The explanation is that the Maya excavated depressions, or modified natural depressions, and then plugged up leaks in the karst by plastering the bottoms of the depressions in order to create reservoirs, which collected rain from large plastered catchment basins and stored it for use in the dry <span class="highlight">season</span>. </span>For example, reservoirs at the Maya city of Tikal held enough water to meet the drinking water needs of about 10,000 people for a period of 18 months. At the city of Coba the Maya built dikes around a lake in order to <span class="highlight">raise</span> its <span class="highlight">level</span> and make their water <span class="highlight">supply</span> more <span class="highlight">reliable</span>. But the inhabitants of Tikal and other cities dependent on reservoirs for drinking water would still have been in deep trouble if 18 months passed without rain in a <span class="highlight">prolonged</span> <span class="highlight">drought</span>. A shorter <span class="highlight">drought</span> in which they <span class="question11">exhausted </span>their stored food supplies might already have gotten them in deep trouble, because growing crops required rain rather than reservoirs.</p>
