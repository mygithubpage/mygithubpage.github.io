            <b>Pastoralism in Ancient Inner Eurasia</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>Pastoralism is a lifestyle in which <span class="highlight">economic</span> <span class="highlight">activity</span> is based <span class="highlight">primarily</span> on <span class="highlight">livestock</span>. <span class="highlight">Archaeological</span> <span class="highlight">evidence</span> suggests that by 3000 B.C., and perhaps <span class="highlight">even</span> earlier, there had emerged on the steppes of <span class="highlight">Inner</span> <span class="highlight">Eurasia</span> the <span class="highlight">distinctive</span> types of pastoralism that were to <span class="highlight">dominate</span> the <span class="highlight">region</span>'s <span class="highlight">history</span> for several <span class="highlight">millennia</span>. Here, the horse was already becoming the animal of <span class="question1"><span class="highlight">prestige</span></span> in many regions, though sheep, goats, and <span class="highlight">cattle</span> could also play a <span class="highlight">vital</span> role. It is the use of horses for <span class="highlight">transportation</span> and <span class="highlight">warfare</span> that explains why <span class="highlight">Inner</span> Eurasian pastoralism proved the most <span class="highlight">mobile</span> and the most militaristic of all <span class="highlight">major</span> forms of pastoralism. The <span class="highlight">emergence</span> and <span class="highlight">spread</span> of pastoralism had a <span class="highlight">profound</span> <span class="highlight">impact</span> on the <span class="highlight">history</span> of <span class="highlight">Inner</span> <span class="highlight">Eurasia</span>, and also, indirectly, on the parts of Asia and Europe just outside this area. In <span class="highlight">particular</span>, pastoralism favors a <span class="highlight">mobile</span> lifestyle, and this <span class="highlight">mobility</span> helps to explain the <span class="highlight">impact</span> of pastoralist societies on this part of the world.</p>
          <p>The <span class="highlight">mobility</span> of pastoralist societies reflects their dependence on animal-based foods. While agriculturalists <span class="highlight">rely</span> on <span class="highlight">domesticated</span> plants, pastoralists <span class="highlight">rely</span> on <span class="highlight">domesticated</span> animals. As a result, pastoralists, like carnivores in general, <span class="highlight">occupy</span> a higher <span class="highlight">position</span> on the food <span class="highlight">chain</span>. All else being <span class="highlight">equal</span>, this means they must <span class="highlight">exploit</span> larger areas of land than do agriculturalists to <span class="highlight">secure</span> the same <span class="highlight">amount</span> of food, clothing, and other necessities. So pastoralism is a more <span class="highlight">extensive</span> lifeway than farming is. However, the larger the <span class="highlight">terrain</span> used to support a group, the harder it is to <span class="highlight">exploit</span> that <span class="highlight">terrain</span> while <span class="highlight">remaining</span> in one place. So, <span class="highlight">basic</span> <span class="highlight">ecological</span> principles <span class="highlight">imply</span> a strong <span class="highlight">tendency</span> <span class="highlight">within</span> pastoralist lifeways toward nomadism (a <span class="highlight">mobile</span> lifestyle). As the archaeologist Roger Cribb puts it, "The greater the <span class="highlight">degree</span> of pastoralism, the stronger the <span class="highlight">tendency</span> toward nomadism." A modern Turkic nomad interviewed by Cribb commented: "The more animals you have, the farther you have to move."</p>
          <p>Nomadism has further consequences. It means that pastoralist societies <span class="highlight">occupy</span> and can influence very large territories. This is particularly true of the horse pastoralism that emerged in the <span class="highlight">Inner</span> Eurasian steppes, for this was the most <span class="highlight">mobile</span> of all <span class="highlight">major</span> forms of pastoralism. So, it is no <span class="highlight">accident</span> that with the <span class="highlight">appearance</span> of pastoralist societies there <span class="highlight">appear</span> large areas that share <span class="highlight">similar</span> cultural, <span class="highlight">ecological</span>, and <span class="highlight">even</span> <span class="highlight">linguistic</span> features. By the late fourth <span class="highlight">millennium</span> B.C., there is already <span class="highlight">evidence</span> of large <span class="highlight">culture</span> zones reaching from Eastern Europe to the western borders of Mongolia. Perhaps the most <span class="highlight"><span class="question7">striking</span> </span>sign of <span class="highlight">mobility</span> is the fact that by the third <span class="highlight">millennium</span> B.C., most pastoralists in this huge <span class="highlight">region</span> spoke related languages ancestral to the modern Indo-European languages. The <span class="highlight">remarkable</span> <span class="highlight">mobility</span> and <span class="highlight">range</span> of <span class="highlight">pastoral</span> societies explain, in part, why so many linguists have argued that the Indo-European languages began their astonishing expansionist <span class="highlight">career</span> not among farmers in Anatolia (present-day <span class="highlight">Turkey</span>), but among early pastoralists from <span class="highlight">Inner</span> <span class="highlight">Eurasia</span>. Such theories <span class="highlight">imply</span> that the Indo-European languages evolved not in <span class="highlight">Neolithic</span> (10,000 to 3,000 B.C.) Anatolia, but among the foraging communities of the cultures in the <span class="highlight">region</span> of the Don and Dnieper rivers, which took up <span class="highlight">stock</span> <span class="highlight">breeding</span> and began to <span class="highlight">exploit</span> the neighboring steppes.</p>
          <p>Nomadism also subjects pastoralist communities to <span class="highlight"><span class="question9">strict</span> rules of portability. </span><span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>If you are <span class="highlight">constantly</span> on the move, you cannot <span class="highlight">afford</span> to <span class="highlight">accumulate</span> large <span class="highlight">material</span> surpluses. 
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>Such rules limit variations in accumulated <span class="highlight">material</span> goods between pastoralist households (though they may also <span class="highlight">encourage</span> a <span class="highlight">taste</span> for <span class="highlight">portable</span> goods of high value such as silks or <span class="highlight">jewelry</span>).
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>So, by and large, nomadism implies a high <span class="highlight">degree</span> of self-sufficiency and inhibits the <span class="highlight">appearance</span> of an <span class="highlight">extensive</span> <span class="highlight">division</span> of labor. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>Inequalities of wealth and <span class="highlight">rank</span> certainly exist,
and have probably existed in most pastoralist societies, but except in periods of <span class="highlight">military</span> <span class="highlight">conquest</span>, they are <span class="highlight">normally</span> too <span class="highlight">slight</span> to <span class="highlight">generate</span> the <span class="highlight">stable</span>, <span class="highlight">hereditary</span> hierarchies 
that are usually implied by the use of the <span class="highlight">term</span> class. <span class="question11">Inequalities of <span class="highlight">gender</span> have also existed in pastoralist societies, but they <span class="highlight">seem</span> to have been softened by the <span class="highlight">absence</span> of <span class="highlight">steep</span> hierarchies of wealth in most communities, and also by the requirement that women <span class="highlight">acquire</span> most of the skills of men, </span>including, often, their <span class="highlight">military</span> skills.</p>
