Here, the horse was already becoming the animal of <span class="highlight question1">prestige</span> in many regions, though sheep, goats, and <span class="highlight">cattle</span> could also play a <span class="highlight">vital</span> role. It is the use of horses for <span class="highlight">transportation</span> and <span class="highlight">warfare</span> that explains why <span class="highlight">Inner</span> Eurasian pastoralism proved the most <span class="highlight">mobile</span> and the most militaristic of all <span class="highlight">major</span> forms of pastoralism. The <span class="highlight">emergence</span> and <span class="highlight">spread</span> of pastoralism had a <span class="highlight"><span class="question3">profound</span></span><span class="highlight">impact</span> on the <span class="highlight">history</span> of <span class="highlight">Inner</span><span class="highlight">Eurasia</span>, and also, indirectly, on the parts of Asia and Europe just outside this area. In <span class="highlight">particular</span>, pastoralism favors a <span class="highlight">mobile</span> lifestyle, and this <span class="highlight">mobility</span> helps to explain the <span class="highlight">impact</span> of pastoralist societies on this part of the world.</p><p>The <span class="highlight">mobility</span> of pastoralist societies reflects their dependence on animal-based foods. While agriculturalists <span class="highlight">rely</span> on <span class="highlight">domesticated</span> plants, pastoralists <span class="highlight">rely</span> on <span class="highlight">domesticated</span> animals. As a result, pastoralists, like carnivores in general, <span class="highlight">occupy</span> a higher <span class="highlight">position</span> on the food <span class="highlight">chain</span>. All else being <span class="highlight">equal</span>, this means they must <span class="highlight">exploit</span> larger areas of land than do agriculturalists to <span class="highlight">secure</span> the same <span class="highlight">amount</span> of food, clothing, and other necessities. So pastoralism is a more <span class="highlight">extensive</span> lifeway than farming is. However, the larger the <span class="highlight">terrain</span> used to support a group, the harder it is to <span class="highlight">exploit</span> that <span class="highlight">terrain</span> while <span class="highlight">remaining</span> in one place. So, <span class="highlight">basic</span><span class="highlight">ecological</span> principles <span class="highlight">imply</span> a strong <span class="highlight">tendency</span><span class="highlight">within</span> pastoralist lifeways toward nomadism (a <span class="highlight">mobile</span> lifestyle). As the archaeologist Roger Cribb puts it, "The greater the <span class="highlight">degree</span> of pastoralism, the stronger the <span class="highlight">tendency</span> toward nomadism." A modern Turkic nomad interviewed by Cribb commented: "The more animals you have, the farther you have to move."</p><p>Nomadism has further consequences. It means that pastoralist societies <span class="highlight">occupy</span> and can influence very large territories. This is particularly true of the horse pastoralism that emerged in the <span class="highlight">Inner</span> Eurasian steppes, for this was the most <span class="highlight">mobile</span> of all <span class="highlight">major</span> forms of pastoralism. So, it is no <span class="highlight">accident</span> that with the <span class="highlight">appearance</span> of pastoralist societies there <span class="highlight">appear</span> large areas that share <span class="highlight">similar</span> cultural, <span class="highlight">ecological</span>, and <span class="highlight">even</span><span class="highlight">linguistic</span> features. By the late fourth <span class="highlight">millennium</span> B.C., there is already <span class="highlight">evidence</span> of large <span class="highlight">culture</span> zones reaching from Eastern Europe to the western borders of Mongolia. Perhaps the most <span class="highlight"><span class="question7">striking</span></span> sign of <span class="highlight">mobility</span> is the fact that by the third <span class="highlight">millennium</span> B.C., most pastoralists in this huge <span class="highlight">region</span> spoke related languages ancestral to the modern Indo-European languages. The <span class="highlight">remarkable</span><span class="highlight">mobility</span> and <span class="highlight">range</span> of <span class="highlight">pastoral</span> societies explain, in part, why so many linguists have argued that the Indo-European languages began their astonishing expansionist <span class="highlight">career</span> not among farmers in Anatolia (present-day <span class="highlight">Turkey</span>), but among early pastoralists from <span class="highlight">Inner</span><span class="highlight">Eurasia</span>. Such theories <span class="highlight">imply</span> that the Indo-European languages evolved not in <span class="highlight">Neolithic</span> (10,000 to 3,000 B.C.) Anatolia, but among the foraging communities of the cultures in the <span class="highlight">region</span> of the Don and Dnieper rivers, which took up <span class="highlight">stock</span><span class="highlight">breeding</span> and began to <span class="highlight"><span class="question8">exploit</span></span> the neighboring steppes.</p><p>Nomadism also subjects pastoralist communities to <span class="question9"><span class="highlight">strict</span> rules of portability.</span><span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>If you are <span class="highlight">constantly</span> on the move, you cannot <span class="highlight">afford</span> to <span class="highlight">accumulate</span> large <span class="highlight">material</span> surpluses. 
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>Such rules limit variations in accumulated <span class="highlight">material</span> goods between pastoralist households (though they may also <span class="highlight">encourage</span> a <span class="highlight">taste</span> for <span class="highlight">portable</span> goods of high value such as silks or <span class="highlight">jewelry</span>).
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>So, by and large, nomadism implies a high <span class="highlight">degree</span> of self-sufficiency and inhibits the <span class="highlight">appearance</span> of an <span class="highlight">extensive</span><span class="highlight">division</span> of labor. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>Inequalities of wealth and <span class="highlight">rank</span> certainly exist,
and have probably existed in most pastoralist societies, but except in periods of <span class="highlight">military</span><span class="highlight">conquest</span>, they are <span class="highlight">normally</span> too <span class="highlight">slight</span> to <span class="highlight">generate</span> the <span class="highlight">stable</span>, <span class="highlight">hereditary</span> hierarchies 
that are usually implied by the use of the <span class="highlight">term</span> class. <span class="question11">Inequalities of <span class="highlight">gender</span> have also existed in pastoralist societies, but they <span class="highlight">seem</span> to have been softened by the <span class="highlight">absence</span> of <span class="highlight">steep</span> hierarchies of wealth in most communities, and also by the requirement that women <span class="highlight">acquire</span> most of the skills of men</span>, including, often, their <span class="highlight">military</span> skills.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">prestige</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. interest</p><p>B. status</p><p>C. demand</p><p>D. profit</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B prestige: prestige, prestige. A is interest; B is status; C is demand, demand; D is profit, profit. So the status of B is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 1, what made it possible for Inner Eurasian pastoralism to become the most mobile and militaristic form of pastoralism?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It involved the domestication of several types of animals.</p><p>B. It was based primarily on horses rather than on other animals.</p><p>C. It borrowed and improved upon European ideas for mobility and warfare.</p><p>D. It could be adapted to a wide variety of environments.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B uses most mobile and most militarilistic keywords to navigate to the penultimate sentence, saying that using horses as a means of transportation and benefits makes Inner Eurasia pastoralism the most mobile. The answer is B. Although C mentions welfare, it is not borrow, so it is not selected. ;D did not mention in the original.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question3">profound</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. strange</p><p>B. positive</p><p>C. direct</p><p>D. far-reaching</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" D"><p>D, <span class="question3">profound</span>: <span class="question3">profound</span>, <span class="question3">profound</span>. A is strange; B is positive; C is direct; D is far-reaching. So answer D's far-reaching is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>In paragraph 2, why does the author contrast pastoralists with agriculturalists?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To explain why pastoralism requires more land than agriculturalism to support basic needs</p><p>B. To identify some advantages that mobile societies have over immobile societies</p><p>C. To demonstrate that ecological principles that apply to pastoralism do not apply to agriculturalism</p><p>D. To argue that agriculturalism eventually developed out of pastoralism</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A first finds contrasts. The first two sentences of this paragraph respectively describe the characteristics of nomadic peoples and settled peoples. One is to rely on animals and their food, and the other is to domesticate animals. The result of this comparison is followed by the author's purpose for this comparison. Nomadic races, like carnivores, occupy a higher rank in the food chain, so they need more sites. So the purpose of comparison is to explain why nomadic people need to occupy more places. The answer is A. This topic is special, rhetoric purposes behind the sentence where the rhetorical point, need more attention.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 2, pastoralists tend to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. prefer grazing their animals on agricultural lands</p><p>B. consume comparatively large amounts of food and clothing</p><p>C. avoid eating plant foods</p><p>D. move from place to place frequently</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The key words in the D question are difficult to find, but the comparison between the pastalistist and the agriculturalist can be found in the first two or two sentences of this paragraph, and the nomadic people often go around. A is not mentioned in the original text. Item B is in contradiction with the original text. The original text emphasizes the same amount (fourth inning). The fourth sentence of the original text says that the nomadic people must walk around to ensure that the same amount of food and clothing are used, so B is wrong; Said that they are animal-based food, but this does not mean that they do not eat plant food, so C is wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>In paragraph 3, why does the author discuss languages spoken in the region spanning from Eastern Europe to the western borders of Mongolia?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To emphasize the frequency with which Indo-European languages changed as a result of the mobile nature of pastoralism</p><p>B. To indicate one method linguists use to determine that inhabitants of the Don and Dnieper river area had taken up stock breeding</p><p>C. To provide evidence that Indo-European languages have their roots in what is now Turkey</p><p>D. To provide evidence that pastoralist societies can exercise cultural influence over a large area</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D. First, use Eastern Europe and Mongolia as the key words to locate the fourth sentence. The original sentence simply describes an example. In the past, the previous sentence stated that due to the existence of nomadic people, there was a large area of land that shared similar ecology. On cultural, even linguistic, features. Immediately afterwards, an example of language was spoken, so this example of language is to prove the previous text. The answer is D.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question7">striking</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. reliable</p><p>B. noticeable</p><p>C. convincing</p><p>D. violent</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>B strike has the meaning of hitting, knocking or strike, so the strike means obvious, noticeable, noticeable and correct. The first sentence says that in the 4th millennium BC, there was a certain evidence. Then it was said that perhaps the best kind of evidence is that there was already an evidence in front of it. Afterwards, it should be strengthened, so the answer is B. A's reliable and C's convincing meaning is almost the same, is a reliable meaning, the original does not mean this, do not choose; D completely do not fly.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">exploit</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. use to advantage</p><p>B. depart from</p><p>C. pay attention to</p><p>D. travel across</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A exploit exploits, exploits, exploits, so A is correct. This sentence says that the original grass has been used up, and then how to approach the grassland, of course, is to eat the meaning of the nearby grasslands, so we should guess the meaning of development. B clearly said that he should leave the original place to go nearby; C can't go through or pay attention to D, but he can't eat right or he can't eat right.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, the fact that pastoralist communities are subject to "<span class="highlight">strict rules of portability</span>" encourages such communities to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. relocate less frequently than they would otherwise</p><p>B. have households that are more or less equal in wealth</p><p>C. become self-sufficient in the manufacture of silk and jewelry</p><p>D. share large material surpluses with neighboring communities</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="strict rules of portability B"><p>The B keyword has been drawn out, and the first sentence is just saying this matter. After seeing the past, the next sentence is the interpretation of the first sentence, not the answer. The following sentence says that these rules limit the difference in property owned by everyone, which means that everyone's wealth is similar, so the answer is B. Did not introduce the use of exclusion, A's relocate original did not say; C to the original self-sufficient and bracketed example to stir together, steal concept, wrong; D's share original did not say.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, all of the following are true of social inequality in pastoralist societies EXCEPT:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It exists and has existed to some degree in most pastoral societies.</p><p>B. It is most marked during periods of military conquest.</p><p>C. It is expressed in the form of a rigid hierarchy based largely on heredity.</p><p>D. It is usually too insignificant to be discussed in terms of class differences.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C EXCEPT questions, exclusion method, this question is more difficult. A's some degree keyword positioning to the first half of the penultimate paragraph, correct, not selected; B's military conquest keyword positioning to the comma after the penultimate sentence, the original said that in addition to the military conquest are not obvious , that is, B said the military conquest period is obvious, so B is correct, not selected; C's rigid hierarchy do keyword positioning to the second sentence after the penultimate sentence, the original that is usually not obvious, that is not express, and C said that Express, so C said anti, election; D's class difference do keyword positioning to the second sentence after the second sentence, the text said usually not significant, so D said right, not selected.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Despite the fact that wealth is relatively evenly distributed in pastoral societies, gender inequality still exists because only men can acquire military skills and social status.</p><p>B. Inequalities of gender existed in pastoralist societies until most communities began to require women to possess the same skills as men and take part in the military.</p><p>C. Inequalities of gender in pastoralist societies were caused by steep hierarchies of wealth and differences in military training between men and women.</p><p>D. In pastoral societies, gender inequality is comparatively mild because wealth is relatively evenly distributed and women have to learn most of the same skills that men do.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D: The main logic of the original sentence is the turning point, and the secondary logic is the parallelism. The structure of the original sentence is inequality but because both factors are weakened. A has a turning point in the original text, but the reasons given later are reversed, and a closer look at what happened after the fact is also not the same as the original text, so A is wrong; B's up to what time the original text does not exist, and the text's very important predicate softened The answer is not, so wrong; C only said the reasons, did not say weakened, wrong; D correct.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>There is a good reason for this..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A. There is only one transition point for this question, that is, reason, which means that the two sentences before and after the correct insertion point must be causal, and the sentence to be inserted is only a transitional nonsense. The sentence should be the result before inserting the sentence, and the reason after inserting the sentence. After point A, the reason why the nomads followed the rules was stated. If we can't see that we can use the elimination method, such rules as B must precede such rules, so B excludes; C said that everything is similar, and later said that they have to be self-sufficient. This place is also very causal, so C excludes, and it can't be there is a reason for this and then a so; D before and after is not a cause and effect in any case, so D is wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>, a distinctive form of pastoralism had appeared on the steppes of Inner Eurasia.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.The domesticated horse is primarily responsible for Inner Eurasian pastoralism's success in mobility and warfare.</p><p>B.As pastoralists traveled across large areas of terrain with their domesticated animals, they traded valuable material goods such as silks and jewelry.</p><p>C.Because pastoralists are highly mobile, they tend to have few material possessions and can influence the culture, ecology, and language of very large areas</p><p>D.Because pastoralism requires a great deal of land to support its animal-based lifeway, pastoralists must continually relocate and have comparatively egalitarian societies.</p><p>E.Most scholars now believe that Indo-European languages probably evolved during the Neolithic period in the region of the Don and Dnieper rivers.</p><p>F.Pastoralist communities do not have social classes in the usual sense because they value spiritual attainment over material wealth.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="ACD"><p>The ACD the domesticated option corresponds to the first sentence of the original text, correct. The as pastoralists options did not say the original, although the mention of jewelry, but did not say trade, and even if it is the details, do not choose. Because the pastoralists option corresponds to the first sentence and the second sentence of the third paragraph of the original text, correct. Because the pastoralism option corresponds to the fourth paragraph of the original text, correct. The most option is a detail of the third paragraph, not selected. Pastoralist options did not say the original, do not choose.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
