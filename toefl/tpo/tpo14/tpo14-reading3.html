          <h4 class="w3-center">Pastoralism in Ancient Inner Eurasia</h4>
          <p>Pastoralism is a lifestyle in which <span class="highlight">economic</span> <span class="highlight">activity</span> is based <span class="highlight">primarily</span> on <span class="highlight">livestock</span>. <span class="highlight">Archaeological</span> <span class="highlight">evidence</span> suggests that by 3000 B.C., and perhaps <span class="highlight">even</span> earlier, there had emerged on the steppes of <span class="highlight">Inner</span> <span class="highlight">Eurasia</span> the <span class="highlight">distinctive</span> types of pastoralism that were to <span class="highlight">dominate</span> the <span class="highlight">region</span>'s <span class="highlight">history</span> for several <span class="highlight">millennia</span>. Here, the horse was already becoming the animal of <span class="highlight question1">prestige</span> in many regions, though sheep, goats, and <span class="highlight">cattle</span> could also play a <span class="highlight">vital</span> role. It is the use of horses for <span class="highlight">transportation</span> and <span class="highlight">warfare</span> that explains why <span class="highlight">Inner</span> Eurasian pastoralism proved the most <span class="highlight">mobile</span> and the most militaristic of all <span class="highlight">major</span> forms of pastoralism. The <span class="highlight">emergence</span> and <span class="highlight">spread</span> of pastoralism had a <span class="highlight"><span class="question3">profound</span></span> <span class="highlight">impact</span> on the <span class="highlight">history</span> of <span class="highlight">Inner</span> <span class="highlight">Eurasia</span>, and also, indirectly, on the parts of Asia and Europe just outside this area. In <span class="highlight">particular</span>, pastoralism favors a <span class="highlight">mobile</span> lifestyle, and this <span class="highlight">mobility</span> helps to explain the <span class="highlight">impact</span> of pastoralist societies on this part of the world.</p>
          <p>The <span class="highlight">mobility</span> of pastoralist societies reflects their dependence on animal-based foods. While agriculturalists <span class="highlight">rely</span> on <span class="highlight">domesticated</span> plants, pastoralists <span class="highlight">rely</span> on <span class="highlight">domesticated</span> animals. As a result, pastoralists, like carnivores in general, <span class="highlight">occupy</span> a higher <span class="highlight">position</span> on the food <span class="highlight">chain</span>. All else being <span class="highlight">equal</span>, this means they must <span class="highlight">exploit</span> larger areas of land than do agriculturalists to <span class="highlight">secure</span> the same <span class="highlight">amount</span> of food, clothing, and other necessities. So pastoralism is a more <span class="highlight">extensive</span> lifeway than farming is. However, the larger the <span class="highlight">terrain</span> used to support a group, the harder it is to <span class="highlight">exploit</span> that <span class="highlight">terrain</span> while <span class="highlight">remaining</span> in one place. So, <span class="highlight">basic</span> <span class="highlight">ecological</span> principles <span class="highlight">imply</span> a strong <span class="highlight">tendency</span> <span class="highlight">within</span> pastoralist lifeways toward nomadism (a <span class="highlight">mobile</span> lifestyle). As the archaeologist Roger Cribb puts it, "The greater the <span class="highlight">degree</span> of pastoralism, the stronger the <span class="highlight">tendency</span> toward nomadism." A modern Turkic nomad interviewed by Cribb commented: "The more animals you have, the farther you have to move."</p>
          <p>Nomadism has further consequences. It means that pastoralist societies <span class="highlight">occupy</span> and can influence very large territories. This is particularly true of the horse pastoralism that emerged in the <span class="highlight">Inner</span> Eurasian steppes, for this was the most <span class="highlight">mobile</span> of all <span class="highlight">major</span> forms of pastoralism. So, it is no <span class="highlight">accident</span> that with the <span class="highlight">appearance</span> of pastoralist societies there <span class="highlight">appear</span> large areas that share <span class="highlight">similar</span> cultural, <span class="highlight">ecological</span>, and <span class="highlight">even</span> <span class="highlight">linguistic</span> features. By the late fourth <span class="highlight">millennium</span> B.C., there is already <span class="highlight">evidence</span> of large <span class="highlight">culture</span> zones reaching from Eastern Europe to the western borders of Mongolia. Perhaps the most <span class="highlight"><span class="question7">striking</span></span> sign of <span class="highlight">mobility</span> is the fact that by the third <span class="highlight">millennium</span> B.C., most pastoralists in this huge <span class="highlight">region</span> spoke related languages ancestral to the modern Indo-European languages. The <span class="highlight">remarkable</span> <span class="highlight">mobility</span> and <span class="highlight">range</span> of <span class="highlight">pastoral</span> societies explain, in part, why so many linguists have argued that the Indo-European languages began their astonishing expansionist <span class="highlight">career</span> not among farmers in Anatolia (present-day <span class="highlight">Turkey</span>), but among early pastoralists from <span class="highlight">Inner</span> <span class="highlight">Eurasia</span>. Such theories <span class="highlight">imply</span> that the Indo-European languages evolved not in <span class="highlight">Neolithic</span> (10,000 to 3,000 B.C.) Anatolia, but among the foraging communities of the cultures in the <span class="highlight">region</span> of the Don and Dnieper rivers, which took up <span class="highlight">stock</span> <span class="highlight">breeding</span> and began to <span class="highlight"><span class="question8">exploit</span></span> the neighboring steppes.</p>
          <p>Nomadism also subjects pastoralist communities to <span class="question9"><span class="highlight">strict</span> rules of portability.</span> <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>If you are <span class="highlight">constantly</span> on the move, you cannot <span class="highlight">afford</span> to <span class="highlight">accumulate</span> large <span class="highlight">material</span> surpluses. 
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>Such rules limit variations in accumulated <span class="highlight">material</span> goods between pastoralist households (though they may also <span class="highlight">encourage</span> a <span class="highlight">taste</span> for <span class="highlight">portable</span> goods of high value such as silks or <span class="highlight">jewelry</span>).
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>So, by and large, nomadism implies a high <span class="highlight">degree</span> of self-sufficiency and inhibits the <span class="highlight">appearance</span> of an <span class="highlight">extensive</span> <span class="highlight">division</span> of labor. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>Inequalities of wealth and <span class="highlight">rank</span> certainly exist,
and have probably existed in most pastoralist societies, but except in periods of <span class="highlight">military</span> <span class="highlight">conquest</span>, they are <span class="highlight">normally</span> too <span class="highlight">slight</span> to <span class="highlight">generate</span> the <span class="highlight">stable</span>, <span class="highlight">hereditary</span> hierarchies 
that are usually implied by the use of the <span class="highlight">term</span> class. <span class="question11">Inequalities of <span class="highlight">gender</span> have also existed in pastoralist societies, but they <span class="highlight">seem</span> to have been softened by the <span class="highlight">absence</span> of <span class="highlight">steep</span> hierarchies of wealth in most communities, and also by the requirement that women <span class="highlight">acquire</span> most of the skills of men</span>, including, often, their <span class="highlight">military</span> skills.</p>

              <p>A first finds contrasts. The first two sentences of this paragraph respectively describe the characteristics of nomadic peoples and settled peoples. One is to rely on animals and their food, and the other is to domesticate animals. The result of this comparison is followed by the author's purpose for this comparison. Nomadic races, like carnivores, occupy a higher rank in the food chain, so they need more sites. So the purpose of comparison is to explain why nomadic people need to occupy more places. The answer is A. This topic is special, rhetoric purposes behind the sentence where the rhetorical point, need more attention.</p>

A is not mentioned in the original text. Item B is in contradiction with the original text. The original text emphasizes the same amount (fourth inning). The fourth sentence of the original text says that the nomadic people must walk around to ensure that the same amount of food and clothing are used, so B is wrong; Said that they are animal-based food, but this does not mean that they do not eat plant food, so C is wrong.</p>

Immediately afterwards, an example of language was spoken, so this example of language is to prove the previous text. The answer is D.</p>

              <p>B strike has the meaning of hitting, knocking or strike, so the strike means obvious, noticeable, noticeable and correct. The first sentence says that in the 4th millennium BC, there was a certain evidence. Then it was said that perhaps the best kind of evidence is that there was already an evidence in front of it. Afterwards, it should be strengthened, so the answer is B. A's reliable and C's convincing meaning is almost the same, is a reliable meaning, the original does not mean this, do not choose; D completely do not fly.</p>
