Use specific examples and details to support your opinion.</p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>I totally agree with this statement that making mistakes is one of the best ways to learn. Through mistakes, we can learn what we don't understand. After understanding the things we don't know previously, we improve. Like in high school I had difficulty solving math problems. But I always remembered the problems I couldn't solve. After asking teachers and discussing with classmates, I could work out these problems easily. Then I improved. Also, sometimes making a mistake is like learning a lesson. When I first went to a western restaurant, I directly went in to find empty seats. Fortunately, my American friend pulled me back and told me that I should wait until a waiter comes by and takes me to the seats. I make a mistake but I gained knowledge.</p></article></div></main></body></html>
