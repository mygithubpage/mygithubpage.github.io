            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.56" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in an <span class="underline">archaeology</span> class. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="20.25" data-time="6.56">[00:06.56]</span>Professor: Between 11,000 and 10,000 B.C.E., North America was populated by a wide <span class="underline">variety</span> of great beasts, like <span class="underline">mammoth</span> and mastodons, both elephant-like creatures with big tusks, and camels, <span class="underline">giant</span> sloths, the <span class="underline">list</span> goes on. <span class="time" data-times="7.4" data-time="26.81">[00:26.81]</span>By about 10,000 B.C.E., all those <span class="underline">giant</span> creatures, the Metgauna of North America were gone.<span class="time" data-times="4.18" data-time="34.21">[00:34.21]</span>We don't know exactly what happened to them, but there are some theories. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.75" data-time="38.39">[00:38.39]</span>One <span class="underline">theory</span> is that they were hunted to <span class="underline">extinction</span> by humans.<span class="time" data-times="8.35" data-time="42.14">[00:42.14]</span>The humans who coexisted with these <span class="underline">giant</span> <span class="underline">species</span> in North America at that time were what we today called the Clovis People. <span class="time" data-times="12.48" data-time="50.49">[00:50.49]</span>And there is a Clovis site in a <span class="underline">valley</span> in southern California where the remains of thirteen mammoths were found. <span class="time" data-times="5.47" data-time="62.97">[01:02.97]</span>And <span class="underline">spear</span> points, tools for processing meat, and fire places. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.27" data-time="68.44">[01:08.44]</span>That would <span class="underline">appear</span> to be some <span class="underline">pretty</span> <span class="underline">compelling</span> evidences. <span class="time" data-times="3.89" data-time="71.71">[01:11.71]</span> <span class="underline">Mammoth</span> bones have also been found at some other Clovis sites. <span class="time" data-times="11.59" data-time="75.6">[01:15.60]</span>But then at other Clovis sites, there's also a lot of <span class="underline">evidence</span> that the Clovis people mostly gather plants and hunted small game, like rabbits and wild turkeys. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="16.96" data-time="87.19">[01:27.19]</span>Also there are several places in North America where you have natural accumulations of <span class="underline">mammoth</span> bones that look very <span class="underline">similar</span> to the accumulations at the Clovis site, except there's no human <span class="underline">debris</span>, where the <span class="underline">mammoth</span> almost certainly died as a result of some kind of natural <span class="underline">disaster</span>.<span class="time" data-times="11.75" data-time="104.15">[01:44.15]</span>So I think it is quite likely that those thirteen mammoths in southern California also died of natural causes, and that the Clovis people <span class="underline">simply</span> took <span class="underline">advantage</span> of the situation.<span class="time" data-times="3.29" data-time="115.9">[01:55.90]</span> Um...OK. That's the hunting <span class="underline">theory</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.82" data-time="119.19">[01:59.19]</span>Now let's look at another <span class="underline">theory</span>, uh, an <span class="underline">alternative</span> to the hunting <span class="underline">theory</span>, the <span class="underline">climate</span> change <span class="underline">theory</span>. <span class="time" data-times="14.48" data-time="126.01">[02:06.01]</span>At around 11,500 B.C.E.,the world was coming out of an Ice Age. <span class="time" data-times="7.8" data-time="140.49">[02:20.49]</span>And with that came increased seasonality, that is, the summers became warmer, and the winters actually became colder. <span class="time" data-times="8.34" data-time="148.29">[02:28.29]</span>These <span class="underline">extreme</span> shifts would have put a lot of <span class="underline">stress</span> on the bodies of animals that were used to a more <span class="underline">moderate</span> <span class="underline">range</span> of temperatures. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.26" data-time="156.63">[02:36.63]</span>But the most important <span class="underline">impact</span> of this increased seasonality may very well have been its effect on the <span class="underline">distribution</span> of plants. <span class="time" data-times="5.3" data-time="164.89">[02:44.89]</span>Today we take for granted that there <span class="underline">horizontal</span> bands of plant communities.<span class="time" data-times="4.93" data-time="170.19">[02:50.19]</span>In the far north, it is <span class="underline">tundra</span>, which gives way to forest as you move southward. <span class="time" data-times="3.25" data-time="175.12">[02:55.12]</span>And <span class="underline">even</span> farther south, grasslands take over. <span class="time" data-times="6.78" data-time="178.37">[02:58.37]</span>But during the Ice Age, these plant communities actually grew together, mixed with one another. <span class="time" data-times="6.48" data-time="185.15">[03:05.15]</span>So Ice Age animals had <span class="underline">access</span> to many different types of plants, different types of food. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.13" data-time="191.63">[03:11.63]</span>But when the seasons became more <span class="underline">distinct</span>, the plant communities were pulled apart, that meant, that in any <span class="underline">given</span> area, there was less plant <span class="underline">diversity</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.18" data-time="201.76">[03:21.76]</span>And as a result, uh, so the <span class="underline">theory</span> goes, the Ice Age animals that depended on plant <span class="underline">diversity</span> couldn't <span class="underline">survive</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.15" data-time="209.94">[03:29.94]</span>And the great beasts were the ones that needed the most <span class="underline">diversity</span> in their <span class="underline">diet</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9.17" data-time="215.09">[03:35.09]</span>Again, we have what at first seems like a <span class="underline">pretty</span> <span class="underline">attractive</span> <span class="underline">theory</span>, but then, how do you explain the fact that this has happened before? <span class="time" data-times="6.06" data-time="224.26">[03:44.26]</span>You know, global cooling followed by global warming, and there was no <span class="underline">extinction</span> then. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.14" data-time="230.32">[03:50.32]</span>Uh, you know, I recently read an interesting article about an archaeologist who tried to solve this <span class="underline">puzzle</span> with the help of his computer. <span class="time" data-times="7.26" data-time="238.46">[03:58.46]</span>What he did was, he wrote a computer program to <span class="underline">simulate</span> what would happen to <span class="underline">mammoth</span> under certain conditions. <span class="time" data-times="8.99" data-time="245.72">[04:05.72]</span>Say, for example, there is a <span class="underline">drought</span> for a <span class="underline">couple</span> of decades, or hunters are killing or five percent of the <span class="underline">population</span>, and so on. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.16" data-time="254.71">[04:14.71]</span>One thing he found was that humans didn't necessarily have to kill these animals in great numbers in order to nudge them toward <span class="underline">extinction</span>. <span class="time" data-times="12.19" data-time="263.87">[04:23.87]</span>That's because very large animals have a slow <span class="underline">rate</span> of <span class="underline">reproduction</span>, so all you have to do is remove a few young females from the <span class="underline">herd</span>, and you can, <span class="underline">fairly</span> quickly, <span class="underline">significantly</span> reduce the <span class="underline">population</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.94" data-time="276.06">[04:36.06]</span>And then he came up with a <span class="underline">scenario</span> that combined some hunting by humans with some <span class="underline">environmental</span> <span class="underline">stress</span>, and...Bang! <span class="time" data-times="3.52" data-time="284">[04:44.00]</span>The simulated mammoths were <span class="underline">extinct</span> <span class="underline">within</span> decades. <span class="time" data-times="6.14" data-time="287.52">[04:47.52]</span>So it seems the mixture of hunting and <span class="underline">climate</span> change is a likely <span class="underline">scenario</span>.<span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="293.66">[04:53.66]</span> Uh, of <span class="underline">course</span>, computer simulations are not a <span class="underline">substitute</span> for hard <span class="underline">evidence</span>. </p>
