Theories about the hunting methods used by early humans in North America.</p><p>D. Explanations for the disappearance of large animals in North America.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>By about 10,000 BCE, all those giant creatures, the Metgauna of North America were gone. We don't know exactly exactly what happened to them, but there are some theories. But there is a theory to choose D</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor mention an archaeological site in Southern California?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To present evidence that supports the hunting theory.</p><p>B. To present evidence that mammoths migrated southward to avoid cold winters.</p><p>C. To point out that mammoth bones are usually found near human debris.</p><p>D. To demonstrate that large animals were able to survive in a variety of habitats.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>So I think it is quite likely that those thirteen mammoths in southern California also died of natural causes, and that the Clovis people simply took advantage of the situation. Um...OK. That's the hunting theory.</p><p>Suddenly, So she pulled a long time when she spoke, gave a hint, and finally said that this was hunting theory, indicating that the previous example was all about the theory, so choose A. This kind of question is difficult to define the positioning sentence, and it needs a comprehensive understanding.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the professor's opinion about the Clovis people?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Their excessive hunting of mammoths was responsible for the extinction of these animals.</p><p>B. Their lack of tools for processing meat contradicts the hunting theory.</p><p>C. They were less accomplished at hunting mammoths than the hunting theory suggests.</p><p>D. They were probably too afraid of large animals to hunt them.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Because professors have a very important word that is called quiet likely, it is very likely that they die from natural factors. There are some parts that are not supported, so choose C.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>According to the climate change theory,how did the climate change at the end of the ice age make it more difficult for large animals to survive?Click on 2 answers.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. By reducing the size of their habitats.</p><p>B. By forcing them to endure a wider range of temperatures.</p><p>C. By reducing the variety of food available to them.</p><p>D. By forcing them to live near humans.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="BC"><p>These extreme shifts would have put a lot of stress on the bodies of animals that were used to a moderate range of temperatures. (B)</p><p>And as a result, uh, so the theory goes, the Ice Age animals that depended on plant diversity couldn't survive.(C)</p><p>There are two reasons. The first one uses the virtual tone to prompt. The second one uses as a result. It is a very important prompt word. It means that the temperature range that the animal needs to adapt to is enlarged, and the other is the plant. The diversity of the animals has been reduced. Some of the animals are warped and choose BC.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor imply is one problem with the climate change theory?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Many large animals actually benefitted from the climate change.</p><p>B. Large animals had survived previous climate changes.</p><p>C. Large animals were probably already near extinction before the climate changed.</p><p>D. New evidence suggests that the climate change was not as extreme as scientists once believed.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>You know, global cooling followed by global warming, and there was no extinction then. In fact, there was no need for so many sentences, but there was a lot of hints before the answer, and I put it up. After that, in fact, everyone should wake up, and then this turning point should be even more noticeable, and this sentence is still a question and answer. The question of the professor is that after global warming, it is global warming. Why did not many species become extinct when it became cold? So basically choose B.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>The professor mentions a series of computer simulations. What did the simulations suggest?Click on 2 answers.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The killing of only a few mammoths could lead to a significant reduction in the mammoth population.</p><p>B. Many mammoths died as the result of an extended drought.</p><p>C. Female mammoths were less able than male mammoths to adapt to climate change.</p><p>D. Both hunting and climate change contributed to the extinction of the mammoths.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="AD"><p>That's because very large animals have a slow rate of reproduction, so all you have to do is remove a few young females from the herd, and you can, fairly quickly, significantly reduce the population. (A)</p><p>Bang! The simulated mammoths were extinct within decades.(D)</p><p>There are obvious signs for both reasons, so one is that without killing many large animals they will also become extinct, and the other is the combination of environment and humans, choosing AD.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
