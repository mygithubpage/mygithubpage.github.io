              <span class="time" data-times="11.67" data-time="3.94">[00:03.94]</span>Professor: OK. For today, let's look at a <span class="underline">reptile</span>, a <span class="underline">predator</span> that hasn't evolved much in the last seventy million years. <span class="time" data-times="5.03" data-time="15.61">[00:15.61]</span>No discussion of reptiles would be complete without some <span class="underline">mention</span> of crocodiles. </p>

              <span class="time" data-times="9.11" data-time="20.64">[00:20.64]</span>Now, we <span class="underline">tend</span> to think of crocodiles as, uh, kind of <span class="underline">solitary</span>, hiding out in a <span class="underline">swamp</span>, uh, kind of <span class="underline">mysterious</span> creatures. <span class="time" data-times="3.86" data-time="29.75">[00:29.75]</span>But we are finding out that they aren't as <span class="underline">isolated</span> as they <span class="underline">seem</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.43" data-time="33.61">[00:33.61]</span>In fact, crocodiles <span class="underline">interact</span> with each other in a <span class="underline">variety</span> of ways.<span class="time" data-times="5.11" data-time="38.04">[00:38.04]</span>One way is with vocalizations, you know, sounds generated by the animal.<span class="time" data-times="6.94" data-time="43.15">[00:43.15]</span>This is true of the whole <span class="underline">crocodile</span> family, which includes crocodiles themselves, alligators, etc. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.5" data-time="50.09">[00:50.09]</span>Take American alligators.<span class="time" data-times="10.7" data-time="52.59">[00:52.59]</span> If you were to go to a <span class="underline">swamp</span> during the <span class="underline">breeding</span> <span class="underline">season</span>, you'd hear a <span class="underline">chorus</span> of sounds, deep grunts, hisses, these are sounds that <span class="underline">male</span> alligators make. <span class="time" data-times="3.16" data-time="63.29">[01:03.29]</span>And some of them are powerful enough to make the water <span class="underline">vibrate</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.56" data-time="66.45">[01:06.45]</span>This sends a strong, go-away message to the other males. <span class="time" data-times="8.64" data-time="71.01">[01:11.01]</span>So the alligator can <span class="underline">focus</span> on sending other <span class="underline">sound</span> waves <span class="underline">through</span> the water, <span class="underline">sound</span> waves that you and I couldn't <span class="underline">even</span> hear since they are at such low <span class="underline">frequency</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.91" data-time="79.65">[01:19.65]</span>But they do <span class="underline">reach</span> the <span class="underline">female</span> alligator, who then goes to find and <span class="underline">mate</span> with the <span class="underline">male</span>. </p>

              <span class="underline">Vocalization</span> is um...well, it is used for other reasons, like getting <span class="underline">attention</span> or just, um... letting others know you are distressed.<span class="time" data-times="1.26" data-time="95.29">[01:35.29]</span>Let's see. <span class="time" data-times="4.06" data-time="96.55">[01:36.55]</span>New-born crocodiles, or hatchlings and their interactions with their mothers.<span class="time" data-times="6.88" data-time="100.61">[01:40.61]</span>When they are born, croc... baby crocodiles have a <span class="underline">sort</span> of muffled cry while they are in their <span class="underline">nest</span>.<span class="time" data-times="5.86" data-time="107.49">[01:47.49]</span>Hatchlings are really <span class="underline">vulnerable</span>, especially to birds and small mammals when they are born. <span class="time" data-times="7.88" data-time="113.35">[01:53.35]</span>But their mother, who has been keeping vigil nearby, hears their cry for help and carries them to safety, meaning, to water. </p>

              <span class="time" data-times="2.66" data-time="121.23">[02:01.23]</span>So she takes them out of the <span class="underline">nest</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.11" data-time="123.89">[02:03.89]</span>Uh, uh, all the eggs hatched at once, so she has about forty newborns to look after. <span class="time" data-times="6.35" data-time="130">[02:10.00]</span>Well, she takes about fifteen out of the <span class="underline">nest</span> at a time, carrying them in her mouth to the nearby water. <span class="time" data-times="4.89" data-time="136.35">[02:16.35]</span>While she is taking one <span class="underline">load</span> of hatchlings, the others wait for her to come back. <span class="time" data-times="3.48" data-time="141.24">[02:21.24]</span>But do you think they are quiet about it? No way.<span class="time" data-times="5.9" data-time="144.72">[02:24.72]</span> They are clamoring for the mother's <span class="underline">attention</span>, <span class="underline">sort</span> of squeaking and <span class="underline">practically</span> saying-don't forget about me! </p>

              <span class="time" data-times="4.66" data-time="150.62">[02:30.62]</span>I heard some great examples of this on the television program on crocodiles last week.<span class="time" data-times="1.18" data-time="155.28">[02:35.28]</span> Anyone catch it? <span class="time" data-times="1.95" data-time="156.46">[02:36.46]</span>It had a few interesting bits. <span class="time" data-times="4.46" data-time="158.41">[02:38.41]</span>But you know, uh, you have to be careful, think critically. <span class="time" data-times="7.56" data-time="162.87">[02:42.87]</span>Sometimes I don't know where these shows find their experts. </p>

            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.35" data-time="179.06">[02:59.06]</span>Professor: Hmm...good question. <span class="time" data-times="5.87" data-time="181.41">[03:01.41]</span>I guess, well, I am guessing that once the babies have the mother's <span class="underline">attention</span>, they are safe. <span class="time" data-times="10.28" data-time="187.28">[03:07.28]</span>She's never too far away, and, and I think...I mean, would you <span class="underline">mess</span> with a mother <span class="underline">crocodile</span>? </p>

              <span class="time" data-times="8.88" data-time="197.56">[03:17.56]</span>So after the mother transports all the youngsters, they still call to each other, and to their mother.<span class="time" data-times="3.45" data-time="206.44">[03:26.44]</span>This communication continues right <span class="underline">through</span> to adulthood. <span class="time" data-times="3.71" data-time="209.89">[03:29.89]</span>Crocodiles have about eighteen different sounds that they can make. </p>

              <span class="time" data-times="10.34" data-time="251.94">[04:11.94]</span>Another thing would be, um, if a <span class="underline">hatchling</span> gets separated from the rest of its family, once the others get far enough away, its <span class="underline">survival</span> <span class="underline">instinct</span> kicks in. <span class="time" data-times="3.91" data-time="262.28">[04:22.28]</span>It will make a loud <span class="underline">distress</span> call, which its siblings answer.<span class="time" data-times="1.4" data-time="266.19">[04:26.19]</span> It calls again.<span class="time" data-times="3.9" data-time="267.59">[04:27.59]</span> And they continue calling back and forth until they all find each other again. </p>
