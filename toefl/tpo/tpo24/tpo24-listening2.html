For today, let's look at a <span class="highlight">reptile</span>, a <span class="highlight">predator</span> that hasn't evolved much in the last seventy million years. <span class="time" data-times="5.03" data-time="15.61">[00:15.61]</span>No discussion of reptiles would be complete without some <span class="highlight">mention</span> of crocodiles. </p>

            <span class="time" data-times="2.5" data-time="50.09">[00:50.09]</span>Take American alligators.<span class="time" data-times="10.7" data-time="52.59">[00:52.59]</span> If you were to go to a <span class="highlight">swamp</span> during the <span class="highlight">breeding</span> <span class="highlight">season</span>, you'd hear a <span class="highlight">chorus</span> of sounds, deep grunts, hisses, these are sounds that <span class="highlight">male</span> alligators make. <span class="time" data-times="3.16" data-time="63.29">[01:03.29]</span>And some of them are powerful enough to make the water <span class="highlight">vibrate</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.56" data-time="66.45">[01:06.45]</span>This sends a strong, go-away message to the other males. <span class="time" data-times="8.64" data-time="71.01">[01:11.01]</span>So the alligator can <span class="highlight">focus</span> on sending other <span class="highlight">sound</span> waves <span class="highlight">through</span> the water, <span class="highlight">sound</span> waves that you and I couldn't <span class="highlight">even</span> hear since they are at such low <span class="highlight">frequency</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.91" data-time="79.65">[01:19.65]</span>But they do <span class="highlight">reach</span> the <span class="highlight">female</span> alligator, who then goes to find and <span class="highlight">mate</span> with the <span class="highlight">male</span>. </p>

            <span class="highlight">Vocalization</span> is um...well, it is used for other reasons, like getting <span class="highlight">attention</span> or just, um... letting others know you are distressed.<span class="time" data-times="1.26" data-time="95.29">[01:35.29]</span>Let's see. <span class="time" data-times="4.06" data-time="96.55">[01:36.55]</span>New-born crocodiles, or hatchlings and their interactions with their mothers.<span class="time" data-times="6.88" data-time="100.61">[01:40.61]</span>When they are born, croc... baby crocodiles have a <span class="highlight">sort</span> of muffled cry while they are in their <span class="highlight">nest</span>.<span class="time" data-times="5.86" data-time="107.49">[01:47.49]</span>Hatchlings are really <span class="highlight">vulnerable</span>, especially to birds and small mammals when they are born. <span class="time" data-times="7.88" data-time="113.35">[01:53.35]</span>But their mother, who has been keeping vigil nearby, hears their cry for help and carries them to safety, meaning, to water. </p>

            <span class="time" data-times="2.66" data-time="121.23">[02:01.23]</span>So she takes them out of the <span class="highlight">nest</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.11" data-time="123.89">[02:03.89]</span>Uh, uh, all the eggs hatched at once, so she has about forty newborns to look after. <span class="time" data-times="6.35" data-time="130">[02:10.00]</span>Well, she takes about fifteen out of the <span class="highlight">nest</span> at a time, carrying them in her mouth to the nearby water. <span class="time" data-times="4.89" data-time="136.35">[02:16.35]</span>While she is taking one <span class="highlight">load</span> of hatchlings, the others wait for her to come back. <span class="time" data-times="3.48" data-time="141.24">[02:21.24]</span>But do you think they are quiet about it? No way.<span class="time" data-times="5.9" data-time="144.72">[02:24.72]</span> They are clamoring for the mother's <span class="highlight">attention</span>, <span class="highlight">sort</span> of squeaking and <span class="highlight">practically</span> saying-don't forget about me! </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.66" data-time="150.62">[02:30.62]</span>I heard some great examples of this on the television program on crocodiles last week.<span class="time" data-times="1.18" data-time="155.28">[02:35.28]</span> Anyone catch it? <span class="time" data-times="1.95" data-time="156.46">[02:36.46]</span>It had a few interesting bits. <span class="time" data-times="4.46" data-time="158.41">[02:38.41]</span>But you know, uh, you have to be careful, think critically. <span class="time" data-times="7.56" data-time="162.87">[02:42.87]</span>Sometimes I don't know where these shows find their experts. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.16" data-time="170.43">[02:50.43]</span>Student: Excuse me. <span class="time" data-times="2.77" data-time="173.59">[02:53.59]</span>But, um... does all that crying defeat the purpose? <span class="time" data-times="2.7" data-time="176.36">[02:56.36]</span>I mean, doesn't it <span class="highlight">attract</span> more predators? </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.35" data-time="179.06">[02:59.06]</span>Professor: Hmm...good question. <span class="time" data-times="5.87" data-time="181.41">[03:01.41]</span>I guess, well, I am guessing that once the babies have the mother's <span class="highlight">attention</span>, they are safe. <span class="time" data-times="10.28" data-time="187.28">[03:07.28]</span>She's never too far away, and, and I think...I mean, would you <span class="highlight">mess</span> with a mother <span class="highlight">crocodile</span>? </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="8.88" data-time="197.56">[03:17.56]</span>So after the mother transports all the youngsters, they still call to each other, and to their mother.<span class="time" data-times="3.45" data-time="206.44">[03:26.44]</span>This communication continues right <span class="highlight">through</span> to adulthood. <span class="time" data-times="3.71" data-time="209.89">[03:29.89]</span>Crocodiles have about eighteen different sounds that they can make. </p>

            <span class="time" data-times="12.31" data-time="213.6">[03:33.60]</span>There's...um...um... you have deep grunting sounds, hisses, growls, so there are many different sounds to <span class="highlight">interact</span> or send messages.<span class="time" data-times="3.33" data-time="225.91">[03:45.91]</span>This is more <span class="highlight">typical</span> of mammals than of reptiles. <span class="time" data-times="3.46" data-time="229.24">[03:49.24]</span>I mean, crocodiles' brains are the most developed of any <span class="highlight">reptile</span>.<span class="time" data-times="4.09" data-time="232.7">[03:52.70]</span> In that <span class="highlight">sense</span>, they are closer to mammals' brains than other reptiles' brains. <span class="time" data-times="6.67" data-time="236.79">[03:56.79]</span>And we know that mammals, dogs for example, dogs <span class="highlight">vocalize</span> many different sounds. <span class="time" data-times="8.48" data-time="243.46">[04:03.46]</span>Crocodiles have a <span class="highlight">similar</span> <span class="highlight">level</span> of, uh, <span class="highlight">vocal</span> sophistication, if you will, which makes them <span class="highlight">unique</span> among reptiles. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="10.34" data-time="251.94">[04:11.94]</span>Another thing would be, um, if a <span class="highlight">hatchling</span> gets separated from the rest of its family, once the others get far enough away, its <span class="highlight">survival</span> <span class="highlight">instinct</span> kicks in. <span class="time" data-times="3.91" data-time="262.28">[04:22.28]</span>It will make a loud <span class="highlight">distress</span> call, which its siblings answer.<span class="time" data-times="1.4" data-time="266.19">[04:26.19]</span> It calls again.<span class="time" data-times="3.9" data-time="267.59">[04:27.59]</span> And they continue calling back and forth until they all find each other again. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.36" data-time="271.49">[04:31.49]</span>Another thing, something that wasn't on that TV show I mentioned.<span class="time" data-times="7.84" data-time="275.85">[04:35.85]</span> Um... mother crocodiles <span class="highlight">lead</span> their young from one area to another, like when they have to find a different <span class="highlight">source</span> of water. <span class="time" data-times="8" data-time="283.69">[04:43.69]</span>Usually she will <span class="highlight">lead</span> them at night, when it is safer for them, moving ahead and then letting out calls of reassurance so that they will follow her.<span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="291.69">[04:51.69]</span>Her voice helps give the babies the courage they need to leave the area and go someplace that's a more <span class="highlight">desirable</span> home for them. </p>
