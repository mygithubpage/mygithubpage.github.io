          <h4 class="w3-center">Close the Campus Coffee house</h4>I propose that the university close the campus coffeehouse. Coffeehouses are great, if people actually use them, like to socialize with friends, while enjoying a cup of coffee and a snack. But students are not using our campus coffeehouse. There are usually lots of empty tables when I pass by the place. It's just a waste of space that could be used for other things. Also, the food at the coffeehouse is not very good. The last time I was there, the cakes and muffins my friends and I ordered were dry and didn't have much flavor.
Sincerely,
Greg Smith</article>

          <p>Now listen to two students discussing the letter.</p>
          <p>(woman) I don't like his proposal.</p>
          <p>(man) Why not? There are never many students there.</p>
          <p>(woman) But that's why I like about it, that it's never crowded.</p>
          <p>(man) Really?</p>
          <p>(woman) Yeah, so it's a great place to study. I go there a lot. I'll read a book or bring my laptop computer and work on a paper for class. It's never very noisy.</p>
          <p>(man) You're able to get work done there?</p>
          <p>(woman) Absolutely! In fact, I actually prefer it to the library as a place to study, and a lot of other students do, too. We even study for our final exams there, and you can eat there while you work, something you can't do with the library.</p>
          <p>(man) OK, but you don't actually like the food there, do you? I mean, he said.</p>
          <p>(woman) Well, I don't think he's been there recently, I mean, it's true that it wasn't that great in the past, but I think it's a lot better now.</p>
          <p>(man) What's changed?</p>
          <p>(woman) They have a new manager and I guess she's made some improvements in the quality of the food. I was there last week and the food was delicious.</p>
          <p>(man) Really?</p>
          <p>(woman) Yeah, really! And the new manager has also added a lot of really healthful foods and snacks, so the food doesn't just taste good now. It's good for you, too.</p>
          <p>(man) Hmm, I'll have to try the place.</p>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>Well, the woman disagrees with the proposal for two main reasons. Firstly, she thinks it's a great place to study and she could read a book or use her laptop there to work on her paper, since it's never been too noisy. Compared with the library, she chooses the coffee house to be a better place to study in, and she says many other students do so as well, because they could eat and work in the coffee house, which they will never do in the library. The second point that the woman is making is that the food there in the coffee house is also improving thanks to the new manager. She even could have healthful foods and snacks there. So based on the main reasons stated above the woman is against the proposal. (126 words)</p>
