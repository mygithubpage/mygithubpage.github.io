There are several reasons why it's popular. The first reason is that the park has a very big square where senior citizens go nearly every day to do some physical exercise. I can see them every day after dinner, they dance together energetically. Another reason is that there is a beautiful lake beside the park, and young people, especially those from the university, like to sit on the bank, enjoying the view and having some talk. If the weather is fine, beautiful young girls and handsome boys can be seen sit side by side.</p></article></section></main></body></html>
