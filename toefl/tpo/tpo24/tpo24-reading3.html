            <b>Moving into Pueblos</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>In the Mesa Verde area of the <span class="underline">ancient</span> North American Southwest, living patterns changed in the thirteenth <span class="underline">century</span>, with large numbers of people moving into large <span class="underline">communal</span> dwellings called pueblos, 
often constructed at the edges of canyons, especially on the sides of cliffs. Abandoning small extended-family households to move into these large pueblos with dozens if not hundreds of other
people was probably <span class="light"><span class="underline">traumatic</span></span> Few of the cultural traditions and rules that today allow us to <span class="underline">deal</span> with <span class="underline"><span class="underline">dense</span></span> populations existed for these people <span class="underline">accustomed</span> to <span class="underline">household</span> <span class="underline">autonomy</span> and the <span class="underline">ability</span> 
to move around the <span class="underline">landscape</span> almost at will. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>And <span class="underline">besides</span> the awkwardness of having to share walls with neighbors, living in aggregated pueblos introduced other problems. 
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>For people in <span class="underline">cliff</span> dwellings, hauling water, wood, and food to their homes was a <span class="underline">major</span> <span class="underline">chore</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>The <span class="underline">stress</span> on <span class="underline">local</span> resources, especially in the firewood needed for daily cooking and warmth,
was particularly <span class="underline">intense</span>, and conditions in aggregated pueblos were not very hygienic. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p>
          <p>
            <span class="underline">Given</span> all the disadvantages of living in aggregated towns, why did people in the thirteenth <span class="underline">century</span> move into these closely <span class="underline">packed</span> quarters? For transitions of such suddenness, archaeologists <span class="underline">consider</span> either pull factors (benefits that drew families together) or push factors (some <span class="underline">external</span> threat or crisis that forced people to <span class="underline">aggregate</span>). In this case, push explanations <span class="underline">dominate</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="underline">Population</span> growth is considered a particularly <span class="underline">influential</span> push. After several generations of <span class="underline">population</span> growth, people <span class="underline">packed</span> the <span class="underline">landscape</span> in densities so high that <span class="underline">communal</span> pueblos may have been a necessary <span class="underline">outcome</span>. Around Sand <span class="underline">Canyon</span>, for example, populations grew from 5 -12 people per <span class="underline">square</span> kilometer in the tenth <span class="underline">century</span> to as many as 30 - 50 by the 1200s. As densities increased, <span class="underline">domestic</span> <span class="underline">architecture</span> became larger, culminating in crowded pueblos. Some scholars <span class="underline">expand</span> on this idea by emphasizing a corresponding need for <span class="underline">arable</span> land to feed growing numbers of people: <span class="underline">construction</span> of small dams, reservoirs, terraces, and <span class="underline">field</span> houses indicates that farmers were intensifying their efforts during the 1200s. Competition for good farmland may also have prompted people to <span class="underline">bond</span> together to <span class="underline">assert</span> rights over the best fields.</p>
          <p>Another important push was the onset of the Little Ice Age, a <span class="underline">climatic</span> <span class="underline">phenomenon</span> that led to cooler temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere. Although the height of the Little Ice Age was still around the corner, some <span class="underline">evidence</span> suggests that temperatures were falling during the thirteenth <span class="underline">century</span>. The <span class="underline">environmental</span> changes <span class="underline">associated</span> with this <span class="underline">transition</span> are not fully understood, but people living closest to the San Juan Mountains, to the northeast of Mesa Verde, were affected first. Growing food at these elevations is always difficult because of the short growing <span class="underline">season</span>. As the Little Ice Age progressed, farmers probably moved their fields to <span class="underline">lower</span> elevations, infringing on the lands of other farmers and pushing people together, thus contributing to the aggregations. Archaeologists <span class="underline">identify</span> a corresponding <span class="underline">shift</span> in populations toward the south and west toward Mesa Verde and away from higher elevations.</p>
          <p>In the face of all these pushes, people in the Mesa Verde area had yet another <span class="underline">reason</span> to move into <span class="underline">communal</span> villages: the need for greater <span class="underline">cooperation</span>. Sharing and <span class="underline">cooperation</span> were almost certainly part of early Puebloan life, <span class="underline">even</span> for people living in largely <span class="underline">independent</span> single-household residences <span class="underline">scattered</span> <span class="underline">across</span> the <span class="underline">landscape</span>. Archaeologists find that <span class="underline">even</span> the most <span class="underline">isolated</span> residences during the eleventh and twelfth centuries obtained some <span class="underline">pottery</span>, and probably food, from some distance away, while <span class="underline">major</span> <span class="underline">ceremonial</span> events were opportunities for sharing food and crafts. Scholars believe that this <span class="underline">cooperation</span> allowed people to <span class="underline">contend</span> with a patchy environment in which <span class="underline">precipitation</span> and other resources <span class="underline">varied</span> <span class="underline">across</span> the landscape: if you produce a lot of food one year, you might <span class="underline">trade</span> it for <span class="underline">pottery</span> made by a <span class="underline">distant</span> <span class="underline">ally</span> who is having difficulty with crops-and the next year, the flow of goods might go in the <span class="underline">opposite</span> direction. But all of this appears to have changed thirteenth <span class="underline">century</span>. Although the <span class="underline">climate</span> remained as <span class="underline">unpredictable</span> as ever between one year and the next, it became much less <span class="underline">locally</span> <span class="underline">diverse</span>. In a bad year for farming, everyone was equally affected.No longer was it helpful to share widely. <span class="underline">Instead</span>, the most <span class="underline">sensible</span> thing would be for neighbors to <span class="underline">combine</span> efforts to produce as much food as possible, and thus aggregated towns were a <span class="underline">sensible</span> arrangement.</p>
