often constructed at the edges of canyons, especially on the sides of cliffs. Abandoning small extended-family households to move into these large pueblos with dozens if not hundreds of other
people was probably <span class="highlight question1">traumatic</span> Few of the cultural traditions and rules that today allow us to <span class="highlight">deal</span> with <span class="highlight question1">dense</span> populations existed for these people <span class="highlight">accustomed</span> to <span class="highlight">household</span><span class="highlight">autonomy</span> and the <span class="highlight">ability</span> 
to move around the <span class="highlight">landscape</span> almost at will. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>And <span class="highlight">besides</span> the awkwardness of having to share walls with neighbors, living in aggregated pueblos introduced other problems. 
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>For people in <span class="highlight">cliff</span> dwellings, hauling water, wood, and food to their homes was a <span class="highlight">major</span><span class="highlight">chore</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>The <span class="highlight">stress</span> on <span class="highlight">local</span> resources, especially in the firewood needed for daily cooking and warmth,
was particularly <span class="highlight"><span class="question2">intense</span></span>, and conditions in aggregated pueblos were not very hygienic. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p><p><span class="highlight">Given</span> all the disadvantages of living in aggregated towns, why did people in the thirteenth <span class="highlight">century</span> move into these closely <span class="highlight">packed</span> quarters? For transitions of such suddenness, archaeologists <span class="highlight">consider</span> either pull factors (benefits that drew families together) or push factors (some <span class="highlight">external</span> threat or crisis that forced people to <span class="highlight">aggregate</span>). In this case, push explanations <span class="highlight">dominate</span>.</p><p><span class="highlight">Population</span> growth is considered a particularly <span class="highlight">influential</span> push. After several generations of <span class="highlight">population</span> growth, people <span class="highlight">packed</span> the <span class="highlight">landscape</span> in densities so high that <span class="highlight">communal</span> pueblos may have been a necessary <span class="highlight">outcome</span>. Around Sand <span class="highlight">Canyon</span>, for example, populations grew from 5 -12 people per <span class="highlight">square</span> kilometer in the tenth <span class="highlight">century</span> to as many as 30 - 50 by the 1200s. As densities increased, <span class="highlight">domestic</span><span class="highlight">architecture</span> became larger, culminating in crowded pueblos. <span class="question6">Some scholars <span class="highlight">expand</span> on this idea by emphasizing a corresponding need for <span class="highlight">arable</span> land to feed growing numbers of people: <span class="highlight">construction</span> of small dams, reservoirs, terraces, and <span class="highlight">field</span> houses indicates that farmers were intensifying their efforts during the 1200s.</span> Competition for good farmland may also have prompted people to <span class="highlight">bond</span> together to <span class="highlight">assert</span> rights over the best fields.</p><p>Another important push was the onset of the Little Ice Age, a <span class="highlight">climatic</span><span class="highlight">phenomenon</span> that led to cooler temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere. Although the height of the Little Ice Age was still around the corner, some <span class="highlight">evidence</span> suggests that temperatures were falling during the thirteenth <span class="highlight">century</span>. The <span class="highlight">environmental</span> changes <span class="highlight">associated</span> with this <span class="highlight"><span class="question7">transition</span></span> are not fully understood, but people living closest to the San Juan Mountains, to the northeast of Mesa Verde, were affected first. <span class="question8">Growing food at these elevations is always difficult because of the short growing <span class="highlight">season</span>.</span> As the Little Ice Age progressed, farmers probably moved their fields to <span class="highlight">lower</span> elevations, infringing on the lands of other farmers and pushing people together, thus contributing to the aggregations. Archaeologists <span class="highlight">identify</span> a corresponding <span class="highlight">shift</span> in populations toward the south and west toward Mesa Verde and away from higher elevations.</p><p>In the face of all these pushes, people in the Mesa Verde area had yet another <span class="highlight">reason</span> to move into <span class="highlight">communal</span> villages: the need for greater <span class="highlight">cooperation</span>. Sharing and <span class="highlight">cooperation</span> were almost certainly part of early Puebloan life, <span class="highlight">even</span> for people living in largely <span class="highlight">independent</span> single-household residences <span class="highlight">scattered</span><span class="highlight">across</span> the <span class="highlight">landscape</span>. Archaeologists find that <span class="highlight">even</span> the most <span class="highlight">isolated</span> residences during the eleventh and twelfth centuries obtained some <span class="highlight">pottery</span>, and probably food, from some distance away, while <span class="highlight">major</span><span class="highlight">ceremonial</span> events were opportunities for sharing food and crafts. Scholars believe that this <span class="highlight">cooperation</span> allowed people to <span class="highlight">contend</span> with a patchy environment in which <span class="highlight">precipitation</span> and other resources <span class="highlight">varied</span><span class="highlight">across</span> the landscape: if you produce a lot of food one year, you might <span class="highlight">trade</span> it for <span class="highlight">pottery</span> made by a <span class="highlight">distant</span><span class="highlight">ally</span> who is having difficulty with crops-and the next year, the flow of goods might go in the <span class="highlight">opposite</span> direction. But all of this appears to have changed thirteenth <span class="highlight">century</span>. Although the <span class="highlight">climate</span> remained as <span class="highlight">unpredictable</span> as ever between one year and the next, it became much less <span class="highlight">locally</span><span class="highlight">diverse</span>. In a bad year for farming, everyone was equally affected.No longer was it helpful to share widely. <span class="highlight">Instead</span>, the most <span class="highlight">sensible</span> thing would be for neighbors to <span class="highlight">combine</span> efforts to produce as much food as possible, and thus aggregated towns were a <span class="highlight">sensible</span> arrangement.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">traumatic</span>" meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Essential</p><p>B. highly stressful</p><p>C. highly unusual</p><p>D. unwise</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B traumatic: Injured, not happy. The A option is necessary, B is very stressful, C is very unusual, and D is unwise. So the correct answer is highly stressful.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question2">intense</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. strong</p><p>B. questionable</p><p>C. obvious</p><p>D. deliberate</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" A"><p>A <span class="question2">intense</span>: Intense, <span class="question2">intense</span>. A is strong, B is suspicious, problematic, C is obvious, and D is thoughtful. So the correct answer is strong.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 1, before the thirteenth century the people of southwestern North America lived in households that</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. shared daily chores with neighboring households</p><p>B. occupied dwellings that were built into the sides of cliffs</p><p>C. were largely free to conduct their lives as they pleased</p><p>D. enforced common standards of behavior and cooperative conduct within their communities</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C If this question is targeted by the thirteenth century, you will not know which one to choose after reading the first sentence. Therefore, it is better to use exclusion. A's chore keyword positioning to the penultimate sentence, but the original is only listed chore, did not say the option said share, A wrong; B's dwelling and sides of the cliffs do keyword positioning to the first sentence, but built in Cliff is pueblo, not before the thirteenth century, so B is wrong; C is not clearly stated in the original text, but see the first sentence will be found in the thirteenth century changes, and after the thirteenth century we all live together, there are many problems, that is ten Before the third century, everyone lived on their own. That is, C said that their lives lives as they pleased, C is correct; D did not say anything at all.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the following best indicates the organization of paragraph 1?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It presents the conditions that caused a change in a population' s living patterns and then explains why those conditions got worse.</p><p>B. It identifies certain present-day cultural traditions and rules and then traces them to their roots in the thirteenth century.</p><p>C. It casts doubt on one explanation of the move to pueblos and then introduces an alternative explanation that the passage will defend.</p><p>D. It describes a major change in a population' s living patterns and then presents a number of problems that resulted from that change.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D asked the entire paragraph of the question, see head and tail. The first sentence states that people's lifestyles changed in the thirteenth century. Many people moved to pueblo; the second half of the second half from the penultimate sentence to the end all said that this phenomenon caused a series of problems. After that, the answer to this question is D. A's why those conditions get worse, B's present cultural condition and C's an alternative explanation did not say.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 3, which of the following was one of the consequences of increasing population densities?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. People were increasingly crowded into collections of large housing units.</p><p>B. People stopped planting crops that have relatively low yields.</p><p>C. Domestic buildings were pushed beyond the canyon limits.</p><p>D. The natural landscape was destroyed.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A. Positioning to the second sentence with the keyword of density, said that after several generations of population growth, the density is too large, making pueblo an inevitable result, so the correct answer is A, crowd into collections of large housing units. B's crop, C canyon limits and D's destroy didn't say anything.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage (paragraph 4)?Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Some scholars even claim that the intensification of farmers' various efforts during the 1200s led to further population growth and the consequent need for more arable land.</p><p>B. Evidence of intensifying agriculture in the 1200s indicates a need to feed a larger population and so extends the argument that a growing population was the cause of the move to pueblos.</p><p>C. During the 1200s, farmers met the demand for more arable land, but they also succeeded in cultivating existing land more intensively with the help of agricultural construction projects.</p><p>D. Some scholars feel strongly that the construction of small dams, reservoirs, terraces, and field houses in the thirteenth century is independent evidence for growth in the number of people.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B. The structure of the original text is scholarly to emphasize the need for arable land to guarantee the growth of the population of food, construction indicator blabla. The answer is B, A's effort lead to population growth is purely nonsense; C's transition is completely wrong, and farmer to meet the needs of arable land is not right; D's independent evidence is wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">transition</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. change</p><p>B. climate</p><p>C. decline</p><p>D. problem</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A transition: transition, change. A is the change, B is the climate, C is the decline, D is the problem. So the answer is A.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the author state that "<span class="highlight">Growing food at these elevations is always difficult because of the short growing season</span>"?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To explain why the higher elevations were always relatively sparsely populated</p><p>B. To suggest that any worsening of conditions would have significant consequences</p><p>C. To emphasize how resourceful the people growing food at these elevations were</p><p>D. To argue that farming was not the primary source of food at high elevations</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="Growing food at these elevations is always difficult because of the short growing season B"><p>B. The rhetorical purpose question. The sentence where the rhetorical point is located is just an example. It looks like the past, but the previous sentence is still an example. So look at the first sentence. The first sentence says that Little Ice Age has influence on push, and the option says that only the consequence of B is affected, so the correct answer is B, and the last sentence says that population migration can also explain the impact of Little Ice Age. A sparsely populated, C's resourceful, and D's primary source of food did not have any relevant information.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, what did farmers do in response to falling temperatures during the Little Ice Age?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Moved to areas away from Mesa Verde</p><p>B. Moved closer to the northeastern part of Mesa Verde</p><p>C. Began to cultivate crops adapted to a short growing season</p><p>D. Gave up the cultivation of the highest-lying lands</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D. If you use the keyword "falling temperature" to locate the keyword, you will find no answer or a lot of reading. If you can't find the keyword, it is a good way to read it. The first sentence says cooler temperature, the last sentence says that from south and west toward the MESA, left the high ground, so the correct answer is D, giving up the high ground. A said that it was wrong; B was not in the northeast of MESA, but in the direction of MESA; C's original was not stated.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 5, major ceremonial events were occasions for</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. leaders to persuade people from the countryside to move into a pueblo</p><p>B. farmers to collect information about where crops could be reliably grown</p><p>C. people to develop better techniques for producing pottery and crafts</p><p>D. people in the early Puebloan era to share farm and craft products</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D The keyword ceremonial events keyword positioning to the last sentence of the third sentence, said ceremonial event provides the opportunity to share food and crafts, so the correct answer is D, others are completely insensitive</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 5, which of the following was a reason people in the Mesa Verde area formed communal villages in the thirteenth century?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The climate in the Mesa Verde area became more locally diverse.</p><p>B. Individuals were no longer interested in exchanging pottery and food.</p><p>C. Cooperation between people became more important for survival.</p><p>D. Bad years of farming began to occur more frequently.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C. With the thirteenth century key word positioning to the fourth last sentence, saying that everything has changed in the thirteenth century, and then all the contents are saying things after the changes in the thirteenth century. The last sentence specifically pointed out that the most effective way is for the neighbor to jointly produce more food, so the aggregated town becomes the best arrangement, so the reason for forming the communal village is C. A said anti; B and D did not say.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Paragraph 5 supports which of the following statements about cooperation among the people in the Mesa Verde area from the eleventh through the thirteenth century?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Cooperation allowed many households to give up farming and to specialize in making pottery and crafts.</p><p>B. People went from exchanging food and crafts they individually produced to sharing in a cooperative effort to produce as much food as possible.</p><p>C. Overtime there was less cooperation as farmers competed with each other for trade with distant areas.</p><p>D. Individuals stopped cooperating with each other because they did not have enough food for themselves.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B This question does not need to return to the original position, because the question is asked how the MESA people's cooperation changed from the eleventh century to the thirteenth century. The above question has already stated that people cooperated in the thirteenth century, that is, they had not cooperated before. Of the answers, only B talks about co-production of more foods, so B is the correct answer.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Performing everyday household tasks required more effort..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B two transition points, namely the noun everyday household tasks and noun more effort, according to the noun everyday household tasks can determine B or C is the answer, because the original hauling water, wood, and food is synonymous with everyday household tasks; and require more The effort corresponds to the other problem before the B insertion point, and it can be determined that the answer is A or B. In summary, the correct answer is B.</p></div></div><div id="question14" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>In the thirteenth century, the people in the Mesa Verde area went from living in scattered independent households to living in large pueblos.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.Because the thirteenth-century inhabitants of the Mesa Verde area did not have the cultural expectations of today's city dwellers, they easily adapted to communal life.</p><p>B.Even though living in pueblos had disadvantages, the population of the area had grown so large that there may have been no other arrangement that would have met its needs.</p><p>C.From the eleventh century onward, farmers began to increase food production on existing farmland and started bringing more land under cultivation.</p><p>D.A development that contributed to increasing population densities was a cooling climate that led many people to leave the coldest areas and crowd into climatically more favorable areas.</p><p>E.The primary reason for moving to pueblos was the social benefits associated with communal life.</p><p>F.People were brought together by the need to produce food cooperatively, as the use of food surpluses in one place to relieve shortages in another ended due to a change in climate.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="BDF"><p>The BDF Because option contradicts the second sentence of the first paragraph of the original text. The original text says that traumatic, that is, it is not easy to adapt to the life of the town, and the answer says that it is easy to adapt. If the option is not selected, the From option is contrary to the last sentence in the fourth paragraph of the original text. The original high elevation, rather than the option said to open more land, so do not choose. The primary option is wrong, the author did not explicitly say which is the primary reason, even in order, the first sentence of the third paragraph is also said population growth, Not benefit, so do not choose .Even option is correct, because the last sentence of the first paragraph mentioned the shortcomings of the town, corresponding to the first part of the options, and the fifth paragraph finally said that the town is the most sensible arrangement, so this answer is correct. The A development option corresponds to the first sentence and the last sentence of the fourth paragraph of the original text. The correct .People option corresponds to the reciprocal four sentences in the fifth paragraph of the original text.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
