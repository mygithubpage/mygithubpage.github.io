            <b>Moving into Pueblos</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>In the Mesa Verde area of the <span class="highlight">ancient</span> North American Southwest, living patterns changed in the thirteenth <span class="highlight">century</span>, with large numbers of people moving into large <span class="highlight">communal</span> dwellings called pueblos, 
often constructed at the edges of canyons, especially on the sides of cliffs. Abandoning small extended-family households to move into these large pueblos with dozens if not hundreds of other
people was probably <span class="question1"><span class="highlight">traumatic</span></span> Few of the cultural traditions and rules that today allow us to <span class="highlight">deal</span> with <span class="highlight"><span class="highlight">dense</span></span> populations existed for these people <span class="highlight">accustomed</span> to <span class="highlight">household</span> <span class="highlight">autonomy</span> and the <span class="highlight">ability</span> 
to move around the <span class="highlight">landscape</span> almost at will. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>And <span class="highlight">besides</span> the awkwardness of having to share walls with neighbors, living in aggregated pueblos introduced other problems. 
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>For people in <span class="highlight">cliff</span> dwellings, hauling water, wood, and food to their homes was a <span class="highlight">major</span> <span class="highlight">chore</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>The <span class="highlight">stress</span> on <span class="highlight">local</span> resources, especially in the firewood needed for daily cooking and warmth,
was particularly <span class="highlight"><span class="question2">intense</span>, </span>and conditions in aggregated pueblos were not very hygienic. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p>
          <p>
            <span class="highlight">Given</span> all the disadvantages of living in aggregated towns, why did people in the thirteenth <span class="highlight">century</span> move into these closely <span class="highlight">packed</span> quarters? For transitions of such suddenness, archaeologists <span class="highlight">consider</span> either pull factors (benefits that drew families together) or push factors (some <span class="highlight">external</span> threat or crisis that forced people to <span class="highlight">aggregate</span>). In this case, push explanations <span class="highlight">dominate</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="highlight">Population</span> growth is considered a particularly <span class="highlight">influential</span> push. After several generations of <span class="highlight">population</span> growth, people <span class="highlight">packed</span> the <span class="highlight">landscape</span> in densities so high that <span class="highlight">communal</span> pueblos may have been a necessary <span class="highlight">outcome</span>. Around Sand <span class="highlight">Canyon</span>, for example, populations grew from 5 -12 people per <span class="highlight">square</span> kilometer in the tenth <span class="highlight">century</span> to as many as 30 - 50 by the 1200s. As densities increased, <span class="highlight">domestic</span> <span class="highlight">architecture</span> became larger, culminating in crowded pueblos. <span class="question6">Some scholars <span class="highlight">expand</span> on this idea by emphasizing a corresponding need for <span class="highlight">arable</span> land to feed growing numbers of people: <span class="highlight">construction</span> of small dams, reservoirs, terraces, and <span class="highlight">field</span> houses indicates that farmers were intensifying their efforts during the 1200s. </span>Competition for good farmland may also have prompted people to <span class="highlight">bond</span> together to <span class="highlight">assert</span> rights over the best fields.</p>
          <p>Another important push was the onset of the Little Ice Age, a <span class="highlight">climatic</span> <span class="highlight">phenomenon</span> that led to cooler temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere. Although the height of the Little Ice Age was still around the corner, some <span class="highlight">evidence</span> suggests that temperatures were falling during the thirteenth <span class="highlight">century</span>. The <span class="highlight">environmental</span> changes <span class="highlight">associated</span> with this <span class="highlight">transition</span> are not fully understood, but people living closest to the San Juan Mountains, to the northeast of Mesa Verde, were affected first. <span class="question8">Growing food at these elevations is always difficult because of the short growing <span class="highlight">season</span>. </span>As the Little Ice Age progressed, farmers probably moved their fields to <span class="highlight">lower</span> elevations, infringing on the lands of other farmers and pushing people together, thus contributing to the aggregations. Archaeologists <span class="highlight">identify</span> a corresponding <span class="highlight">shift</span> in populations toward the south and west toward Mesa Verde and away from higher elevations.</p>
          <p>In the face of all these pushes, people in the Mesa Verde area had yet another <span class="highlight">reason</span> to move into <span class="highlight">communal</span> villages: the need for greater <span class="highlight">cooperation</span>. Sharing and <span class="highlight">cooperation</span> were almost certainly part of early Puebloan life, <span class="highlight">even</span> for people living in largely <span class="highlight">independent</span> single-household residences <span class="highlight">scattered</span> <span class="highlight">across</span> the <span class="highlight">landscape</span>. Archaeologists find that <span class="highlight">even</span> the most <span class="highlight">isolated</span> residences during the eleventh and twelfth centuries obtained some <span class="highlight">pottery</span>, and probably food, from some distance away, while <span class="highlight">major</span> <span class="highlight">ceremonial</span> events were opportunities for sharing food and crafts. Scholars believe that this <span class="highlight">cooperation</span> allowed people to <span class="highlight">contend</span> with a patchy environment in which <span class="highlight">precipitation</span> and other resources <span class="highlight">varied</span> <span class="highlight">across</span> the landscape: if you produce a lot of food one year, you might <span class="highlight">trade</span> it for <span class="highlight">pottery</span> made by a <span class="highlight">distant</span> <span class="highlight">ally</span> who is having difficulty with crops-and the next year, the flow of goods might go in the <span class="highlight">opposite</span> direction. But all of this appears to have changed thirteenth <span class="highlight">century</span>. Although the <span class="highlight">climate</span> remained as <span class="highlight">unpredictable</span> as ever between one year and the next, it became much less <span class="highlight">locally</span> <span class="highlight">diverse</span>. In a bad year for farming, everyone was equally affected.No longer was it helpful to share widely. <span class="highlight">Instead</span>, the most <span class="highlight">sensible</span> thing would be for neighbors to <span class="highlight">combine</span> efforts to produce as much food as possible, and thus aggregated towns were a <span class="highlight">sensible</span> arrangement.</p>
