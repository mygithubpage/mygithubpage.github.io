            <span class="time" data-times="3.73" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in a dance <span class="highlight">history</span> class. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="14.63" data-time="3.73">[00:03.73]</span>Professor: As we have been studying, ballet, the <span class="highlight">classical</span> ballet, is based on formalized movements, <span class="highlight">specific</span> positioning of the arms, feet and the body. <span class="time" data-times="5.39" data-time="18.36">[00:18.36]</span>So, now let's move on to modern dance, also known as theatrical dance. <span class="time" data-times="13.05" data-time="23.75">[00:23.75]</span>Modern dance evolved in the late nineteenth, early twentieth <span class="highlight">century</span>, and in most cases, audiences were very receptive to this <span class="highlight">radical</span> new type of performing art. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.01" data-time="36.8">[00:36.80]</span>Student: Um... what made modern dance so <span class="highlight">radical</span>? </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.48" data-time="41.81">[00:41.81]</span>Professor: Well, for example, I think the best <span class="highlight">analogy</span> to modern dance is modern art or modern music. <span class="time" data-times="9.09" data-time="48.29">[00:48.29]</span>Compared to their <span class="highlight">classical</span> predecessors, these newer art forms are freer, more <span class="highlight">experimental</span>, more improvisational. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="15" data-time="57.38">[00:57.38]</span>Modern dance seeks to show how deep emotions and the music itself, how these intangible attributes can <span class="highlight">affect</span> and <span class="highlight">inspire</span> <span class="highlight">physical</span> movement, and how movement can <span class="highlight">convey</span> emotions to the <span class="highlight">audience</span>.<span class="time" data-times="7.75" data-time="72.38">[01:12.38]</span>As I said, in <span class="highlight">classical</span> ballet, emotions are conveyed <span class="highlight">through</span> a set of strictly formalized movements. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.57" data-time="80.13">[01:20.13]</span>Now, a <span class="highlight">pioneer</span> of modern dance was Isadora Duncan, who was born in 1878. <span class="time" data-times="13.94" data-time="86.7">[01:26.70]</span>Isadora Duncan did study ballet <span class="highlight">briefly</span> as a child, but she quickly developed her own <span class="highlight">unique</span> style, which she called free dance. <span class="time" data-times="6.29" data-time="100.64">[01:40.64]</span>And by age fourteen, she was teaching her free dance to young children and giving recitals. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="15.13" data-time="106.93">[01:46.93]</span>Her early dance <span class="highlight">technique</span> was loosely based on the natural movements of children, running, skipping, <span class="highlight">acting</span> out stories, also on motions from nature, waves crashing onto <span class="highlight">shore</span>, trees swaying in the wind. <span class="time" data-times="7.38" data-time="122.06">[02:02.06]</span>Her <span class="highlight">expressive</span> gestures were motivated from <span class="highlight">within</span> rather than from being dictated by <span class="highlight">strict</span> <span class="highlight">technique</span>. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.6" data-time="129.44">[02:09.44]</span>Duncan also wore her hair down, ballerinas typically <span class="highlight">wear</span> their hair in a tight bun behind the head. <span class="time" data-times="10.17" data-time="136.04">[02:16.04]</span>And <span class="highlight">instead</span> of the short <span class="highlight">steep</span> skirts and <span class="highlight">rigid</span> toeshoes worn by ballerinas, Duncan wore <span class="highlight">loose</span>, flowing tunics, and she dance <span class="highlight">bare</span> foot.<span class="time" data-times="3.95" data-time="146.21">[02:26.21]</span>Now, that was something her audiences had never seen before. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="15.59" data-time="150.16">[02:30.16]</span>Duncan performed in Paris and other European cities dancing to the music of <span class="highlight">classical</span> composers, but avoiding set movements and steps, no two performances were <span class="highlight">alike</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.77" data-time="165.75">[02:45.75]</span>And audiences, for the most part, adored her. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.44" data-time="168.52">[02:48.52]</span>In 1904, she opened a school of modern dance in Berlin. <span class="time" data-times="2.99" data-time="173.96">[02:53.96]</span>And the next year she performed in Russia. <span class="time" data-times="4.19" data-time="176.95">[02:56.95]</span>But the Russian critics were not really kind. <span class="time" data-times="4.6" data-time="181.14">[03:01.14]</span>Some said Duncan's art form was closer to pantomime than to dance. <span class="time" data-times="7.05" data-time="185.74">[03:05.74]</span>But her style was a <span class="highlight">clear</span> <span class="highlight">rebellion</span> against ballet, and ballet is extremely important in Russia.<span class="time" data-times="2.13" data-time="192.79">[03:12.79]</span> A question, Julie? </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="7.17" data-time="194.92">[03:14.92]</span>Student: Yeah. What did Duncan have against ballet? <span class="time" data-times="2.69" data-time="202.09">[03:22.09]</span>I mean, she studied it as a child. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.46" data-time="204.78">[03:24.78]</span>Professor: As a youngster, she might have found it too restrictive, uh, not <span class="highlight">creative</span> enough. <span class="time" data-times="5.96" data-time="210.24">[03:30.24]</span>I think that feeling is exemplied by something that happened earlier in her <span class="highlight">career</span>, in Russia. <span class="time" data-times="7.23" data-time="216.2">[03:36.20]</span>Duncan attended a ballet, and the <span class="highlight">lead</span> dancer was the renowned Russian ballerina,Ana Pavlova.<span class="time" data-times="7.77" data-time="223.43">[03:43.43]</span>The following day, Pavlova invited Duncan to watch her practice. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.8" data-time="231.2">[03:51.20]</span>Duncan accepted but was appalled by what she saw.<span class="time" data-times="12.03" data-time="235">[03:55.00]</span> To her, the exercises that Pavlova and the other ballerinas were doing seemed painful, <span class="highlight">even</span> harmful, standing on tiptoe for hours, moving their bodies in unnatural ways. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="15.86" data-time="247.03">[04:07.03]</span>After seeing this, Duncan publically denounced ballet as a form of acrobatics, uh, <span class="highlight">complicated</span> and excruciating <span class="highlight">mechanism</span> she called it. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="262.89">[04:22.89]</span>This <span class="highlight">critic</span> generated I think some undue <span class="highlight">rivalry</span> between ballet and modern dance, and it would take a long time, many years in fact, for the <span class="highlight">rivalry</span> to <span class="highlight">calm</span> down. </p>
