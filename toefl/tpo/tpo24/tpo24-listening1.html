        <h3>Listening Text</h3>
        <article>
          <p>Narrator: Listen to a conversation between a student and a clerk in the bookstore.</p>
          <p>:Student: Hi. Can you tell me where to find New Kind of Science, by, uh, by Stephen Wolfram?</p>
          <p>:Clerk: OK</p>
          <p>:Student: ...uh, I couldn't find it</p>
          <p>:Clerk: OK. Let me look it up on the computer for you. Who would you say the author was?</p>
          <p>:Student: It's a Stephen Wolfram.</p>
          <p>:Clerk: OK. Let's see... Hmm... no, it's not coming up. Hmm..,. I am not seeing it</p>
          <p>:Student: Um...hmm.</p>
          <p>:Clerk: This is for a class here at the university, right?</p>
          <p>:Student: Yeah, it's assigned reading for a class that I am taking.</p>
          <p>:Clerk: It's for the semester, right? You are not buying it in advance for next year or anything.</p>
          <p>:Student: No, no. It's for a class I am taking now.</p>
          <p>:Clerk: Hmm...</p>
          <p>:Student: Oh, oh, you know what? Um, it's for a graduate class. Would that maybe make a difference? I mean, I am an undergrad, but I am just taking this one class in the graduate department, so...</p>
          <p>:Clerk: No, no. I don't think that's it. That shouldn't make any difference. But, hmm... let me see... maybe it's just...it could be that whoever that entered it misspelled the title or the author's name, so I can't find it on the computer and I can't tell if it's sold out. But if it's sold out, we would probably be getting a new shipment within about a week or so.</p>
          <p>:Student: OK. Well, uh, I was hoping to get it sooner because like we already have assignments and you know, I mean, I guess I can get it from the library.</p>
          <p>:Clerk: Right, of course. But I am trying to check. If we've ordered more, then that back orders information should be in the computer too. Let's see... back order... Wolfram, Stephen..,. no, no. I am not seeing it. I am sorry. We just don't seem to carry it.</p>
          <p>:Student: Uh-huh.</p>
          <p>:Clerk: This is odd though. What is...what's your professor's name? I could try searching for his or her classes in the database. That might help</p>
          <p>:Student: Um...OK. It's professor Kayne.</p>
          <p>:Clerk: K-A-N-E?</p>
          <p>:Student: No. It's professor Kayne, K-A-Y-N-E. He's in the computer science department.</p>
          <p>:Clerk: Oh. It's for a computer science course, is it?</p>
          <p>:Student: Yeah.</p>
          <p>:Clerk: Well, that must be it. Computer science books are sold across the street in the computer store.</p>
          <p>:Student: Oh, are there signs up anywhere?</p>
          <p>:Clerk: I don't know.</p>
          <p>:Student: Maybe they should put some up. It could have save us both some time.</p>
          <p>:Clerk: Yeah. Well, anyway, I'll bet that's the problem. Check across the street. I'll bet they have it. But if not, come back, and I'll help you find it somewhere else. I can call around to see if other bookstores might have it. OK?</p>
          <p>:Student: OK. Thanks a lot. Bye</p>
          <p>:Clerk: Bye </p>
