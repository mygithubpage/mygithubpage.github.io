I moved into my new apartment off-campus yesterday.</p><p>(man) How do you like it?</p><p>(woman) It's great. There's just one problem.</p><p>(man) What's that?</p><p>(woman) Well, I don't have internet connection in my new apartment so I can't use the computer to access the internet from my room.</p><p>(man) And that's really important.</p><p>(woman) Right, I need it to do research for classes, email people, stuff like that. I use it almost everyday.</p><p>(man) So are you going to pay to get it installed in the apartment?</p><p>(woman) Well, I've called a couple of internet companies in the area and it's no trouble for them to send someone out to my apartment to install internet service. It's just the cost. I have to pay every month for the service.</p><p>(man) Well, you know, there's always the computer center on campus. The computers there have free internet access. Couldn't you use them?</p><p>(woman) I could. It's just that I don't have classes every day, so I'd have to go campus on some days just to use the internet. And that computer center can get crowded sometimes.</p><p>(man) Hmm,</p><p>(woman) So, I'm not sure what to do.</p></article></section><section id="question"><h4>Question</h4><p>Briefly summarize the problem the speakers are discussing.

There are two solutions from the man: first, she could pay to get the Internet installed, and second, she could go to the computer center on campus. I believe that the first option is a better one for some reasons. First of all, the Internet connection at home is crucial for most of the students, especially after class, since students always can't live without Internet for their homework. And apart from that, they need entertainment such as downloading mp3, or watching online programs. After all they could not stay in the computer center all day long. Secondly, the woman could find some neighbor or roommate to share the cost, so it wouldn't be a problem either. (155 words)</p></article></section></main></body></html>
