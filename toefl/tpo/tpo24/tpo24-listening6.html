            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.6" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in an <span class="underline">astronomy</span> class. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.57" data-time="8.6">[00:08.60]</span>Professor: Many people have been fascinated about <span class="underline">Venus</span> for centuries because of its thick cloud cover, this so-called <span class="underline">planet</span> of mystery and all of that. <span class="time" data-times="2.72" data-time="18.17">[00:18.17]</span>Well, what's under those clouds?<span class="time" data-times="2.23" data-time="20.89">[00:20.89]</span> What's the surface of the <span class="underline">planet</span> like? <span class="time" data-times="7.5" data-time="23.12">[00:23.12]</span>Some questions about the surface are still unresolved but, but we have learned a lot about it in the past several years. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.16" data-time="30.62">[00:30.62]</span>First of all, let me talk about how we have been able to get past those clouds. <span class="time" data-times="6.96" data-time="35.78">[00:35.78]</span>First, there were Soviet modules that landed directly on the surface and sent back some images of what was around them. <span class="time" data-times="4.11" data-time="42.74">[00:42.74]</span> <span class="underline">Second</span>, we did some <span class="underline">radar</span> imaging from satellites from above. <span class="time" data-times="2.5" data-time="46.85">[00:46.85]</span> <span class="underline">Radar</span> can get <span class="underline">through</span> the clouds. <span class="time" data-times="2.92" data-time="49.35">[00:49.35]</span>So what have we learned?<span class="time" data-times="2.14" data-time="52.27">[00:52.27]</span> Yes, Karen? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="11.93" data-time="54.41">[00:54.41]</span>Student: Well, I remember reading that there's not really a lot going on, that the surface of <span class="underline">Venus</span> is just <span class="underline">flat</span> and smooth in a lot of places. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.02" data-time="66.34">[01:06.34]</span>Professor: Yeah, smooth in a lot of places. <span class="time" data-times="3.25" data-time="69.36">[01:09.36]</span>But that's not, um... that's not the whole picture. <span class="time" data-times="10.2" data-time="72.61">[01:12.61]</span>In other areas, you've got canyons, ripped valleys, <span class="underline">meteor</span> craters, uh, <span class="underline">lava</span> domes, these <span class="underline">lava</span> formations that look like <span class="underline">giant</span> pancakes.<span class="time" data-times="1.83" data-time="82.81">[01:22.81]</span> And also volcanoes. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.04" data-time="84.64">[01:24.64]</span>Well, one of the most interesting features on the surface are in fact the <span class="underline">shield</span> volcanoes. <span class="time" data-times="10.4" data-time="89.68">[01:29.68]</span> <span class="underline">Shield</span> volcanoes formed when <span class="underline">magma</span> comes out of the ground in the same <span class="underline">spot</span> over and over again. <span class="time" data-times="6.74" data-time="100.08">[01:40.08]</span>Remember, <span class="underline">magma</span> is hot <span class="underline">molten</span> rock that's <span class="underline">underground</span>, and it is called <span class="underline">lava</span> when it reaches the surface. <span class="time" data-times="4.41" data-time="106.82">[01:46.82]</span>Uh, so the <span class="underline">lava</span> builds up, and hardens, and a <span class="underline">volcano</span> forms. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.77" data-time="111.23">[01:51.23]</span>Now, the <span class="underline">lava</span> on <span class="underline">Venus</span> is thin. <span class="time" data-times="1.91" data-time="114">[01:54.00]</span>It spreads out easily.<span class="time" data-times="4" data-time="115.91">[01:55.91]</span> So <span class="underline">shield</span> volcanoes have very <span class="underline">gentle</span> sloping sides. <span class="time" data-times="7.28" data-time="119.91">[01:59.91]</span>[They are called <span class="underline">shield</span> volcanoes, because viewed from above, they kind of <span class="underline">resemble</span> shields, you know, like a warrior's <span class="underline">shield</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="13.43" data-time="127.19">[02:07.19]</span>But what's particularly interesting about these volcanoes is that most of the volcanoes here on Earth are not <span class="underline">shield</span> volcanoes. <span class="time" data-times="7.82" data-time="140.62">[02:20.62]</span> <span class="underline">Instead</span>, they are other <span class="underline">volcano</span> types, like <span class="underline">strata</span> volcanoes, for example, which are a result of <span class="underline">tectonic</span> <span class="underline">plate</span> movement. <span class="time" data-times="1.93" data-time="148.44">[02:28.44]</span>Remember <span class="underline">tectonic</span> plates? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.81" data-time="150.37">[02:30.37]</span>
              <span class="underline">Underneath</span> the Earth's <span class="underline">crust</span>, there are a number of shifting slabs or plates that are slowly moving. <span class="time" data-times="8.07" data-time="156.18">[02:36.18]</span>And in the zones on the edges of the plates where different plates meet and <span class="underline">interact</span>, that's where we get most of Earth's volcanoes </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6" data-time="164.25">[02:44.25]</span>On <span class="underline">Venus</span>, however, volcanoes are not clustered in <span class="underline">discrete</span> zones like they are on Earth. <span class="time" data-times="5.27" data-time="170.25">[02:50.25]</span> <span class="underline">Instead</span>, they are more or less randomly <span class="underline">scattered</span> over <span class="underline">Venus</span>'s surface. <span class="time" data-times="2.77" data-time="175.52">[02:55.52]</span>Well, that's <span class="underline">significant</span>. <span class="time" data-times="13.16" data-time="178.29">[02:58.29]</span> <span class="underline">Venus</span> has mostly <span class="underline">shield</span> volcanoes, and they are randomly <span class="underline">scattered</span>, that indicates that <span class="underline">Venus</span> does not have moving <span class="underline">tectonic</span> plates, and that's a big <span class="underline">difference</span> compared to Earth. <span class="time" data-times="7.63" data-time="191.45">[03:11.45]</span>Here on Earth, moving <span class="underline">tectonic</span> plates are a <span class="underline">major</span> geological <span class="underline">element</span>, just <span class="underline">crucial</span> for the whole surface <span class="underline">dynamic</span>, right? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.53" data-time="199.08">[03:19.08]</span>So why doesn't <span class="underline">Venus</span> have them?<span class="time" data-times="3.09" data-time="201.61">[03:21.61]</span> Well, there are a few theories. <span class="time" data-times="10.63" data-time="204.7">[03:24.70]</span>One of them is that this has to do with the fact that <span class="underline">Venus</span> has no surface water that's needed to kind of lubricate the movement of the plates, you know, like oceans on Earth. <span class="time" data-times="1.87" data-time="215.33">[03:35.33]</span>Yeah, I forgot to spell that out.<span class="time" data-times="2.61" data-time="217.2">[03:37.20]</span> Uh, <span class="underline">Venus</span> has no surface water. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.76" data-time="219.81">[03:39.81]</span>Student: Wait a <span class="underline">second</span>.<span class="time" data-times="2.62" data-time="221.57">[03:41.57]</span> Did you say we have <span class="underline">shield</span> volcanoes on Earth? <span class="time" data-times="1.54" data-time="224.19">[03:44.19]</span>Can you give an example? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.09" data-time="225.73">[03:45.73]</span>Professor: Sure. The volcanoes in the Hawaii islands, in the <span class="underline">Pacific</span> Ocean are <span class="underline">shield</span> volcanoes. <span class="time" data-times="2.82" data-time="231.82">[03:51.82]</span>They are formed over a hot <span class="underline">spot</span> of <span class="underline">magma</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.52" data-time="234.64">[03:54.64]</span>So while on Earth we have several types of volcanoes, on <span class="underline">Venus</span> there's mostly the one type. <span class="time" data-times="1.61" data-time="242.16">[04:02.16]</span>Uh, Eric? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.38" data-time="243.77">[04:03.77]</span>Student: Are the volcanoes on <span class="underline">Venus</span> still active? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.95" data-time="252.15">[04:12.15]</span>Professor: Well, that's an interesting question. <span class="time" data-times="2.81" data-time="254.1">[04:14.10]</span>There is still some discussion on that point.<span class="time" data-times="2.01" data-time="256.91">[04:16.91]</span> But here's what we do now. <span class="time" data-times="9.17" data-time="258.92">[04:18.92]</span>First, the <span class="underline">level</span> of <span class="underline">sulfur</span> <span class="underline">dioxide</span> gas above <span class="underline">Venus</span>'s clouds shows large and very frequent fluctuations. <span class="time" data-times="9.01" data-time="268.09">[04:28.09]</span>It is quite possible that these fluctuations, the huge increase and <span class="underline">decrease</span> of <span class="underline">sulfur</span> <span class="underline">dioxide</span>, happening again and again. <span class="time" data-times="7.42" data-time="277.1">[04:37.10]</span>It's quite possible that this is <span class="underline">due</span> to <span class="underline">volcanic</span> eruptions, because <span class="underline">volcanic</span> eruptions often <span class="underline">emit</span> gases. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.85" data-time="284.52">[04:44.52]</span>If that's the case, volcanism could very well be the <span class="underline">root</span> cause of <span class="underline">Venus</span>'s thick cloud cover. <span class="time" data-times="5.83" data-time="291.37">[04:51.37]</span>And also we have observed bursts of radio energy from the <span class="underline">planet</span>'s surface. <span class="time" data-times="4.79" data-time="297.2">[04:57.20]</span>These bursts are <span class="underline">similar</span> to what we see when volcanoes <span class="underline">erupt</span> on Earth. <span class="time" data-times="4.32" data-time="301.99">[05:01.99]</span>So this too suggests <span class="underline">ongoing</span> <span class="underline">volcanic</span> <span class="underline">activity</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="306.31">[05:06.31]</span>But although this is <span class="underline">intriguing</span> <span class="underline">evidence</span>, no one's actually observed a <span class="underline">Venus</span> <span class="underline">volcano</span> erupting yet, so we can't be <span class="underline">positive</span>. </p>
