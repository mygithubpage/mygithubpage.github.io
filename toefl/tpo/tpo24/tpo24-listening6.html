Basically, the professor has raised a lot of questions at the beginning, and then said that we have learned this in the past few years, but began to say that basically is a summary of the recent Venus mapping, choose A.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>How were scientists able to learn new information about Venus' surface?Click on 2 answers.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

It is almost all shield volcanoes on Venus. Choose A! Instead, it followed, saying that the earth is not the case and that the volcanoes on Earth were all formed because of the movement of the earth's crust. In fact, if you understand the movement of the crust here, you can do the problem, but if you don't understand it, then you can listen to it. The professor explained it, and it is also barrier-free. C is also selected.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor mention the fact that Venus has no surface water?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To give an example of a discovery that was unexpected.</p><p>B. To illustrate the consequences of intense volcanic activity.</p><p>C.

Strong winds that blow dust into the atmosphere.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>If that's the case, volcanism could very well be the root cause of Venus's thick cloud cover. All are causal words, prompt words. It is said that this is most likely due to the explosion of the volcano and the release of gas, forming a cloud.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the professor's opinion about the theory that Venus' volcanoes are active?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The theory has recently been proved by direct observation.</p><p>B. At least two kinds of evidence support the theory.</p><p>C. The data collected so far about the theory are contradictory.</p><p>D. New findings have made the theory quite unlikely.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Professor said that this also proves that Venus's volcano is active, but there is no direct evidence and no one really sees the volcanic eruption. Obviously, the professor is skeptical of the two theories, but at least two proofs are available, so choose B.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
