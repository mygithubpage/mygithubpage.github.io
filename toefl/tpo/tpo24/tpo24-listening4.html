              <span class="time" data-times="4.92" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to a <span class="underline">conversation</span> between a student and his geography professor. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.33" data-time="4.92">[00:04.92]</span>Student: Hi. Professor Brown. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.69" data-time="12.25">[00:12.25]</span>Professor: Hi. Paul. What can I do for you? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.93" data-time="13.94">[00:13.94]</span>Student: I have a question about the final exam. <span class="time" data-times="2.89" data-time="15.87">[00:15.87]</span>I mean, will it cover everything we've done all <span class="underline">term</span>? <span class="time" data-times="2.94" data-time="18.76">[00:18.76]</span>Or just what we've been doing since the mid-term exam. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.61" data-time="21.7">[00:21.70]</span>Professor: Everything we've done all <span class="underline">term</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.14" data-time="23.31">[00:23.31]</span>Student: Oh, boy.<span class="time" data-times="9.11" data-time="24.45">[00:24.45]</span> You know, I am still not too <span class="underline">clear</span> about the <span class="underline">hydrologic</span> <span class="underline">cycle</span>, um, the <span class="underline">transfer</span> of water back and forth between the earth and the <span class="underline">atmosphere</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.16" data-time="33.56">[00:33.56]</span>I really blew the question about it on the mid-term exam.<span class="time" data-times="2.38" data-time="36.72">[00:36.72]</span> I want to do better on the final exam.<span class="time" data-times="1.61" data-time="39.1">[00:39.10]</span> But I am still having trouble with it. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.08" data-time="40.71">[00:40.71]</span>Professor: Well, uh, have you been to the tutoring center? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.31" data-time="43.79">[00:43.79]</span>Student: No, not for geography anyway. <span class="time" data-times="4.7" data-time="46.1">[00:46.10]</span>Isn't that just for when you need help with writing, like an <span class="underline">essay</span> or a research paper? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="0.72" data-time="50.8">[00:50.80]</span>Professor: Oh, no. <span class="time" data-times="2.31" data-time="51.52">[00:51.52]</span>you can get tutoring in a lot of subjects. <span class="time" data-times="3.06" data-time="53.83">[00:53.83]</span>Some graduate students from this <span class="underline">department</span> <span class="underline">tutor</span> there. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.46" data-time="56.89">[00:56.89]</span>Student: That's good to know. <span class="time" data-times="2.69" data-time="58.35">[00:58.35]</span>But I <span class="underline">hardly</span> go there because I have a part-time job. <span class="time" data-times="2.16" data-time="61.04">[01:01.04]</span>I never <span class="underline">seem</span> to be free when they are open. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.27" data-time="63.2">[01:03.20]</span>Professor: Well, they will be extending their hours when final exams begin. <span class="time" data-times="1.11" data-time="66.47">[01:06.47]</span>You might try then. <span class="time" data-times="4.22" data-time="67.58">[01:07.58]</span>But um... Well, since you are here now, can I help you with something? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.52" data-time="71.8">[01:11.80]</span>Student: Well, the <span class="underline">hydrologic</span> <span class="underline">cycle</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.53" data-time="74.32">[01:14.32]</span>I remember we went over a <span class="underline">diagram</span> in class. <span class="time" data-times="11.36" data-time="77.85">[01:17.85]</span>And from what I remember, water changes back and forth from water in lakes and oceans to <span class="underline">vapor</span>, and then back to water again when it falls as rain or snow, as <span class="underline">precipitation</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.19" data-time="89.21">[01:29.21]</span>It's <span class="underline">constantly</span> being recycled <span class="underline">through</span> <span class="underline">evaporation</span> and <span class="underline">condensation</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.93" data-time="93.4">[01:33.40]</span>Professor: That's it. Basically. <span class="time" data-times="4.22" data-time="95.33">[01:35.33]</span>Um... so exactly what is it you don't understand? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.05" data-time="99.55">[01:39.55]</span>Student: OK. I guess what I am really <span class="underline">confused</span> about is how the <span class="underline">topography</span> of the land, the mountains and valleys and <span class="underline">stuff</span>, affects <span class="underline">precipitation</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.81" data-time="107.6">[01:47.60]</span>Professor: OK. Good question.<span class="time" data-times="4.77" data-time="109.41">[01:49.41]</span> <span class="underline">Precipitation</span> is influenced by <span class="underline">topography</span> among other things. <span class="time" data-times="3.82" data-time="114.18">[01:54.18]</span>Um, why don't we talk about lake-effect snow? <span class="time" data-times="8.38" data-time="118">[01:58.00]</span>It's a <span class="underline">phenomenon</span> that occurs anywhere you have a large lake that doesn't <span class="underline">freeze</span> and have cold <span class="underline">air</span> flowing over it, mostly in the Northern Hemisphere. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.23" data-time="126.38">[02:06.38]</span>Student: Like the great lakes in the United States? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.32" data-time="128.61">[02:08.61]</span>Professor: Yeah. What happens is that the cold arctic <span class="underline">air</span> blows <span class="underline">across</span> the lake from the north in winter. <span class="time" data-times="7.14" data-time="134.93">[02:14.93]</span>And as the <span class="underline">air</span> crosses the lake, the <span class="underline">lower</span> <span class="underline">layer</span> is warmed by the lake water, which is much warmer than the arctic <span class="underline">air</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.85" data-time="142.07">[02:22.07]</span>And as this <span class="underline">air</span> is warmed and picks up <span class="underline">moisture</span>, it becomes lighter than the <span class="underline">air</span> above it. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.87" data-time="147.92">[02:27.92]</span>Student: So it starts to rise, right? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.1" data-time="149.79">[02:29.79]</span>Professor: Yes. And clouds begin to form. <span class="time" data-times="6.05" data-time="152.89">[02:32.89]</span>When the <span class="underline">air</span> gets closer to the <span class="underline">shore</span>, it's slowed down by the land and starts to pile up. <span class="time" data-times="6.8" data-time="158.94">[02:38.94]</span>So it rises <span class="underline">even</span> faster because it has nowhere else to go, that's where <span class="underline">topography</span> comes into the picture. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.93" data-time="165.74">[02:45.74]</span>Student: And then it snows because as the <span class="underline">air</span> rises, it cools off and loses its <span class="underline">capacity</span> to hold water <span class="underline">vapor</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.16" data-time="172.67">[02:52.67]</span>Professor: That's right. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.72" data-time="173.83">[02:53.83]</span>Student: OK. Thanks. Any <span class="underline">chance</span> you'll have this question on the final? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.98" data-time="177.55">[02:57.55]</span>Professor: I don't know yet. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="179.53">[02:59.53]</span>But you <span class="underline">seem</span> to have a <span class="underline">handle</span> on it. </p>
