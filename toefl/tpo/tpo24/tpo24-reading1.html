            <b>Lake Water</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>Where does the water in a lake come from, and how does water leave it? Water enters a lake from inflowing rivers, from underwater seeps and springs, from overland flow off the surrounding land, and from rain falling directly on the lake surface. Water leaves a lake via outflowing rivers, by soaking into the bed of the lake, and by <span class="underline">evaporation</span>. <span class="light">So much</span> is <span class="underline">obvious</span>.</p>
          <p>The questions become more <span class="underline">complicated</span> when actual volumes of water are considered: how much water enters and leaves by each <span class="underline">route</span>? Discovering the inputs and outputs of rivers is a matter of measuring the discharges of every inflowing and outflowing <span class="underline">stream</span> and river. Then exchanges with the <span class="underline">atmosphere</span> are calculated by finding the <span class="underline">difference</span> between the gains from rain, as measured (rather <span class="underline">roughly</span>) by rain gauges, and the losses by <span class="underline">evaporation</span>, measured with models that correct for the other sources of water loss. For the <span class="underline">majority</span> of lakes, certainly those surrounded by forests, input from overland flow is too small to have a <span class="underline">noticeable</span> effect. Changes in lake <span class="underline">level</span> not explained by river flows plus exchanges with the <span class="underline">atmosphere</span> must be <span class="underline">due</span> to the net <span class="underline">difference</span> between what seeps into the lake from the <span class="underline">groundwater</span> and what leaks into the <span class="underline">groundwater</span>. Note the word "net": measuring the actual amounts of <span class="underline">groundwater</span> seepage into the lake and out of the lake is a much more <span class="underline">complicated</span> matter than merely inferring their <span class="underline">difference</span>.</p>
          <p>Once all this information has been gathered, it becomes possible to judge whether a lake's flow is mainly <span class="underline">due</span> to its surface inputs and outputs or to its <span class="underline">underground</span> inputs and outputs. 
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>If the <span class="underline">former</span> are greater, the lake is a surface-water-dominated lake; if the <span class="underline">latter</span>, it is a seepage-dominated lake. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>Occasionally, <span class="underline">common</span> <span class="underline">sense</span> tells you which of these 
two possibilities applies. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>For example, a pond in hilly country that maintains a <span class="underline">steady</span> water <span class="underline">level</span> all <span class="underline">through</span> a dry summer in spite of having no streams flowing into it must <span class="underline">obviously</span> 
be seepage dominated. Conversely, a pond with a <span class="underline">stream</span> flowing in one end and out the other, which dries up when the <span class="underline">stream</span> dries up, is clearly surface water dominated. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p>
          <p>By whatever means, a lake is <span class="underline">constantly</span> gaining water and losing water: its water does not just sit there, or, anyway, not for long. This raises the matter of a lake's residence time. The residence time is the <span class="underline">average</span> length of time that any <span class="underline">particular</span> <span class="underline">molecule</span> of water remains in the lake, and it is calculated by dividing the <span class="underline">volume</span> of water in the lake by the <span class="underline">rate</span> at which water leaves the lake. The residence time is an <span class="underline">average</span>; the time spent in the lake by a <span class="underline">given</span> <span class="underline">molecule</span> (if we could follow its fate) would <span class="underline">depend</span> on the <span class="underline">route</span> it took: it might flow <span class="underline">through</span> as part of the fastest, most direct <span class="underline">current</span>, or it might circle in a backwater for an <span class="underline">indefinitely</span> long time.</p>
          <p>Residence times <span class="underline">vary</span> enormously. They <span class="underline">range</span> from a few days for small lakes up to several hundred years for large ones; Lake Tahoe, in California, has a residence time of 700 years. The residence times for the Great Lakes of North America, namely, Lakes <span class="underline">Superior</span>, Michigan, Huron, Erie, and Ontario, are, <span class="underline">respectively</span>, 190,100,22,2.5, and 6 years. Lake Erie's is the lowest: although its area is larger than Lake Ontario' s, its <span class="underline">volume</span> is less than one-third as great because it is so shallow-less than 20 meters on <span class="underline">average</span>.</p>
          <p>A <span class="underline">given</span> lake's residence time is by no means a fixed <span class="underline">quantity</span>. It depends on the <span class="underline">rate</span> at which water enters the lake, and that depends on the <span class="underline">rainfall</span> and the <span class="underline">evaporation</span> <span class="underline">rate</span>. <span class="underline">Climatic</span> change (the result of global warming?) is <span class="underline">dramatically</span> affecting the residence times of some lakes in northwestern Ontario. Canada. In the period 1970 to 1986, <span class="underline">rainfall</span> in the area decreased from 1,000 millimeters to 650 millimeters per annum, while above-average temperatures speeded up the evapotranspiration <span class="underline">rate</span> (the <span class="underline">rate</span> at which water is lost to the <span class="underline">atmosphere</span> <span class="underline">through</span> <span class="underline">evaporation</span> and the processes of plant life).</p>
          <p>The result has been that the residence time of one of the lakes increased from 5 to 18 years during the study period. The slowing down of water <span class="underline">renewal</span> leads to a <span class="underline">chain</span> of further consequences; it causes dissolved chemicals to become increasingly concentrated, and this, in turn, has a <span class="underline">marked</span> effect on all living things in the lake.</p>
