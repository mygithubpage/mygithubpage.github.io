          <h4 class="w3-center">Lake Water</h4>
          <p>Where does the water in a lake come from, and how does water leave it? Water enters a lake from inflowing rivers, from underwater seeps and springs, from overland flow off the surrounding land, and from rain falling directly on the lake surface. Water leaves a lake via outflowing rivers, by soaking into the bed of the lake, and by <span class="highlight">evaporation</span>. <span class="question1">So much</span> is <span class="highlight">obvious</span>.</p>
          <p>The questions become more <span class="highlight">complicated</span> when actual volumes of water are considered: how much water enters and leaves by each <span class="highlight">route</span>? Discovering the inputs and outputs of rivers is a matter of measuring the discharges of every inflowing and outflowing <span class="highlight">stream</span> and river. Then exchanges with the <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span> are calculated by finding the <span class="highlight">difference</span> between the <span class="question2">gains</span> from rain, as measured (rather <span class="highlight">roughly</span>) by rain gauges, and the losses by <span class="highlight">evaporation</span>, measured with models that correct for the other sources of water loss. For the <span class="highlight">majority</span> of lakes, certainly those surrounded by forests, input from overland flow is too small to have a <span class="highlight">noticeable</span> effect. Changes in lake <span class="highlight">level</span> not explained by river flows plus exchanges with the <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span> must be <span class="highlight">due</span> to the net <span class="highlight">difference</span> between what seeps into the lake from the <span class="highlight">groundwater</span> and what leaks into the <span class="highlight">groundwater</span>. <span class="question4">Note the word "net</span>": measuring the actual amounts of <span class="highlight">groundwater</span> seepage into the lake and out of the lake is a much more <span class="highlight">complicated</span> matter than merely inferring their <span class="highlight">difference</span>.</p>
          <p>Once all this information has been gathered, it becomes possible to judge whether a lake's flow is mainly <span class="highlight">due</span> to its surface inputs and outputs or to its <span class="highlight">underground</span> inputs and outputs. 
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>If the <span class="highlight">former</span> are greater, the lake is a surface-water-dominated lake; if the <span class="highlight">latter</span>, it is a seepage-dominated lake. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>Occasionally, <span class="highlight">common</span> <span class="highlight">sense</span> tells you which of these 
two possibilities applies. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>For example, a pond in hilly country that maintains a <span class="highlight">steady</span> water <span class="highlight">level</span> all <span class="highlight">through</span> a dry summer in spite of having no streams flowing into it must <span class="highlight">obviously</span> 
be seepage dominated. <span class="question5">Conversely</span>, a pond with a <span class="highlight">stream</span> flowing in one end and out the other, which dries up when the <span class="highlight">stream</span> dries up, is clearly surface water dominated. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p>
          <p>By whatever means, a lake is <span class="highlight">constantly</span> gaining water and losing water: its water does not just sit there, or, anyway, not for long. This raises the matter of a lake's residence time. The residence time is the <span class="highlight">average</span> length of time that any <span class="highlight">particular</span> <span class="highlight">molecule</span> of water remains in the lake, and it is calculated by dividing the <span class="highlight">volume</span> of water in the lake by the <span class="highlight">rate</span> at which water leaves the lake. The residence time is an <span class="highlight">average</span>; the time spent in the lake by a <span class="highlight">given</span> <span class="highlight">molecule</span> (if we could follow its fate) would <span class="highlight">depend</span> on the <span class="highlight">route</span> it took: it might flow <span class="highlight">through</span> as part of the fastest, most direct <span class="highlight">current</span>, or it might circle in a backwater for an <span class="highlight">indefinitely</span> long time.</p>
          <p>Residence times <span class="highlight">vary</span> enormously. They <span class="highlight">range</span> from a few days for small lakes up to several hundred years for large ones; Lake Tahoe, in California, has a residence time of 700 years. The residence times for the Great Lakes of North America, namely, Lakes <span class="highlight">Superior</span>, Michigan, Huron, Erie, and Ontario, are, <span class="highlight">respectively</span>, 190,100,22,2.5, and 6 years. Lake Erie's is the lowest: although its area is larger than Lake Ontario' s, its <span class="highlight">volume</span> is less than one-third as great because it is so shallow-less than 20 meters on <span class="highlight">average</span>.</p>
          <p>A <span class="highlight">given</span> lake's residence time is by no means a fixed <span class="highlight">quantity</span>. It depends on the <span class="highlight">rate</span> at which water enters the lake, and that depends on the <span class="highlight">rainfall</span> and the <span class="highlight">evaporation</span> <span class="highlight">rate</span>. <span class="highlight">Climatic</span> change (the result of global warming?) is <span class="highlight">dramatically</span> affecting the residence times of some lakes in northwestern Ontario. Canada. In the period 1970 to 1986, <span class="highlight">rainfall</span> in the area decreased from 1,000 millimeters to 650 millimeters per annum, while above-average temperatures speeded up the evapotranspiration <span class="highlight">rate</span> (the <span class="highlight">rate</span> at which water is lost to the <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span> <span class="highlight">through</span> <span class="highlight">evaporation</span> and the processes of plant life).</p>
          <p>The result has been that the residence time of one of the lakes increased from 5 to 18 years during the study period. The slowing down of water <span class="highlight">renewal</span> leads to a <span class="highlight">chain</span> of <span class="question10">further</span> consequences; it causes dissolved chemicals to become increasingly concentrated, and this, in turn, has a <span class="highlight">marked</span> effect on all living things in the lake.</p>

            <div class="explanation">
              <p>C. Using two proper nouns as the keywords to locate the last sentence, said that the residence time of E is the smallest. Although the E area is larger than O, but the volume is small, so the correct answer is C, be careful not to dig a layer of election B, Because shallow is the cause of less volume, it cannot directly cause the residence time to become smaller. But to tell the truth, the individual chose the answer first. Afterwards, it would be more accurate if he carefully considered it. It is more direct. A is obviously not the point emphasized by the author, D did not say</p>
              <p>*B is the wrong option because the article says E is shallow, and it is wrong with the content of the article.</p>

            <div class="explanation">
              <p>A rhetorical question, first look at the sentence where the example is located, and find that the whole sentence is an example. In the past, looking ahead, it was a tragedy. The first sentence is also an example. So, looking at the opening sentence, the opening sentence says that the residence time has changed a lot, that is to say, There are a lot of lakes behind to say that their residence time is different, which proves that the change is very big, so the correct answer is A. Note that mentioning the Great Lakes is not for comparison with T Lake because T Lake itself is an example, so D Wrong, others are less reliable.</p>

The next sentence says that the slowing down of water renewal will bring a series of consequences. That is to say, the reduction in precipitation mentioned earlier or the increase in evaporation will be attributed to renewal slowdown, so the correct answer is C, and none of the other answers.</p>
