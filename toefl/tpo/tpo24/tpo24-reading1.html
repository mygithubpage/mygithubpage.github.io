Water enters a lake from inflowing rivers, from underwater seeps and springs, from overland flow off the surrounding land, and from rain falling directly on the lake surface. Water leaves a lake via outflowing rivers, by soaking into the bed of the lake, and by <span class="highlight">evaporation</span>. <span class="question1">So much</span> is <span class="highlight">obvious</span>.</p><p>The questions become more <span class="highlight">complicated</span> when actual volumes of water are considered: how much water enters and leaves by each <span class="highlight">route</span>? Discovering the inputs and outputs of rivers is a matter of measuring the discharges of every inflowing and outflowing <span class="highlight">stream</span> and river. Then exchanges with the <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span> are calculated by finding the <span class="highlight">difference</span> between the <span class="question2">gains</span> from rain, as measured (rather <span class="highlight">roughly</span>) by rain gauges, and the losses by <span class="highlight">evaporation</span>, measured with models that correct for the other sources of water loss. For the <span class="highlight">majority</span> of lakes, certainly those surrounded by forests, input from overland flow is too small to have a <span class="highlight">noticeable</span> effect. Changes in lake <span class="highlight">level</span> not explained by river flows plus exchanges with the <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span> must be <span class="highlight">due</span> to the net <span class="highlight">difference</span> between what seeps into the lake from the <span class="highlight">groundwater</span> and what leaks into the <span class="highlight">groundwater</span>. <span class="question4">Note the word "net</span>": measuring the actual amounts of <span class="highlight">groundwater</span> seepage into the lake and out of the lake is a much more <span class="highlight">complicated</span> matter than merely inferring their <span class="highlight">difference</span>.</p><p>Once all this information has been gathered, it becomes possible to judge whether a lake's flow is mainly <span class="highlight">due</span> to its surface inputs and outputs or to its <span class="highlight">underground</span> inputs and outputs. 
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>If the <span class="highlight">former</span> are greater, the lake is a surface-water-dominated lake; if the <span class="highlight">latter</span>, it is a seepage-dominated lake. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>Occasionally, <span class="highlight">common</span><span class="highlight">sense</span> tells you which of these 
two possibilities applies. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>For example, a pond in hilly country that maintains a <span class="highlight">steady</span> water <span class="highlight">level</span> all <span class="highlight">through</span> a dry summer in spite of having no streams flowing into it must <span class="highlight">obviously</span> 
be seepage dominated. <span class="question5">Conversely</span>, a pond with a <span class="highlight">stream</span> flowing in one end and out the other, which dries up when the <span class="highlight">stream</span> dries up, is clearly surface water dominated. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p><p>By whatever means, a lake is <span class="highlight">constantly</span> gaining water and losing water: its water does not just sit there, or, anyway, not for long. This raises the matter of a lake's residence time. The residence time is the <span class="highlight">average</span> length of time that any <span class="highlight">particular</span><span class="highlight">molecule</span> of water remains in the lake, and it is calculated by dividing the <span class="highlight">volume</span> of water in the lake by the <span class="highlight">rate</span> at which water leaves the lake. The residence time is an <span class="highlight">average</span>; the time spent in the lake by a <span class="highlight">given</span><span class="highlight">molecule</span> (if we could follow its fate) would <span class="highlight">depend</span> on the <span class="highlight">route</span> it took: it might flow <span class="highlight">through</span> as part of the fastest, most direct <span class="highlight">current</span>, or it might circle in a backwater for an <span class="highlight">indefinitely</span> long time.</p><p>Residence times <span class="highlight">vary</span> enormously. They <span class="highlight">range</span> from a few days for small lakes up to several hundred years for large ones; Lake Tahoe, in California, has a residence time of 700 years. The residence times for the Great Lakes of North America, namely, Lakes <span class="highlight">Superior</span>, Michigan, Huron, Erie, and Ontario, are, <span class="highlight">respectively</span>, 190,100,22,2.5, and 6 years. Lake Erie's is the lowest: although its area is larger than Lake Ontario' s, its <span class="highlight">volume</span> is less than one-third as great because it is so shallow-less than 20 meters on <span class="highlight">average</span>.</p><p>A <span class="highlight">given</span> lake's residence time is by no means a fixed <span class="highlight">quantity</span>. It depends on the <span class="highlight">rate</span> at which water enters the lake, and that depends on the <span class="highlight">rainfall</span> and the <span class="highlight">evaporation</span><span class="highlight">rate</span>. <span class="highlight">Climatic</span> change (the result of global warming?) is <span class="highlight">dramatically</span> affecting the residence times of some lakes in northwestern Ontario. Canada. In the period 1970 to 1986, <span class="highlight">rainfall</span> in the area decreased from 1,000 millimeters to 650 millimeters per annum, while above-average temperatures speeded up the evapotranspiration <span class="highlight">rate</span> (the <span class="highlight">rate</span> at which water is lost to the <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span><span class="highlight">through</span><span class="highlight">evaporation</span> and the processes of plant life).</p><p>The result has been that the residence time of one of the lakes increased from 5 to 18 years during the study period. The slowing down of water <span class="highlight">renewal</span> leads to a <span class="highlight">chain</span> of <span class="question10">further</span> consequences; it causes dissolved chemicals to become increasingly concentrated, and this, in turn, has a <span class="highlight">marked</span> effect on all living things in the lake.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The phrase "<span class="highlight">So much</span>" in the passage refers to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. the negative effects of overland flow, rain, and evaporation on river water levels</p><p>B. water that a lake loses to outflowing rivers, to the lake bed, and to evaporation</p><p>C. the importance of rivers to the maintenance of lake water levels</p><p>D. the information given about ways that water can enter or exit a lake</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="So much D"><p>D So much refers to the previous article. The former says how water enters how to leave, so the correct answer is D. Note that B seems to be right, but after the substitution is problematic, because water is not obvious, obviously information, so so much refers not only to its preceding sentence, but also refers to the previous sentence of the previous sentence. The correct answer is D.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question2">gains</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. results</p><p>B. increases</p><p>C. resources</p><p>D. savings</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>B gain: Increase, get. A is the result, B is the increase, C is the resource, D is the savings, storage. According to the word meaning, B is the correct answer.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the following can be inferred from paragraph 2 about the movement of water into a lake?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Heavy rain accounts for most of the water that enters into lakes.</p><p>B. Rainfall replaces approximately the amount of water lost through evaporation.</p><p>C. Overland flow into lakes is reduced by the presence of forests.</p><p>D. Seepage has a smaller effect on water level than any other input.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C This keyword is difficult to find, so you can use the exclusion method, of course, can also be found under orderly. Here we use exclusion. A's heavy rain and most of the water have no relevant information at all, wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the author use the phrase "<span class="question4">Note the word "net</span>" " in the passage?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To emphasize the impact of seepage on water levels</p><p>B. To point out that seepage is calculated differently from river flows and atmospheric exchanges</p><p>C. To compare the different methods of calculating seepage</p><p>D. To emphasize the difficulty of obtaining specific values for seepage inputs and outputs</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="Note the word &quot;net D"><p>D first read the sentence where the rhetorical point is located, and obviously there is a colon. The colon directly indicates why the author emphasizes the concept of net. It is said that the measurement of the actual infiltration and exudation of groundwater is more complicated than just measuring the difference between the two. Many, so the correct answer is D, and it's hard to come up with specific values. None of the other answers said.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question5">Conversely</span></span>" in paragraph 3 meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. on the other hand</p><p>B. in the same way</p><p>C. in other words</p><p>D. on average</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" A"><p>A conversely: On the contrary. The A option is the other hand, B is the same, C is the other word, D is the average. So the correct answer is on the other hand.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 3, which of the following best describes a seepage-dominated lake?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. A lake that is fed by streams but still has fluctuating water levels</p><p>B. A lake with a constant water level that has no streams or rivers as inputs</p><p>C. A lake with a stream flowing into it and a stream flowing out of it</p><p>D. A lake that has surface and underground inputs but loses water during dry seasons</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B. It is possible to use the seepage-dominated lake keyword to locate the second sentence or the penultimate sentence. The second sentence says that if the ground is large, it is seepage, and the penultimate sentence says that if no surface water is injected, the pond can still maintain the amount of seepage-dominated water, so no matter which position the answer is, it is B. The other three answers all refer to surface water, which is the opposite of the original and wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>It can be inferred from paragraph 4 that the length of time a given molecule of water remains in a lake</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. depends entirely upon the average speed of a lake' s currents</p><p>B. can be measured by the volume of the lake alone</p><p>C. can be greater or lesser than the residence time</p><p>D. is similar to the length of time all other molecules remain in that lake</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C uses a given molecule of water as a key word to locate the last sentence. It is said that the residence time is the average value. A molecule's time in lake depends on its route. It may be very quickly or very slowly. So the correct answer is C, Or more or less. A and B did not say the original; D said that the opposite, the original said that a specific molecule and the residence time is not the same, wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 5, Lake Erie's residence time is lower than Lake Ontario;s for which of the following reasons?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Lake Erie has a larger area than Lake Ontario.</p><p>B. Lake Ontario is shallower than Lake Erie.</p><p>C. Lake Ontario has a greater volume than Lake Erie.</p><p>D. Lake Erie receives less rainfall than Lake Ontario.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C. Using two proper nouns as the keywords to locate the last sentence, said that the residence time of E is the smallest. Although the E area is larger than O, but the volume is small, so the correct answer is C, be careful not to dig a layer of election B, Because shallow is the cause of less volume, it cannot directly cause the residence time to become smaller. But to tell the truth, the individual chose the answer first. Afterwards, it would be more accurate if he carefully considered it. It is more direct. A is obviously not the point emphasized by the author, D did not say</p><p>*B is the wrong option because the article says E is shallow, and it is wrong with the content of the article.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the author discuss the Great Lakes in paragraph 5?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To demonstrate the extent to which residence times vary from lake to lake</p><p>B. To illustrate how residence times are calculated for specific lakes</p><p>C. To argue that the residence time of a lake increases with area</p><p>D. To emphasize that Lake Tahoe' s residence time is unusually long</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A rhetorical question, first look at the sentence where the example is located, and find that the whole sentence is an example. In the past, looking ahead, it was a tragedy. The first sentence is also an example. So, looking at the opening sentence, the opening sentence says that the residence time has changed a lot, that is to say, There are a lot of lakes behind to say that their residence time is different, which proves that the change is very big, so the correct answer is A. Note that mentioning the Great Lakes is not for comparison with T Lake because T Lake itself is an example, so D Wrong, others are less reliable.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question10">further</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. expected</p><p>B. additional</p><p>C. serious</p><p>D. unfortunate</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>B <span class="question10">further</span>: Further, more. A is expected, B is extra, additional, C is serious, D is unfortunate. So the correct answer is additional.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 6, which of the following explains the increase in residence time of some lakes of northwestern Ontario?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The amount of water flowing into the lakes has increased.</p><p>B. The rate of evaporation has decreased more sharply than the amount of rainfall.</p><p>C. The renewal of the lakes' water has slowed due to changes in climate.</p><p>D. Plants have required less water from the lakes</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C positions the penultimate sentence with the double words of northwestern Ontario and increase, but this sentence just says increase. No specific explanation is given. Look down. The next sentence says that the slowing down of water renewal will bring a series of consequences. That is to say, the reduction in precipitation mentioned earlier or the increase in evaporation will be attributed to renewal slowdown, so the correct answer is C, and none of the other answers.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 6, residence time is affected by all of the following EXCEPT</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. amount of rainfall</p><p>B. rate of evaporation</p><p>C. temperature of surrounding air</p><p>D. concentration of chemicals in lake water</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D EXCEPT questions, exclusion. A's rainfall, B's evaporation and C's temperature keyword can all be positioned to the fourth sentence, which is correct and not selected; whereas D's chemicals are keyword-targeted to the last sentence, but the chemical's concentration is renewal. The impact is not the determinant of residence time, wrong, and election. And according to the above question, the answer to this question can also be drawn directly.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Of course, a lake may be neither surface-water-nor seepage-dominated if, for example, its inputs are predominantly surface and its outputs are predominantly seepage..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>This saying that a lake may not be either surface water dominated nor seepage-dominated, explains the two situations mentioned earlier and finds that it can be inserted in B or D, but since there is no...nor in the sentence to be inserted, it must be After all these concepts have been said, we can say neither this nor that, so we should insert it at the end of the article. The correct answer is D.</p></div></div><div id="question14" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>Water enters, remains, and eventually leaves a lake in a variety of ways.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.By measuring the water quantities at each of a lake's inputs and outputs, it can be determined whether water enters the lake mainly from surface or groundwater sources.</p><p>B.Changes in lake level and volume are caused principally by the amount of evaporation of water into the atmosphere.</p><p>C.It is sometimes possible to decide whether a lake is surface water dominated or seepage dominated by simple observation at different seasons.</p><p>D.The average period of time that molecules of water spend in a lake-the residence time-varies from lake to lake and overtime within a particular lake.</p><p>E.The residence times of surface-water-dominated lakes are usually longer than those of seepage-dominated lakes.</p><p>F.The residence time of a lake frequently depends on the kinds of organisms to be found in the lake.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="ACD"><p>The ACD By measuring option corresponds to the first half of the third paragraph. The correct .It is the same as the second half of the third paragraph. Correct. The residence time of a surface-water-dominated option is not described in the original, and the option of the .Changes option is not described. Do not choose .The average period option corresponds to the first sentence of the fifth paragraph, and the sixth paragraph is also said to change, correct.The residence time of a lake option in the organization is the impact of renewal slowdown, not the decisive factor of the residence time , do not choose.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
