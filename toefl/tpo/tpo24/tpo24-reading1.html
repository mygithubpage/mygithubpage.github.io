            <b>Lake Water</b>
          </h4>
          <p>Where does the water in a lake come from, and how does water leave it? Water enters a lake from inflowing rivers, from underwater seeps and springs, from overland flow off the surrounding land, and from rain falling directly on the lake surface. Water leaves a lake via outflowing rivers, by soaking into the bed of the lake, and by <span class="highlight">evaporation</span>. <span class="highlight question1">So much</span> is <span class="highlight">obvious</span>.</p>
          <p>The questions become more <span class="highlight">complicated</span> when actual volumes of water are considered: how much water enters and leaves by each <span class="highlight">route</span>? Discovering the inputs and outputs of rivers is a matter of measuring the discharges of every inflowing and outflowing <span class="highlight">stream</span> and river. Then exchanges with the <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span> are calculated by finding the <span class="highlight">difference</span> between the <span class="question2">gains</span> from rain, as measured (rather <span class="highlight">roughly</span>) by rain gauges, and the losses by <span class="highlight">evaporation</span>, measured with models that correct for the other sources of water loss. For the <span class="highlight">majority</span> of lakes, certainly those surrounded by forests, input from overland flow is too small to have a <span class="highlight">noticeable</span> effect. Changes in lake <span class="highlight">level</span> not explained by river flows plus exchanges with the <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span> must be <span class="highlight">due</span> to the net <span class="highlight">difference</span> between what seeps into the lake from the <span class="highlight">groundwater</span> and what leaks into the <span class="highlight">groundwater</span>. <span class="question4">Note the word "net</span>": measuring the actual amounts of <span class="highlight">groundwater</span> seepage into the lake and out of the lake is a much more <span class="highlight">complicated</span> matter than merely inferring their <span class="highlight">difference</span>.</p>
          <p>Once all this information has been gathered, it becomes possible to judge whether a lake's flow is mainly <span class="highlight">due</span> to its surface inputs and outputs or to its <span class="highlight">underground</span> inputs and outputs. 
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>If the <span class="highlight">former</span> are greater, the lake is a surface-water-dominated lake; if the <span class="highlight">latter</span>, it is a seepage-dominated lake. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>Occasionally, <span class="highlight">common</span> <span class="highlight">sense</span> tells you which of these 
two possibilities applies. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>For example, a pond in hilly country that maintains a <span class="highlight">steady</span> water <span class="highlight">level</span> all <span class="highlight">through</span> a dry summer in spite of having no streams flowing into it must <span class="highlight">obviously</span> 
be seepage dominated. <span class="question5">Conversely</span>, a pond with a <span class="highlight">stream</span> flowing in one end and out the other, which dries up when the <span class="highlight">stream</span> dries up, is clearly surface water dominated. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p>
          <p>By whatever means, a lake is <span class="highlight">constantly</span> gaining water and losing water: its water does not just sit there, or, anyway, not for long. This raises the matter of a lake's residence time. The residence time is the <span class="highlight">average</span> length of time that any <span class="highlight">particular</span> <span class="highlight">molecule</span> of water remains in the lake, and it is calculated by dividing the <span class="highlight">volume</span> of water in the lake by the <span class="highlight">rate</span> at which water leaves the lake. The residence time is an <span class="highlight">average</span>; the time spent in the lake by a <span class="highlight">given</span> <span class="highlight">molecule</span> (if we could follow its fate) would <span class="highlight">depend</span> on the <span class="highlight">route</span> it took: it might flow <span class="highlight">through</span> as part of the fastest, most direct <span class="highlight">current</span>, or it might circle in a backwater for an <span class="highlight">indefinitely</span> long time.</p>
          <p>Residence times <span class="highlight">vary</span> enormously. They <span class="highlight">range</span> from a few days for small lakes up to several hundred years for large ones; Lake Tahoe, in California, has a residence time of 700 years. The residence times for the Great Lakes of North America, namely, Lakes <span class="highlight">Superior</span>, Michigan, Huron, Erie, and Ontario, are, <span class="highlight">respectively</span>, 190,100,22,2.5, and 6 years. Lake Erie's is the lowest: although its area is larger than Lake Ontario' s, its <span class="highlight">volume</span> is less than one-third as great because it is so shallow-less than 20 meters on <span class="highlight">average</span>.</p>
          <p>A <span class="highlight">given</span> lake's residence time is by no means a fixed <span class="highlight">quantity</span>. It depends on the <span class="highlight">rate</span> at which water enters the lake, and that depends on the <span class="highlight">rainfall</span> and the <span class="highlight">evaporation</span> <span class="highlight">rate</span>. <span class="highlight">Climatic</span> change (the result of global warming?) is <span class="highlight">dramatically</span> affecting the residence times of some lakes in northwestern Ontario. Canada. In the period 1970 to 1986, <span class="highlight">rainfall</span> in the area decreased from 1,000 millimeters to 650 millimeters per annum, while above-average temperatures speeded up the evapotranspiration <span class="highlight">rate</span> (the <span class="highlight">rate</span> at which water is lost to the <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span> <span class="highlight">through</span> <span class="highlight">evaporation</span> and the processes of plant life).</p>
          <p>The result has been that the residence time of one of the lakes increased from 5 to 18 years during the study period. The slowing down of water <span class="highlight">renewal</span> leads to a <span class="highlight">chain</span> of <span class="question10">further</span> consequences; it causes dissolved chemicals to become increasingly concentrated, and this, in turn, has a <span class="highlight">marked</span> effect on all living things in the lake.</p>
