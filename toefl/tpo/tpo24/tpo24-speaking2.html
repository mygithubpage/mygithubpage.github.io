Use specific examples and details to support your opinion.</p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>I don't agree with this statement. I believe students benefit more from small classes than from large classes.. First of all, there are many students in a large class and it's usually in a big lecture hall. Teachers or lecturers will always focus on their own topic. There aren't as many interactions in it as in a small class. In small classes, students are allowed to make discussions. Also, students can get more attention from teachers and thus have more opportunities to voice themselves. Secondly, in a large class, if there is a point a student doesn't understand, he or she might be left behind, while in a small class, teachers give attention to every student, so no one will be left behind.</p></article></div></main></body></html>
