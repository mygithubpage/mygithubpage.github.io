          <h4 class="w3-center">Breathing During Sleep</h4>
          <p>Of all the <span class="highlight">physiological</span> differences in human sleep compared with wakefulness that have been discovered in the last <span class="highlight">decade</span>, changes in <span class="highlight"><span class="highlight">respiratory</span></span> control are most <span class="highlight">dramatic</span>. Not only are there differences in the <span class="highlight">level</span> of the functioning of <span class="highlight"><span class="highlight">respiratory</span></span> systems, there are <span class="highlight">even</span> changes in how they <span class="highlight">function</span>. Movements of the rib cage for <span class="highlight">breathing</span> are reduced during sleep,
making the contractions of the diaphragm more important. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>Yet because of the physics of lying down, the stomach applies weight against the diaphragm and makes it more difficult for the 
diaphragm to do its job. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>However, there are many other changes that <span class="highlight">affect</span> <span class="highlight">respiration</span> when asleep.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C">
            </span>During wakefulness, <span class="highlight">breathing</span> is controlled by two interacting systems. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>The first is an <span class="highlight">automatic</span>, <span class="highlight">metabolic</span> system whose control is centered in the brain <span class="highlight">stem</span>. 
It subconsciously adjusts <span class="highlight">breathing</span> <span class="highlight">rate</span> and depth in order to <span class="highlight">regulate</span> the levels of <span class="highlight">carbon</span> <span class="highlight">dioxide</span> (CO2) and <span class="highlight">oxygen</span> (O2), and the acid-base <span class="highlight">ratio</span> in the blood. The <span class="highlight">second</span> system is the voluntary,
<span class="highlight">behavioral</span> system. Its control center is based in the forebrain, and it regulates <span class="highlight">breathing</span> for use in speech, singing, sighing, and so on. It is <span class="highlight">capable</span> of ignoring or <span class="highlight">overriding</span> the <span class="highlight">automatic</span>,
<span class="highlight">metabolic</span> system and produces an <span class="highlight">irregular</span> <span class="highlight">pattern</span> of <span class="highlight">breathing</span>.</p>
          <p>During NREM (the <span class="highlight">phase</span> of sleep in which there is no rapid eye movement) <span class="highlight">breathing</span> becomes deeper and more <span class="highlight">regular</span>, but there is also a <span class="highlight">decrease</span> in the <span class="highlight">breathing</span> <span class="highlight">rate</span>, resulting in less <span class="highlight">air</span> being exchanged <span class="highlight">overall</span>. This occurs because during NREM sleep the <span class="highlight">automatic</span>, <span class="highlight">metabolic</span> system has <span class="highlight"><span class="question3">exclusive</span></span> control over <span class="highlight">breathing</span> and the body uses less <span class="highlight">oxygen</span> and produces less <span class="highlight">carbon</span> <span class="highlight">dioxide</span>. Also, during sleep the <span class="highlight">automatic</span> <span class="highlight">metabolic</span> system is less responsive to <span class="highlight">carbon</span> <span class="highlight">dioxide</span> levels and <span class="highlight">oxygen</span> levels in the blood. Two things result from these changes in <span class="highlight">breathing</span> control that <span class="highlight">occur</span> during sleep. First, there may be a <span class="highlight">brief</span> cessation or <span class="highlight">reduction</span> of <span class="highlight">breathing</span> when falling asleep as the sleeper waxes and wanes between sleep and wakefulness and their differing control mechanisms. <span class="highlight">Second</span>, once sleep is fully obtained, there is an increase of <span class="highlight">carbon</span> <span class="highlight">dioxide</span> and a <span class="highlight">decrease</span> of <span class="highlight">oxygen</span> in the blood that persists during NREM.</p>
          <p>But that is not all that changes. During all phases of sleep, several changes in the <span class="highlight">air</span> passages have been observed. It takes twice as much effort to breathe during sleep because of greater <span class="highlight">resistance</span> to <span class="highlight">airflow</span> in the airways and changes in the <span class="highlight">efficiency</span> of the muscles used for <span class="highlight">breathing</span>. Some of the muscles that help keep the upper airway open when <span class="highlight">breathing</span> <span class="highlight">tend</span> to become more relaxed during sleep, especially during REM (the <span class="highlight">phase</span> of sleep in which there is rapid eye movement). Without this <span class="highlight">muscular</span> <span class="highlight">action</span>, <span class="question5">inhaling is like sucking <span class="highlight">air</span> out of a balloon</span>-the narrow passages <span class="highlight">tend</span> to <span class="highlight">collapse</span>. Also there is a <span class="highlight">regular</span> <span class="highlight">cycle</span> of change in <span class="highlight">resistance</span> between the two sides of the nose. If something blocks the "good" side, such as <span class="highlight">congestion</span> from allergies or a cold, then <span class="highlight">resistance</span> increases <span class="highlight">dramatically</span>. Coupled with these factors is the loss of the <span class="highlight">complex</span> interactions among the muscles that can change the <span class="highlight">route</span> of <span class="highlight">airflow</span> from nose to mouth.</p>
          <p>Other <span class="highlight"><span class="highlight">respiratory</span></span> regulating mechanisms apparently <span class="highlight">cease</span> functioning during sleep. For example, during wakefulness there is an <span class="highlight">immediate</span>, <span class="highlight">automatic</span>, <span class="highlight">adaptive</span> increase in <span class="highlight">breathing</span> effort when inhaling is made more difficult (such as <span class="highlight">breathing</span> <span class="highlight">through</span> a restrictive face <span class="highlight">mask</span>). This reflexive <span class="highlight">adjustment</span> is totally absent during NREM sleep. Only after several inadequate breaths under such conditions, resulting in the <span class="highlight"><span class="question9">considerable</span></span> <span class="highlight">elevation</span> of <span class="highlight">carbon</span> <span class="highlight">dioxide</span> and <span class="highlight">reduction</span> of <span class="highlight">oxygen</span> in the blood, is <span class="highlight">breathing</span> effort adjusted. Finally, the coughing reflex in <span class="highlight">reaction</span> to irritants in the airway produces not a cough during sleep but a cessation of <span class="highlight">breathing</span>. If the <span class="highlight">irritation</span> is <span class="highlight">severe</span> enough, a sleeping person will <span class="highlight">arouse</span>, <span class="highlight">clear</span> the airway, then <span class="highlight"><span class="question10">resume</span></span> <span class="highlight">breathing</span> and likely return to sleep.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="highlight">Additional</span>
            <span class="highlight">breathing</span> changes <span class="highlight">occur</span> during REM sleep that are <span class="highlight">even</span> more <span class="highlight">dramatic</span> than the changes that <span class="highlight">occur</span> during NREM. <span class="question11">The <span class="highlight">amount</span> of <span class="highlight">air</span> exchanged is <span class="highlight">even</span> <span class="highlight">lower</span> in REM than NREM because, although <span class="highlight">breathing</span> is more rapid in REM, it is also more <span class="highlight">irregular</span>, with <span class="highlight">brief</span> episodes of <span class="highlight">shallow</span> <span class="highlight">breathing</span> or <span class="highlight">absence</span> of <span class="highlight">breathing</span>.</span> In <span class="highlight">addition</span>, <span class="highlight">breathing</span> during REM depends much more on the <span class="highlight">action</span> of the diaphragm and much less on rib cage <span class="highlight">action</span>.</p>

              <p>Why does the author say that breathing is like inhaling from a balloon? Look at the sentence where the rhetorical point is, and say that if there is no such muscle activity, breathing is like inhaling from a balloon; the author uses analogous rhetoric (like), so we need to know what the author thinks of this sentence and continue Look forward; the first sentence says: When you are sleeping, your muscles will become relaxed. It seems that you can't see any connection. Look ahead and say that it takes more effort to breathe during sleep. One of the reasons is muscle efficiency. Change, so the author wants to emphasize that breathing during breathing is difficult, so the correct answer is C.

              <p>D. Positioning to the last sentence with irritation as the key word, saying that if the irritation is too severe, the sleeping person will wake up. According to the normal narrative order, it should first describe the mild situation. The former sentence really said that the coughing reflex did not produce cough. The ceSSATion of breathing, the state of respiratory arrest, is the answer, so the answer is D. C is the opposite of the original; B was only when Severe, A did not say.</p>
