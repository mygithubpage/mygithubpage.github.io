Not only are there differences in the <span class="highlight">level</span> of the functioning of <span class="highlight"><span class="highlight">respiratory</span></span> systems, there are <span class="highlight">even</span> changes in how they <span class="highlight">function</span>. Movements of the rib cage for <span class="highlight">breathing</span> are reduced during sleep,
making the contractions of the diaphragm more important. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>Yet because of the physics of lying down, the stomach applies weight against the diaphragm and makes it more difficult for the 
diaphragm to do its job. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>However, there are many other changes that <span class="highlight">affect</span><span class="highlight">respiration</span> when asleep.</p><p><span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>During wakefulness, <span class="highlight">breathing</span> is controlled by two interacting systems. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>The first is an <span class="highlight">automatic</span>, <span class="highlight">metabolic</span> system whose control is centered in the brain <span class="highlight">stem</span>. 
It subconsciously adjusts <span class="highlight">breathing</span><span class="highlight">rate</span> and depth in order to <span class="highlight">regulate</span> the levels of <span class="highlight">carbon</span><span class="highlight">dioxide</span> (CO2) and <span class="highlight">oxygen</span> (O2), and the acid-base <span class="highlight">ratio</span> in the blood. The <span class="highlight">second</span> system is the voluntary,
<span class="highlight">behavioral</span> system. Its control center is based in the forebrain, and it regulates <span class="highlight">breathing</span> for use in speech, singing, sighing, and so on. It is <span class="highlight">capable</span> of ignoring or <span class="highlight">overriding</span> the <span class="highlight">automatic</span>,
<span class="highlight">metabolic</span> system and produces an <span class="highlight">irregular</span><span class="highlight">pattern</span> of <span class="highlight">breathing</span>.</p><p>During NREM (the <span class="highlight">phase</span> of sleep in which there is no rapid eye movement) <span class="highlight">breathing</span> becomes deeper and more <span class="highlight">regular</span>, but there is also a <span class="highlight">decrease</span> in the <span class="highlight">breathing</span><span class="highlight">rate</span>, resulting in less <span class="highlight">air</span> being exchanged <span class="highlight">overall</span>. This occurs because during NREM sleep the <span class="highlight">automatic</span>, <span class="highlight">metabolic</span> system has <span class="highlight"><span class="question3">exclusive</span></span> control over <span class="highlight">breathing</span> and the body uses less <span class="highlight">oxygen</span> and produces less <span class="highlight">carbon</span><span class="highlight">dioxide</span>. Also, during sleep the <span class="highlight">automatic</span><span class="highlight">metabolic</span> system is less responsive to <span class="highlight">carbon</span><span class="highlight">dioxide</span> levels and <span class="highlight">oxygen</span> levels in the blood. Two things result from these changes in <span class="highlight">breathing</span> control that <span class="highlight">occur</span> during sleep. First, there may be a <span class="highlight">brief</span> cessation or <span class="highlight">reduction</span> of <span class="highlight">breathing</span> when falling asleep as the sleeper waxes and wanes between sleep and wakefulness and their differing control mechanisms. <span class="highlight">Second</span>, once sleep is fully obtained, there is an increase of <span class="highlight">carbon</span><span class="highlight">dioxide</span> and a <span class="highlight">decrease</span> of <span class="highlight">oxygen</span> in the blood that persists during NREM.</p><p>But that is not all that changes. During all phases of sleep, several changes in the <span class="highlight">air</span> passages have been observed. It takes twice as much effort to breathe during sleep because of greater <span class="highlight">resistance</span> to <span class="highlight">airflow</span> in the airways and changes in the <span class="highlight">efficiency</span> of the muscles used for <span class="highlight">breathing</span>. Some of the muscles that help keep the upper airway open when <span class="highlight">breathing</span><span class="highlight">tend</span> to become more relaxed during sleep, especially during REM (the <span class="highlight">phase</span> of sleep in which there is rapid eye movement). Without this <span class="highlight">muscular</span><span class="highlight">action</span>, <span class="question5">inhaling is like sucking <span class="highlight">air</span> out of a balloon</span>-the narrow passages <span class="highlight">tend</span> to <span class="highlight">collapse</span>. Also there is a <span class="highlight">regular</span><span class="highlight">cycle</span> of change in <span class="highlight">resistance</span> between the two sides of the nose. If something blocks the "good" side, such as <span class="highlight">congestion</span> from allergies or a cold, then <span class="highlight">resistance</span> increases <span class="highlight">dramatically</span>. Coupled with these factors is the loss of the <span class="highlight">complex</span> interactions among the muscles that can change the <span class="highlight">route</span> of <span class="highlight">airflow</span> from nose to mouth.</p><p>Other <span class="highlight"><span class="highlight">respiratory</span></span> regulating mechanisms apparently <span class="highlight">cease</span> functioning during sleep. For example, during wakefulness there is an <span class="highlight">immediate</span>, <span class="highlight">automatic</span>, <span class="highlight">adaptive</span> increase in <span class="highlight">breathing</span> effort when inhaling is made more difficult (such as <span class="highlight">breathing</span><span class="highlight">through</span> a restrictive face <span class="highlight">mask</span>). This reflexive <span class="highlight">adjustment</span> is totally absent during NREM sleep. Only after several inadequate breaths under such conditions, resulting in the <span class="highlight"><span class="question9">considerable</span></span><span class="highlight">elevation</span> of <span class="highlight">carbon</span><span class="highlight">dioxide</span> and <span class="highlight">reduction</span> of <span class="highlight">oxygen</span> in the blood, is <span class="highlight">breathing</span> effort adjusted. Finally, the coughing reflex in <span class="highlight">reaction</span> to irritants in the airway produces not a cough during sleep but a cessation of <span class="highlight">breathing</span>. If the <span class="highlight">irritation</span> is <span class="highlight">severe</span> enough, a sleeping person will <span class="highlight">arouse</span>, <span class="highlight">clear</span> the airway, then <span class="highlight"><span class="question10">resume</span></span><span class="highlight">breathing</span> and likely return to sleep.</p><p><span class="highlight">Additional</span><span class="highlight">breathing</span> changes <span class="highlight">occur</span> during REM sleep that are <span class="highlight">even</span> more <span class="highlight">dramatic</span> than the changes that <span class="highlight">occur</span> during NREM. <span class="question11">The <span class="highlight">amount</span> of <span class="highlight">air</span> exchanged is <span class="highlight">even</span><span class="highlight">lower</span> in REM than NREM because, although <span class="highlight">breathing</span> is more rapid in REM, it is also more <span class="highlight">irregular</span>, with <span class="highlight">brief</span> episodes of <span class="highlight">shallow</span><span class="highlight">breathing</span> or <span class="highlight">absence</span> of <span class="highlight">breathing</span>.</span> In <span class="highlight">addition</span>, <span class="highlight">breathing</span> during REM depends much more on the <span class="highlight">action</span> of the diaphragm and much less on rib cage <span class="highlight">action</span>.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 1, which of the following can be inferred about the diaphragm during sleep?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. During sleep the diaphragm requires increased movement of the rib cage.</p><p>B. The diaphragm helps with breathing as movements of the rib cage decrease during sleep.</p><p>C. The diaphragm requires a great amount of pressure to function properly.</p><p>D. The diaphragm contributes to the effective functioning of the rib cage.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B. Positioning Diaphragm as a key word to the third and fourth sentences, said that ribcage movements become less, making diaphragms more important, but the pressure of stomache makes it more difficult for Diaphragm to work, and B is the correct answer. A's increased movement of the rib cage and C's need pressure is opposite to the original; D said thatdiaphragm contributes to the original did not say</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 2, all of the following are true of the voluntary breathing system EXCEPT:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It has its control center in the brain stem.</p><p>B. It controls breathing for a number of activities during wakefulness.</p><p>C. It is able to bypass the automatic system.</p><p>D. It produces an irregular breathing pattern.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A EXCEPT questions, exclusion method. A's centered in brainstem keyword positioning to the first sentence, but the original said this feature is an automatic, metabolic system, and voluntary's center is in forebrain, so A wrong, election; B's a number of activities do keyword Positioning to the bottom of the second sentence of a lot of activities, so B is correct, not selected; C's bypass the automatic system and D's iris respiratory breathing pattern keywords are located to the last sentence, are correct, not selected</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question3">exclusive</span></span>" in the passage (paragraph 3) is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. consistent</p><p>B. perfect</p><p>C. partial</p><p>D. sole</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" D"><p>D <span class="question3">exclusive</span>: <span class="question3">exclusive</span>, <span class="question3">exclusive</span>. A is consistent and consistent, B is perfect, C is partial, D is unique and unique. So the correct answer is sole.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 3, which of the following may occur just before NREM sleep begins?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The automatic, metabolic system may increase its dependence on air exchanges.</p><p>B. Breathing can stop for a short time as a person falls asleep.</p><p>C. An increase in the oxygen level in the blood can occur as sleep becomes fully obtained.</p><p>D. The level of carbon dioxide in the blood may drop suddenly.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B This keyword is difficult to find, you can look down or you can use the elimination method. If you look down, you will see that the first point is when the sleeper swings between sleep and wake up. Breathing cessation, which is stop, so the correct answer is B, stop for a short time. One of the C and D said that the increase in oxygen was to say that the drop in carbon dioxide was one thing. It wasn't happening during sleep. So it was the opposite, and neither of them was selected. A didn't say.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the author's purpose in stating that |inhaling is like sucking air out of a balloon|</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To refute the argument that additional effort is necessary for breathing during sleep</p><p>B. To argue that REM sleep is more important than NREM sleep</p><p>C. To illustrate the difficulty of breathing during sleep</p><p>D. To illustrate how blockage of narrow passages can be prevented during sleep</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Why does the author say that breathing is like inhaling from a balloon? Look at the sentence where the rhetorical point is, and say that if there is no such muscle activity, breathing is like inhaling from a balloon; the author uses analogous rhetoric (like), so we need to know what the author thinks of this sentence and continue Look forward; the first sentence says: When you are sleeping, your muscles will become relaxed. It seems that you can't see any connection. Look ahead and say that it takes more effort to breathe during sleep. One of the reasons is muscle efficiency. Change, so the author wants to emphasize that breathing during breathing is difficult, so the correct answer is C. A's refute is the opposite of the original; B's comparison and D's prevent blockage are all out of nothing.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>All of the following are mentioned in paragraph 4 as being characteristic of breathing during sleep EXCEPT</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. relaxation of the muscles involved in the respiratory system</p><p>B. changes in resistance between the two sides of the nose</p><p>C. easier airflow in the passages of the upper airway</p><p>D. absence of certain complex muscle interactions</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C EXCEPT questions, exclusion. A's relaxation of the muscles is targeted to the third sentence, correct, not selected; B's two sides of the nose do keyword positioning to the penultimate sentence, correct, not selected; C's upper airway keyword positioning To the third sentence, but the default air pressure of the answer did not say, C wrong, election; D's complex muscle interaction keywords are positioned to the last sentence, correct, not selected</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 5, what happens during NREM sleep when inhaling is difficult?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. There is an immediate, automatic, adaptive increase in breathing effort.</p><p>B. The sleeping person takes several inadequate breaths before the breathing effort is adjusted.</p><p>C. The coughing reflex causes the breathing effort to adjust.</p><p>D. The airways become cleared as the blood removes irritants.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B. Inhaling is difficult to use the keyword to locate the second sentence, but this sentence only said something difficult, did not say what happened, look down. The following sentence says that there is no adjustment during NREM. It is adjusted only after inadequate breaths, so the answer is B. A was awakeful; C's causality didn't say it; D didn't say it at all.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>It can be inferred from paragraph 5 that a very mild irritation during sleep will likely cause the sleeping person to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. increase the breathing effort</p><p>B. wake up and remove the source of irritation</p><p>C. cough while still sleeping</p><p>D. stop breathing temporarily while still sleeping</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D. Positioning to the last sentence with irritation as the key word, saying that if the irritation is too severe, the sleeping person will wake up. According to the normal narrative order, it should first describe the mild situation. The former sentence really said that the coughing reflex did not produce cough. The ceSSATion of breathing, the state of respiratory arrest, is the answer, so the answer is D. C is the opposite of the original; B was only when Severe, A did not say.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question9">considerable</span></span>" (paragraph 3) meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. significant</p><p>B. Steady</p><p>C. Usual</p><p>D. necessary</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" A"><p>A: Considerable, quite, A is significant, B is stable, C is normal, and D is necessary. So the correct answer is significant.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question10">resume</span></span>" in the passage (paragraph 3) is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. reduce</p><p>B. stop</p><p>C. Readjust</p><p>D. restart</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" D"><p>A <span class="question10">resume</span>: Resume and continue. A is a decrease, B is a stop, C is a readjustment, and D is a restart. So the correct answer is restart.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage (paragraph 6)? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Because breathing is more shallow and irregular in REM than in NREM, less air is exchanged in REM.</p><p>B. Breathing in NREM is less effective than breathing in REM because of irregular episodes of rapid breathing during NREM.</p><p>C. Because breathing is more rapid in NREM sleep than in REM sleep, breathing often becomes shallow.</p><p>D. Although REM has brief episodes of shallow breathing or lack of breathing, breathing is more rapid than in NREM.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The main logic of A original sentence is the causal logic, the result is exchanged lower, the reason is more irregular. The reason logic also uses transition logic, and a supplemental reason with the structure. The A option covers this causality and several key elements, so the correct answer is A. None of the other answers mentioned the trunk of exchange lower, and B changed the original non-backbone part to the trunk; C results were confused; D logic was wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>To better understand breathing during sleep, it is, however, helpful to first understand how respiration works in general..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C Two transition points, noun respiration and conjunctions how. According to respiration, it can be initially determined that the answer is B or C, but B is not right according to how, because the two terms cannot appear consecutively, and the first sentence of the insertion sentence also indicates that the content of the how respiration work must be discussed below. Therefore, the correct answer is C. .</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="table"><div class="question"><p>From the seven statements below, select the statements that correctly characterize breathing during wakefulness and those statements that correctly characterize breathing during sleep.
