            <b>Breathing During Sleep</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>Of all the <span class="underline">physiological</span> differences in human sleep compared with wakefulness that have been discovered in the last <span class="underline">decade</span>, changes in <span class="underline"><span class="underline">respiratory</span></span> control are most <span class="underline">dramatic</span>. Not only are there differences in the <span class="underline">level</span> of the functioning of <span class="underline"><span class="underline">respiratory</span></span> systems, there are <span class="underline">even</span> changes in how they <span class="underline">function</span>. Movements of the rib cage for <span class="underline">breathing</span> are reduced during sleep,
making the contractions of the diaphragm more important. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>Yet because of the physics of lying down, the stomach applies weight against the diaphragm and makes it more difficult for the 
diaphragm to do its job. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>However, there are many other changes that <span class="underline">affect</span> <span class="underline">respiration</span> when asleep.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C">
            </span>During wakefulness, <span class="underline">breathing</span> is controlled by two interacting systems. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>The first is an <span class="underline">automatic</span>, <span class="underline">metabolic</span> system whose control is centered in the brain <span class="underline">stem</span>. 
It subconsciously adjusts <span class="underline">breathing</span> <span class="underline">rate</span> and depth in order to <span class="underline">regulate</span> the levels of <span class="underline">carbon</span> <span class="underline">dioxide</span> (CO2) and <span class="underline">oxygen</span> (O2), and the acid-base <span class="underline">ratio</span> in the blood. The <span class="underline">second</span> system is the voluntary,
<span class="underline">behavioral</span> system. Its control center is based in the forebrain, and it regulates <span class="underline">breathing</span> for use in speech, singing, sighing, and so on. It is <span class="underline">capable</span> of ignoring or <span class="underline">overriding</span> the <span class="underline">automatic</span>,
<span class="underline">metabolic</span> system and produces an <span class="underline">irregular</span> <span class="underline">pattern</span> of <span class="underline">breathing</span>.</p>
          <p>During NREM (the <span class="underline">phase</span> of sleep in which there is no rapid eye movement) <span class="underline">breathing</span> becomes deeper and more <span class="underline">regular</span>, but there is also a <span class="underline">decrease</span> in the <span class="underline">breathing</span> <span class="underline">rate</span>, resulting in less <span class="underline">air</span> being exchanged <span class="underline">overall</span>. This occurs because during NREM sleep the <span class="underline">automatic</span>, <span class="underline">metabolic</span> system has <span class="underline">exclusive</span> control over <span class="underline">breathing</span> and the body uses less <span class="underline">oxygen</span> and produces less <span class="underline">carbon</span> <span class="underline">dioxide</span>. Also, during sleep the <span class="underline">automatic</span> <span class="underline">metabolic</span> system is less responsive to <span class="underline">carbon</span> <span class="underline">dioxide</span> levels and <span class="underline">oxygen</span> levels in the blood. Two things result from these changes in <span class="underline">breathing</span> control that <span class="underline">occur</span> during sleep. First, there may be a <span class="underline">brief</span> cessation or <span class="underline">reduction</span> of <span class="underline">breathing</span> when falling asleep as the sleeper waxes and wanes between sleep and wakefulness and their differing control mechanisms. <span class="underline">Second</span>, once sleep is fully obtained, there is an increase of <span class="underline">carbon</span> <span class="underline">dioxide</span> and a <span class="underline">decrease</span> of <span class="underline">oxygen</span> in the blood that persists during NREM.</p>
          <p>But that is not all that changes. During all phases of sleep, several changes in the <span class="underline">air</span> passages have been observed. It takes twice as much effort to breathe during sleep because of greater <span class="underline">resistance</span> to <span class="underline">airflow</span> in the airways and changes in the <span class="underline">efficiency</span> of the muscles used for <span class="underline">breathing</span>. Some of the muscles that help keep the upper airway open when <span class="underline">breathing</span> <span class="underline">tend</span> to become more relaxed during sleep, especially during REM (the <span class="underline">phase</span> of sleep in which there is rapid eye movement). Without this <span class="underline">muscular</span> <span class="underline">action</span>, inhaling is like sucking <span class="underline">air</span> out of a balloon-the narrow passages <span class="underline">tend</span> to <span class="underline">collapse</span>. Also there is a <span class="underline">regular</span> <span class="underline">cycle</span> of change in <span class="underline">resistance</span> between the two sides of the nose. If something blocks the "good" side, such as <span class="underline">congestion</span> from allergies or a cold, then <span class="underline">resistance</span> increases <span class="underline">dramatically</span>. Coupled with these factors is the loss of the <span class="underline">complex</span> interactions among the muscles that can change the <span class="underline">route</span> of <span class="underline">airflow</span> from nose to mouth.</p>
          <p>Other <span class="underline"><span class="underline">respiratory</span></span> regulating mechanisms apparently <span class="underline">cease</span> functioning during sleep. For example, during wakefulness there is an <span class="underline">immediate</span>, <span class="underline">automatic</span>, <span class="underline">adaptive</span> increase in <span class="underline">breathing</span> effort when inhaling is made more difficult (such as <span class="underline">breathing</span> <span class="underline">through</span> a restrictive face <span class="underline">mask</span>). This reflexive <span class="underline">adjustment</span> is totally absent during NREM sleep. Only after several inadequate breaths under such conditions, resulting in the <span class="underline">considerable</span> <span class="underline">elevation</span> of <span class="underline">carbon</span> <span class="underline">dioxide</span> and <span class="underline">reduction</span> of <span class="underline">oxygen</span> in the blood, is <span class="underline">breathing</span> effort adjusted. Finally, the coughing reflex in <span class="underline">reaction</span> to irritants in the airway produces not a cough during sleep but a cessation of <span class="underline">breathing</span>. If the <span class="underline">irritation</span> is <span class="underline">severe</span> enough, a sleeping person will <span class="underline">arouse</span>, <span class="underline">clear</span> the airway, then <span class="underline">resume</span> <span class="underline">breathing</span> and likely return to sleep.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="underline">Additional</span>
            <span class="underline">breathing</span> changes <span class="underline">occur</span> during REM sleep that are <span class="underline">even</span> more <span class="underline">dramatic</span> than the changes that <span class="underline">occur</span> during NREM. The <span class="underline">amount</span> of <span class="underline">air</span> exchanged is <span class="underline">even</span> <span class="underline">lower</span> in REM than NREM because, although <span class="underline">breathing</span> is more rapid in REM, it is also more <span class="underline">irregular</span>, with <span class="underline">brief</span> episodes of <span class="underline">shallow</span> <span class="underline">breathing</span> or <span class="underline">absence</span> of <span class="underline">breathing</span>. In <span class="underline">addition</span>, <span class="underline">breathing</span> during REM depends much more on the <span class="underline">action</span> of the diaphragm and much less on rib cage <span class="underline">action</span>.</p>
