          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.08" data-time="5.86">[00:05.86]</span>Professor: Oh, hi, Melanie, how are you doing?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.05" data-time="7.94">[00:07.94]</span>Student: I'm good. Thanks. <span class="time" data-times="2.97" data-time="8.99">[00:08.99]</span>I just have some questions about this paper for your class. <span class="time" data-times="1.77" data-time="11.96">[00:11.96]</span>Do you have a <span class="highlight">second</span> to talk about it now?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.6" data-time="13.73">[00:13.73]</span>Professor: Oh, yes. No problem. <span class="time" data-times="3.11" data-time="15.33">[00:15.33]</span>I have about twenty minutes before my next class. <span class="time" data-times="1.55" data-time="18.44">[00:18.44]</span>Will that be enough time?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.26" data-time="19.99">[00:19.99]</span>Student: Yeah. I think so. <span class="time" data-times="6.62" data-time="21.25">[00:21.25]</span>Okay. So the thing is, you know, okay, I'm writing my paper on the <span class="highlight">history</span> of jazz in New York City.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="0.86" data-time="27.87">[00:27.87]</span>Professor: All right. <span class="time" data-times="2.12" data-time="28.73">[00:28.73]</span>Well, that's a <span class="highlight">pretty</span> <span class="highlight">broad</span> <span class="highlight">subject</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="7.29" data-time="30.85">[00:30.85]</span>Student: Well, actually I'm focusing on a <span class="highlight">specific</span> <span class="highlight">decade</span>, the 50s and on...and I'm only doing it on a few <span class="highlight">specific</span> artists.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.28" data-time="38.14">[00:38.14]</span>Professor: Oh, okay, because I was going to say that seemed a bit, uh, too <span class="highlight">ambitious</span> for a ten-page paper.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.18" data-time="44.42">[00:44.42]</span>Student: Yeah, no, it's not the <span class="highlight">subject</span> I'm having trouble with.<span class="time" data-times="2.58" data-time="47.6">[00:47.60]</span>Actually the paper is <span class="highlight">practically</span> writing itself.<span class="time" data-times="2.76" data-time="50.18">[00:50.18]</span>I mean, I have got a lot to say and it's going <span class="highlight">pretty</span> well.<span class="time" data-times="7.21" data-time="52.94">[00:52.94]</span>The thing is, I have this idea that might make it better and I was wondering if there's any way I could get an <span class="highlight">extension</span>.<span class="time" data-times="2.69" data-time="60.15">[01:00.15]</span>I mean, I know it's <span class="highlight">due</span> next week. Right?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.72" data-time="62.84">[01:02.84]</span>Professor: That's right, on Monday. <span class="time" data-times="1.64" data-time="64.56">[01:04.56]</span>But I don't understand.<span class="time" data-times="2.06" data-time="66.2">[01:06.20]</span>It sounds like you are doing so well. <span class="time" data-times="1.39" data-time="68.26">[01:08.26]</span>Why do you need more time?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.1" data-time="69.65">[01:09.65]</span>Student: Yeah. Well, I could write the paper as it is and turn it in on time and it would be fine.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="0.58" data-time="75.75">[01:15.75]</span>Professor: But?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.52" data-time="76.33">[01:16.33]</span>Student: But I was just talking to one of my friends whose family has lived in New York forever!<span class="time" data-times="5.55" data-time="81.85">[01:21.85]</span>And it turns out that her grandfather was actually there, in the period of jazz I'm writing about.<span class="time" data-times="5.76" data-time="87.4">[01:27.40]</span>I mean, he was a jazz <span class="highlight">musician</span> and he actually, like personally, knew the artists I'm writing about.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="0.81" data-time="93.16">[01:33.16]</span>Professor: You are kidding!<span class="time" data-times="1.83" data-time="93.97">[01:33.97]</span>That's a coincidence.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.74" data-time="95.8">[01:35.80]</span>Student: Yeah, I know, it's cool, right?<span class="time" data-times="7.51" data-time="97.54">[01:37.54]</span>So anyway, that's why I was wondering if I could get an <span class="highlight">extension</span> because I thought it would be really great if I could like interview him for my paper.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="0.95" data-time="105.05">[01:45.05]</span>Professor: Ah...</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.52" data-time="106">[01:46.00]</span>Student: But I don't think I can meet with him until early next week. <span class="time" data-times="1.08" data-time="109.52">[01:49.52]</span>So...</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.18" data-time="110.6">[01:50.60]</span>Professor: Ah, I see.<span class="time" data-times="4.18" data-time="111.78">[01:51.78]</span>Well. It would certainly add a new <span class="highlight">dimension</span> to your paper, wouldn't it?<span class="time" data-times="2.47" data-time="115.96">[01:55.96]</span>Have you talked to this gentleman yet?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="7.63" data-time="118.43">[01:58.43]</span>Student: Uh, no, but I talked to my friend, just, you know, ran the idea past her and she said he would probably love to do it.<span class="time" data-times="2.15" data-time="126.06">[02:06.06]</span>But you know, he is busy until next week.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="8.24" data-time="128.21">[02:08.21]</span>Professor: Okay. Well, yeah, I think that in this case we can <span class="highlight">definitely</span> <span class="highlight">extend</span> your <span class="highlight">deadline</span> until, that's say, Friday next week?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.67" data-time="136.45">[02:16.45]</span>Student: Okay. That would be great!</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.88" data-time="138.12">[02:18.12]</span>Professor: But just to be <span class="highlight">fair</span>, why don't you turn in an <span class="highlight">outline</span> of your paper on the <span class="highlight">due</span> <span class="highlight">date</span>?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="0.85" data-time="143">[02:23.00]</span>Student: The <span class="highlight">outline</span>? <span class="time" data-times="1.38" data-time="143.85">[02:23.85]</span>Oh, that's no problem.<span class="time" data-times="2.79" data-time="145.23">[02:25.23]</span>It's basically done except for the parts about the interview.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.1" data-time="148.02">[02:28.02]</span>Professor: Oh, yeah. The interview.<span class="time" data-times="2.64" data-time="150.12">[02:30.12]</span>Could you have the questions ready then too? <span class="time" data-times="1.81" data-time="152.76">[02:32.76]</span>The ones you are planning on asking.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.37" data-time="154.57">[02:34.57]</span>Student: Sure! Yeah, I can do that too.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.09" data-time="156.94">[02:36.94]</span>Professor: And then I'll <span class="highlight">expect</span> the final <span class="highlight">draft</span> next Friday.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.25" data-time="160.03">[02:40.03]</span>Student: Okay. Great. Thanks!</p>
