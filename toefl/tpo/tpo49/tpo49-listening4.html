To ask if she can interview him for her paper</p><p>B. To ask permission to extend the length of her paper</p><p>C. To ask permission to change the topic of her paper</p><p>D. To ask for more time to finish her paper</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>So the thing is,you know,okay,I'm writing my paper on the history of jazz in New York City...The thing is,I have this idea that might make it better and I was wondering if there's any way I The word "the thing is" in these two sentences indicates that the purpose of the student looking for a professor is to extend the paper submission time. So the answer is D.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What can be inferred about the student's work on her paper so far?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. She received a lot of help on the paper from professional musicians.</p><p>B. She has found enough information to complete the paper.</p><p>C. She did not start working on the paper early enough.</p><p>D. She is having difficulty finding sources for the paper.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The students' two sentences indicate that the thesis has progressed smoothly so far, and I have got a lot to say. I already have a lot to write. So answer B. The professional musicians mentioned in the A option are the people she will interview next week, so her received from the A option should be changed to she will receive. Contrary to or without mention of the C option and the original meaning, "Well, I could write the paper as it is and turn it in on time and it would be fine" can exclude C. The error of the D option is more obvious. In addition to time, everything is progressing smoothly.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the student want to interview her friend's grandfather?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. He has written articles about jazz music in New York City.</p><p>B. He has recordings of the musicians discussed in the woman's paper.</p><p>C. He owned a historic jazz club in New York City.</p><p>D. He was a jazz musician during the 1950s.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>Attention to that's why the sentence before and after the causal signal word, the reason why the students interviewed the friend grandfather has been clearly expressed. At the same time, the A option must be taken care of when the subject is examined. The subject is he or his friend, and he can write no papers.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor ask the student to do on the original due date of the paper? Click on two answers.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Turn in her first draft</p><p>B. Hand in an outline</p><p>C. Submit interview questions</p><p>D. Confirm that she has scheduled an interview</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="BC"><p>Professor just let be fair, why don't you turn in an outline of your paper on the due date? The professor asked the students to hand in the outline before the due date. The student said there was no problem. So answer B. The interview questions in the C option, the professor's original words is Could you have the questions ready then too? At that time (when the interview next week) you can also prepare for the interview questions? This corresponds to option C.</p></div></div><div class="replay" id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the student say this:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To address the professor's concern</p><p>B. To explain a change in her approach to her paper</p><p>C. To restate the professor's point</p><p>D. To request approval of her topic</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>Professor: All right.Well, that's a pretty broad subject. Okay, your theme is a bit big.</p><p>Student: Well, actually I'm focusing on a specific decade, the 50s. Actually I'm writing about jazz music from the 50s. The teacher first raised a concern and the student responded to this question to solve the teacher's worry. So the answer is A.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
