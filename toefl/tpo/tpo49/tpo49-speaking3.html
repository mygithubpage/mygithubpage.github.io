          <h4 class="w3-center">Make Textbook List Available Earlier</h4>Students always have to wait until the beginning of the semester to find out which textbooks they will need for their new courses. But since a lot of students register early for their courses, I think that the list for each course should be available immediately at the time of registration.This would give students more time to shop around to find less expensive textbooks. And it would also allow them to start work on the teaching for their new courses early.

        <h3>Listening Text</h3>

          <p>Narrator: Now listen to two students discussing the letter.</p>
          <p>Man: Hey, did you see Alexandra's letter?</p>
          <p>Girl: Yeah, what do you think?</p>
          <p>Man: Well, it's great. She really makes some good points, like the thing with the university bookstore is, if you buy a brand new textbook, it can be pretty expensive and they usually have only a few used textbooks around. They're cheaper of course, but they sell out quickly.</p>
          <p>Girl: That's true.</p>
          <p>Man: So this would give students time to look around on their own. You know, maybe they could find the books they need online, get books a few months ahead of time using the internet.</p>
          <p>Girl: I agree.</p>
          <p>Man: So this way students might be able to save a little money.</p>
          <p>Girl: Right, so what do you think about the second point, about the reading assignment?</p>
          <p>Man: I agree with that, too. It just makes a lot of sense, because things get really busy when the semester first starts and it can be hard to find time to keep up with all of the assignments, but students usually have some free time right before the start of the semester.</p>
          <p>Girl: So we'd have a good opportunity to do some preparation.</p>
          <p>Man: Exactly.</p>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>In the letter, Alexandra proposes the school to offer the list of textbooks needed for each course earlier. In this way, students can have more time to find cheaper textbooks and start working on their new courses early. In the conversation, the man supports her proposal. The man states that brand new textbooks are usually expensive and the used one, which are much cheaper, sell out quickly. And if the book list are available earlier, students may be able to get textbook online with less money. In addition, the man agree that at the beginning of each semester, students are often quite busy, hard to keep up with all the assignments. If they can have the textbooks earlier, they may have more time to make preparation ahead of the semester. </p>
