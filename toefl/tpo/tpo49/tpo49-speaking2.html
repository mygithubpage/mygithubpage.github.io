Explain why.</p></section><section id="sample-response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><article><p>From my perspective, I prefer the latter option. One obvious advantage of it is that students are able to have discussions conveniently with other group members who are focusing on the same projects. Proximity do facilitate this kind of discussions. Also, it may enable students to establish relationship with more people in the same class. If the seat is fixed, a student's social connection is very likely to be confined to those around him. A typical case of it is that my nephew who was assigned to sit in the front row in high school, could not even name those sat in the back row after one semester. </p></article></section></main></body></html>
