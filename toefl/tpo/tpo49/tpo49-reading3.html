Both exports and imports showed <span class="highlight">spectacular</span> growth, particularly in England and France. An increasingly larger <span class="highlight">portion</span> of the stepped-up <span class="highlight">commercial</span><span class="highlight">activity</span> was the result of <span class="highlight">trade</span> with <span class="highlight">overseas</span> colonies. Imports included a <span class="highlight">variety</span> of new beverages, spices, and ship's goods around the world and brought money flowing back. Europe's <span class="highlight">economic</span> institutions, particularly those in England, were strong, had wealth <span class="highlight">available</span> for new investment, and seemed almost to be waiting for some <span class="highlight">technological</span><span class="highlight">breakthrough</span> that would <span class="highlight">expand</span> their profit-making <span class="question1"><span class="highlight">potential</span></span><span class="highlight">even</span> more.</p><p>The <span class="highlight">breakthrough</span> came in Great Britain, where several <span class="highlight">economic</span> advantages created a <span class="highlight">climate</span> especially <span class="highlight">favorable</span> to the encouragement of new technology. One was its geographic location at the crossroads of international <span class="highlight">trade</span>. Internally, Britain was endowed with easily navigable natural waterway, which helped its <span class="highlight">trade</span> and communication with the world. Beginning in the 1770's, it enjoyed a <span class="highlight">boom</span> in <span class="highlight">canal</span> building, which helped make its <span class="highlight">domestic</span><span class="highlight">market</span> more <span class="highlight">accessible</span>. Because water <span class="highlight">transportation</span> was the cheapest means of carrying goods to <span class="highlight">market</span>, canals reduced prices and thus increased consumer demand. Great Britain also had rich deposits of <span class="highlight">coal</span> that fed the factories springing up in <span class="highlight">industrial</span> and consumer goods.</p><p>Another <span class="highlight">advantage</span> was Britain's large <span class="highlight">population</span> of <span class="highlight">rural</span>, agricultural wage earners, as well as cottage workers, who had the <span class="highlight">potential</span> of being more <span class="highlight">mobile</span> than peasants of some other countries. Eventually they found their way to the cities or <span class="highlight">mining</span> communities and provided the human power upon which the <span class="highlight">Industrial</span><span class="highlight">Revolution</span> was built. The British people were also consumers; the <span class="highlight">absence</span> of <span class="highlight">internal</span> tariffs, such as those that existed in France or Italy or between the German states, made Britain the largest free-trade area in Europe. Britain's <span class="highlight">relatively</span><span class="highlight">stable</span><span class="highlight">government</span> also helped create an <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span><span class="highlight"><span class="question5">conducive</span> to <span class="highlight"></span>industrial</span> progress.</p><p>Great Britain's better-developed banking and <span class="highlight">credit</span> system also helped speed the <span class="highlight">industrial</span> progress, as did the fact that it was the home of an <span class="highlight">impressive</span><span class="highlight">array</span> of entrepreneurs and inventors. Among them were a large number of nonconformists whose <span class="highlight">religious</span> principles encouraged thrift and <span class="highlight">industry</span> rather than luxurious living and who tended to pour their profits back into their business, thus providing the basis for continued <span class="highlight">expansion</span>.</p><p>A <span class="highlight">precursor</span> to the <span class="highlight">Industrial</span><span class="highlight">Revolution</span> was a <span class="highlight">revolution</span> in agricultural techniques. Ideas about agricultural <span class="highlight">reform</span> developed first in Holland, where as early as the mid-seventeenth <span class="highlight">century</span>, such modern methods as crop <span class="highlight">rotation</span>, heavy fertilization, and <span class="highlight">diversification</span> were all in use. Dutch peasant farmers were known <span class="highlight">throughout</span> Europe for their agricultural innovations, but as British markets and opportunities grew, the English quickly learned from them. As early as the seventeenth <span class="highlight">century</span> the Dutch were helping them <span class="highlight">drain</span> marshes and fens where, with the help of <span class="highlight">advanced</span> techniques, they grew new crops. By the mid-eighteenth <span class="highlight">century</span> new agricultural methods as well as <span class="highlight">selective</span><span class="highlight">breeding</span> of <span class="highlight">livestock</span> had caught on <span class="highlight">throughout</span> the country.</p><p>Much of the increased production was <span class="question8">consumed </span>by Great Britain's <span class="highlight">burgeoning</span><span class="highlight">population</span>. At the same time, people were moving to the city, <span class="highlight">partly</span> because of the enclosure movement; that is, the fencing of <span class="highlight">common</span> fields and pastures in order to provide more <span class="highlight"><span class="question9">compact</span>, <span class="highlight"></span>efficient</span> privately held agricultural parcels that would produce more goods and greater profits. In the sixteenth <span class="highlight">century</span> enclosures were usually used for creating sheep pastures, but by the eighteenth <span class="highlight">century</span> new farming techniques made it <span class="highlight">advantageous</span> for large landowners to seek enclosures in order to <span class="highlight">improve</span> agricultural production. Between 1714 and 1820 over 6 million acres of English land were enclosed. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> As a result, many small, <span class="highlight">independent</span> farmers were forced to sell out <span class="highlight">simply</span> because they could not <span class="highlight">compete</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> Non-landholding peasants and cottage workers, who worked for wages and grazed cows or pigs on the village <span class="highlight">common</span>, were also hurt when the <span class="highlight">common</span> was no longer <span class="highlight">available</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span> It was such people who began to <span class="highlight">flock</span> to the cities seeking <span class="highlight">employment</span> and who found work in the factories that would <span class="highlight">transform</span> the nation and, the world. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p></article></div><div id="question"><div id="question1"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">potential</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p><label class="my-label"><span>A. rate</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><label class="my-label"><span>B. dominance</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><label class="my-label"><span>C. capacity</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><label class="my-label"><span>D. method</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><p><span>Answer: </span><span class="my-answer">C</span></p></div><div id="question2"><p>According to paragraph 1, all of the following conditions created a favorable environment for the Industrial Revolution EXCEPT</p><label class="my-label"><span>A.
