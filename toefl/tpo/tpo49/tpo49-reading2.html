            <b>Movable Type</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>Nothing divided the <span class="underline">medieval</span> world in Europe more decisively from the Early Modern period than printing with movable type. It was a German invention and the <span class="underline">culmination</span> of a <span class="underline">complex</span> <span class="underline">process</span>. The world of <span class="underline">antiquity</span> had recorded its writings mainly on <span class="underline">papyrus</span>. Between 200 B.C and A.D 300, <span class="light">this</span> was supplemented by <span class="underline">vellum</span>, calf skin treated and then smoothed by pumice stone. To this in late Roman times was added <span class="underline">parchment</span>, similarly made from the smoothed skin of sheep or goats. In the early Middle Ages, Europe imported an <span class="underline">industrial</span> <span class="underline">process</span> from China, which turned almost any kind of <span class="underline">fibrous</span> <span class="underline">material</span> into <span class="underline">pulp</span> that was then <span class="underline">spread</span> in sheets. This was known as cloth <span class="underline">parchment</span>. By about 1150, the Spanish had developed the first <span class="underline">mill</span> for making cheap paper (a word contracted from "papyrus", which became the <span class="underline">standard</span> <span class="underline">term</span>). One of the most important phenomena of the later Middle Ages was the growing <span class="underline">availability</span> of cheap paper. <span class="underline">Even</span> in England, where technology lagged far behind, a sheet of paper, or eight octavo pages, <span class="underline">cost</span> only a penny by the fifteenth <span class="underline">century</span>.</p>
          <p>In the years 1446-1448, two German goldsmiths, Johannes Gutenberg and Johann Fust, made use of cheap paper to introduce a <span class="underline">critical</span> improvement in the way written pages were reproduced. Printing from wooden blocks was the old <span class="underline">method</span>; what the Germans did was to invent movable type for the letterpress. It had three merits: it could be used repeatedly until worn out; it was <span class="underline">cast</span> in metal from a <span class="underline">mold</span> and so could be <span class="underline">renewed</span> without difficulty; and it made lettering <span class="underline">uniform</span>. In 1450, Gutenberg began work on his Bible, the first printed book, known as the Gutenberg. It was completed in 1455 and is a <span class="underline">marvel</span>. As Gutenberg, apart from getting the key idea, had to solve a lot of <span class="underline">practical</span> problems, including imposing paper and ink into the <span class="underline">process</span> and the actual printing itself, for which he adapted the screw <span class="underline">press</span> used by winemakers, it is amazing that his first product does not look at all <span class="underline">rudimentary</span>. Those who <span class="underline">handle</span> it are struck by its clarity and <span class="underline">quality</span>.</p>
          <p>Printing was one of those <span class="underline">technical</span> revolutions that developed its own <span class="underline">momentum</span> at <span class="underline">extraordinary</span> speed. Europe in the fifteenth <span class="underline">century</span> was a place where <span class="underline">intermediate</span> technology - that is, workshops with skilled craftspeople - was well established and spreading fast, especially in Germany and Italy. Such workshops were able to take on printing easily, and it thus became Europe's first true <span class="underline">industry</span>. The <span class="underline">process</span> was aided by two factors: the new demand for cheap <span class="underline">classical</span> texts and the translation of the <span class="underline">Latin</span> Bible into "modern" languages. Works of <span class="underline">reference</span> were also in demand. Presses sprang up in several German cities, and by 1470, Nuremberg, Germany had established itself as the center of the international publishing <span class="underline">trade</span>, printing books from 24 presses and distributing them at <span class="underline">trade</span> fairs all over western and central Europe. The old monastic scriptoria-monastery workshops where monks copied texts by hand-worked closely alongside the new presses, continuing to produce the <span class="underline">luxury</span> goods that movable-type printing could not yet <span class="underline">supply</span>. Printing, however, was <span class="underline">primarily</span> aimed at a cheap <span class="underline">mass</span> sale.</p>
          <p>Although there was no competition between the technologies, there was <span class="underline">rivalry</span> between nations. The Italians made <span class="underline">energetic</span> and successful efforts to catch up with Germany. Their most successful <span class="underline">scriptorium</span> quickly imported two <span class="underline">leading</span> German printers to set up presses in their book-producing shop. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> German printers had the <span class="underline">disadvantage</span> of working with the <span class="underline">complex</span> typeface that the Italians sneeringly referred to as "Gothic" and that later became known as black letter. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> Outside Germany, readers found this typeface disagreeable. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span> The Italians, on the other hand, had a <span class="underline">clear</span> typeface known as roman that became the type of the future. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p>
          <p>Hence, although the Germans made use of the paper <span class="underline">revolution</span> to introduce movable type, the Italians went far to regain the <span class="underline">initiative</span> by their artistry. By 1500 there were printing firms in 60 German cities, but there were 150 presses in Venice alone. However, since many nations and governments <span class="underline">wanted</span> their own presses, the <span class="underline">trade</span> quickly became international. The <span class="underline">cumulative</span> <span class="underline">impact</span> of this <span class="underline">industrial</span> <span class="underline">spread</span> was <span class="underline">spectacular</span>. Before printing, only the very largest libraries, of which there were a <span class="underline">dozen</span> in Europe, had as many as 600 books. The total number of books on the entire <span class="underline">Continent</span> was well under 100,000. But by 1500, after only 45 years of the printed book, there were 9 million in <span class="underline">circulation</span>.</p>
