          <p>Well, if one of my friends cannot do things on time, I would like to give some suggestions to him as follows. Firstly, set an alarm as possible as he can. Once he has an important schedule, an alarm gives him a reminder on time not to be late. And what is more, he can set the voice of alarm loud so that he will not forget. Secondly, ask somebody else to do things together. As we all know, doing things together with others rather than alone is kind of like intangible force. To sum up, these are the two of the advice that I can give to him.</p>
