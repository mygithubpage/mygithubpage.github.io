a <span class="highlight">geology</span> class. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.75" data-time="4.38">[00:04.38]</span>Professor: Alaska is <span class="highlight">fascinating</span> to geologists because of its <span class="highlight">incredible</span> landscapes.<span class="time" data-times="3.58" data-time="10.13">[00:10.13]</span>Permafrost has a lot to do with this.<span class="time" data-times="12.4" data-time="13.71">[00:13.71]</span>That is the areas where the ground, the soil, is always frozen, except for the very top <span class="highlight">layer</span>, what we call the active <span class="highlight">layer</span> of permafrost, which melts in the summer and refreezes again in the winter. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.09" data-time="26.11">[00:26.11]</span>The northern part of Alaska is covered in lakes, thousands of them.<span class="time" data-times="7.29" data-time="31.2">[00:31.20]</span>And most of these are what we call <span class="highlight">thaw</span> lakes, T-H-A-W, <span class="highlight">thaw</span> lakes.<span class="time" data-times="5.76" data-time="38.49">[00:38.49]</span>I'm going to show you a few sketches of them in a <span class="highlight">minute</span>, so you'll have a good idea of what I'm talking about.<span class="time" data-times="8.89" data-time="44.25">[00:44.25]</span>So how these <span class="highlight">thaw</span> lakes are formed has to do with...OK, it starts with ice wedges.<span class="time" data-times="2.96" data-time="53.14">[00:53.14]</span>The top part of the ice <span class="highlight">wedge</span> melts.<span class="time" data-times="1.39" data-time="56.1">[00:56.10]</span>Should I back up? </p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.76" data-time="57.49">[00:57.49]</span>Ice wedges form when water runs into cracks in the ground, the permafrost, then freezes.<span class="time" data-times="2.65" data-time="65.25">[01:05.25]</span>You ever see mud after it dries?<span class="time" data-times="6.05" data-time="67.9">[01:07.90]</span>Dried mud has cracks because when it dries it contracts, it shrinks.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.02" data-time="73.95">[01:13.95]</span>Well, in winter permafrost behaves similarly.<span class="time" data-times="4.13" data-time="77.97">[01:17.97]</span>It shrinks in winter because it freezes <span class="highlight">even</span> more thoroughly then.<span class="time" data-times="4.45" data-time="82.1">[01:22.10]</span>And as it shrinks, it forms deep, deep cracks.<span class="time" data-times="17.1" data-time="86.55">[01:26.55]</span>Then in the summer, when the active <span class="highlight">layer</span>, the top <span class="highlight">layer</span> of the permafrost, melts, the <span class="highlight">melt</span> water runs into those cracks in the permafrost, then freezes again, because that ground, the ground <span class="highlight">beneath</span> the active <span class="highlight">layer</span> is still below freezing.<span class="time" data-times="4.28" data-time="103.65">[01:43.65]</span>So you have wedges of ice in the permafrost.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.49" data-time="107.93">[01:47.93]</span>Now, the ice wedges widen the <span class="highlight">original</span> cracks in the permafrost because water expands when it freezes.<span class="time" data-times="1.85" data-time="115.42">[01:55.42]</span>All right, OK.<span class="time" data-times="5.13" data-time="117.27">[01:57.27]</span>Then in the autumn, the active <span class="highlight">layer</span> on top freezes again.<span class="time" data-times="8.17" data-time="122.4">[02:02.40]</span>Then in winter the permafrost starts contracting again and the cracks open up <span class="highlight">even</span> wider.<span class="time" data-times="11.43" data-time="130.57">[02:10.57]</span>So the next summer when the active <span class="highlight">layer</span> melts again and flows into the widened cracks and freezes, it makes the cracks <span class="highlight">even</span> wider.<span class="time" data-times="5.95" data-time="142">[02:22.00]</span>So it's <span class="highlight">sort</span> of a <span class="highlight">cycle</span><span class="highlight">through</span> which the cracks and the wedges grow wider and wider.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="9.81" data-time="147.95">[02:27.95]</span>So when the ice <span class="highlight">wedge</span> reaches a certain size, its top part in the active <span class="highlight">layer</span> turns into a little pond when it melts in the summer.<span class="time" data-times="3.87" data-time="157.76">[02:37.76]</span>And that's the beginning of your <span class="highlight">thaw</span> lake.<span class="time" data-times="3.11" data-time="161.63">[02:41.63]</span>There are thousands of them in Northern Alaska.<span class="time" data-times="15.68" data-time="164.74">[02:44.74]</span>One of the most <span class="highlight">fascinating</span> things about these lakes and this is important, is that they mostly have the same <span class="highlight">shape</span> like an <span class="highlight">elongated</span><span class="highlight">oval</span> or egg <span class="highlight">shape</span>, and what's more, all the ovals are oriented in the same way.<span class="time" data-times="7.19" data-time="180.42">[03:00.42]</span>Here is an idea of what they look like, what the <span class="highlight">landscape</span> looks like from an <span class="highlight">aerial</span> view with the lakes side by side.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.69" data-time="187.61">[03:07.61]</span>There's been <span class="highlight">considerable</span> research done to try to <span class="highlight">figure</span> out what causes them to be shaped and oriented this way.<span class="time" data-times="6.85" data-time="195.3">[03:15.30]</span>We know that the <span class="highlight">shape</span> and <span class="highlight">orientation</span> are caused by the way the lakes grow once they are formed.<span class="time" data-times="4.3" data-time="202.15">[03:22.15]</span>But the question is what makes them grow this way?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.56" data-time="206.45">[03:26.45]</span>One <span class="highlight">theory</span> sees winds as the cause.<span class="time" data-times="5.34" data-time="210.01">[03:30.01]</span>This <span class="highlight">region</span> of Alaska has strong winds that blow <span class="highlight">perpendicular</span> to the lakes.<span class="time" data-times="5.29" data-time="215.35">[03:35.35]</span>What happens is wind blows straight into the longer side of the lakes.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.86" data-time="220.64">[03:40.64]</span>Now, wouldn't that <span class="highlight">erode</span> the lake bank in that direction?<span class="time" data-times="1.32" data-time="223.5">[03:43.50]</span>Same direction as the wind?<span class="time" data-times="1.63" data-time="224.82">[03:44.82]</span>Well, no.<span class="time" data-times="8.26" data-time="226.45">[03:46.45]</span>Actually, what happens is that the waves caused by the winds build a <span class="highlight">sort</span> of protective <span class="highlight">layer</span> of <span class="highlight">sediment</span>.<span class="time" data-times="6.43" data-time="234.71">[03:54.71]</span>It's called a protective shelf, <span class="highlight">along</span> the bank of the lake directly in front of them.<span class="time" data-times="7.48" data-time="241.14">[04:01.14]</span>So that bank is shielded from <span class="highlight">erosion</span> and the waves are diverted to the sides, to the left and to the right.<span class="time" data-times="4.33" data-time="248.62">[04:08.62]</span>And that's why the left and the right banks start eroding.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.87" data-time="252.95">[04:12.95]</span>Get it? The bank straight ahead is protected. <span class="time" data-times="5.37" data-time="256.82">[04:16.82]</span>But the lake currents, the waves <span class="highlight">erode</span> the banks to the sides. <span class="time" data-times="5.34" data-time="262.19">[04:22.19]</span>That's the <span class="highlight">current</span> model, the wind <span class="highlight">erosion</span> model, which is generally accepted.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="9.17" data-time="267.53">[04:27.53]</span>But there is a new <span class="highlight">theory</span> that says that <span class="highlight">thaw</span> slumping, not wind, is what shapes the <span class="highlight">thaw</span> lakes.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.56" data-time="276.7">[04:36.70]</span><span class="highlight">Thaw</span> slumping... Ok. <span class="time" data-times="3.66" data-time="280.26">[04:40.26]</span>Sometimes in the summer the <span class="highlight">temperature</span> rises <span class="highlight">pretty</span> quickly. <span class="time" data-times="5.52" data-time="283.92">[04:43.92]</span>So the active <span class="highlight">layer</span> of permafrost thaws faster than the water can <span class="highlight">drain</span> from the soil. <span class="time" data-times="7.61" data-time="289.44">[04:49.44]</span>So the sides of the <span class="highlight">thaw</span> lakes get like mushy and slump or <span class="highlight">slide</span> into the lake. <span class="time" data-times="5.5" data-time="297.05">[04:57.05]</span>Then the lake water spreads out more and the lake gets bigger. OK?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.22" data-time="302.55">[05:02.55]</span>Also in that part of Alaska, the <span class="highlight">terrain</span> is gently sloped, so the lakes are all on an incline. <span class="time" data-times="5.63" data-time="309.77">[05:09.77]</span>Here, now, this is an exaggeration of the <span class="highlight">angle</span>. <span class="time" data-times="1.78" data-time="315.4">[05:15.40]</span>The hill is not this <span class="highlight">steep</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.43" data-time="317.18">[05:17.18]</span>But see how with the lake's banks, the side that is farther downhill, it's smaller, <span class="highlight">lower</span>. <span class="time" data-times="11.72" data-time="324.61">[05:24.61]</span>This short bank thaws faster than the tall one does, so it falls into the lake, it slumps much more and much faster than the other bank. <span class="time" data-times="10.12" data-time="336.33">[05:36.33]</span>When short banks of many lakes slump, they move farther downhill and the lakes grow all in the same downhill direction.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.41" data-time="346.45">[05:46.45]</span>This is a new <span class="highlight">theory</span>, so it hasn't been tested much yet. <span class="time" data-times="6.18" data-time="350.86">[05:50.86]</span>In <span class="highlight">field</span> studies, when we've looked at the banks of these <span class="highlight">thaw</span> lakes, there is not much <span class="highlight">evidence</span> of slumping. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="357.04">[05:57.04]</span>We'd <span class="highlight">expect</span> to see cliff-like <span class="highlight">formation</span> there from the slumping. But we <span class="highlight">haven</span>'t really found any of those.</p></p></article></section><div id="question"><div id="question1"><p>What is the main purpose of the lecture?
