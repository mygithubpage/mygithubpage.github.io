lecture in an education class.<span class="time" data-times="4.97" data-time="4.96">[00:04.96]</span>The professor is discussing the Italian educator Maria Montessori.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="8.67" data-time="9.93">[00:09.93]</span>Professor: Ok, if you did your reading for today, then you were introduced to a very <span class="highlight">influential</span><span class="highlight">alternative</span> to <span class="highlight">traditional</span> education.<span class="time" data-times="9.95" data-time="18.6">[00:18.60]</span>This educational <span class="highlight">philosophy</span> and methodology was pioneered in Italy in the early 1900s by Doctor Maria Montessori.<span class="time" data-times="2.81" data-time="28.55">[00:28.55]</span>It's called the Montessori <span class="highlight">Method</span>.<span class="time" data-times="4.81" data-time="31.36">[00:31.36]</span>But what made the Montessori <span class="highlight">Method</span> for young children so different?<span class="time" data-times="2.82" data-time="36.17">[00:36.17]</span>What made it so different, so <span class="highlight">special</span>?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.9" data-time="38.99">[00:38.99]</span><span class="highlight">Male</span> Student: It's based on very different ideas about how kids learn best, right?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.77" data-time="43.89">[00:43.89]</span>Professor: Um-hmm...It was groundbreaking.<span class="time" data-times="7.86" data-time="46.66">[00:46.66]</span>To begin with, unlike the <span class="highlight">traditional</span> classrooms at the time, the Montessori classroom environment was more suited to the child.<span class="time" data-times="2.21" data-time="54.52">[00:54.52]</span>The furniture was child-sized.<span class="time" data-times="5.03" data-time="56.73">[00:56.73]</span>Well, it's that way in almost all schools now, but that wasn't always the case.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.05" data-time="61.76">[01:01.76]</span>We can thank Montessori for this.<span class="time" data-times="6.02" data-time="63.81">[01:03.81]</span>You won't see any long benches with children in rows or heavy desks that <span class="highlight">separate</span> children.<span class="time" data-times="3.08" data-time="69.83">[01:09.83]</span>Children are free to <span class="highlight">interact</span> with each other.<span class="time" data-times="11.61" data-time="72.91">[01:12.91]</span>And in Montessori classrooms, the furniture is lightweight, so children can move it around easily, and having furniture and materials made to fit them, makes kids feel more <span class="highlight">competent</span>.<span class="time" data-times="4.48" data-time="84.52">[01:24.52]</span>This fits in with Montessori's <span class="highlight">notion</span> of <span class="highlight">liberty</span> and <span class="highlight">autonomy</span>.<span class="time" data-times="5.32" data-time="89">[01:29.00]</span>Children are free to move around the room and they learn to do things for themselves.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="1.81" data-time="94.32">[01:34.32]</span><span class="highlight">Male</span> Student: I'm not sure I get that part.<span class="time" data-times="1.97" data-time="96.13">[01:36.13]</span>It sounds like <span class="highlight">potential</span><span class="highlight">chaos</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="1.47" data-time="98.1">[01:38.10]</span>Professor: Oh, no, no, no.<span class="time" data-times="3.93" data-time="99.57">[01:39.57]</span>Let's not confuse this <span class="highlight">liberty</span> of <span class="highlight">activity</span> with <span class="highlight">lack</span> of <span class="highlight">discipline</span>.<span class="time" data-times="9.27" data-time="103.5">[01:43.50]</span>In fact, teachers have to <span class="highlight">maintain</span> this <span class="highlight">specific</span> environment carefully <span class="highlight">through</span> a number of rules, which are generally about <span class="highlight">respect</span> and what's right.<span class="time" data-times="6.22" data-time="112.77">[01:52.77]</span>It's just that the child needs freedom of choice to develop independence and self-direction.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.58" data-time="118.99">[01:58.99]</span>Also, unlike what happens in most <span class="highlight">conventional</span> classrooms, children choose their own activities.<span class="time" data-times="20.22" data-time="125.57">[02:05.57]</span>They may be guided by the teacher, but it's <span class="highlight">ultimately</span> up to each child to select tasks, which brings us to the manipulative equipment you find in a Montessori classroom, like little boards that have <span class="highlight">rough</span> or smooth surfaces, or blocks that can be stacked into a tower.<span class="time" data-times="13.51" data-time="145.79">[02:25.79]</span>Now this equipment was designed by Montessori over time with much experimentation, designed...well, designed to help children teach themselves <span class="highlight">through</span> playing.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="1.96" data-time="159.3">[02:39.30]</span><span class="highlight">Female</span> Student: Well, what do the teachers do?<span class="time" data-times="3.07" data-time="161.26">[02:41.26]</span>I mean if the kids are teaching themselves.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="1.22" data-time="164.33">[02:44.33]</span>Professor: Ah, well, that's a good question.<span class="time" data-times="8.09" data-time="165.55">[02:45.55]</span>To start, a child may not work with an <span class="highlight">activity</span> until the teacher has demonstrated its <span class="highlight">proper</span> use.<span class="time" data-times="8.31" data-time="173.64">[02:53.64]</span>Then the Montessori teacher's job is to <span class="highlight">observe</span> the child's play, because when the children play, they are acquiring the bases for later concepts.<span class="time" data-times="9.78" data-time="181.95">[03:01.95]</span>So the teacher helps <span class="highlight">motivate</span> and <span class="highlight">focus</span> each child and monitors the child's progress, but does not <span class="highlight">interfere</span> with the child's observations and deductions.<span class="time" data-times="6.82" data-time="191.73">[03:11.73]</span>That was and still is a <span class="highlight">novel</span> idea, and for many teachers not the easiest thing to do.<span class="time" data-times="2.99" data-time="198.55">[03:18.55]</span>In facts, for some, it's very difficult.<span class="time" data-times="3.83" data-time="201.54">[03:21.54]</span>Montessori herself called the teacher a <span class="highlight">director</span>.<span class="time" data-times="5.53" data-time="205.37">[03:25.37]</span>Remember, the independence of the learner lies at the heart of the Montessori methodology.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.88" data-time="210.9">[03:30.90]</span><span class="highlight">Female</span> Student: Ok, yeah, it does <span class="highlight">seem</span> like that the teacher need a lot of training and patience.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="1.2" data-time="215.78">[03:35.78]</span>Professor: True.<span class="time" data-times="6.27" data-time="216.98">[03:36.98]</span>As I said, it is not easy for a lot of teachers to step back like that, but getting back to the equipment.<span class="time" data-times="11.8" data-time="223.25">[03:43.25]</span><span class="highlight">Basic</span> Montessori equipment can be divided into a number of <span class="highlight">major</span><span class="highlight">subject</span> areas such as <span class="highlight">practical</span> life, <span class="highlight">mathematics</span> and what is called sensorial.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.95" data-time="235.05">[03:55.05]</span>With a sensorial equipment, the children can <span class="highlight">explore</span> things like sounds and textures.<span class="time" data-times="3.43" data-time="241">[04:01.00]</span>At the same time, they develop <span class="highlight">motor</span> skills.<span class="time" data-times="6.07" data-time="244.43">[04:04.43]</span>But this <span class="highlight">apparent</span> play is laying the groundwork for the later math and language work.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.05" data-time="250.5">[04:10.50]</span>Now let's take a look at the materials called brown stairs.<span class="time" data-times="8.62" data-time="255.55">[04:15.55]</span>For a young child playing with this graduated blocks, these brown stairs, they are not just a sensorial lesson.<span class="time" data-times="11.88" data-time="264.17">[04:24.17]</span>By manipulating them, the child develops fine <span class="highlight">motor</span> skills and by sorting and classifying them by size, by weight, the child learns some <span class="highlight">basic</span><span class="highlight">mathematics</span>.<span class="time" data-times="10.9" data-time="276.05">[04:36.05]</span>Similarly, with practical-life equipment, the child can learn how to button a shirt, cut up an apple for a <span class="highlight">snack</span> and other real-world tasks.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.55" data-time="286.95">[04:46.95]</span><span class="highlight">Male</span> Student: Without this <span class="highlight">integration</span> in real-world learning, is there any room for <span class="highlight">creativity</span>?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.39" data-time="291.5">[04:51.50]</span>Professor: Is <span class="highlight">creativity</span> encouraged?<span class="time" data-times="8.31" data-time="293.89">[04:53.89]</span>Well, lots of Montessori teachers wouldn't praise a child for using a violin as a baseball bat or for putting their head like a hat.<span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="302.2">[05:02.20]</span>But actually, <span class="highlight">creativity</span> comes <span class="highlight">through</span> learning to play the violin, using the object for the purpose that was intended and <span class="highlight">practical</span> life exercises <span class="highlight">stress</span> that.</p></article><div id="questions"><div

How Maria Montessori developed her educational method</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>If you did your reading for today, then you were introduced to a very influential alternative to traditional education. This educational philosophy and methodology was pioneered in Italy in the early 1900s by Doctor Maria Montessori. The opening sentence has already told us what to say Montessori's teaching methods and theory. As will be seen later, this method is for children, so the answer is C.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor imply about the furniture that was traditionally found in children's classrooms in the early 1900s? Click on three answers.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It did not encourage interaction among children.</p><p>B. It helped maintain discipline in the classroom.</p><p>C. It was heavy and difficult for children to move.</p><p>D. It was not child sized.</p><p>E. It encouraged children to act independently.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="ACD"><p>This question is characteristic of finding a traditional teaching method after examination, that is, finding a point opposite to Montessori teaching method. The characteristics of Montessori are now located in the article. The furniture was child-sized corresponding to answer D. You won't see any long benches with children in rows or heavy desks with e each other.Corresponding to Answer A; The furniture is lightweight, so children can move it around easily.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor, what is the primary goal of the Montessori teacher?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To instruct the child in the correct use of the manipulative equipment</p><p>B. To prepare the child socially for future school interactions</p><p>C. To focus directly on the skills necessary for academic success</p><p>D. To guide the child to learn skills and concepts independently</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>It can be seen from this lecture that M's teachers' main task is to develop students' self-learning skills and form concepts. Training independence is the core of M teaching.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the professor's attitude about the Montessori teacher's role?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. She thinks children need more interaction with adults than it allows.</p><p>B. She thinks it is too limiting for the teacher.</p><p>C. She thinks it could be a difficult role to perform.</p><p>D. She thinks it demands expertise in many academic areas.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>That was and still is a novel idea, and for many teachers not the easiest thing to do. In fact, for some is very difficult.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the example of the brown stairs demonstrate about Montessori classroom materials?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. That natural materials provide children with a superior sensorial experience</p><p>B. That Montessori classroom materials are generally the same as those used in other primary schools</p><p>C. That same materials lack a particular educational focus</p><p>D. That one set of materials can be used to introduce several skills</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>This example demonstrates that during the play of building blocks, students learned some arithmetic skills. This corresponds to the skill of the D option.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor mention the violin? Click on two answers.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To demonstrate the type of creativity the Montessori method encourages</p><p>B. To stress the importance of music education at an early age</p><p>C. To give an example of how advanced Montessori lessons can be</p><p>D. To show that Montessori teachers expect materials to be used for their intended purpose</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="AD"><p>The example of the violin is mainly to illustrate which creativity is encouraged and which is not. It also emphasizes that daily life practice in M teaching emphasizes the need to use things according to purpose. So correspond to AD</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
