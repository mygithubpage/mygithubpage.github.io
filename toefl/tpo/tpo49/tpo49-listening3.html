            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.67" data-time="9.93">[00:09.93]</span>Professor: Ok, if you did your reading for today, then you were introduced to a very <span class="underline">influential</span> <span class="underline">alternative</span> to <span class="underline">traditional</span> education.<span class="time" data-times="9.95" data-time="18.6">[00:18.60]</span>This educational <span class="underline">philosophy</span> and methodology was pioneered in Italy in the early 1900s by Doctor Maria Montessori.<span class="time" data-times="2.81" data-time="28.55">[00:28.55]</span>It's called the Montessori <span class="underline">Method</span>.<span class="time" data-times="4.81" data-time="31.36">[00:31.36]</span>But what made the Montessori <span class="underline">Method</span> for young children so different?<span class="time" data-times="2.82" data-time="36.17">[00:36.17]</span>What made it so different, so <span class="underline">special</span>?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.9" data-time="38.99">[00:38.99]</span>
              <span class="underline">Male</span> Student: It's based on very different ideas about how kids learn best, right?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.77" data-time="43.89">[00:43.89]</span>Professor: Um-hmm...It was groundbreaking.<span class="time" data-times="7.86" data-time="46.66">[00:46.66]</span>To begin with, unlike the <span class="underline">traditional</span> classrooms at the time, the Montessori classroom environment was more suited to the child.<span class="time" data-times="2.21" data-time="54.52">[00:54.52]</span>The furniture was child-sized.<span class="time" data-times="5.03" data-time="56.73">[00:56.73]</span>Well, it's that way in almost all schools now, but that wasn't always the case.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.05" data-time="61.76">[01:01.76]</span>We can thank Montessori for this.<span class="time" data-times="6.02" data-time="63.81">[01:03.81]</span>You won't see any long benches with children in rows or heavy desks that <span class="underline">separate</span> children.<span class="time" data-times="3.08" data-time="69.83">[01:09.83]</span>Children are free to <span class="underline">interact</span> with each other.<span class="time" data-times="11.61" data-time="72.91">[01:12.91]</span>And in Montessori classrooms, the furniture is lightweight, so children can move it around easily, and having furniture and materials made to fit them, makes kids feel more <span class="underline">competent</span>.<span class="time" data-times="4.48" data-time="84.52">[01:24.52]</span>This fits in with Montessori's <span class="underline">notion</span> of <span class="underline">liberty</span> and <span class="underline">autonomy</span>.<span class="time" data-times="5.32" data-time="89">[01:29.00]</span>Children are free to move around the room and they learn to do things for themselves.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.81" data-time="94.32">[01:34.32]</span>
              <span class="underline">Male</span> Student: I'm not sure I get that part.<span class="time" data-times="1.97" data-time="96.13">[01:36.13]</span>It sounds like <span class="underline">potential</span> <span class="underline">chaos</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.47" data-time="98.1">[01:38.10]</span>Professor: Oh, no, no, no.<span class="time" data-times="3.93" data-time="99.57">[01:39.57]</span>Let's not confuse this <span class="underline">liberty</span> of <span class="underline">activity</span> with <span class="underline">lack</span> of <span class="underline">discipline</span>.<span class="time" data-times="9.27" data-time="103.5">[01:43.50]</span>In fact, teachers have to <span class="underline">maintain</span> this <span class="underline">specific</span> environment carefully <span class="underline">through</span> a number of rules, which are generally about <span class="underline">respect</span> and what's right.<span class="time" data-times="6.22" data-time="112.77">[01:52.77]</span>It's just that the child needs freedom of choice to develop independence and self-direction.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.58" data-time="118.99">[01:58.99]</span>Also, unlike what happens in most <span class="underline">conventional</span> classrooms, children choose their own activities.<span class="time" data-times="20.22" data-time="125.57">[02:05.57]</span>They may be guided by the teacher, but it's <span class="underline">ultimately</span> up to each child to select tasks, which brings us to the manipulative equipment you find in a Montessori classroom, like little boards that have <span class="underline">rough</span> or smooth surfaces, or blocks that can be stacked into a tower.<span class="time" data-times="13.51" data-time="145.79">[02:25.79]</span>Now this equipment was designed by Montessori over time with much experimentation, designed...well, designed to help children teach themselves <span class="underline">through</span> playing.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.96" data-time="159.3">[02:39.30]</span>
              <span class="underline">Female</span> Student: Well, what do the teachers do?<span class="time" data-times="3.07" data-time="161.26">[02:41.26]</span>I mean if the kids are teaching themselves.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.22" data-time="164.33">[02:44.33]</span>Professor: Ah, well, that's a good question.<span class="time" data-times="8.09" data-time="165.55">[02:45.55]</span>To start, a child may not work with an <span class="underline">activity</span> until the teacher has demonstrated its <span class="underline">proper</span> use.<span class="time" data-times="8.31" data-time="173.64">[02:53.64]</span>Then the Montessori teacher's job is to <span class="underline">observe</span> the child's play, because when the children play, they are acquiring the bases for later concepts.<span class="time" data-times="9.78" data-time="181.95">[03:01.95]</span>So the teacher helps <span class="underline">motivate</span> and <span class="underline">focus</span> each child and monitors the child's progress, but does not <span class="underline">interfere</span> with the child's observations and deductions.<span class="time" data-times="6.82" data-time="191.73">[03:11.73]</span>That was and still is a <span class="underline">novel</span> idea, and for many teachers not the easiest thing to do.<span class="time" data-times="2.99" data-time="198.55">[03:18.55]</span>In facts, for some, it's very difficult.<span class="time" data-times="3.83" data-time="201.54">[03:21.54]</span>Montessori herself called the teacher a <span class="underline">director</span>.<span class="time" data-times="5.53" data-time="205.37">[03:25.37]</span>Remember, the independence of the learner lies at the heart of the Montessori methodology.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.88" data-time="210.9">[03:30.90]</span>
              <span class="underline">Female</span> Student: Ok, yeah, it does <span class="underline">seem</span> like that the teacher need a lot of training and patience.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.2" data-time="215.78">[03:35.78]</span>Professor: True.<span class="time" data-times="6.27" data-time="216.98">[03:36.98]</span>As I said, it is not easy for a lot of teachers to step back like that, but getting back to the equipment.<span class="time" data-times="11.8" data-time="223.25">[03:43.25]</span> <span class="underline">Basic</span> Montessori equipment can be divided into a number of <span class="underline">major</span> <span class="underline">subject</span> areas such as <span class="underline">practical</span> life, <span class="underline">mathematics</span> and what is called sensorial.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.95" data-time="235.05">[03:55.05]</span>With a sensorial equipment, the children can <span class="underline">explore</span> things like sounds and textures.<span class="time" data-times="3.43" data-time="241">[04:01.00]</span>At the same time, they develop <span class="underline">motor</span> skills.<span class="time" data-times="6.07" data-time="244.43">[04:04.43]</span>But this <span class="underline">apparent</span> play is laying the groundwork for the later math and language work.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.05" data-time="250.5">[04:10.50]</span>Now let's take a look at the materials called brown stairs.<span class="time" data-times="8.62" data-time="255.55">[04:15.55]</span>For a young child playing with this graduated blocks, these brown stairs, they are not just a sensorial lesson.<span class="time" data-times="11.88" data-time="264.17">[04:24.17]</span>By manipulating them, the child develops fine <span class="underline">motor</span> skills and by sorting and classifying them by size, by weight, the child learns some <span class="underline">basic</span> <span class="underline">mathematics</span>.<span class="time" data-times="10.9" data-time="276.05">[04:36.05]</span>Similarly, with practical-life equipment, the child can learn how to button a shirt, cut up an apple for a <span class="underline">snack</span> and other real-world tasks.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.55" data-time="286.95">[04:46.95]</span>
              <span class="underline">Male</span> Student: Without this <span class="underline">integration</span> in real-world learning, is there any room for <span class="underline">creativity</span>?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.39" data-time="291.5">[04:51.50]</span>Professor: Is <span class="underline">creativity</span> encouraged?<span class="time" data-times="8.31" data-time="293.89">[04:53.89]</span>Well, lots of Montessori teachers wouldn't praise a child for using a violin as a baseball bat or for putting their head like a hat.<span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="302.2">[05:02.20]</span>But actually, <span class="underline">creativity</span> comes <span class="underline">through</span> learning to play the violin, using the object for the purpose that was intended and <span class="underline">practical</span> life exercises <span class="underline">stress</span> that.</p>
