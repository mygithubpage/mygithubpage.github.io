              <span class="highlight">Male</span> Student: It's based on very different ideas about how kids learn best, right?</p>

              <span class="time" data-times="6.58" data-time="118.99">[01:58.99]</span>Also, unlike what happens in most <span class="highlight">conventional</span> classrooms, children choose their own activities.<span class="time" data-times="20.22" data-time="125.57">[02:05.57]</span>They may be guided by the teacher, but it's <span class="highlight">ultimately</span> up to each child to select tasks, which brings us to the manipulative equipment you find in a Montessori classroom, like little boards that have <span class="highlight">rough</span> or smooth surfaces, or blocks that can be stacked into a tower.<span class="time" data-times="13.51" data-time="145.79">[02:25.79]</span>Now this equipment was designed by Montessori over time with much experimentation, designed...well, designed to help children teach themselves <span class="highlight">through</span> playing.</p>

            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.22" data-time="164.33">[02:44.33]</span>Professor: Ah, well, that's a good question.<span class="time" data-times="8.09" data-time="165.55">[02:45.55]</span>To start, a child may not work with an <span class="highlight">activity</span> until the teacher has demonstrated its <span class="highlight">proper</span> use.<span class="time" data-times="8.31" data-time="173.64">[02:53.64]</span>Then the Montessori teacher's job is to <span class="highlight">observe</span> the child's play, because when the children play, they are acquiring the bases for later concepts.<span class="time" data-times="9.78" data-time="181.95">[03:01.95]</span>So the teacher helps <span class="highlight">motivate</span> and <span class="highlight">focus</span> each child and monitors the child's progress, but does not <span class="highlight">interfere</span> with the child's observations and deductions.<span class="time" data-times="6.82" data-time="191.73">[03:11.73]</span>That was and still is a <span class="highlight">novel</span> idea, and for many teachers not the easiest thing to do.<span class="time" data-times="2.99" data-time="198.55">[03:18.55]</span>In facts, for some, it's very difficult.<span class="time" data-times="3.83" data-time="201.54">[03:21.54]</span>Montessori herself called the teacher a <span class="highlight">director</span>.<span class="time" data-times="5.53" data-time="205.37">[03:25.37]</span>Remember, the independence of the learner lies at the heart of the Montessori methodology.</p>

              <span class="highlight">Female</span> Student: Ok, yeah, it does <span class="highlight">seem</span> like that the teacher need a lot of training and patience.</p>

              <span class="time" data-times="1.2" data-time="215.78">[03:35.78]</span>Professor: True.<span class="time" data-times="6.27" data-time="216.98">[03:36.98]</span>As I said, it is not easy for a lot of teachers to step back like that, but getting back to the equipment.<span class="time" data-times="11.8" data-time="223.25">[03:43.25]</span> <span class="highlight">Basic</span> Montessori equipment can be divided into a number of <span class="highlight">major</span> <span class="highlight">subject</span> areas such as <span class="highlight">practical</span> life, <span class="highlight">mathematics</span> and what is called sensorial.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.95" data-time="235.05">[03:55.05]</span>With a sensorial equipment, the children can <span class="highlight">explore</span> things like sounds and textures.<span class="time" data-times="3.43" data-time="241">[04:01.00]</span>At the same time, they develop <span class="highlight">motor</span> skills.<span class="time" data-times="6.07" data-time="244.43">[04:04.43]</span>But this <span class="highlight">apparent</span> play is laying the groundwork for the later math and language work.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.05" data-time="250.5">[04:10.50]</span>Now let's take a look at the materials called brown stairs.<span class="time" data-times="8.62" data-time="255.55">[04:15.55]</span>For a young child playing with this graduated blocks, these brown stairs, they are not just a sensorial lesson.<span class="time" data-times="11.88" data-time="264.17">[04:24.17]</span>By manipulating them, the child develops fine <span class="highlight">motor</span> skills and by sorting and classifying them by size, by weight, the child learns some <span class="highlight">basic</span> <span class="highlight">mathematics</span>.<span class="time" data-times="10.9" data-time="276.05">[04:36.05]</span>Similarly, with practical-life equipment, the child can learn how to button a shirt, cut up an apple for a <span class="highlight">snack</span> and other real-world tasks.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.55" data-time="286.95">[04:46.95]</span>
              <span class="highlight">Male</span> Student: Without this <span class="highlight">integration</span> in real-world learning, is there any room for <span class="highlight">creativity</span>?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.39" data-time="291.5">[04:51.50]</span>Professor: Is <span class="highlight">creativity</span> encouraged?<span class="time" data-times="8.31" data-time="293.89">[04:53.89]</span>Well, lots of Montessori teachers wouldn't praise a child for using a violin as a baseball bat or for putting their head like a hat.<span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="302.2">[05:02.20]</span>But actually, <span class="highlight">creativity</span> comes <span class="highlight">through</span> learning to play the violin, using the object for the purpose that was intended and <span class="highlight">practical</span> life exercises <span class="highlight">stress</span> that.</p>
