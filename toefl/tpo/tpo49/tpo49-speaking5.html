Any big plans for summer break?</p><p>Girl: Well, I thought I knew what my plans were... But now I'm not sure.</p><p>Man: How come?</p><p>Girl: Well, you know how we are required to take a foreign language course before we graduate.</p><p>Man: Yeah.</p><p>Girl: I want to take it this summer since I am graduating next year and I will have a busy course schedule, so I signed to take a Russian course online over the summer because I am hoping to take a trip to Russia at some point.</p><p>Man: Online? That's cool. You wouldn't have to stay around campus and you could do it for home.</p><p>Girl: Exactly. You do everything over the internet, but not enough people signed up for the class so they cancelled it. Now I don't know what to do, l still need to fulfill the requirement.</p><p>Man: Wow, could you take a Russian class on campus this summer instead of the online course?</p><p>Girl: Yeah, there is a regular Russian class being offered on campus and it has space, so I could sign up and just stay in the dorms this summer and live on campus.</p><p>Man: OK.</p><p>Girl: I was looking forward to being home the summer, though, and spending some time with my family. My sister is coming back from China, she's working there for a year and I haven't seen her.</p><p>Man: Oh, that's disappointing.</p><p>Girl: I checked though and I could take a different language course online. There is one thing offered in Spanish.</p><p>Man: Great! So why don't you just do that, you'd be able to spend time with your sister.</p><p>Girl: Yeah, but I am not that excited by taking Spanish. I thought it would be fun to learn Russian. It's more interesting to me, though at least this way I could get the requirement out of the way. So, I don't know...</p></article><section id="question"><h4>Question</h4><p>Briefly summarize the problem the speakers are discussing.Then state which of the two solutions from the conversation you would recommend.Explain the reasons for your recommendation. </p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>The woman in the conversation planned to take a Russian course online this summer, but the problem is that this course was cancelled since not enough people sign up for the course. And she is required to take a language course in order to graduate next year. The man suggests her to take a Russian class on campus, but the woman wants to be with her family this summer and she hasn't seen her sister for a year. Another option is that she could take another language course online, a Spanish course. But the woman is not that interested in Spanish. If I were her, I would choose the latter option. Although it seems to be a little boring to learn Spanish, she can fulfill the needs for graduation and have more time to be with her family. And maybe, she may find it is more interesting than expected to learn Spanish.</p></article></div></main></body></html>
