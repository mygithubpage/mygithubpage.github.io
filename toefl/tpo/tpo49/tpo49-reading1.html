The most <span class="highlight question1">crucial</span> effect of <span class="highlight">climate</span> was on the <span class="highlight">sheer</span><span class="highlight">quantity</span> of land <span class="highlight">available</span> in each period, measurable by studying <span class="highlight">ancient</span> coastlines. <span class="question2">These have changed <span class="highlight">constantly</span><span class="highlight">through</span> time, <span class="highlight">even</span> in <span class="highlight">relatively</span> recent periods, as can be seen from the <span class="highlight">Neolithic</span> stone circle of Er Lannic, in Brittany, France (once inland but now half submerged on an island) or <span class="highlight">medieval</span> villages in east Yorkshire, England, that have tumbled into the sea in the last few centuries as the North Sea gnaws its way westward and erodes the cliffs.</span><span class="highlight">Conversely</span>, silts deposited by rivers sometimes push the sea farther back, creating new land, as at Ephesus in western <span class="highlight">Turkey</span>, a port on the <span class="highlight">coast</span> in Roman times but today some five kilometers inland.</p><p><span class="highlight">Nevertheless</span>, for archeologists concerned with the long periods of time of the <span class="highlight">Paleolithic</span> period there are variations in coastlines of much greater <span class="highlight">magnitude</span> to <span class="highlight">consider</span>. The <span class="highlight">expansion</span> and contraction of the <span class="highlight">continental</span> glaciers caused huge and <span class="highlight">uneven</span> rises and falls in sea levels worldwide. When the ice sheets grew, the sea <span class="highlight">level</span> would <span class="highlight">drop</span> as water became locked up in the glaciers; when the ice melted, the sea <span class="highlight">level</span> would rise again. Falls in sea <span class="highlight">level</span> often <span class="highlight">exposed</span> a number of important land bridges, such as those linking Alaska to northeast Asia and Britain to northwest Europe, a <span class="highlight">phenomenon</span> with far-reaching effects not only on human <span class="highlight">colonization</span> of the globe but also on the environment as a whole - the <span class="highlight">flora</span> and <span class="highlight">fauna</span> of <span class="highlight">isolated</span> or insular areas were <span class="highlight">radically</span> and often <span class="question5">irreversibly affected.</span> Between Alaska and Asia today lies the Bering Strait, which is so <span class="highlight">shallow</span> that a fall in sea <span class="highlight">level</span> of only four meters would turn it into a land bridge. When the ice sheets were at their greatest <span class="highlight">extent</span> some 18,000 years ago (the <span class="highlight">glacier</span><span class="highlight">maximum</span>), it is thought that the fall was about 120 meters, which <span class="highlight">therefore</span> created not merely a bridge but a <span class="highlight">vast</span><span class="highlight">plain</span>,1,000 kilometers from the north to the south, which has been called Beringia. The <span class="highlight">existence</span> of Beringia (and the <span class="highlight">extent</span> to which it could have supported human life) is one of the <span class="highlight">crucial</span> pieces of <span class="highlight">evidence</span> in the continuing <span class="highlight">debate</span> about the likely <span class="highlight">route</span> and <span class="highlight">date</span> of human <span class="highlight">colonization</span> of the New World.</p><p>The assessment of past rises and falls in sea <span class="highlight">level</span> requires study of submerged land surfaces off the <span class="highlight">coast</span> and of raised or elevated beaches on land. Raised beaches are <span class="question8">remnants</span> of <span class="highlight">former</span> coastlines at higher levels <span class="highlight">relative</span> to the present shoreline and <span class="highlight">visible</span>, for <span class="highlight">instance</span>, <span class="highlight">along</span> the Californian <span class="highlight">coast</span> north of San Francisco. The height of a raised <span class="highlight">beach</span> above the present shoreline, however, does not generally give a <span class="highlight">straightforward</span><span class="highlight">indication</span> of the height of a <span class="highlight">former</span> sea <span class="highlight">level</span>. In the <span class="highlight">majority</span> of cases, the beaches lie at a higher <span class="highlight">level</span> because the land has been raised up <span class="highlight">through</span> isostatic uplift or <span class="highlight">tectonic</span> movement. Isostatic uplift of the land occurs when the weight of ice is removed as temperatures rise, as at the end of an ice age; it has affected coastlines, for example, in <span class="highlight">Scandinavia</span>, Scotland, Alaska, and Newfoundland during the <span class="highlight">postglacial</span> period. <span class="highlight">Tectonic</span> movements <span class="highlight">involve</span> displacements in the plates that make up Earth's <span class="highlight">crust</span>. Middle and Late <span class="highlight">Pleistocene</span> raised beaches in the <span class="highlight">Mediterranean</span> are one <span class="highlight">instance</span> of such movements.</p><p><span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> Raised beaches often <span class="highlight">consist</span> of areas of sand, pebbles, or dunes, sometimes containing seashells or piles of <span class="highlight">debris</span><span class="question11">comprising</span> shells and bones of <span class="highlight">marine</span> animals used by humans. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> In Tokyo Bay, for example, <span class="highlight">shell</span> mounds of the Jomon period (about 10,000 to 300 B.C.E.)mark the <span class="highlight">position</span> of the shoreline at a time of <span class="highlight">maximum</span><span class="highlight">inundation</span> by the sea (6,500-5,500 years ago),when, <span class="highlight">through</span><span class="highlight">tectonic</span> movement, the sea was three to five meters higher in relation to the <span class="highlight">contemporary</span><span class="highlight">landmass</span> of Japan than at present. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span><span class="highlight">Analysis</span> of the shells themselves has confirmed the changes in <span class="highlight">marine</span><span class="highlight">topography</span>, for it is only during the <span class="highlight">maximum</span><span class="highlight">phase</span> that subtropical <span class="highlight">species</span> of mollusc are present, indicating a higher water <span class="highlight">temperature</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">crucial</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. interesting</p><p>B. important</p><p>C. established</p><p>D. understood</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Crucial: It is crucial. A is interesting, b is important, c is established, and d is understood. Comprehensive options, b best match.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. In the last few centuries, the erosion of coastline created the Neolithic stone circle in Brittany, France, at the same time that it destroyed the medieval villages in Yorkshire, England</p><p>B. Coastlines have changed even in recent times as shown by the current locations of certain Neolithic monuments and medieval villages</p><p>C. Recent changes in the coastlines near the Neolithic stone circle of Er Lannic in Brittany, France, and the medieval villages in Yorkshire, England, suggest that ancient coastlines changed in similar ways</p><p>D. Changes in coastlines can lead to the creation of islands such as Er Lannic in France or the total erosion of the cliffs as in Yorkshire in England, though no considerable changes have occurred in recent periods</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>When extracting the main sentence and removing the contents of parentheses and clauses first, the sentences are: "these have changed continuously through through time, even in comparative recent periods, as can be seen from the Neolithic stone circle of Er Lannic, in Brittany, France or In east Yorkshire, England. The subject refers to the ancient coastlines of the previous sentence. The main idea of the sentence stems from "the coastline is always changing, even in the most recent period, this phenomenon can be seen through the Neolithic stone circle and the medieval villages." The b option is a synonymous alternative expression to the original sentence, so it is correct. The two predicate actions of the a option, neither created nor destroyed, are mentioned. The c option says that the recent lines changes are the same as the way the ancient line changes. The original sentence is not mentioned. The lead to causality of the d option is not reflected in the original sentence.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 1, the city of Ephesus in western Turkey is an example of which of the following?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Recent changes in the shoreline that have resulted in the creation of new land</p><p>B. Port cities that have lost shoreline due to the erosion of land</p><p>C. The ocean's role in the formation of new land</p><p>D. The importance of changes in shoreline to cities located inland</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The question asked about Ephesus in western Turkey is one of the following examples. By positioning the stemmed Ephesus in western Turkey to the second half of the last sentence of the original sentence, as can be seen, the answer is the first half of the sentence. "silts deposited by rivers sometimes push the sea farther back, creating new land", which is a after synonymous rewriting.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the following can be inferred from paragraph 2 about the effects of climate change during the Paleolithic period?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The amount of land not covered by water was a greater during warmer periods</p><p>B. Warmer weather encouraged the expansion of the range of flora and fauna</p><p>C. As a result of colder weather,land bridges became exposed</p><p>D. The rise of sea level occurred during periods of cold weather</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>In the third sentence and the fourth sentence of this paragraph, "When the ice sheets grew, the sea level would drop", when the ice sheet increased, the sea level would drop; "Falls in sea level often exposed a number of important land bridges "The decline in sea level will usually reveal a large number of important land bridges. It was reasoned that the increase in the ice sheet is due to the low temperature, so low temperatures can lead to the appearance of land bridges.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>By indicating that flora and fauna of isolated or insular areas were often |irreversibly affected|by the changes due to the Ice Age, the author means that the flora and fauna were</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. unable to return to their previous conditions</p><p>B. in a constant state of change</p><p>C. completely destroyed by human colonization</p><p>D. unevenly distributed across the area</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>This question can start with the phrase itself. Irreversibly affected means "<span class="question5">irreversibly affected.</span>" Plants and animals have been affected and have changed. Irreversible, that is, unable to return to the state before the change, so the answer is a.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 2, all of the following are true of Beringia EXCEPT</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It may have been used by the people who first colonized North America</p><p>B. It may have been large enough to support life</p><p>C. It was probably still four meters under water during the glacier maximum</p><p>D. It was probably a vast plain</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>According to Beringia's position of the stem to the second last sentence of this paragraph, it is determined that the answer is in the last two sentences. The a option corresponds to the last sentence of the original text, The existence of Beringia...the New World, so exclude; the b option corresponds to the 1,000th from the north to the south of the penultimate sentence and the extent to which it could have supported human life The second-to-last sentence of the original text mentions that during the glacier maximum period, sea level fell by 120 meters, revealing a large plain, Beringia, which means that Beringia is above sea level, with the option c still below the surface of the water. 4 meters represent conflicts, so c is the correct answer; therefore, the d option corresponds to the second-last sentence, which therefore created not merely a bridge but a vast plain.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What purpose does the discussion about the Bering Strait in paragraph 2 serve in the passage?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It explains the idea that changes in coastlines do not necessarily result in significant alternations to existing marine life</p><p>B. It illustrates the kind of impact that variations in land availability caused by climate change can have</p><p>C. It provides a large amount of archaeological evidence that casts doubt on changes in sea level during the Paleolithic period</p><p>D. It shows how ancient coastlines can serve as useful models in understanding recent changes in coastlines</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Through the Bering Strait of the title, the 5th sentence of this paragraph refers to the specific Bering Strait as an example, so look ahead. The previous sentence mentioned that the lowering of the temperature resulted in a decline in sea level and the decline in sea level made the land bridge appear. The example itself states that the decline in sea level exposes the Bering Strait. The example is the same as the one expressed in the previous sentence. The example is to illustrate the effect of temperature change on the land availability. The answer is B.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question8">remnants</span></span>" in the passage is closest meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. remains</p><p>B. regions</p><p>C. points</p><p>D. origins</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" A"><p>Remnant: The rest, <span class="question8">remnants</span>. A is the legacy, b is the area, c is the location, and d is the origin. The comprehensive option is a.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 3, why is the height of a raised beach not a straightforward indicator of past sea level?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The height of the beach may have been raised or altered by human interventions in the shore environment</p><p>B. The height of the beach may be the result of erosion over a brief period of time</p><p>C. It is difficult to assess if the sea actually existed at that level for any significant period of time</p><p>D. The surface of Earth may have shifted,moving the beach from its original positron</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>Through the stem position to the third sentence of this paragraph, the question asked why, so the answer is generally located in the latter sentence. "In the majority of cases, the beaches lie at a higher level because the land has been raised up through through isostatic uplift or tectonic movement." The general reason is that changes in the land resulted in changes in the position of the beach, so the answer is d.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 3, which of following causes an isostatic uplift?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Shifts in Earth's crust</p><p>B. A decrease in the pressure of thick ice sheets</p><p>C. A decrease in temperature</p><p>D. Changes in sea level</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Through the positioning of the stem to the fifth sentence of this paragraph, Isostatic uplift of the land occurs when the weight of ice is removed as temperatures rise, ie as the temperature rises, the weight of the ice cube is reduced, thus producing isostatic uplift, check option, b It is correct to rewrite the same meaning of the original text.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question11">comprising</span></span>" in the passage 4 is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. taken from</p><p>B. made up of</p><p>C. suggesting</p><p>D. covering</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>Comprising: composition. A is lower, B is composition, C is suggestive / surface, and D is covered. Comprehensive options, B is the correct answer.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the following can be inferred from paragraph 4 about Tokyo Bay?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The coastal land currently available is smaller than it was during the Japan period</p><p>B. The height of raised beaches around Tokyo Bay is a poor indicator of ancient sea levels</p><p>C. The water temperature in Tokyo Bay is lower at present than it was during the Jomon period</p><p>D. Tectonic movement during the Jomon period was not responsible for the formation of Tokyo Bay's raised beaches</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The second sentence of this paragraph refers to Tokyo Bay as the shell mounds of the Jomon period. The last sentence mentions that analysis of shellfish itself can confirm changes in the ocean topography because subtropical mollusks exist only at the highest values of seawater inundation. This implies a higher water temperature. (Analysis of the shells itself has confirmed the changes in marine topography, for it is only during the maximum depth of the subtropical species of mollusc are present, indicating a higher water temperature.) Reasoning: The presence of molluscs implies that the water temperature is high, and Tokyo Bay is a shellfish made up of mollusks during the Jomon period, so the water temperature that can be introduced in Tokyo Bay was higher during the Jomon period than it is now. So the answer is c.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The location of these heaps of rubbish can be an accurate indicator of earlier coastlines.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>These heaps of rubbish in the sentence to be inserted are guided by the demonstrative thesse, which indicates that the heaps of rubbish mentioned earlier, only the sand, pebbles, or dunes in front of the b option can correspond to seashells or piles of debris.</p></div></div><div id="question14" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>Changes in climate have altered Earth's coastlines and their environments.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.Changing coastlines affect the total amount of land available for people to live on</p><p>B.The existence of Beringia,a vast landmass that may have supported human life,is still debated by archaeologists</p><p>C.Raised beaches,which may contain indicators of human activity,are often the result of isotactic uplifts and tectonic movements</p><p>D.The expansion and contraction of glaciers caused rises and falls in sea levels all over the world and in some areas,led to radical changes in their flora and fauna</p><p>E.The climate changes that led to alternations in the coastlines of San Francisco,Scandinavia,Scotland,Alaska,and Newfoundland isolated species that had once flourished together</p><p>F.Because raised beaches along the Mediterranean Sea were caused by tectonic movements,they contain abundant evidence of ancient civilizations</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="ACD"><p>The a option corresponds to paragraph 2 of the paragraph and is correct; the Beringia of the b option is just an example of the second paragraph, so the details are not selected; the c option corresponds to the third paragraph, correct; the d option corresponds to the second, third of the second paragraph. And the fourth sentence, correct; e option refers to multiple specific locations, for details, not selected; f option causality is not reflected in the original text, excluded.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
