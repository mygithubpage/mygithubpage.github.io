            <b>Ancient Coastlines</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>Information on past climates is of <span class="underline">primary</span> <span class="underline">relevance</span> to <span class="underline">archaeology</span> because of what it tells us about the effects on the land and on the resources that people needed to <span class="underline">survive</span>. The most <span class="light"><span class="underline">crucial</span></span> effect of <span class="underline">climate</span> was on the <span class="underline">sheer</span> <span class="underline">quantity</span> of land <span class="underline">available</span> in each period, measurable by studying <span class="underline">ancient</span> coastlines. These have changed <span class="underline">constantly</span> <span class="underline">through</span> time, <span class="underline">even</span> in <span class="underline">relatively</span> recent periods, as can be seen from the <span class="underline">Neolithic</span> stone circle of Er Lannic, in Brittany, France (once inland but now half submerged on an island) or <span class="underline">medieval</span> villages in east Yorkshire, England, that have tumbled into the sea in the last few centuries as the North Sea gnaws its way westward and erodes the cliffs. <span class="underline">Conversely</span>, silts deposited by rivers sometimes push the sea farther back, creating new land, as at Ephesus in western <span class="underline">Turkey</span>, a port on the <span class="underline">coast</span> in Roman times but today some five kilometers inland.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="underline">Nevertheless</span>, for archeologists concerned with the long periods of time of the <span class="underline">Paleolithic</span> period there are variations in coastlines of much greater <span class="underline">magnitude</span> to <span class="underline">consider</span>. The <span class="underline">expansion</span> and contraction of the <span class="underline">continental</span> glaciers caused huge and <span class="underline">uneven</span> rises and falls in sea levels worldwide. When the ice sheets grew, the sea <span class="underline">level</span> would <span class="underline">drop</span> as water became locked up in the glaciers; when the ice melted, the sea <span class="underline">level</span> would rise again. Falls in sea <span class="underline">level</span> often <span class="underline">exposed</span> a number of important land bridges, such as those linking Alaska to northeast Asia and Britain to northwest Europe, a <span class="underline">phenomenon</span> with far-reaching effects not only on human <span class="underline">colonization</span> of the globe but also on the environment as a whole - the <span class="underline">flora</span> and <span class="underline">fauna</span> of <span class="underline">isolated</span> or insular areas were <span class="underline">radically</span> and often irreversibly affected. Between Alaska and Asia today lies the Bering Strait, which is so <span class="underline">shallow</span> that a fall in sea <span class="underline">level</span> of only four meters would turn it into a land bridge. When the ice sheets were at their greatest <span class="underline">extent</span> some 18,000 years ago (the <span class="underline">glacier</span> <span class="underline">maximum</span>), it is thought that the fall was about 120 meters, which <span class="underline">therefore</span> created not merely a bridge but a <span class="underline">vast</span> <span class="underline">plain</span>,1,000 kilometers from the north to the south, which has been called Beringia. The <span class="underline">existence</span> of Beringia (and the <span class="underline">extent</span> to which it could have supported human life) is one of the <span class="underline">crucial</span> pieces of <span class="underline">evidence</span> in the continuing <span class="underline">debate</span> about the likely <span class="underline">route</span> and <span class="underline">date</span> of human <span class="underline">colonization</span> of the New World.</p>
          <p>The assessment of past rises and falls in sea <span class="underline">level</span> requires study of submerged land surfaces off the <span class="underline">coast</span> and of raised or elevated beaches on land. Raised beaches are remnants of <span class="underline">former</span> coastlines at higher levels <span class="underline">relative</span> to the present shoreline and <span class="underline">visible</span>, for <span class="underline">instance</span>, <span class="underline">along</span> the Californian <span class="underline">coast</span> north of San Francisco. The height of a raised <span class="underline">beach</span> above the present shoreline, however, does not generally give a <span class="underline">straightforward</span> <span class="underline">indication</span> of the height of a <span class="underline">former</span> sea <span class="underline">level</span>. In the <span class="underline">majority</span> of cases, the beaches lie at a higher <span class="underline">level</span> because the land has been raised up <span class="underline">through</span> isostatic uplift or <span class="underline">tectonic</span> movement. Isostatic uplift of the land occurs when the weight of ice is removed as temperatures rise, as at the end of an ice age; it has affected coastlines, for example, in <span class="underline">Scandinavia</span>, Scotland, Alaska, and Newfoundland during the <span class="underline">postglacial</span> period. <span class="underline">Tectonic</span> movements <span class="underline">involve</span> displacements in the plates that make up Earth's <span class="underline">crust</span>. Middle and Late <span class="underline">Pleistocene</span> raised beaches in the <span class="underline">Mediterranean</span> are one <span class="underline">instance</span> of such movements.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A">
            </span> Raised beaches often <span class="underline">consist</span> of areas of sand, pebbles, or dunes, sometimes containing seashells or piles of <span class="underline">debris</span> comprising shells and bones of <span class="underline">marine</span> animals used by humans. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> In Tokyo Bay, for example, <span class="underline">shell</span> mounds of the Jomon period (about 10,000 to 300 B.C.E.)mark the <span class="underline">position</span> of the shoreline at a time of <span class="underline">maximum</span> <span class="underline">inundation</span> by the sea (6,500-5,500 years ago),when, <span class="underline">through</span> <span class="underline">tectonic</span> movement, the sea was three to five meters higher in relation to the <span class="underline">contemporary</span> <span class="underline">landmass</span> of Japan than at present. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span> <span class="underline">Analysis</span> of the shells themselves has confirmed the changes in <span class="underline">marine</span> <span class="underline">topography</span>, for it is only during the <span class="underline">maximum</span> <span class="underline">phase</span> that subtropical <span class="underline">species</span> of mollusc are present, indicating a higher water <span class="underline">temperature</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p>
