            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.96" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Listen to part of a lecture in an <span class="underline">archaeology</span> class.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="13.35" data-time="4.96">[00:04.96]</span>Professor: So if I ask you what most archaeologists do with all those pieces of broken <span class="underline">pottery</span> they find at the <span class="underline">excavation</span> sites, you'd probably say that they help <span class="underline">establish</span> the time period of the site. <span class="time" data-times="1.79" data-time="18.31">[00:18.31]</span> <span class="underline">Pretty</span> <span class="underline">obvious</span>. Huh? <span class="time" data-times="4.92" data-time="20.1">[00:20.10]</span> <span class="underline">Pottery</span> helps us order things in time to <span class="underline">assign</span> <span class="underline">relative</span> dates.<span class="time" data-times="4.79" data-time="25.02">[00:25.02]</span>Basically, when we <span class="underline">date</span> <span class="underline">pottery</span>, we look at its <span class="underline">frequency</span> at a <span class="underline">given</span> site.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.32" data-time="29.81">[00:29.81]</span>As you can probably <span class="underline">surmise</span>, styles of <span class="underline">pottery</span> <span class="underline">vary</span> over time, in terms of how they're made, what they're made of and what they were used for.<span class="time" data-times="17.94" data-time="40.13">[00:40.13]</span>So as archaeologists, we built up a picture, a <span class="underline">sequence</span> of how <span class="underline">pottery</span> changed over time as well as how its popularity <span class="underline">varied</span> over time which we can tell by the <span class="underline">frequency</span> of a style at a site, how many occurrences we find at a <span class="underline">given</span> site.<span class="time" data-times="10.92" data-time="58.07">[00:58.07]</span>But <span class="underline">pottery</span> can provide <span class="underline">evidence</span> about a lot of things, not just dating <span class="underline">evidence</span>, not just <span class="underline">evidence</span> of the time period that <span class="underline">pottery</span> was created.<span class="time" data-times="6.4" data-time="68.99">[01:08.99]</span>So there is also another type of <span class="underline">evidence</span> that we call distributional <span class="underline">evidence</span>.<span class="time" data-times="4.49" data-time="75.39">[01:15.39]</span>OK, <span class="underline">pottery</span> is <span class="underline">evidence</span> of <span class="underline">distribution</span>.<span class="time" data-times="5.41" data-time="79.88">[01:19.88]</span>It, <span class="underline">pottery</span>, provides <span class="underline">evidence</span> that <span class="underline">trade</span> took place.<span class="time" data-times="12.81" data-time="85.29">[01:25.29]</span>Pots were traded for themselves or <span class="underline">given</span> as gifts, but <span class="underline">even</span> more often they changed hands cause they were used as containers for food or wine.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.07" data-time="98.1">[01:38.10]</span>To fully understand how <span class="underline">pottery</span>'s used as distributional <span class="underline">evidence</span>, we have to know its <span class="underline">origin</span>, where it was made.<span class="time" data-times="2.43" data-time="107.17">[01:47.17]</span>So how do we <span class="underline">figure</span> this out? <span class="time" data-times="11.97" data-time="109.6">[01:49.60]</span>Well, by studying what the <span class="underline">pottery</span>'s made of, you look at the <span class="underline">material</span> that...that a pot's made of, to know where it was made and its <span class="underline">distribution</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="13.19" data-time="121.57">[02:01.57]</span>OK. A third kind of <span class="underline">evidence</span> is <span class="underline">evidence</span> of <span class="underline">function</span>, the <span class="underline">function</span> of the site where the <span class="underline">pottery</span> was found and sometimes about the lives of the people who lived there.<span class="time" data-times="5.87" data-time="134.76">[02:14.76]</span>Now this <span class="underline">evidence</span> is a bit tougher to <span class="underline">interpret</span> than the other two.<span class="time" data-times="2.66" data-time="140.63">[02:20.63]</span>And there are several reasons for this.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.11" data-time="143.29">[02:23.29]</span>First of all, <span class="underline">pottery</span> is usually not found in <span class="underline">primary</span> contexts, that is, it's often not found in the place where it was used.<span class="time" data-times="19.57" data-time="153.4">[02:33.40]</span>Think about you <span class="underline">average</span> town <span class="underline">dump</span>, you know the place where everyone's unwanted <span class="underline">stuff</span> ends up, can you imagine archaeologists a thousand years from now digging up a town <span class="underline">dump</span> and then using the items found there to get <span class="underline">meaningful</span> information about how the objects found there were used? <span class="time" data-times="1.74" data-time="172.97">[02:52.97]</span>Probably not.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="15.72" data-time="174.71">[02:54.71]</span>A <span class="underline">second</span> <span class="underline">reason</span> why <span class="underline">function</span> is harder to <span class="underline">identify</span> is that not all objects found in one <span class="underline">spot</span> can be assumed to have <span class="underline">identical</span> functions <span class="underline">even</span> if they look <span class="underline">similar</span>.<span class="time" data-times="16.52" data-time="190.43">[03:10.43]</span>If you come <span class="underline">across</span> a collection of pots at a site, you need to work at the <span class="underline">level</span> of the group rather than the <span class="underline">individual</span> pots because you can't <span class="underline">assume</span> that they all have the same <span class="underline">function</span> just because they were found in the same place.<span class="time" data-times="4.96" data-time="206.95">[03:26.95]</span>So this is where <span class="underline">pottery</span>'s form comes into play.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.37" data-time="211.91">[03:31.91]</span>The form of a pot can give us some ideas about its <span class="underline">function</span>, the suitability of the <span class="underline">pottery</span> to serve a <span class="underline">specific</span> <span class="underline">function</span>.<span class="time" data-times="5.83" data-time="221.28">[03:41.28]</span>However, we have to be careful when it comes to skeuomorphs.<span class="time" data-times="5.91" data-time="227.11">[03:47.11]</span>These objects are copies of the designs of other objects, but in another <span class="underline">material</span>.<span class="time" data-times="8.98" data-time="233.02">[03:53.02]</span>And this can be problematic, because sometimes the new or different <span class="underline">material</span> is not well suited to the design.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="19.23" data-time="242">[04:02.00]</span>A good example of this comes from a fifteen-century Dutch ceramics, a <span class="underline">bronze</span> cauldron was copied in <span class="underline">ceramic</span>, including the <span class="underline">sort</span> of big angled handles, and while it worked well in <span class="underline">bronze</span>, it didn't work in the <span class="underline">ceramic</span> skeuomorph. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="261.23">[04:21.23]</span>Well, because the <span class="underline">ceramic</span> handles couldn't support the weight of the pot when it's full, it just couldn't <span class="underline">function</span> as it was intended to.</p>
