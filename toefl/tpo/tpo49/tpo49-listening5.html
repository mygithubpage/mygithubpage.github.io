Explanations for a recent increase in the reindeer population</p><p>B. Adaptatians that enable reindeerta live in cold climates</p><p>C. Dififerences between newborn reindeer and adult reindeer</p><p>D. Changes in the reindeer's food supply</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The article was introduced from the beginning to the discussion of reindeer, and later began to describe how their characteristics adapted to the cold environment.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor, why is it necessary for newborn reindeer to be able to walk and run almost immediately?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Newborn reindeer face intense competition from older reindeer.</p><p>B. Reindeer herds have to travel long distances every day.</p><p>C. Running and walking help reindeer maintain a stable body temperature.</p><p>D. Running is the only way reindeer can protect themselves from predators.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Teacher-student interaction students say that the new-born reindeer is like an adult reindeer and can be born to stand up and get up the next day. The teacher replied that it was because the resource-poor reindeer needed to go a long way to find resources.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor say about the lower part of a reindeer's legs?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It stays warmer than the upper part of the leg.</p><p>B. It is able to maintain the same temperature as the main part of the reindeer's body</p><p>C. It contains fat that changes texture at lower temperatures.</p><p>D. It contains fat that is different from the fat in the upper part of the leg.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The teacher-student interaction teacher said that the fat structure of the lower half of the legs of the reindeer is different from the upper part. They can make the reindeer not freeze in the cold environment.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor imply about lichens?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They need reindeer in order to survive.</p><p>B. They are more abundant than other arctic plants during the winter.</p><p>C. They are more important to cows and sheep than they are to reindeer.</p><p>D. They are the object of fierce competition among arctic animals.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The teacher raised Lichen's example first to say that it was a mixture of a fungus and algae. Lichen was quite abundant in winter. He also said that reindeers like to eat it and have more nutrients than other lichen animals.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor say about the microbes in a reindeer's digestive system?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Some of the microbes protect the reindeer against harmful bacteria.</p><p>B. Many of the microbes are transported into the reindeer's body on lichens that the reindeer eats.</p><p>C. The proportion of various microbes changes to accommodate changes in the reindeers diet.</p><p>D. The microbes found in a newborn reindeer's digestive system are very different from those found in an adult reindeer.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The teacher finally said that in the spring, the reindeer had malnutrition, and they needed to eat different plants. The bacteria in their digestive system could themselves adjust to changes in different seasons to digest different plants.</p></div></div><div class="replay" id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor say this:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. She wants to emphasize the importance of her previous point.</p><p>B. She wants to illustrate her previous point with an example.</p><p>C. She wants to return to the main topic ofthe lecture.</p><p>D. She wants to clarify her previous statement.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The teacher talked a lot about lichen, a bit of a dilemma and then said anyway reindeer, so it was back to the topic</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
