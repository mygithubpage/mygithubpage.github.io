            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.19" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Listen to part of a lecture in a <span class="underline">biology</span> class.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.35" data-time="5.19">[00:05.19]</span>Professor: Okay, so that's how the arctic ground <span class="underline">squirrel</span>'s able to cope in this <span class="underline">extreme</span> environment.<span class="time" data-times="7.89" data-time="11.54">[00:11.54]</span>Now let's talk about your reading <span class="underline">assignment</span>, about reindeer, also typically found in Siberia and other far northern regions.<span class="time" data-times="3.03" data-time="19.43">[00:19.43]</span>Who would like to start off? Yes, Mike?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.29" data-time="22.46">[00:22.46]</span>
              <span class="underline">Male</span> Student: Well, for one thing, they've got thick hair all over their body, <span class="underline">even</span> on their noses.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.12" data-time="26.75">[00:26.75]</span>Professor: Yes. They are very well <span class="underline">insulated</span>, and the thickness of their <span class="underline">fur</span> varies depending on the <span class="underline">season</span>. Good. Yes?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="11.39" data-time="34.87">[00:34.87]</span>
              <span class="underline">Female</span> Student: Um...newborn reindeer are very adult-like, like they can stand as soon as they're born, and by their <span class="underline">second</span> day they can already run as fast as a human.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.69" data-time="46.26">[00:46.26]</span>Professor: <span class="underline">Critical</span>. Food is very <span class="underline">scarce</span> in far north so reindeer herds have to cover lots of ground every day.<span class="time" data-times="5.97" data-time="53.95">[00:53.95]</span>And in the fall they might easily trek a thousand kilometers or more to get to their winter feeding site.<span class="time" data-times="4.12" data-time="59.92">[00:59.92]</span>So if you are a newborn you've got to get up to speed fast.<span class="time" data-times="2.72" data-time="64.04">[01:04.04]</span>Okay. Other adaptations?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.3" data-time="66.76">[01:06.76]</span>
              <span class="underline">Male</span> Student: Also reindeer don't have to keep their legs as warm as their main body, so they don't have to use up as much energy keeping them warm.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="11.38" data-time="74.06">[01:14.06]</span>Professor: Yes, so that means they can <span class="underline">allocate</span> less energy to heating their extremities and more energy to maintaining <span class="underline">stable</span> <span class="underline">temperature</span> in their body <span class="underline">core</span> where their <span class="underline">vital</span> organs are located.<span class="time" data-times="10.05" data-time="85.44">[01:25.44]</span>And you know I don't think it is mentioned in your textbook, but <span class="underline">even</span> different parts of a reindeer's leg are adapted for <span class="underline">optimal</span> cold weather performance.<span class="time" data-times="9.81" data-time="95.49">[01:35.49]</span>The fat in the <span class="underline">lower</span> part of their legs the part that gets coldest, that fat has a different chemical structure from the fat in the upper parts of the leg.<span class="time" data-times="7.17" data-time="105.3">[01:45.30]</span>So it doesn't get hard, <span class="underline">even</span> at temperatures down around freezing, it stays kind of gel-like, kind of oily.<span class="time" data-times="2.12" data-time="112.47">[01:52.47]</span>Okay, good.<span class="time" data-times="1.62" data-time="114.59">[01:54.59]</span>What about food?<span class="time" data-times="2.11" data-time="116.21">[01:56.21]</span>What do you remember about that?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.42" data-time="118.32">[01:58.32]</span>
              <span class="underline">Female</span> Student: Well, they are <span class="underline">pretty</span> <span class="underline">flexible</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.64" data-time="120.74">[02:00.74]</span>Professor: OK, can you explain that a little more?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.05" data-time="123.38">[02:03.38]</span>
              <span class="underline">Female</span> Student: Well, they can eat a lot of different kinds of plants, so that improves their chances of coming <span class="underline">across</span> something they can eat.<span class="time" data-times="6.46" data-time="130.43">[02:10.43]</span>I think they said that they found that the reindeer in one <span class="underline">herd</span> had eaten something like 37 different kinds of plants.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.52" data-time="136.89">[02:16.89]</span>Professor: OK, yes. You've really done your reading.<span class="time" data-times="7.96" data-time="140.41">[02:20.41]</span>And reindeer also eat a number of different plant <span class="underline">species</span> that most animals are not very interested in, which means?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.52" data-time="148.37">[02:28.37]</span>
              <span class="underline">Female</span> Student: They don't have a lot of competition when it comes to that food?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.11" data-time="151.89">[02:31.89]</span>Professor: That's right.<span class="time" data-times="3.83" data-time="153">[02:33.00]</span>In <span class="underline">particular</span>, your reading mentions lichens.<span class="time" data-times="7.17" data-time="156.83">[02:36.83]</span>Lichens are plants you'll find growing on rocks in the far north, sometimes referred to as reindeer <span class="underline">moss</span>.<span class="time" data-times="4.33" data-time="164">[02:44.00]</span>They look <span class="underline">pretty</span> <span class="underline">basic</span> you know, just a little <span class="underline">moss</span> on a rock.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.44" data-time="168.33">[02:48.33]</span>But lichens are actually quite <span class="underline">complex</span>.<span class="time" data-times="1.85" data-time="170.77">[02:50.77]</span>They are not just a single <span class="underline">organism</span>.<span class="time" data-times="8.68" data-time="172.62">[02:52.62]</span>They're actually kind of <span class="underline">combination</span> of some <span class="underline">sort</span> of <span class="underline">fungus</span> and some <span class="underline">sort</span> of <span class="underline">algae</span> that live together in a symbiotic relationship.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.94" data-time="181.3">[03:01.30]</span>Anyway...Okay, reindeer, um, oh, oh yes, and one more thing about lichens.<span class="time" data-times="7.85" data-time="187.24">[03:07.24]</span>They crank out a lot of chemicals, which is probably at <span class="underline">least</span> part of the <span class="underline">reason</span> why they are not considered all that tasty by most animals.<span class="time" data-times="4.19" data-time="195.09">[03:15.09]</span>Anyway, does anyone remember what your reading said about them?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.32" data-time="199.28">[03:19.28]</span>
              <span class="underline">Male</span> Student: Yeah, somehow when reindeer eat lichens they're able to <span class="underline">draw</span> a lot more nutrients from them than other animals.<span class="time" data-times="6.61" data-time="206.6">[03:26.60]</span>Like if a cow or a sheep eats lichens, they're only <span class="underline">gonna</span> get like half as much <span class="underline">nutrition</span> out of them as a reindeer would.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.22" data-time="213.21">[03:33.21]</span>Professor: That's right, and in winter, lichens are <span class="underline">crucial</span> for reindeer because their <span class="underline">supply</span> energy, but they don't have all the proteins and minerals the reindeer need.<span class="time" data-times="6.86" data-time="223.43">[03:43.43]</span>Um, so when reindeer get to the end of the long winter they are often very thin with low levels of minerals.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="14.67" data-time="230.29">[03:50.29]</span>In <span class="underline">spring</span> they have to eat different plants and <span class="underline">replenish</span> what they've lost over the winter, so what reindeer have done is they've developed the <span class="underline">ability</span> to <span class="underline">digest</span> different plants in different seasons by adjusting the microbes in their <span class="underline">digestive</span> systems.<span class="time" data-times="6.74" data-time="244.96">[04:04.96]</span>As you know microbes are micro-organisms like <span class="underline">bacteria</span> that help to <span class="underline">digest</span> or <span class="underline">break</span> down food.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.47" data-time="251.7">[04:11.70]</span>Well, what's interesting about reindeer is that they change the <span class="underline">proportion</span> of different microbes in their <span class="underline">digestive</span> system. <span class="time" data-times="13.44" data-time="259.17">[04:19.17]</span>So you, so the reindeer might have more one kind of <span class="underline">microbe</span> in winter to help <span class="underline">digest</span> plants it eats then; and in summer, it would have more another kind of <span class="underline">microbe</span> to help <span class="underline">digest</span> summer plants. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="272.61">[04:32.61]</span>That way, the reindeer get more <span class="underline">nutrition</span> out of different foods at different times of the year.</p>
