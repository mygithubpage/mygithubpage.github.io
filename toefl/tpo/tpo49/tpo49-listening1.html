The student's difficulties locating sources for a research project</p><p>B. The topic of the student's research project</p><p>C. The student's request to visit a particular part of the library</p><p>D. Procedures for requesting different editions of a book</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The student's first sentence "I need to get into special collections, in particular the british literature", through I need to indicate intention is to look at the library of books about British literature. Afterwards, the full text discusses whether students have authorization to teach and whether they can borrow these books. So the answer is C.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why is the student unable to use later editions or reproductions of a book he mentions?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The later editions contain errors.</p><p>B. Professor Gray specified the use of a particular edition.</p><p>C. The later editions must be requested from another library.</p><p>D. Reproductions typically omit the specific material he needs.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>Through the staff's question and student's answer, we can locate this question. The test center is a question and answer between teachers and students, and the answer we have to focus on. The student said that his project needs to use annotations in the literature, and these annotations are not reflected in the replicas and are cleaned up (clean up is equivalent to omit in the D option). So the answer is D.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why is the student reluctant to contact Professor Gray?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. He already has disturbed her several times during her time away from campus.</p><p>B. He does not feel comfortable about asking her for another favor.</p><p>C. He does not know her e-mail address.</p><p>D. He wants to surprise her with a completed project.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Like the previous question, it is through the questions and answers of teachers and students that lead to important test sites. The student said: I hope I can handle this instead of letting the professor help me, because the extra time before was already a great help for the professors. And now I think skating on thin ice with her. The expression of "skate on thin ice with her" here is very important. We must understand that, as we say in Chinese, we are walking on thin ice. Imagine that if the professor has helped you a favor and you haven't done it well, then you will ask her for her second help. Is this time like walking on thin ice and being frightened? It's best not to go find her. right? So this student is also the same psychology, so the answer chooses B (and then asks the professor to help the second busy time, the students will feel uncomfortable).</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the woman imply about the rules regarding Special Collections?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The rules are unfair to the students.</p><p>B. The rules are in place to protect the books.</p><p>C. The rules are determined by the professors.</p><p>D. The rules have changed since the previous semester.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Employee rejected the student again with the phrase "If we don't maintain our policies, they'll disintegrate", where the policies (policy policy) are equivalent to the rules of the B option. If we do not maintain our regulations, these documents will be damaged. So these rules are used to protect these literature books, so answer B.</p></div></div><div class="replay" id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the woman mean when she says this:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. She has been in a similar situation herself.</p><p>B. She will help the student solve his problem.</p><p>C. Shen has often heard this kind of story from students.</p><p>D. She thinks the student should try to understand her situation.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Everybody has special circumstances. Everyone has special circumstances. The implication is that you don't need to talk more, I hear more about your story. So the answer is C. I believe some students will have questions why not choose D? "Everyone has special circumstances. We can't have everyone on the net. Please understand us." Students with this kind of thinking must be sure to collect the brain hole. Do not overdo it. If D is right, the original word should be changed to "I understand, but sorry, we also have our special circumstance that the The policy cannot be changed." So the students, if the wrong option can't be ruled out, can try to think backwards, which is more conducive to grasping the trainees' thinking and enhancing the ability to identify options.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
