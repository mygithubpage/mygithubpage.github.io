You're still involved in that after-school program with the elementary kids?</p><p>(woman) Yeah, but I've got a problem. I am supposed to be driving a bunch of them to the zoo tomorrow.</p><p>(man) Yeah?</p><p>(woman) And I was supposed to rent a van for the trip. But I waited too long to call the rental agency to reserve one.</p><p>(man) Oh!</p><p>(woman) Now it turns out they don't have any vans available for tomorrow. I don't know what to do? These kids will be really disappointed if their trip gets cancelled.</p><p>(man) Hmmm, well, doesn't one of your friends on campus have a car? I mean, couldn't you borrow it for the day?</p><p>(woman) Yeah, probably, but I'd need to borrow two cars or there wouldn't be enough space for all the kids.</p><p>(man) Um, hum.</p><p>(woman) That's why I was going to rent the van. And then I'd need to find somebody else to drive, too. I can't drive two cars by myself.</p><p>(man) Yeah, that's true. Well, I am sure you can probably find a volunteer or if you wanted to save yourself the trouble of hunting down a second driver, what about public transportation? Check the bus schedule, I think there's a bus line that goes right past the zoo.</p><p>(woman) Yeah, that's a possibility, but I don't know, it might be a real challenge supervising the kids on the bus.</p><p>(man) Ha, ha...</p><p>(woman) Sometimes they are a handful when they get excited. It's an option, though.</p></article><section id="question"><h4>Question</h4><p>The speakers discuss two possible solutions to the woman's problem. Briefly summarize the problem then state which solution you recommend and explain why. </p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>Well, <b>the woman's problem is that she is supposed to drive a bunch of kids to the zoo tomorrow but she couldn't rent a van</b>. Accordingly, the man offers two solutions: she could perhaps borrow a car form one of her friends for the trip, or she could try public transportation instead. Well I think the woman should try public transportation for two reasons. Safety <b>would be the first reason of my recommendation.</b> The tour bus drivers are generally more experienced and professional especially when carrying a bunch of kids. All she needs to do is to focus on keeping the kids safe and cheered up, so it will be a lot easier and more manageable. Comparatively speaking, it's undoubtedly more dangerous for the woman to plan some self-driving trip, letting alone carrying a bunch of kids. Irresponsible, I'd say, if anything bad happens. All in all, I strongly recommend the public transportation as a better option.
