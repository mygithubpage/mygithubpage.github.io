Others believe it has had a negative influence on society. Which do you agree with and why? Use details and examples to explain your opinion.</p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>I think television has a positive influence on society. <b>1.</b> It's a good source of news. The members in the society can get news easily from News Channels and thus keep themselves informed of what's happening around. Like, my grandfather watches News on TV everyday just to keep up with the latest events. <b>2.</b> Beside television can be a kind of entertainment. People can watch different shows on TV such as funny talk shows and soap operas. I have many friends who like watching Late show with David Letterman and some other friends like watching TV series such as Lost and Friends. They all consider TV as a good way of relaxing themselves and of killing time. So, with the news and same TV programs, people in a society share a lot of things that they can talk about in any event. Therefore, society actually benefits from TV.</p></article><article class="response"><h4>My Response</h4><p>I agree with the idea that TV has a negative influence on society. Many children are additive to watching TV and they watch TV for a couple of hours every day. They don't go outside to play with others kids. They don't talk to anybody else. Sometimes they don't even get some rest. Children like this will forget to do their homework which make them do bad in school. Children like this will have speaking problem and they can't not build social skills. Children like this often has health problem. They might be overweight, because they don't move while they are watching TV. They might also suffer eye problem. many kids wear glasses in a very early age. Children are the future of our society. if they grow up like this because of TV, then TV surely has a negative influence on society.</p></article></div></main></body></html>
