The book influences me a lot because the story has something that touches my heart. The story talks about a man who wants to be a poet and who abandons many well-paying jobs to pursue his dream of being a poet. I have a similar experience of quitting a very good job in order to be a writer. Also, the man in the story is lack of money because he works as a bookstore assistant and thus has a very low salary. He lives in a shabby apartment and sometimes have no money to buy food. Again, I've got similar experience. I once lived in a cramped apartment alone and had no money. The book is important to me because it touches me and gives me encouragement to persist.</p></article><article class="response"><h4>My Response</h4><p>A book name C++ primer is a text book teach you how to develope program in C++ A programming language.
