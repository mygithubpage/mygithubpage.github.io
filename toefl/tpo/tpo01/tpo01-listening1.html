              <span class="time" data-times="2.4" data-time="42.68">[00:42.68]</span>Student: Aha, that's one thing I did know to do. <span class="time" data-times="5.9" data-time="45.08">[00:45.08]</span>I just copied an article, but I still need three more on my topic from three different journals.</p>

              <span class="time" data-times="2.64" data-time="50.98">[00:50.98]</span>Librarian: Let's get you going on looking for those then. <span class="time" data-times="5.35" data-time="53.62">[00:53.62]</span>We have printed versions of twenty or so <span class="underline">psychology</span> journals in the <span class="underline">Reference</span> <span class="underline">Section</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.97" data-time="58.97">[00:58.97]</span>These are the ones published <span class="underline">within</span> the last year. <span class="time" data-times="3.88" data-time="61.94">[01:01.94]</span>Then I think about it... there's a <span class="underline">journal</span> named Sleep and Dream.</p>

              <span class="time" data-times="5.59" data-time="65.82">[01:05.82]</span>Student: Oh, yeah, the article I just copied is from that <span class="underline">journal</span>, so I've got to look at other sources.</p>

              <span class="time" data-times="4.36" data-time="71.41">[01:11.41]</span>Librarian: Ok, actually, most of our materials are <span class="underline">available</span> electronically now. <span class="time" data-times="15.23" data-time="75.77">[01:15.77]</span>You can <span class="underline">access</span> <span class="underline">psychology</span> databases or electronic journals and articles <span class="underline">through</span> the library's computers, and if you want to search by title with the word 'dream' for example, just type it in and all the articles with 'dream' in the title will come up on the <span class="underline">screen</span>.</p>

I can't believe I didn't know that. <span class="time" data-times="6.91" data-time="106.55">[01:46.55]</span>It still sounds like it's going to take a while though, you know, going <span class="underline">through</span> all of that information, all of those sources.</p>

              <span class="time" data-times="6.84" data-time="113.46">[01:53.46]</span>Librarian: Maybe, but you already narrow your search down to articles on Dream Interpretation, so it shouldn't be too bad. <span class="time" data-times="6.67" data-time="120.3">[02:00.30]</span>And you probably notice that there's an <span class="underline">abstract</span> or <span class="underline">summary</span> at the top of the first page of the article you copied.<span class="time" data-times="12.52" data-time="126.97">[02:06.97]</span> When you go into the databases and electronic sources, you have the option to <span class="underline">display</span> the abstracts on the computer <span class="underline">screen</span>, skimming those to decide whether or not you want to read the whole article should cut down some time.</p>
            <p>
