To sign up for a seminar on using electronic sources for research</p><p>B. To report that a journal is missing from the reference area</p><p>C. To find out the procedure for checking out journal articles</p><p>D. To ask about how to look for resources for a class paper</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>Hear the librarian ask What can I do for you? It means that the answer to this question will appear later. The student said: I'm asked to do a literature review for my psychology course, but um...having a hard time finding articles. I don't even know where to start looking. Explaining her need to find references for her psychology thesis . There will be confusion here: C. But D is more in line with the original text. Excellent and excellent selection.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the librarian say about the availability of journals and articles in the library?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They are not easy to find if a professor put them on reserve</p><p>B. Most of them are accessible in an electronic format</p><p>C. Most of them can be checked out for three weeks</p><p>D. Printed versions from the past three years are located in the reference section</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The word "actually, most of our materials are available electronically now." appears in the available corresponding options. So the sentence is the answer. Although printed version was mentioned at 53 seconds, the "three years" in D is not exact.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the librarian suggest the student should do to save time?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Choose an easier research topic</p><p>B. Concentrate on five journals</p><p>C. Read the summaries of the articles first</p><p>D. Install a new program on her home computer</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>At 1 minute 47 seconds the student said: It still sounds like it's going to take a while though. Then the Librarian will discuss this issue. In the following, Librarian mentioned "narrow your search down to articles on dream interpretation", "the abstract or summary at the top of the first page", "have option to display the abstracts on the computer screen", that is to say, narrowing the scope, Then read the outline of each book and decide whether to read the book completely. At the end of librarian's words cut down some time (correspondence between the keyword and the question), the previous content is the answer.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What can be inferred about why the woman decides to use the computer in the library?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. She thinks she might need additional help from the man</p><p>B. She does not have a computer at home</p><p>C. She has to hand in her assignment by the end of the day</p><p>D. She will be meeting a friend in the library later on</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The student said: I guess I should try out the electronic search while I'm still here then, you know, just in case. The student mentioned that I would like to try the electronic search function here, just in case Librarian: Sure, er ... that computer's free over there, and I'll be here till five this afternoon. The librarian deliberately told the students what time he went to work. This means that students can come to him if they have problems before a few points. So control the answer: A.</p></div></div><div class="replay" id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the woman say this</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. She had forgotten about the information</p><p>B. She is surprised she was not aware of the information</p><p>C. She is annoyed that the information was published only recently</p><p>D. She is concerned that the librarian gave her incorrect information</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>It starts in about 30 seconds. The students mentioned that they could not get library information at home. But the librarian said: In fact, you can do it at home, blahblahblah, and the student said the sentence in the hard-of-hearing question. It can be seen that students are very surprised that they do not know this method.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
