I'd better write that down. <span class="time" data-times="4.88" data-time="19.48">[00:19.48]</span>Catalhoyuk, that's about as close as we get in English. <span class="time" data-times="1.75" data-time="24.36">[00:24.36]</span>It's Turkish, really. <span class="time" data-times="4.99" data-time="26.11">[00:26.11]</span>The sites in modern day <span class="highlight">Turkey</span>, and who knows what the <span class="highlight">original</span> inhabitants called it.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="12.92" data-time="31.1">[00:31.10]</span>Anyway, uh...Catalhoyuk wasn't the first agricultural <span class="highlight">settlement</span> in the near east, but it was <span class="highlight">pretty</span> early, settled about 9000 years ago in the <span class="highlight">Neolithic</span> period. <span class="time" data-times="9.15" data-time="44.02">[00:44.02]</span>And ... umm... the <span class="highlight">settlement</span>...ah...town really, lasted about a thousand years and grew to a size of about eight or ten thousand people. <span class="time" data-times="4.38" data-time="53.17">[00:53.17]</span>That certainly makes it one of the largest towns in the world at that time.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.45" data-time="57.55">[00:57.55]</span>One of the things that make the <span class="highlight">settlement</span> of this size <span class="highlight">impressive</span> is the time period. <span class="time" data-times="3.74" data-time="63">[01:03.00]</span>It's the <span class="highlight">Neolithic</span>, remember, the late Stone Age. <span class="time" data-times="3.84" data-time="66.74">[01:06.74]</span>So the people that lived there had only stone tools, no metals. <span class="time" data-times="8.86" data-time="70.58">[01:10.58]</span>So everything they <span class="highlight">accomplished</span>, like building this town, they did with just stone, plus wood, bricks, that <span class="highlight">sort</span> of thing.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.09" data-time="79.44">[01:19.44]</span>But you got to remember that it wasn't just any stone they had, they had <span class="highlight">obsidian</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.84" data-time="84.53">[01:24.53]</span>And umm... <span class="highlight">obsidian</span> is a black, <span class="highlight">volcanic</span>, well, almost like glass. <span class="time" data-times="4.21" data-time="91.37">[01:31.37]</span>It flakes very nicely into really sharp points. <span class="time" data-times="4.1" data-time="95.58">[01:35.58]</span>The sharpest tools of the entire Stone Age were made of <span class="highlight">obsidian</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.75" data-time="99.68">[01:39.68]</span>And urrr... the people of Catalhoyuk got theirs from further inland, from central <span class="highlight">Turkey</span>, traded for it, probably.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.07" data-time="108.43">[01:48.43]</span>Anyway, what I <span class="highlight">wanna</span><span class="highlight">focus</span> on is the way the town was built. <span class="time" data-times="5.1" data-time="112.5">[01:52.50]</span>The houses are all <span class="highlight">rectangular</span>, one storey made of sun dried bricks. <span class="time" data-times="10.09" data-time="117.6">[01:57.60]</span>But what's really interesting is that there are no spaces between them, no streets in other words, and so generally no doors on the houses either. <span class="time" data-times="7.07" data-time="127.69">[02:07.69]</span>People walked around on the roofs and entered the house <span class="highlight">through</span> a hatchway on the roof, down a wooden ladder. <span class="time" data-times="5.19" data-time="134.76">[02:14.76]</span>You can still see the <span class="highlight">diagonal</span> marks of the ladders in the <span class="highlight">plaster</span> on the inside walls.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.73" data-time="139.95">[02:19.95]</span>Once you were in the house, there would be one main room and a <span class="highlight">couple</span> of small rooms for <span class="highlight">storage</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.81" data-time="146.68">[02:26.68]</span>The main room had the hearths, for cooking and for heat. <span class="time" data-times="2.66" data-time="150.49">[02:30.49]</span>It would've been <span class="highlight">pretty</span> cold during the winters. <span class="time" data-times="4" data-time="153.15">[02:33.15]</span>And it also looks like they made their tools near the fire. <span class="time" data-times="6.4" data-time="157.15">[02:37.15]</span>There tends to be a lot of <span class="highlight">obsidian</span> flakes and chips in the <span class="highlight">hearth</span> ashes, but no chimney.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.21" data-time="163.55">[02:43.55]</span>The smoke just went out the same hatchway that people used for going in and out themselves. <span class="time" data-times="7" data-time="168.76">[02:48.76]</span>So there would have been an open fire inside the house with only one hole in the roof to let the smoke out. <span class="time" data-times="3.29" data-time="175.76">[02:55.76]</span>You and I would have found it a bit too smoky in there. <span class="time" data-times="4.51" data-time="179.05">[02:59.05]</span>You can see on the walls, which they plastered and decorated with paintings. <span class="time" data-times="4.98" data-time="183.56">[03:03.56]</span>They ended up with a <span class="highlight">layer</span> of black <span class="highlight">soot</span> on them, and so did people's lungs. <span class="time" data-times="5.13" data-time="188.54">[03:08.54]</span>The bones found in the graves show a <span class="highlight">layer</span> of <span class="highlight">soot</span> on the inside of the ribs. <span class="time" data-times="5.86" data-time="193.67">[03:13.67]</span>And that's another unusual feature of Catalhoyuk, the <span class="highlight">burial</span> sites.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.48" data-time="199.53">[03:19.53]</span>The graves have all been found under the houses, right under the floors. <span class="time" data-times="6.35" data-time="204.01">[03:24.01]</span>And it maybe this <span class="highlight">burial</span><span class="highlight">custom</span> that explains why the houses were <span class="highlight">packed</span> in so tightly without streets. <span class="time" data-times="8.73" data-time="210.36">[03:30.36]</span>I mean, you might think it was for protection or something, but there has been no <span class="highlight">evidence</span> found yet of any <span class="highlight">violent</span> attack that would <span class="highlight">indicate</span> that kind of danger. <span class="time" data-times="7.43" data-time="219.09">[03:39.09]</span>It maybe they <span class="highlight">wanted</span> to live as near as possible to their ancestors' graves and be buried near them themselves. <span class="time" data-times="1.92" data-time="226.52">[03:46.52]</span>But it makes a good point.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="9.99" data-time="228.44">[03:48.44]</span>Based on excavations, we can know the <span class="highlight">layout</span> of the houses and the location of the graves, but we're only guessing when we tried to say why they did it that way. <span class="time" data-times="2.12" data-time="238.43">[03:58.43]</span>That's the way it is with archeology. <span class="time" data-times="4.13" data-time="240.55">[04:00.55]</span>You are dealing with the <span class="highlight">physical</span> remains that people left behind. <span class="time" data-times="4.98" data-time="244.68">[04:04.68]</span>We have no sure <span class="highlight">access</span> to what they thought and how they felt about things. <span class="time" data-times="2.72" data-time="249.66">[04:09.66]</span>I mean it's interesting to <span class="highlight">speculate</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.27" data-time="252.38">[04:12.38]</span>And the <span class="highlight">physical</span> artifacts can give us clues, but there is a lot we can't really know.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.48" data-time="257.65">[04:17.65]</span>So, for <span class="highlight">instance</span>, their art. <span class="time" data-times="7.19" data-time="260.13">[04:20.13]</span>They painted on the plastered walls and usually they painted hunting scenes with wild animals in them. <span class="time" data-times="9.58" data-time="267.32">[04:27.32]</span>Now they did hunt and they also raised <span class="highlight">cereal</span> crops and kept sheep, but we don't know why so many of the paintings are of hunting scenes. <span class="time" data-times="3.97" data-time="276.9">[04:36.90]</span>Was it supposed to have <span class="highlight">religious</span> or magical <span class="highlight">significance</span>? <span class="time" data-times="3.53" data-time="280.87">[04:40.87]</span>That's the kind of thing we can only guess at based on clues. <span class="time" data-times="6.03" data-time="284.4">[04:44.40]</span>And hopefully, further <span class="highlight">excavation</span> of Catalhoyuk will <span class="highlight">yield</span> more clues. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="290.43">[04:50.43]</span>But we'll probably never know for sure.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div

They stood opposite one another across narrow streets</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="AC"><p>Interesting prompts the test center. When it comes to the absence of streets between houses, there are also people, so people go in and out of the houses through ladders. And there is a fire, but there is no chimney, smoke is also discharged from these passages.</p><p>People walked around on the roofs and entered the house through a hatchway on the roof, down a wooden ladder.</p><p>For the A option, enter from the roof.</p><p>2 minutes and 40 seconds</p><p>There tends to be a lot of obsidian flakes and chips in the hearth ashes, but no chimney.
