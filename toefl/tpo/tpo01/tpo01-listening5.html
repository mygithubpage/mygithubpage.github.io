              <span class="time" data-times="6" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in an archeology class.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.78" data-time="6">[00:06.00]</span>Professor: OK, we've been talking about early <span class="highlight">agriculture</span> in the near east. <span class="time" data-times="4.29" data-time="9.78">[00:09.78]</span>So let's <span class="highlight">concentrate</span> on one site and see what we can learn from it. <span class="time" data-times="2.5" data-time="14.07">[00:14.07]</span>Let's look at Catalhoyuk. <span class="time" data-times="2.91" data-time="16.57">[00:16.57]</span>Ah... I'd better write that down. <span class="time" data-times="4.88" data-time="19.48">[00:19.48]</span>Catalhoyuk, that's about as close as we get in English. <span class="time" data-times="1.75" data-time="24.36">[00:24.36]</span>It's Turkish, really. <span class="time" data-times="4.99" data-time="26.11">[00:26.11]</span>The sites in modern day <span class="highlight">Turkey</span>, and who knows what the <span class="highlight">original</span> inhabitants called it.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="12.92" data-time="31.1">[00:31.10]</span>Anyway, uh...Catalhoyuk wasn't the first agricultural <span class="highlight">settlement</span> in the near east, but it was <span class="highlight">pretty</span> early, settled about 9000 years ago in the <span class="highlight">Neolithic</span> period. <span class="time" data-times="9.15" data-time="44.02">[00:44.02]</span>And ... umm... the <span class="highlight">settlement</span>...ah...town really, lasted about a thousand years and grew to a size of about eight or ten thousand people. <span class="time" data-times="4.38" data-time="53.17">[00:53.17]</span>That certainly makes it one of the largest towns in the world at that time.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.45" data-time="57.55">[00:57.55]</span>One of the things that make the <span class="highlight">settlement</span> of this size <span class="highlight">impressive</span> is the time period. <span class="time" data-times="3.74" data-time="63">[01:03.00]</span>It's the <span class="highlight">Neolithic</span>, remember, the late Stone Age. <span class="time" data-times="3.84" data-time="66.74">[01:06.74]</span>So the people that lived there had only stone tools, no metals. <span class="time" data-times="8.86" data-time="70.58">[01:10.58]</span>So everything they <span class="highlight">accomplished</span>, like building this town, they did with just stone, plus wood, bricks, that <span class="highlight">sort</span> of thing.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.09" data-time="79.44">[01:19.44]</span>But you got to remember that it wasn't just any stone they had, they had <span class="highlight">obsidian</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.84" data-time="84.53">[01:24.53]</span>And umm... <span class="highlight">obsidian</span> is a black, <span class="highlight">volcanic</span>, well, almost like glass. <span class="time" data-times="4.21" data-time="91.37">[01:31.37]</span>It flakes very nicely into really sharp points. <span class="time" data-times="4.1" data-time="95.58">[01:35.58]</span>The sharpest tools of the entire Stone Age were made of <span class="highlight">obsidian</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.75" data-time="99.68">[01:39.68]</span>And urrr... the people of Catalhoyuk got theirs from further inland, from central <span class="highlight">Turkey</span>, traded for it, probably.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.07" data-time="108.43">[01:48.43]</span>Anyway, what I <span class="highlight">wanna</span> <span class="highlight">focus</span> on is the way the town was built. <span class="time" data-times="5.1" data-time="112.5">[01:52.50]</span>The houses are all <span class="highlight">rectangular</span>, one storey made of sun dried bricks. <span class="time" data-times="10.09" data-time="117.6">[01:57.60]</span>But what's really interesting is that there are no spaces between them, no streets in other words, and so generally no doors on the houses either. <span class="time" data-times="7.07" data-time="127.69">[02:07.69]</span>People walked around on the roofs and entered the house <span class="highlight">through</span> a hatchway on the roof, down a wooden ladder. <span class="time" data-times="5.19" data-time="134.76">[02:14.76]</span>You can still see the <span class="highlight">diagonal</span> marks of the ladders in the <span class="highlight">plaster</span> on the inside walls.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.73" data-time="139.95">[02:19.95]</span>Once you were in the house, there would be one main room and a <span class="highlight">couple</span> of small rooms for <span class="highlight">storage</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.81" data-time="146.68">[02:26.68]</span>The main room had the hearths, for cooking and for heat. <span class="time" data-times="2.66" data-time="150.49">[02:30.49]</span>It would've been <span class="highlight">pretty</span> cold during the winters. <span class="time" data-times="4" data-time="153.15">[02:33.15]</span>And it also looks like they made their tools near the fire. <span class="time" data-times="6.4" data-time="157.15">[02:37.15]</span>There tends to be a lot of <span class="highlight">obsidian</span> flakes and chips in the <span class="highlight">hearth</span> ashes, but no chimney.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.21" data-time="163.55">[02:43.55]</span>The smoke just went out the same hatchway that people used for going in and out themselves. <span class="time" data-times="7" data-time="168.76">[02:48.76]</span>So there would have been an open fire inside the house with only one hole in the roof to let the smoke out. <span class="time" data-times="3.29" data-time="175.76">[02:55.76]</span>You and I would have found it a bit too smoky in there. <span class="time" data-times="4.51" data-time="179.05">[02:59.05]</span>You can see on the walls, which they plastered and decorated with paintings. <span class="time" data-times="4.98" data-time="183.56">[03:03.56]</span>They ended up with a <span class="highlight">layer</span> of black <span class="highlight">soot</span> on them, and so did people's lungs. <span class="time" data-times="5.13" data-time="188.54">[03:08.54]</span>The bones found in the graves show a <span class="highlight">layer</span> of <span class="highlight">soot</span> on the inside of the ribs. <span class="time" data-times="5.86" data-time="193.67">[03:13.67]</span>And that's another unusual feature of Catalhoyuk, the <span class="highlight">burial</span> sites.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.48" data-time="199.53">[03:19.53]</span>The graves have all been found under the houses, right under the floors. <span class="time" data-times="6.35" data-time="204.01">[03:24.01]</span>And it maybe this <span class="highlight">burial</span> <span class="highlight">custom</span> that explains why the houses were <span class="highlight">packed</span> in so tightly without streets. <span class="time" data-times="8.73" data-time="210.36">[03:30.36]</span>I mean, you might think it was for protection or something, but there has been no <span class="highlight">evidence</span> found yet of any <span class="highlight">violent</span> attack that would <span class="highlight">indicate</span> that kind of danger. <span class="time" data-times="7.43" data-time="219.09">[03:39.09]</span>It maybe they <span class="highlight">wanted</span> to live as near as possible to their ancestors' graves and be buried near them themselves. <span class="time" data-times="1.92" data-time="226.52">[03:46.52]</span>But it makes a good point.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.99" data-time="228.44">[03:48.44]</span>Based on excavations, we can know the <span class="highlight">layout</span> of the houses and the location of the graves, but we're only guessing when we tried to say why they did it that way. <span class="time" data-times="2.12" data-time="238.43">[03:58.43]</span>That's the way it is with archeology. <span class="time" data-times="4.13" data-time="240.55">[04:00.55]</span>You are dealing with the <span class="highlight">physical</span> remains that people left behind. <span class="time" data-times="4.98" data-time="244.68">[04:04.68]</span>We have no sure <span class="highlight">access</span> to what they thought and how they felt about things. <span class="time" data-times="2.72" data-time="249.66">[04:09.66]</span>I mean it's interesting to <span class="highlight">speculate</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.27" data-time="252.38">[04:12.38]</span>And the <span class="highlight">physical</span> artifacts can give us clues, but there is a lot we can't really know.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.48" data-time="257.65">[04:17.65]</span>So, for <span class="highlight">instance</span>, their art. <span class="time" data-times="7.19" data-time="260.13">[04:20.13]</span>They painted on the plastered walls and usually they painted hunting scenes with wild animals in them. <span class="time" data-times="9.58" data-time="267.32">[04:27.32]</span>Now they did hunt and they also raised <span class="highlight">cereal</span> crops and kept sheep, but we don't know why so many of the paintings are of hunting scenes. <span class="time" data-times="3.97" data-time="276.9">[04:36.90]</span>Was it supposed to have <span class="highlight">religious</span> or magical <span class="highlight">significance</span>? <span class="time" data-times="3.53" data-time="280.87">[04:40.87]</span>That's the kind of thing we can only guess at based on clues. <span class="time" data-times="6.03" data-time="284.4">[04:44.40]</span>And hopefully, further <span class="highlight">excavation</span> of Catalhoyuk will <span class="highlight">yield</span> more clues. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="290.43">[04:50.43]</span>But we'll probably never know for sure.</p>
