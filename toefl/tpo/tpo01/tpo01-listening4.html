            <span class="time" data-times="6.88" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a conversation between a student and his professor.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.34" data-time="6.88">[00:06.88]</span>Professor: Hi Mathew, I'm glad you can come in today. <span class="time" data-times="5.03" data-time="10.22">[00:10.22]</span>You've been observing Mr. Grable's third-grade class for your approaches to education paper, right?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.93" data-time="15.25">[00:15.25]</span>Student: Hmmm, yes. <span class="time" data-times="5.2" data-time="17.18">[00:17.18]</span>I go over the Johnson Elementary School, you know, to watch Mr. Grable teach the children in class. <span class="time" data-times="4.41" data-time="22.38">[00:22.38]</span>It's been amazing, I mean, I'm just learning so much from just watching him. <span class="time" data-times="4.63" data-time="26.79">[00:26.79]</span>I'm so glad the classroom observations are a requirement for the education program. <span class="time" data-times="4.03" data-time="31.42">[00:31.42]</span>I mean it's like the best thing ever to prepare you to be a good teacher.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.33" data-time="35.45">[00:35.45]</span>Professor: Well, I'm glad to see you feel that way, Mathew. <span class="time" data-times="1.9" data-time="37.78">[00:37.78]</span>You know, that's the goal. <span class="time" data-times="8.96" data-time="39.68">[00:39.68]</span>So, I've been reading over your <span class="highlight">observation</span> notes and I'm quite interested in what's going on, in <span class="highlight">particular</span> what's the <span class="highlight">astronomy</span> unit he's been teaching.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.87" data-time="48.64">[00:48.64]</span>Student: The <span class="highlight">astronomy</span> unit?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.64" data-time="50.51">[00:50.51]</span>Professor: It seems that Mr. Grable has mastered the interdisciplinary <span class="highlight">approach</span> to teaching - the way we've been talking about in class.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="9.9" data-time="57.15">[00:57.15]</span>Student: Oh! OK, yeah, so like when he was teaching them <span class="highlight">astronomy</span>, he didn't just teach them the names of the planets, he used it as a way to teach <span class="highlight">mythology</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.44" data-time="67.05">[01:07.05]</span>Professor: Really! So, how did he do that?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="7.02" data-time="69.49">[01:09.49]</span>Student: Well, some of the students could already name the planets, but they didn't know that the names had any meaning - the stories behind them.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.47" data-time="76.51">[01:16.51]</span>Professor: So, he...</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.36" data-time="77.98">[01:17.98]</span>Student: He introduced Greek and Roman <span class="highlight">mythology</span> as a way of explaining. <span class="time" data-times="8.73" data-time="81.34">[01:21.34]</span>Like, you know, how like <span class="highlight">Jupiter</span>'s the biggest <span class="highlight">planet</span>, right, and how <span class="highlight">Jupiter</span> was the name of the king of the gods in Roman <span class="highlight">mythology</span>, right? <span class="time" data-times="8.9" data-time="90.07">[01:30.07]</span>So since <span class="highlight">Jupiter</span>, the <span class="highlight">planet</span>, is the largest <span class="highlight">planet</span> in our <span class="highlight">solar</span> system, it's like the king of the planets, like <span class="highlight">Jupiter</span> was the king of all the gods.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.48" data-time="98.97">[01:38.97]</span>Professor: Oh, Mathew, that's a great example.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="0.49" data-time="101.45">[01:41.45]</span>Student: Yeah! <span class="time" data-times="5.97" data-time="101.94">[01:41.94]</span>And each student chose a <span class="highlight">planet</span> and then did research on it to write a <span class="highlight">report</span> and make a <span class="highlight">presentation</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.47" data-time="107.91">[01:47.91]</span>They went to the library to do the research, then they made presentations about the <span class="highlight">planet</span> they chose.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="14.08" data-time="114.38">[01:54.38]</span>Professor: So, in one science unit, in which the <span class="highlight">focus</span> was <span class="highlight">astronomy</span>, the students also learned about the <span class="highlight">literature</span> of Greek and Roman <span class="highlight">mythology</span>, used research skills in the library, wrote a <span class="highlight">report</span> and practiced their <span class="highlight">oral</span> <span class="highlight">presentation</span> skills.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="9.54" data-time="128.46">[02:08.46]</span>Student: Exactly! He used this one topic to teach third-graders all that <span class="highlight">stuff</span> - how to use the books in the library, to write reports, and <span class="highlight">even</span> how to speak in public. <span class="time" data-times="1.91" data-time="138">[02:18.00]</span>Plus they had a great time doing it.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.41" data-time="139.91">[02:19.91]</span>Professor: You know, Mathew, this is just what we've been talking about in our class. <span class="time" data-times="2.86" data-time="144.32">[02:24.32]</span>I'm sure everyone can learn something from your experience. <span class="time" data-times="5.61" data-time="147.18">[02:27.18]</span>You know, Mathew, I'd love for you to talk about this <span class="highlight">astronomy</span> unit in class on Wednesday.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.85" data-time="152.79">[02:32.79]</span>Student: Really?! Hmmm... 'cause I don't really think I'll have any time to write my paper by then.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.5" data-time="158.64">[02:38.64]</span>Professor: Oh, you won't need to write anything new just yet. <span class="time" data-times="4.89" data-time="161.14">[02:41.14]</span>For Wednesday, use your class <span class="highlight">observation</span> notes and explain the things we've discussed today.</p>

              <p>Skills appear twice in the conversation. When students and professors repeatedly discuss interdisciplinary teaching methods used in Mr. Grable's third-year class, students can benefit a lot. You can exercise your ability to find information in the library, you can also exercise your ability to write papers, and you can also exercise your ability to speak in class. Therefore, students can acquire the ability to search, write and speak three aspects.</p>
