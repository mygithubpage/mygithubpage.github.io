              <span class="time" data-times="6.88" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a conversation between a student and his professor.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.34" data-time="6.88">[00:06.88]</span>Professor: Hi Mathew, I'm glad you can come in today. <span class="time" data-times="5.03" data-time="10.22">[00:10.22]</span>You've been observing Mr. Grable's third-grade class for your approaches to education paper, right?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.93" data-time="15.25">[00:15.25]</span>Student: Hmmm, yes. <span class="time" data-times="5.2" data-time="17.18">[00:17.18]</span>I go over the Johnson Elementary School, you know, to watch Mr. Grable teach the children in class. <span class="time" data-times="4.41" data-time="22.38">[00:22.38]</span>It's been amazing, I mean, I'm just learning so much from just watching him. <span class="time" data-times="4.63" data-time="26.79">[00:26.79]</span>I'm so glad the classroom observations are a requirement for the education program. <span class="time" data-times="4.03" data-time="31.42">[00:31.42]</span>I mean it's like the best thing ever to prepare you to be a good teacher.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.33" data-time="35.45">[00:35.45]</span>Professor: Well, I'm glad to see you feel that way, Mathew. <span class="time" data-times="1.9" data-time="37.78">[00:37.78]</span>You know, that's the goal. <span class="time" data-times="8.96" data-time="39.68">[00:39.68]</span>So, I've been reading over your <span class="underline">observation</span> notes and I'm quite interested in what's going on, in <span class="underline">particular</span> what's the <span class="underline">astronomy</span> unit he's been teaching.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.87" data-time="48.64">[00:48.64]</span>Student: The <span class="underline">astronomy</span> unit?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.64" data-time="50.51">[00:50.51]</span>Professor: It seems that Mr. Grable has mastered the interdisciplinary <span class="underline">approach</span> to teaching - the way we've been talking about in class.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.9" data-time="57.15">[00:57.15]</span>Student: Oh! OK, yeah, so like when he was teaching them <span class="underline">astronomy</span>, he didn't just teach them the names of the planets, he used it as a way to teach <span class="underline">mythology</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.44" data-time="67.05">[01:07.05]</span>Professor: Really! So, how did he do that?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.02" data-time="69.49">[01:09.49]</span>Student: Well, some of the students could already name the planets, but they didn't know that the names had any meaning - the stories behind them.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.47" data-time="76.51">[01:16.51]</span>Professor: So, he...</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.36" data-time="77.98">[01:17.98]</span>Student: He introduced Greek and Roman <span class="underline">mythology</span> as a way of explaining. <span class="time" data-times="8.73" data-time="81.34">[01:21.34]</span>Like, you know, how like <span class="underline">Jupiter</span>'s the biggest <span class="underline">planet</span>, right, and how <span class="underline">Jupiter</span> was the name of the king of the gods in Roman <span class="underline">mythology</span>, right? <span class="time" data-times="8.9" data-time="90.07">[01:30.07]</span>So since <span class="underline">Jupiter</span>, the <span class="underline">planet</span>, is the largest <span class="underline">planet</span> in our <span class="underline">solar</span> system, it's like the king of the planets, like <span class="underline">Jupiter</span> was the king of all the gods.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.48" data-time="98.97">[01:38.97]</span>Professor: Oh, Mathew, that's a great example.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="0.49" data-time="101.45">[01:41.45]</span>Student: Yeah! <span class="time" data-times="5.97" data-time="101.94">[01:41.94]</span>And each student chose a <span class="underline">planet</span> and then did research on it to write a <span class="underline">report</span> and make a <span class="underline">presentation</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.47" data-time="107.91">[01:47.91]</span>They went to the library to do the research, then they made presentations about the <span class="underline">planet</span> they chose.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="14.08" data-time="114.38">[01:54.38]</span>Professor: So, in one science unit, in which the <span class="underline">focus</span> was <span class="underline">astronomy</span>, the students also learned about the <span class="underline">literature</span> of Greek and Roman <span class="underline">mythology</span>, used research skills in the library, wrote a <span class="underline">report</span> and practiced their <span class="underline">oral</span> <span class="underline">presentation</span> skills.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.54" data-time="128.46">[02:08.46]</span>Student: Exactly! He used this one topic to teach third-graders all that <span class="underline">stuff</span> - how to use the books in the library, to write reports, and <span class="underline">even</span> how to speak in public. <span class="time" data-times="1.91" data-time="138">[02:18.00]</span>Plus they had a great time doing it.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.41" data-time="139.91">[02:19.91]</span>Professor: You know, Mathew, this is just what we've been talking about in our class. <span class="time" data-times="2.86" data-time="144.32">[02:24.32]</span>I'm sure everyone can learn something from your experience. <span class="time" data-times="5.61" data-time="147.18">[02:27.18]</span>You know, Mathew, I'd love for you to talk about this <span class="underline">astronomy</span> unit in class on Wednesday.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.85" data-time="152.79">[02:32.79]</span>Student: Really?! Hmmm... 'cause I don't really think I'll have any time to write my paper by then.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.5" data-time="158.64">[02:38.64]</span>Professor: Oh, you won't need to write anything new just yet. <span class="time" data-times="4.89" data-time="161.14">[02:41.14]</span>For Wednesday, use your class <span class="underline">observation</span> notes and explain the things we've discussed today.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="166.03">[02:46.03]</span>Student: Ok, that sounds all right.</p>
