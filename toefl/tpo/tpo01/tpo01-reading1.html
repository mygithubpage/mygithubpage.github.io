            <b>Groundwater</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>
            <span class="underline">Groundwater</span> is the word used to <span class="underline">describe</span> water that saturates the ground, filling all the <span class="underline">available</span> spaces. By far the most <span class="underline">abundant</span> type of <span class="underline">groundwater</span> is <span class="underline">meteoric</span> water; this is the <span class="underline">groundwater</span> that circulates as part of the water <span class="underline">cycle</span>. Ordinary <span class="underline">meteoric</span> water is water that has soaked into the ground from the surface, from <span class="underline">precipitation</span> (rain and snow) and from lakes and streams. There it remains, sometimes for long periods, before emerging at the surface again. At first thought it seems <span class="underline">incredible</span> that there can be enough <span class="underline">space</span> in the "<span class="underline">solid</span>" ground underfoot to hold all this water.</p>
          <p>The necessary <span class="underline">space</span> is there, however, in many forms. The commonest spaces are those among the particles-sand grains and tiny pebbles-of <span class="underline">loose</span>, <span class="underline">unconsolidated</span> sand and <span class="underline">gravel</span>. Beds of this <span class="underline">material</span>, out of sight <span class="underline">beneath</span> the soil, are <span class="underline">common</span>. They are found wherever fast rivers carrying loads of <span class="underline">coarse</span> <span class="underline">sediment</span> once flowed. For example, as the great ice sheets that covered North America during the last ice age steadily melted away, huge volumes of water flowed from them. The water was always laden with pebbles, <span class="underline">gravel</span>, and sand, known as <span class="underline">glacial</span> <span class="underline">outwash</span>, that was deposited as the flow slowed down.</p>
          <p>The same thing happens to this day, though on a smaller <span class="underline">scale</span>, wherever a sediment-laden river or <span class="underline">stream</span> emerges from a mountain <span class="underline">valley</span> onto <span class="underline">relatively</span> <span class="underline">flat</span> land, dropping its <span class="underline">load</span> as the <span class="underline">current</span> slows: the water usually spreads out fanwise, depositing the <span class="underline">sediment</span> in the form of a smooth, fan-shaped <span class="underline">slope</span>. Sediments are also dropped where a river slows on entering a lake or the sea, the deposited sediments are on a lake floor or the seafloor at first, but will be located inland at some future <span class="underline">date</span>, when the sea <span class="underline">level</span> falls or the land rises; such beds are sometimes thousands of meters thick.</p>
          <p>In <span class="underline">lowland</span> country almost any <span class="underline">spot</span> on the ground may overlie what was once the bed of a river that has since become buried by soil; if they are now below the water's upper surface (the water table), the gravels and sands of the <span class="underline">former</span> riverbed, and its sandbars, will be saturated with <span class="underline">groundwater</span>.</p>
          <p>So much for <span class="underline">unconsolidated</span> sediments. Consolidated (or cemented) sediments, too, <span class="underline">contain</span> millions of <span class="underline">minute</span> water-holding pores. This is because the gaps among the <span class="underline">original</span> grains are often not totally plugged with cementing chemicals; also, parts of the <span class="underline">original</span> grains may become dissolved by percolating <span class="underline">groundwater</span>, either while consolidation is taking place or at any time afterwards. The result is that sandstone, for example, can be as <span class="underline">porous</span> as the <span class="underline">loose</span> sand from which it was formed.</p>
          <p>Thus a <span class="underline">proportion</span> of the total <span class="underline">volume</span> of any <span class="underline">sediment</span>, <span class="underline">loose</span> or cemented, consists of empty <span class="underline">space</span>. Most <span class="underline">crystalline</span> rocks are much more <span class="underline">solid</span>; a <span class="underline">common</span> <span class="underline">exception</span> is basalt, a form of solidified <span class="underline">volcanic</span> <span class="underline">lava</span>, which is sometimes full of tiny bubbles that make it very <span class="underline">porous</span>.</p>
          <p>The <span class="underline">proportion</span> of empty <span class="underline">space</span> in a rock is known as its <span class="underline">porosity</span>. But note that <span class="underline">porosity</span> is not the same as permeability, which measures the <span class="underline">ease</span> with which water can flow <span class="underline">through</span> a <span class="underline">material</span>; this depends on the sizes of the <span class="underline">individual</span> cavities and the crevices linking them.</p>
          <p>Much of the water in a <span class="underline">sample</span> of water-saturated <span class="underline">sediment</span> or rock will <span class="underline">drain</span> from it if the <span class="underline">sample</span> is put in a <span class="underline">suitable</span> dry place. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>But some will <span class="underline">remain</span>, clinging to all <span class="underline">solid</span> surfaces. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>It is held there by the force of surface <span class="underline">tension</span> without which water would <span class="underline">drain</span> <span class="underline">instantly</span> from any wet surface, leaving it totally dry. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>The total <span class="underline">volume</span> of water in the saturated <span class="underline">sample</span> must <span class="underline">therefore</span> be thought of as consisting of water that can, and water that cannot, <span class="underline">drain</span> away. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p>
          <p>The <span class="underline">relative</span> <span class="underline">amount</span> of these two kinds of water varies greatly from one kind of rock or <span class="underline">sediment</span> to another, <span class="underline">even</span> though their porosities may be the same. What happens depends on <span class="underline">pore</span> size. If the pores are large, the water in them will exist as drops too heavy for surface <span class="underline">tension</span> to hold, and it will <span class="underline">drain</span> away; but if the pores are small enough, the water in them will exist as thin films, too light to <span class="underline">overcome</span> the force of surface <span class="underline">tension</span> holding them in place; then the water will be firmly held.</p>
