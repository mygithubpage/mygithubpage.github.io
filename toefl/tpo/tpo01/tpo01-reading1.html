          <h4 class="w3-center">Groundwater</h4>
          <p>
            <span class="highlight">Groundwater</span> is the word used to <span class="highlight">describe</span> water that saturates the ground, filling all the <span class="highlight">available</span> spaces. By far the most <span class="highlight">abundant</span> type of <span class="highlight">groundwater</span> is <span class="highlight">meteoric</span> water; this is the <span class="highlight">groundwater</span> that circulates as part of the water <span class="highlight">cycle</span>. Ordinary <span class="highlight">meteoric</span> water is water that has soaked into the ground from the surface, from <span class="highlight">precipitation</span> (rain and snow) and from lakes and streams. There it remains, sometimes for long periods, before emerging at the surface again. At first thought it seems <span class="highlight"><span class="question2">incredible</span></span> that there can be enough <span class="highlight">space</span> in the "<span class="highlight">solid</span>" ground underfoot to hold all this water.</p>
          <p>The necessary <span class="highlight">space</span> is there, however, in many forms. The commonest spaces are those among the particles-sand grains and tiny pebbles-of <span class="highlight">loose</span>, <span class="highlight">unconsolidated</span> sand and <span class="highlight">gravel</span>. Beds of this <span class="highlight">material</span>, <span class="question3">out of sight</span> <span class="highlight">beneath</span> the soil, are <span class="highlight">common</span>. They are found wherever fast rivers carrying loads of <span class="highlight">coarse</span> <span class="highlight">sediment</span> once flowed. For example, as the great ice sheets that covered North America during the last ice age steadily melted away, huge volumes of water flowed from them. The water was always laden with pebbles, <span class="highlight">gravel</span>, and sand, known as <span class="question5"><span class="highlight">glacial</span> <span class="highlight">outwash</span></span>, that was deposited as the flow slowed down.</p>
          <p>The same thing happens to this day, though on a smaller <span class="highlight">scale</span>, wherever a sediment-laden river or <span class="highlight">stream</span> emerges from a mountain <span class="highlight">valley</span> onto <span class="highlight">relatively</span> <span class="highlight">flat</span> land, dropping its <span class="highlight">load</span> as the <span class="highlight">current</span> slows: the water usually spreads out fanwise, depositing the <span class="highlight">sediment</span> in the form of a smooth, fan-shaped <span class="highlight">slope</span>. Sediments are also dropped where a river slows on entering a lake or the sea, the deposited sediments are on a lake floor or the seafloor at first, but will be located inland at some future <span class="highlight">date</span>, when the sea <span class="highlight">level</span> falls or the land rises; such beds are sometimes thousands of meters thick.</p>
          <p>In <span class="highlight">lowland</span> country almost any <span class="highlight">spot</span> on the ground may <span class="question7">overlie</span> what was once the bed of a river that has since become buried by soil; if they are now below the water's upper surface (the water table), the gravels and sands of the <span class="highlight">former</span> riverbed, and its sandbars, will be saturated with <span class="highlight">groundwater</span>.</p>
          <p><span class="question8">So much for</span> <span class="highlight">unconsolidated</span> sediments. Consolidated (or cemented) sediments, too, <span class="highlight">contain</span> millions of <span class="highlight">minute</span> water-holding pores. This is because the gaps among the <span class="highlight">original</span> grains are often not totally <span class="question9">plugged</span> with cementing chemicals; also, parts of the <span class="highlight">original</span> grains may become dissolved by percolating <span class="highlight">groundwater</span>, either while consolidation is taking place or at any time afterwards. The result is that sandstone, for example, can be as <span class="highlight">porous</span> as the <span class="highlight">loose</span> sand from which it was formed.</p>
          <p>Thus a <span class="highlight">proportion</span> of the total <span class="highlight">volume</span> of any <span class="highlight">sediment</span>, <span class="highlight">loose</span> or cemented, consists of empty <span class="highlight">space</span>. Most <span class="highlight">crystalline</span> rocks are much more <span class="highlight">solid</span>; a <span class="highlight">common</span> <span class="highlight">exception</span> is basalt, a form of solidified <span class="highlight">volcanic</span> <span class="highlight">lava</span>, which is sometimes full of tiny bubbles that make it very <span class="highlight">porous</span>.</p>
          <p>The <span class="highlight">proportion</span> of empty <span class="highlight">space</span> in a rock is known as its <span class="highlight">porosity</span>. But note that <span class="highlight">porosity</span> is not the same as permeability, which measures the <span class="highlight">ease</span> with which water can flow <span class="highlight">through</span> a <span class="highlight">material</span>; this depends on the sizes of the <span class="highlight">individual</span> cavities and the crevices linking them.</p>
          <p>Much of the water in a <span class="highlight">sample</span> of water-saturated <span class="highlight">sediment</span> or rock will <span class="highlight">drain</span> from it if the <span class="highlight">sample</span> is put in a <span class="highlight">suitable</span> dry place. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>But some will <span class="highlight">remain</span>, clinging to all <span class="highlight">solid</span> surfaces. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>It is held there by the force of surface <span class="highlight">tension</span> without which water would <span class="highlight">drain</span> <span class="highlight">instantly</span> from any wet surface, leaving it totally dry. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>The total <span class="highlight">volume</span> of water in the saturated <span class="highlight">sample</span> must <span class="highlight">therefore</span> be thought of as consisting of water that can, and water that cannot, <span class="highlight">drain</span> away. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p>
          <p>The <span class="highlight">relative</span> <span class="highlight">amount</span> of these two kinds of water varies greatly from one kind of rock or <span class="highlight">sediment</span> to another, <span class="highlight">even</span> though their porosities may be the same. What happens depends on <span class="highlight">pore</span> size. <span class="question12">If the pores are large, the water in them will exist as drops too heavy for surface <span class="highlight">tension</span> to hold, and it will <span class="highlight">drain</span> away; but if the pores are small enough, the water in them will exist as thin films, too light to <span class="highlight">overcome</span> the force of surface <span class="highlight">tension</span> holding them in place; then the water will be firmly held.</span></p>

              <p>C It has the ability to store large amounts of groundwater.</p>
              <p>D It absorbs most of the water from the river. According to the "ground that we walk on" to the last sentence of the paragraph "At first thought it seems<span class="question2">incredible</span>thatthere can be enough spacein the "solid" ground underfootto hold all this water." means: It is hard to imagine at the beginning that there is enough land under our feet. The space accommodates these waters.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Option B is wrong. The second sentence of the paragraph "By far the most abundant type of groundwater is meteoric water; this is the groundwater that circulates as part of the water cycle." means: The most abundant type of groundwater is now rainwater; these rainwaters enter the water cycle.

              <p>Option D is wrong.

              <p>Much of the ground is actually saturated with water.</p>
              <p>Mostly filled with water.</p>
              <p>A deposits of stored water have been spread by glaciers and are now spread by river streams.</p>
              <p>B. The water stored underground is on the sand and gravel base or in a solid sediment.</p>
              <p>When placed in a dry place, the size of the saturated rock void determines how much water is retained.</p>
              <p>Before D reappears, groundwater stays underground for a long time.</p>
              <p>E Like sandstone, basalt is a particularly porous crystalline rock.</p>
              <p>F. The base of loose sediments is usually located in inland locations that have been underwater. Option A, the second paragraph "For example, as the great ice sheets that covered ....." refers to being spread by the glaciers; the third paragraph "The same thing happens to this day, .....wherever asediment-laden river or streamemerges from a Mountain valley onto relatively flat land,...."</p>
              <p>Option B is correct. In the second paragraph, the necessary space is in the gap between the particles of sand and gravel; the second sentence of the fifth paragraph is "Consolidated (cemented) sediments, too, containing millions of minute water-holding pores."</p>
              <p>Option C is correct. In the last paragraph, "What happens depends on pore size." The last paragraph is also to solve the penultimate paragraph: What determines which part of the water is left behind and which part of the water is drained?</p>
              <p>Option D is wrong. This is a detail of the first paragraph.</p>
              <p>Option E is wrong. The original does not mention basalt and sandstone.</p>
              <p>Option F wrong, the original did not mention that the base of loose sediments is typically land that has been underwater.</p>
              <p>Therefore, the answer is: A, B, C;</p>
              <p>This is an illustrative article that focuses on the existence of groundwater.The first paragraph introduces the definition and source of groundwater and its relationship with the water cycle;</p>
              <p>The second paragraph describes that the most common place where groundwater occurs is the space between loose particles of sand and sand. These loose particles of sand and sand are usually present in the place where the turbulent river water carrying sediments has flown. For this reason, an example of an ice age is given. An example of the flow of sediments carried by glaciers.</p>
              <p>The third paragraph stated that current rivers and lakes will also carry such sediments, and they will flow from the valleys to the plains at a slower speed, so that sediments will settle there and form a smooth fan-shaped slope; sediments also enter the mouth of the river and enter the sea inlet. It will be precipitated as long as the water flow is slowed down, often on the bottom of the lake or on the seabed.</p>
              <p>In the fourth paragraph, the lowlands covered almost every riverbed covered with mud. The sand and gravel there was also filled with groundwater.</p>
