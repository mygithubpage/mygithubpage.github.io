            <b>The Origins of Theater</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>In seeking to <span class="underline">describe</span> the origins of theater, one must <span class="underline">rely</span> <span class="underline">primarily</span> on speculation, since there is little <span class="underline">concrete</span> <span class="underline">evidence</span> on which to <span class="underline">draw</span>. The most widely accepted <span class="underline">theory</span>, <span class="light">championed</span> by anthropologists in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, envisions theater as emerging out of <span class="underline">myth</span> and <span class="underline">ritual</span>. The <span class="underline">process</span> perceived by these anthropologists may be summarized <span class="underline">briefly</span>. During the early stages of its <span class="underline">development</span>, a society becomes <span class="underline">aware</span> of forces that <span class="underline">appear</span> to influence or control its food <span class="underline">supply</span> and well-being. Having little understanding of natural causes, it attributes both <span class="underline">desirable</span> and undesirable occurrences to supernatural or magical forces, and it searches for means to win the <span class="underline">favor</span> of these forces. Perceiving an <span class="underline">apparent</span> connection between certain actions performed by the group and the result it desires, the group repeats, refines and formalizes those actions into fixed ceremonies, or rituals.</p>
          <p>Stories (myths) may then grow up around a <span class="underline">ritual</span>. Frequently the myths include representatives of those supernatural forces that the rites <span class="underline">celebrate</span> or hope to influence. Performers may <span class="underline">wear</span> costumes and masks to <span class="underline">represent</span> the <span class="underline">mythical</span> characters or supernatural forces in the rituals or in accompanying celebrations. As a people becomes more <span class="underline">sophisticated</span>, its conceptions of supernatural forces and causal relationships may change. As a result, it may <span class="underline">abandon</span> or <span class="underline">modify</span> some rites. But the myths that have grown up around the rites may continue as part of the group's <span class="underline">oral</span> tradition and may <span class="underline">even</span> come to be acted out under conditions divorced from these rites. When this occurs, the first step has been taken toward theater as an <span class="underline">autonomous</span> <span class="underline">activity</span>, and thereafter entertainment and <span class="underline">aesthetic</span> values may <span class="underline">gradually</span> <span class="underline">replace</span> the <span class="underline">former</span> <span class="underline">mystical</span> and socially efficacious concerns.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A">
            </span>Although <span class="underline">origin</span> in <span class="underline">ritual</span> has long been the most <span class="underline">popular</span>, it is by no means the only <span class="underline">theory</span> about how the theater came into being. 
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>Storytelling has been proposed as one <span class="underline">alternative</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>Under this <span class="underline">theory</span>, relating and listening to stories are seen as <span class="underline">fundamental</span> human pleasures. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>Thus, the recalling of an event (a hunt, battle, or other <span class="underline">feat</span>) is elaborated <span class="underline">through</span> the <span class="underline">narrator</span>'s pantomime and impersonation and <span class="underline">eventually</span> <span class="underline">through</span> each role being assumed by a different person.</p>
          <p>A closely related <span class="underline">theory</span> sees theater as evolving out of dances that are <span class="underline">primarily</span> pantomimic, rhythmical or gymnastic, or from imitations of animal noises and sounds. <span class="underline">Admiration</span> for the performer's skill, virtuosity, and <span class="underline">grace</span> are seen as <span class="underline">motivation</span> for elaborating the activities into fully realized theatrical performances.</p>
          <p>In <span class="underline">addition</span> to exploring the possible antecedents of theater, scholars have also theorized about the motives that led people to develop theater. Why did theater develop, and why was it valued after it ceased to <span class="underline">fulfill</span> the <span class="underline">function</span> of <span class="underline">ritual</span>? Most answers fall back on the theories about the human <span class="underline">mind</span> and <span class="underline">basic</span> human needs. One, set forth by <span class="underline">Aristotle</span> in the fourth <span class="underline">century</span> B.C., sees humans as naturally imitative-as taking pleasure in imitating persons, things, and actions and in seeing such imitations. Another, <span class="underline">advanced</span> in the twentieth <span class="underline">century</span>, suggests that humans have a gift for <span class="underline">fantasy</span>, <span class="underline">through</span> which they seek to reshape reality into more satisfying forms than those encountered in daily life. Thus, <span class="underline">fantasy</span> or <span class="underline">fiction</span> (of which drama is one form) permits people to objectify their anxieties and fears, <span class="underline">confront</span> them, and <span class="underline">fulfill</span> their hopes in <span class="underline">fiction</span> if not fact. The theater, then, is one tool <span class="underline">whereby</span> people <span class="underline">define</span> and understand their world or <span class="underline">escape</span> from unpleasant realities.</p>
          <p>But neither the human imitative <span class="underline">instinct</span> nor a penchant for <span class="underline">fantasy</span> by itself leads to an <span class="underline">autonomous</span> theater. <span class="underline">Therefore</span>, <span class="underline">additional</span> explanations are needed. One necessary condition seems to be a <span class="underline">somewhat</span> detached view of human problems. For example, one sign of this condition is the <span class="underline">appearance</span> of the <span class="underline">comic</span> <span class="underline">vision</span>, since <span class="underline">comedy</span> requires <span class="underline">sufficient</span> detachment to view some deviations from social norms as <span class="underline">ridiculous</span> rather than as serious threats to the <span class="underline">welfare</span> of the entire group. Another condition that contributes to the <span class="underline">development</span> of <span class="underline">autonomous</span> theater is the <span class="underline">emergence</span> of the <span class="underline">aesthetic</span> <span class="underline">sense</span>. For example, some early societies ceased to <span class="underline">consider</span> certain rites <span class="underline">essential</span> to their well-being and abandoned them, <span class="underline">nevertheless</span>, they retained as parts of their <span class="underline">oral</span> tradition the myths that had grown up around the rites and admired them for their <span class="underline">artistic</span> qualities rather than for their <span class="underline">religious</span> usefulness.</p>
