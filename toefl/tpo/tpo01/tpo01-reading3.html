This rapid <span class="highlight">zone</span> of <span class="highlight">transition</span> is called the upper <span class="highlight">timberline</span> or tree <span class="highlight">line</span>. In many <span class="highlight">semiarid</span> areas there is also a <span class="highlight">lower</span><span class="highlight">timberline</span> where the forest passes into <span class="highlight">steppe</span> or <span class="highlight">desert</span> at its <span class="highlight">lower</span><span class="highlight">edge</span>, usually because of a <span class="highlight">lack</span> of <span class="highlight">moisture</span>.</p><p>The upper <span class="highlight">timberline</span>, like the snow <span class="highlight">line</span>, is highest in the tropics and lowest in the Polar Regions. It ranges from sea <span class="highlight">level</span> in the Polar Regions to 4,500 meters in the dry subtropics and 3,500-4,500 meters in the <span class="highlight">moist</span> tropics. <span class="highlight">Timberline</span> trees are <span class="highlight">normally</span> evergreens, suggesting that these have some <span class="highlight">advantage</span> over <span class="highlight">deciduous</span> trees (those that lose their leaves) in the <span class="highlight">extreme</span> environments of the upper <span class="highlight">timberline</span>. There are some areas, however, where <span class="highlight">broadleaf</span><span class="highlight">deciduous</span> trees form the <span class="highlight">timberline</span>. <span class="highlight">Species</span> of <span class="highlight">birch</span>, for example, may <span class="highlight">occur</span> at the <span class="highlight">timberline</span> in parts of the Himalayas.</p><p>At the upper <span class="highlight">timberline</span> the trees begin to become twisted and deformed. This is particularly true for trees in the middle and upper latitudes, which <span class="highlight">tend</span> to <span class="highlight"><span class="question5">attain</span></span> greater heights on ridges, whereas in the tropics the trees <span class="highlight">reach</span> their greater heights in the valleys. This is because middle- and upper- <span class="highlight">latitude</span> timberlines are strongly influenced by the <span class="highlight">duration</span> and depth of the snow cover. As the snow is deeper and lasts longer in the valleys, trees <span class="highlight">tend</span> to <span class="highlight">attain</span> greater heights on the ridges, <span class="highlight">even</span> though <span class="question6">they</span> are more <span class="highlight">exposed</span> to high-velocity winds and poor, thin soils there. In the tropics, the valleys <span class="highlight">appear</span> to be more <span class="highlight">favorable</span> because they are less <span class="highlight"><span class="question7">prone</span></span> to dry out, they have less <span class="highlight">frost</span>, and they have deeper soils.</p><p>There is still no universally agreed-on explanation for why there should be such a <span class="highlight">dramatic</span> cessation of tree growth at the upper <span class="highlight">timberline</span>. Various <span class="highlight">environmental</span> factors may play a role. Too much snow, for example, can <span class="highlight">smother</span> trees, and avalanches and snow <span class="highlight">creep</span> can damage or destroy them. Late-lying snow reduces the <span class="highlight">effective</span> growing <span class="highlight">season</span> to the point where seedlings cannot <span class="highlight">establish</span> themselves. <span class="question9">Wind <span class="highlight">velocity</span> also increases with <span class="highlight">altitude</span> and may cause serious <span class="highlight">stress</span> for trees, as is made <span class="highlight">evident</span> by the deformed shapes at high altitudes.</span> Some scientists have proposed that the presence of increasing levels of <span class="highlight">ultraviolet</span> light with <span class="highlight">elevation</span> may play a role, while browsing and <span class="highlight">grazing</span> animals like the ibex may be another contributing <span class="highlight">factor</span>. Probably the most important <span class="highlight">environmental</span><span class="highlight">factor</span> is <span class="highlight">temperature</span>, for if the growing <span class="highlight">season</span> is too short and temperatures are too low, tree shoots and buds cannot <span class="highlight">mature</span><span class="highlight">sufficiently</span> to <span class="highlight">survive</span> the winter months.</p><p>Above the tree <span class="highlight">line</span> there is a <span class="highlight">zone</span> that is generally called <span class="highlight">alpine</span><span class="highlight">tundra</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>Immediately <span class="highlight">adjacent</span> to the <span class="highlight">timberline</span>, the <span class="highlight">tundra</span> consists of a <span class="highlight">fairly</span> complete cover of <span class="highlight">low-lying</span> shrubs, herbs, 
and grasses, while higher up the number and <span class="highlight">diversity</span> of <span class="highlight">species</span><span class="highlight">decrease</span> until there is much <span class="highlight">bare</span> ground with <span class="highlight">occasional</span> mosses and lichens and some prostrate <span class="highlight">cushion</span> plants. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>Some plants can <span class="highlight">even</span><span class="highlight">survive</span> in <span class="highlight">favorable</span> microhabitats above the snow <span class="highlight">line</span>. 
The highest plants in the world <span class="highlight">occur</span> at around 6,100 meters on Makalu in the Himalayas. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>At this great height, rocks, warmed by the sun, <span class="highlight">melt</span> small snowdrifts. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p><p>The most <span class="highlight">striking</span><span class="highlight">characteristic</span> of the plants of the <span class="highlight">alpine</span><span class="highlight">zone</span> is their low growth form. This enables them to <span class="highlight">avoid</span> the worst rigors of high winds and permits them to make use of the higher temperatures immediately <span class="highlight">adjacent</span> to the ground surface. In an area where low temperatures are limiting to life, the importance of the <span class="highlight">additional</span> heat near the surface is <span class="highlight">crucial</span>. The low growth form can also <span class="highlight">permit</span> the plants to take <span class="highlight">advantage</span> of the <span class="highlight">insulation</span> provided by a winter snow cover. In the <span class="highlight">equatorial</span> mountains the low growth form is less <span class="highlight"><span class="question11">prevalent</span></span>.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">dramatic</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. gradual</p><p>B. complex</p><p>C. visible</p><p>D. striking</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>"dramatic: Dramatic, dramatic, the drama can be thought of in terms of the drama itself, so this should be the adjective of the drama. A is gradual; B is complex; C is visible; D is significant, prominent, amazing According to the word meaning, the correct answer is D.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Where is the lower timberline mentioned in paragraph 1 likely to be found?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

On a mountain that has on upper timberline.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>Targeting the lower timberline to the last sentence of this paragraph, there is a lower timberline due to a lack of moisture, lack of humidity, and no water in the A option.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the following can be inferred from paragraph 1 about both the upper and lower timberlines?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Both are treeless zones.</p><p>B. Both mark forest boundaries.</p><p>C. Both are surrounded by desert areas.</p><p>D. Both suffer from a lack of moisture.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>"We used upper timberline and lower timberline as the key words to locate the last sentence of this paragraph. Whether the upper timberline or the lower timberline is a rapid transition zone, the tree is still there. It is only a transition to the steppe, so A is wrong. Since it is a transition, that is, a boundary, B does not say, C does not say, only the lower timberline lacks water, and the upper timberline does not say that there is a lack of water, so D is wrong."</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Paragraph 2 supports which of the following statements about deciduous trees?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They cannot grow in cold climates.</p><p>B. They do not exist at the upper timberline.</p><p>C. They are less likely than evergreens to survive at the upper timberline.</p><p>D. They do not require as much moisture as evergreens do.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>According to the fourth sentence, the timberline is composed of deciduous trees. Therefore, there are deciduous trees on the timberline, so options A and B are contrary. The D term moisture did not say originally. The third sentence says that the timberline is usually composed of evergreen trees. The fourth sentence says that sometimes deciduous trees appear, so the evergreen tree has a higher probability than deciduous trees, so C is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">attain</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. require</p><p>B. resist</p><p>C. achieve</p><p>D. endure</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>"attain: get.

A is adaptation; B is very likely; C is difficult; D is resistant. According to the word meaning, B is the correct answer. Corresponding to the original: In the tropics, the valleys appear to be more favorable because they are less <span class="question7">prone</span> to dry out, they have less frost, and they have deeper soils. The original text says that the valleys in the tropics are more conducive to growth because there Cognac, more favorable growth is not easy to do, of course, C and D are all capable of doing, so it is not right, A adaptation is not reliable, so B is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 3, which of the following is true of trees in the middle and upper latitudes?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Tree growth is negatively affected by the snow cover in valleys</p><p>B. Tree growth is greater in valleys than on ridges.</p><p>C. Tree growth on ridges is not affected by high-velocity winds.</p><p>D. Tree growth lasts longer in those latitudes than it does in the tropics.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The middle and upper latitudes are targeted to the third and fourth sentences of the original text. It is said that the trees in the middle and high latitudes are affected to a great extent by the duration and depth of the snow cover. The snow is deep in the valley and the time is long. Not growing well, so it is negatively affected, options B and C are contrary to the original, and D is not mentioned in the original comparison.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best express the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? In correct choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Because of their deformed shapes at high altitudes, trees are not likely to be seriously harmed by the strong winds typical of those altitudes.</p><p>B. As altitude increases, the velocity of winds increase, leading to a serious decrease in the number of trees found at high altitudes.</p><p>C. The deformed shapes of trees at high altitudes show that wind velocity, which increase with altitude, can cause serious hardship for trees.</p><p>D. Increased wind velocity at high altitudes deforms the shapes of trees, and this may cause serious stress for trees.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>"The original sentence said that the wind speed increased and will put a lot of pressure on the trees. It has been confirmed by blablabla. C is a faithful rewrite of the original sentence, so C is correct. A's causality does not exist in the original, wrong; B's decrease in the number does not speak, wrong D made the original non-main components become the main components, which changed the structure of the original text and made mistakes."</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>In paragraph 4, what is the author's main purpose in the discussion of the dramatic cessation of tree growth at the upper timberline?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.
