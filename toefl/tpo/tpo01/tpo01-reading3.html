            <b>Timberline Vegetation on Mountains</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>The <span class="underline">transition</span> from forest to treeless <span class="underline">tundra</span> on a mountain <span class="underline">slope</span> is often a <span class="light"><span class="underline">dramatic</span></span> one. <span class="underline">Within</span> a <span class="underline">vertical</span> distance of just a few tens of meters, trees disappear as a life-form and are replaced by low shrubs, herbs, and grasses. This rapid <span class="underline">zone</span> of <span class="underline">transition</span> is called the upper <span class="underline">timberline</span> or tree <span class="underline">line</span>. In many <span class="underline">semiarid</span> areas there is also a <span class="underline">lower</span> <span class="underline">timberline</span> where the forest passes into <span class="underline">steppe</span> or <span class="underline">desert</span> at its <span class="underline">lower</span> <span class="underline">edge</span>, usually because of a <span class="underline">lack</span> of <span class="underline">moisture</span>.</p>
          <p>The upper <span class="underline">timberline</span>, like the snow <span class="underline">line</span>, is highest in the tropics and lowest in the Polar Regions. It ranges from sea <span class="underline">level</span> in the Polar Regions to 4,500 meters in the dry subtropics and 3,500-4,500 meters in the <span class="underline">moist</span> tropics. <span class="underline">Timberline</span> trees are <span class="underline">normally</span> evergreens, suggesting that these have some <span class="underline">advantage</span> over <span class="underline">deciduous</span> trees (those that lose their leaves) in the <span class="underline">extreme</span> environments of the upper <span class="underline">timberline</span>. There are some areas, however, where <span class="underline">broadleaf</span> <span class="underline">deciduous</span> trees form the <span class="underline">timberline</span>. <span class="underline">Species</span> of <span class="underline">birch</span>, for example, may <span class="underline">occur</span> at the <span class="underline">timberline</span> in parts of the Himalayas.</p>
          <p>At the upper <span class="underline">timberline</span> the trees begin to become twisted and deformed. This is particularly true for trees in the middle and upper latitudes, which <span class="underline">tend</span> to <span class="underline">attain</span> greater heights on ridges, whereas in the tropics the trees <span class="underline">reach</span> their greater heights in the valleys. This is because middle- and upper- <span class="underline">latitude</span> timberlines are strongly influenced by the <span class="underline">duration</span> and depth of the snow cover. As the snow is deeper and lasts longer in the valleys, trees <span class="underline">tend</span> to <span class="underline">attain</span> greater heights on the ridges, <span class="underline">even</span> though they are more <span class="underline">exposed</span> to high-velocity winds and poor, thin soils there. In the tropics, the valleys <span class="underline">appear</span> to be more <span class="underline">favorable</span> because they are less <span class="underline">prone</span> to dry out, they have less <span class="underline">frost</span>, and they have deeper soils.</p>
          <p>There is still no universally agreed-on explanation for why there should be such a <span class="underline">dramatic</span> cessation of tree growth at the upper <span class="underline">timberline</span>. Various <span class="underline">environmental</span> factors may play a role. Too much snow, for example, can <span class="underline">smother</span> trees, and avalanches and snow <span class="underline">creep</span> can damage or destroy them. Late-lying snow reduces the <span class="underline">effective</span> growing <span class="underline">season</span> to the point where seedlings cannot <span class="underline">establish</span> themselves. Wind <span class="underline">velocity</span> also increases with <span class="underline">altitude</span> and may cause serious <span class="underline">stress</span> for trees, as is made <span class="underline">evident</span> by the deformed shapes at high altitudes. Some scientists have proposed that the presence of increasing levels of <span class="underline">ultraviolet</span> light with <span class="underline">elevation</span> may play a role, while browsing and <span class="underline">grazing</span> animals like the ibex may be another contributing <span class="underline">factor</span>. Probably the most important <span class="underline">environmental</span> <span class="underline">factor</span> is <span class="underline">temperature</span>, for if the growing <span class="underline">season</span> is too short and temperatures are too low, tree shoots and buds cannot <span class="underline">mature</span> <span class="underline">sufficiently</span> to <span class="underline">survive</span> the winter months.</p>
          <p>Above the tree <span class="underline">line</span> there is a <span class="underline">zone</span> that is generally called <span class="underline">alpine</span> <span class="underline">tundra</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>Immediately <span class="underline">adjacent</span> to the <span class="underline">timberline</span>, the <span class="underline">tundra</span> consists of a <span class="underline">fairly</span> complete cover of <span class="underline">low-lying</span> shrubs, herbs, 
and grasses, while higher up the number and <span class="underline">diversity</span> of <span class="underline">species</span> <span class="underline">decrease</span> until there is much <span class="underline">bare</span> ground with <span class="underline">occasional</span> mosses and lichens and some prostrate <span class="underline">cushion</span> plants. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>Some plants can <span class="underline">even</span> <span class="underline">survive</span> in <span class="underline">favorable</span> microhabitats above the snow <span class="underline">line</span>. 
The highest plants in the world <span class="underline">occur</span> at around 6,100 meters on Makalu in the Himalayas. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>At this great height, rocks, warmed by the sun, <span class="underline">melt</span> small snowdrifts. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p>
          <p>The most <span class="underline">striking</span> <span class="underline">characteristic</span> of the plants of the <span class="underline">alpine</span> <span class="underline">zone</span> is their low growth form. This enables them to <span class="underline">avoid</span> the worst rigors of high winds and permits them to make use of the higher temperatures immediately <span class="underline">adjacent</span> to the ground surface. In an area where low temperatures are limiting to life, the importance of the <span class="underline">additional</span> heat near the surface is <span class="underline">crucial</span>. The low growth form can also <span class="underline">permit</span> the plants to take <span class="underline">advantage</span> of the <span class="underline">insulation</span> provided by a winter snow cover. In the <span class="underline">equatorial</span> mountains the low growth form is less <span class="underline">prevalent</span>.</p>
