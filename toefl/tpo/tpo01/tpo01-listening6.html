The types of habitats marmots prefer</p><p>B. Methods of observing marmot behavior</p><p>C. Feeding habits of some marmot species</p><p>D. Differences in behavior between marmot species</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>You today had discussions about how animal animals were behaviorally adapted to their environments. Compare two marmot behavioral habits. Subjective questions usually look at the beginning. Professors talk about how animals' behavior adapts to the environment. They specifically test the behavior of two kinds of prairie dogs and compare Contrast. The conclusion of the article also shows that the behavior of the two prairie dogs is not the same because the environment is not same.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the case study, why are marmots ideal for observation</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They do not hide from humans</p><p>B. They reside in many regions throughout North America</p><p>C. They are active in open areas during the day</p><p>D. Their burrows are easy to locate</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>When the middle school student answers the professor's question, he says: Well, when they are not hibernating, you can find them in open areas. And they are pretty active during the day, which makes them easy to observe, right? The professor gave a positive answer.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What reason does the professor give for the difference in marmot behaviour patterns?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Type of food available</p><p>B. The size of the population</p><p>C. Interaction with other marmot species</p><p>D. Adaptations to the climate</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>Focus on causal logic. Since prompted the test sites, because the climate is good, the climate conditions on the mountains are not so harsh, because of the climate, so their social behavior is different from the eastern prairie dogs.</p></div></div><div class="replay" id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor say this</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To inform the student that his definition is incorrect</p><p>B. To suggest that the student did not do the reading</p><p>C. To encourage the student to try again</p><p>D. To change the topic of discussion</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>Listen to the content to locate the context. When the students did not understand the meaning of the growing season after reading the book at first, they thought they understood and felt that the time needed for growth was five months. But the professor said, sorry, not so. Regardless of what the student mentioned, the growing season is not the time needed for the prairie dogs to grow but the time to get food.</p></div></div><div class="replay" id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor say this</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To express a similar concern</p><p>B. To encourage the student to explain what she means</p><p>C. To address the student's concern</p><p>D. To agree with the student</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The student had previously thought that the 6 weeks were too short and the pups might not have been able to live independently. To explain this doubt, the professor emphasized that these six-week-old pups are well prepared.
