            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.1" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in a <span class="underline">biology</span> class.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.44" data-time="5.1">[00:05.10]</span>Professor: For today's discussion, we'll <span class="underline">review</span> the case study on how some animals have behaviorally adapted to their environments. <span class="time" data-times="5.44" data-time="12.54">[00:12.54]</span>Now you had to read about two animal <span class="underline">species</span>, the Eastern marmot and the Olympic marmot.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.7" data-time="17.98">[00:17.98]</span>Marmots are rodents. <span class="time" data-times="3.52" data-time="19.68">[00:19.68]</span>They are large ground squirrels, about the size of an <span class="underline">average</span> house cat. <span class="time" data-times="2.2" data-time="23.2">[00:23.20]</span>And they live in a <span class="underline">variety</span> of habitats. <span class="time" data-times="10.25" data-time="25.4">[00:25.40]</span>And <span class="underline">even</span> though they spend the <span class="underline">significant</span> <span class="underline">portion</span> of the year hibernating, according to this case study, marmots are still considered excellent subjects for animal <span class="underline">behavioral</span> studies. <span class="time" data-times="1.31" data-time="35.65">[00:35.65]</span>Why is that?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.92" data-time="36.96">[00:36.96]</span>Student: Well, when they are not hibernating, you can find them in open areas. <span class="time" data-times="4.14" data-time="41.88">[00:41.88]</span>And they are <span class="underline">pretty</span> active during the day, which makes them easy to <span class="underline">observe</span>, right?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.49" data-time="46.02">[00:46.02]</span>Professor: Uh-ha, so first let's discuss the Eastern marmots. <span class="time" data-times="11.28" data-time="50.51">[00:50.51]</span>They <span class="underline">reside</span> <span class="underline">throughout</span> the eastern <span class="underline">region</span> of North America where there is a <span class="underline">temperate</span> <span class="underline">climate</span>, where the growing <span class="underline">season</span> lasts for at <span class="underline">least</span> five months of the year, which is when they do all their mating, playing and eating.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.16" data-time="61.79">[01:01.79]</span>Student: Oh, I see. <span class="time" data-times="5.43" data-time="62.95">[01:02.95]</span>At first I wasn't sure what growing <span class="underline">season</span> meant, just from the reading, but now I get it. <span class="time" data-times="2.96" data-time="68.38">[01:08.38]</span>It's the <span class="underline">amount</span> of time it takes for them to grow, right? <span class="time" data-times="2.04" data-time="71.34">[01:11.34]</span>So it would be five months?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.82" data-time="73.38">[01:13.38]</span>Professor: Umm? Oh, uh... I'm sorry but no. <span class="time" data-times="1.48" data-time="76.2">[01:16.20]</span>It has nothing to do with that. <span class="time" data-times="3.56" data-time="77.68">[01:17.68]</span>It's not about the time it takes for Eastern marmots to grow. <span class="time" data-times="2.29" data-time="81.24">[01:21.24]</span>It's when the food is <span class="underline">available</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9.73" data-time="83.53">[01:23.53]</span>That is when it's not covered in snow and there is no <span class="underline">frost</span> covering the grass and, umm, <span class="underline">vegetative</span> parts of a plant's herbs and the flowers the marmots like to eat. <span class="time" data-times="5.15" data-time="93.26">[01:33.26]</span>So growing <span class="underline">season</span> refers to the <span class="underline">availability</span> of the food they eat, OK? <span class="time" data-times="4.87" data-time="98.41">[01:38.41]</span>So now how would you <span class="underline">describe</span> the Eastern marmots' social habits?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.43" data-time="103.28">[01:43.28]</span>Student: Well, they are really <span class="underline">territorial</span>, and loners, and just so <span class="underline">aggressive</span> <span class="underline">even</span> with other Eastern marmots. <span class="time" data-times="3.8" data-time="111.71">[01:51.71]</span>And their mating <span class="underline">ritual</span> is just so <span class="underline">impersonal</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.62" data-time="115.51">[01:55.51]</span>Professor: Uh-ha? Now when they <span class="underline">emerge</span> in the <span class="underline">spring</span> from <span class="underline">hibernation</span>, the mating <span class="underline">process</span> begins. <span class="time" data-times="5.03" data-time="122.13">[02:02.13]</span>For them, well, they come together to <span class="underline">mate</span> and then they go their <span class="underline">separate</span> ways. <span class="time" data-times="4.62" data-time="127.16">[02:07.16]</span>Then about six to eight weeks after birth, the <span class="underline">offspring</span> leave their mothers.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.39" data-time="131.78">[02:11.78]</span>Student: Really? Just six weeks? <span class="time" data-times="3.97" data-time="134.17">[02:14.17]</span>Is that possible for the <span class="underline">offspring</span> to make it on their own so young?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.01" data-time="138.14">[02:18.14]</span>Professor: Well, it's not as if they aren't ready for the real world because they are. <span class="time" data-times="3.19" data-time="143.15">[02:23.15]</span>Remember, they <span class="underline">mature</span> quickly and the weather's nice. <span class="time" data-times="3.92" data-time="146.34">[02:26.34]</span>Also they live in open fields where there is lots of <span class="underline">edible</span> <span class="underline">vegetation</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.72" data-time="150.26">[02:30.26]</span>So <span class="underline">roughly</span> six weeks after birth, Eastern marmots are just old enough to take their chances of surviving in the <span class="underline">temperate</span> environment. <span class="time" data-times="4.08" data-time="157.98">[02:37.98]</span>So how does this <span class="underline">relate</span> to their <span class="underline">behavior</span>?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.32" data-time="162.06">[02:42.06]</span>Student: Oh, I get it. <span class="time" data-times="9.53" data-time="164.38">[02:44.38]</span>Since the <span class="underline">climate</span>'s not too bad, the Eastern marmots don't have to <span class="underline">rely</span> on each other too much and they really don't need to stay together as a family to <span class="underline">survive</span> either.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="0.88" data-time="173.91">[02:53.91]</span>Professor: Uh-ha. <span class="time" data-times="2.94" data-time="174.79">[02:54.79]</span>Any <span class="underline">contrast</span>, the Olympic marmots? <span class="time" data-times="1.54" data-time="177.73">[02:57.73]</span>What about them?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.9" data-time="179.27">[02:59.27]</span>Student: Well, they live together as a family and take <span class="underline">care</span> of their young until they are at <span class="underline">least</span> two years old. <span class="time" data-times="2.35" data-time="185.17">[03:05.17]</span>They're really friendly with each other. <span class="time" data-times="4.61" data-time="187.52">[03:07.52]</span>And what I really like is that they <span class="underline">even</span> have <span class="underline">greeting</span> ceremonies. <span class="time" data-times="3.98" data-time="192.13">[03:12.13]</span>And they are not at all <span class="underline">aggressive</span> and <span class="underline">territorial</span> like the Eastern marmots. <span class="time" data-times="6.68" data-time="196.11">[03:16.11]</span>So their social <span class="underline">behavior</span> is so different from Eastern marmots because of the <span class="underline">climate</span> where they live? <span class="time" data-times="1.87" data-time="202.79">[03:22.79]</span>That seems so bizarre.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.04" data-time="204.66">[03:24.66]</span>Professor: Well, the Olympic marmots <span class="underline">inhabit</span> meadows high in the Olympic Mountains where the weather conditions are much harsher. <span class="time" data-times="2.1" data-time="211.7">[03:31.70]</span>So there is a lot more wind and snow. <span class="time" data-times="3.47" data-time="213.8">[03:33.80]</span>The growing <span class="underline">season</span> only lasts about two to three months. <span class="time" data-times="8.28" data-time="217.27">[03:37.27]</span>So in that much shorter period of time, all the Olympic marmots, <span class="underline">male</span> and <span class="underline">female</span>, eat, play, work and <span class="underline">nurture</span> the young together.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.21" data-time="225.55">[03:45.55]</span>Because the <span class="underline">climate</span> is so <span class="underline">harsh</span>, <span class="underline">cooperation</span> increases the <span class="underline">survival</span> <span class="underline">rate</span> of the Olympic marmots. <span class="time" data-times="4.31" data-time="231.76">[03:51.76]</span>They keep their young at home until they are physically able to <span class="underline">survive</span> on their own. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="236.07">[03:56.07]</span>This could explain why the social <span class="underline">behavior</span> of the Olympic marmots is so unlike that of the Eastern marmots.</p>
