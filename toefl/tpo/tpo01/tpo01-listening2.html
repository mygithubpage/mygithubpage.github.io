So when you go to the <span class="highlight">exhibit</span>, I really want you to take a close look at a certain painting. <span class="time" data-times="2.36" data-time="117.73">[01:57.73]</span>It's a farm <span class="highlight">scene</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.57" data-time="120.09">[02:00.09]</span>And you will see it right as you enter the <span class="highlight">gallery</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.71" data-time="122.66">[02:02.66]</span>The <span class="highlight">reason</span> I think this painting is so important is that it stresses the <span class="highlight">impressionist</span><span class="highlight">aspect</span> of Frantzen's style. <span class="time" data-times="4.13" data-time="131.37">[02:11.37]</span>It's an outdoor <span class="highlight">scene</span>, an everyday <span class="highlight">scene</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.89" data-time="135.5">[02:15.50]</span>It's kind of <span class="highlight">bleak</span>, which you can really see those <span class="highlight">broad</span> brushstrokes and the blurry lines.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.22" data-time="141.39">[02:21.39]</span>The colors aren't quite <span class="highlight">realistic</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.87" data-time="143.61">[02:23.61]</span>The sky is kind of, well, an unnatural... pinkish yellow. <span class="time" data-times="9.36" data-time="148.48">[02:28.48]</span>And the fence in the <span class="highlight">foreground</span> is blue, but somehow the <span class="highlight">overall</span><span class="highlight">scene</span> gives an <span class="highlight">impression</span> of a cold, <span class="highlight">bleak</span>, winter day on a farm. <span class="time" data-times="4.43" data-time="157.84">[02:37.84]</span>So that's the <span class="highlight">impressionist</span> side of her work. <span class="time" data-times="15.29" data-time="162.27">[02:42.27]</span>Oh, and speaking about farms, that reminds me one interesting thing I read about Franzten is that when she first moved back to Iowa after living <span class="highlight">abroad</span>, she often visited this place in her town called the Sales <span class="highlight">Barn</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="8.85" data-time="177.56">[02:57.56]</span>And the Sales <span class="highlight">Barn</span>, it was basically this place where the <span class="highlight">local</span> farmers bought and sold their <span class="highlight">cattle</span>, their farm animals. <span class="time" data-times="9.88" data-time="186.41">[03:06.41]</span>And the <span class="highlight">reason</span> Frantzen went there, and she later on would visit other places like dance halls, was to <span class="highlight">observe</span> people and the ways that they moved. <span class="time" data-times="12.58" data-time="196.29">[03:16.29]</span>She really found that this helped her work--that it gave her an understanding of body movements and actions, how humans move, and stand still, what their postures were like, too. <span class="time" data-times="3.16" data-time="208.87">[03:28.87]</span>So, what about <span class="highlight">Realism</span>? <span class="time" data-times="4.91" data-time="212.03">[03:32.03]</span>What are the elements of <span class="highlight">Realism</span> we should be looking for in Frantzen's work?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="10.04" data-time="216.94">[03:36.94]</span>Student: Um... real <span class="highlight">honest</span> depictions of <span class="highlight">subject</span> matter, <span class="highlight">pretty</span> unidealized <span class="highlight">stuff</span>, and <span class="highlight">pretty</span> everyday <span class="highlight">subject</span> matter, too.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.24" data-time="226.98">[03:46.98]</span>Professor: Good. One other painting I really want you to look at is of a young woman surrounded by pumpkins. <span class="time" data-times="5.95" data-time="234.22">[03:54.22]</span>You will notice that the woman's face is so <span class="highlight">realistic</span> looking that it's almost like a <span class="highlight">photograph</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.98" data-time="240.17">[04:00.17]</span>The woman's nose is a little less than <span class="highlight">perfect</span> and her hair is kind of messed up. <span class="time" data-times="2.4" data-time="246.15">[04:06.15]</span>This is <span class="highlight">realism</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="16.34" data-time="248.55">[04:08.55]</span>But then, the background of the painting, this woman with the pumpkins is wrapped in a <span class="highlight">blanket</span> of <span class="highlight">broad</span> thick brushstrokes, and, it's all kinds of zigzagging brushstrokes and lines, kind of <span class="highlight">chaotic</span> almost when you look at it close. <span class="time" data-times="2.83" data-time="264.89">[04:24.89]</span>And there are <span class="highlight">vibrant</span> colors. <span class="time" data-times="4.78" data-time="267.72">[04:27.72]</span>There's lots of orange, with little hints of an electric blue peeking out.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.01" data-time="272.5">[04:32.50]</span>I find Frantzen to be a very <span class="highlight">accessible</span> artist. <span class="time" data-times="4.92" data-time="276.51">[4:36.51]</span>I mean, some artists, to <span class="highlight">appreciate</span> them, you have to know their life story. <span class="time" data-times="3.97" data-time="281.43">[04:41.43]</span>But here's a little bit about Rose Frantzen's life anyway. <span class="time" data-times="9.14" data-time="285.4">[04:45.40]</span>She attended art school, but was told by one of her instructors that she was not good at <span class="highlight">illustration</span>, that she should go into advertising <span class="highlight">instead</span>. <span class="time" data-times="11.75" data-time="294.54">[04:54.54]</span>So she took advertising classes and fine arts classes too, until she was convinced by the head of an advertising <span class="highlight">agency</span> that her work was really good, that she could be an artist.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="11.66" data-time="306.29">[05:06.29]</span>But of <span class="highlight">course</span>, it's not as easy as that, and so Frantzen had to paint other people's portraits at places like art fairs just to make money to buy paint for her more <span class="highlight">series</span> of art work. <span class="time" data-times="3.24" data-time="317.95">[05:17.95]</span>No matter what, she never stopped painting. <span class="time" data-times="2.66" data-time="321.19">[05:21.19]</span>And now, Frantzen is doing extremely well. <span class="time" data-times="2.75" data-time="323.85">[05:23.85]</span>And her work is being shown all over the country. <span class="time" data-times="6.69" data-time="326.6">[05:26.60]</span>So I think most of us would be discouraged if we had to face challenges and difficulties like that. <span class="time" data-times="5.03" data-time="333.29">[05:33.29]</span>But what's important is that you keep at it that you don't give up. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="338.32">[05:38.32]</span>That's what is really important to remember.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the purpose of the lecture?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To explain the difference between two artistic styles</p><p>B. To describe a new art gallery to the class</p><p>C. To introduce an artist's work to the class</p><p>D. To show how artists' styles can evolve over time</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The article begins to mention that students are invited to visit the art exhibition and, after referring to the participating artists, introduce the artist's works. A option:lecture speaks of realistic and impressionism as a whole (a style). The lecturer separates realistic and impressionism in order to facilitate students' understanding of the concept; A is not selected.</p><p>Option B: Option B is wrong in "Describe". The lecture does not describe the art exhibition. Instead, it leads to the work of "Rose Frantzen"; B does not choose. The C option: The C option has no obvious errors and the "introducing an artist's work" can cover the purpose of the lecture; C is to be determined. The D option: The D option is wrong in "Evolve". The lecture does not describe how an artist's style evolves over time; D does not choose. In summary, choose C.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor say about Frantzen's painting of a farm scene?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It resembles a photograph</p><p>B. It may be Frantzen's best known painting</p><p>C. It was painted in the Impressionist style</p><p>D. It was painted while Frantzen lived abroad</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>I really want you to take a close look at a certain painting. It's a farm scene. And you will see this painting is so important is that it stresses the impressionist aspect of Frantzen's style. The reason prompts the test site and farm paintings are impressionist.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why did Frantzen go to the Sales Barn?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To study human form and movement</p><p>B. To earn money by painting portraits</p><p>C. To paint farm animals in an outdoor setting</p><p>D. To meet people who could model for her paining</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>And the Sales Barn, it was basically this place where the local farmers bought and sold their cattle, their farm animals. And the reason Frantzen went there, and she later on would visit other places like dance halls, was to observe people and the ways That they moved. She really found that this helped her work---that it gave her an understanding of body movements and actions, how humans move, and stand still, what their postures were like, too. The purpose of the farm is to observe the way people move.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor imply about the painting of the young woman surrounded by pumpkins?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It was painted at an art fair</p><p>B. It combines Impressionism with Realism</p><p>C. It convinced Frantzen that she was a good illustrator</p><p>D. It was originally meant to be used in an advertisement</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>You will notice that the woman's face is so realistic looking that it's almost like a photograph. The woman's nose is a little less than perfect and her hair is kind of messed up. This is realism. But then, the background of the painting, this Woman with the pumpkins is wrapped in a blanket of broad thick brushstrokes, and, it's all kinds of zigzagging brushstrokes and lines, kind of chaotic almost when you look at it close. And there are vibrant colors. The teacher said that the pumpkin girl painting is a reality Translating, but then twisting, implying that Impressionism, and the details of the description are also consistent with the Impressionist style, so this painting combines realism and Impressionism.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor discuss Frantzen's difficulties as a young painter?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. He wants to point out mistakes that young artists commonly make</p><p>B. He thinks her example can inspire the students in their own lives</p><p>C. Her difficulties remind him of the difficulties he himself experienced as a young artist</p><p>D. Her difficulties are the subject of some of the paintings in the gallery that the students will visit</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>So I think most of us would be discouraged if we had to face challenges and difficulties like that. But what's important is that you keep at it that you don't give up. That's what is really important to remember. When an artist so successful and unique has had difficulties in the past, it is to encourage students in the art department.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor imply when he says this</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The students can understand Frantzen's art without knowing about her life</p><p>B. The students should pay very close attention to what he is going to say</p><p>C. Some of his students are already familiar with Frantzen's life story</p><p>D. Some of his students may not appreciate Frantzen's work</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>"I mean, some artists, to appreciate them, you have to know their life story. But...." in "but" is the key to problem solving. "Life story" is only "a little bit" for Frantzen. So A meets.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
