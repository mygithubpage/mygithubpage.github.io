          <p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.2" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in a <span class="underline">contemporary</span> art class.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.13" data-time="7.2">[00:07.20]</span>Professor: Ok, I'm going to begin this lecture by giving you your next <span class="underline">assignment</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.05" data-time="12.33">[00:12.33]</span>Remember I said that at some point during this <span class="underline">semester</span> I <span class="underline">wanted</span> you to <span class="underline">attend</span> an <span class="underline">exhibit</span> at the Fairy Street <span class="underline">Gallery</span> and then write about it? <span class="time" data-times="3.91" data-time="20.38">[00:20.38]</span>Well, the <span class="underline">exhibit</span> that I want you to <span class="underline">attend</span> is coming up. <span class="time" data-times="7.65" data-time="24.29">[00:24.29]</span>It's already started in fact, but it'll be at the <span class="underline">gallery</span> for the next month, which should give you plenty of time to complete this <span class="underline">assignment</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.32" data-time="31.94">[00:31.94]</span>The name of the artist exhibiting there is Rose Frantzen. <span class="time" data-times="11.55" data-time="38.26">[00:38.26]</span>Frantzen's work may be unfamiliar to you since she's a <span class="underline">relatively</span> young artist, but she's got a very unusual style, compared to some of the artists we've looked at this <span class="underline">term</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.32" data-time="49.81">[00:49.81]</span>But anyway, Frantzen's style is what she herself calls <span class="underline">Realistic</span> Impressionism. <span class="time" data-times="10.27" data-time="58.13">[00:58.13]</span>So you've probably studied both of these movements separately, <span class="underline">separate</span> movements, <span class="underline">Realism</span> and Impressionism, in some of your art <span class="underline">history</span> courses. <span class="time" data-times="3.2" data-time="68.4">[01:08.40]</span>So who can just <span class="underline">sum</span> these up?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.9" data-time="71.6">[01:11.60]</span>Student: Well, Impressionism started in the late 19th <span class="underline">century</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.83" data-time="76.5">[01:16.50]</span>Um...the <span class="underline">basic</span> <span class="underline">impressionist</span> style was very different from earlier styles. <span class="time" data-times="4.18" data-time="81.33">[01:21.33]</span>It didn't <span class="underline">depict</span> scenes or models exactly as they looked. <span class="time" data-times="9.49" data-time="85.51">[01:25.51]</span>Um... <span class="underline">Impressionist</span> painters tended to <span class="underline">apply</span> paint really thickly, and in big brushstrokes, so the <span class="underline">texture</span> of the <span class="underline">canvas</span> was <span class="underline">rough</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.98" data-time="95">[01:35.00]</span>Professor: Good. What else? <span class="time" data-times="2.88" data-time="96.98">[01:36.98]</span>What were the subjects?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.87" data-time="99.86">[01:39.86]</span>Student: Well, a lot of <span class="underline">impressionist</span> artists painted everyday scenes, like people on the streets and in cafes, lots of nature scenes, especially landscapes.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7" data-time="110.73">[01:50.73]</span>Professor: Good. So when you go to the <span class="underline">exhibit</span>, I really want you to take a close look at a certain painting. <span class="time" data-times="2.36" data-time="117.73">[01:57.73]</span>It's a farm <span class="underline">scene</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.57" data-time="120.09">[02:00.09]</span>And you will see it right as you enter the <span class="underline">gallery</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.71" data-time="122.66">[02:02.66]</span>The <span class="underline">reason</span> I think this painting is so important is that it stresses the <span class="underline">impressionist</span> <span class="underline">aspect</span> of Frantzen's style. <span class="time" data-times="4.13" data-time="131.37">[02:11.37]</span>It's an outdoor <span class="underline">scene</span>, an everyday <span class="underline">scene</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.89" data-time="135.5">[02:15.50]</span>It's kind of <span class="underline">bleak</span>, which you can really see those <span class="underline">broad</span> brushstrokes and the blurry lines.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.22" data-time="141.39">[02:21.39]</span>The colors aren't quite <span class="underline">realistic</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.87" data-time="143.61">[02:23.61]</span>The sky is kind of, well, an unnatural... pinkish yellow. <span class="time" data-times="9.36" data-time="148.48">[02:28.48]</span>And the fence in the <span class="underline">foreground</span> is blue, but somehow the <span class="underline">overall</span> <span class="underline">scene</span> gives an <span class="underline">impression</span> of a cold, <span class="underline">bleak</span>, winter day on a farm. <span class="time" data-times="4.43" data-time="157.84">[02:37.84]</span>So that's the <span class="underline">impressionist</span> side of her work. <span class="time" data-times="15.29" data-time="162.27">[02:42.27]</span>Oh, and speaking about farms, that reminds me one interesting thing I read about Franzten is that when she first moved back to Iowa after living <span class="underline">abroad</span>, she often visited this place in her town called the Sales <span class="underline">Barn</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.85" data-time="177.56">[02:57.56]</span>And the Sales <span class="underline">Barn</span>, it was basically this place where the <span class="underline">local</span> farmers bought and sold their <span class="underline">cattle</span>, their farm animals. <span class="time" data-times="9.88" data-time="186.41">[03:06.41]</span>And the <span class="underline">reason</span> Frantzen went there, and she later on would visit other places like dance halls, was to <span class="underline">observe</span> people and the ways that they moved. <span class="time" data-times="12.58" data-time="196.29">[03:16.29]</span>She really found that this helped her work--that it gave her an understanding of body movements and actions, how humans move, and stand still, what their postures were like, too. <span class="time" data-times="3.16" data-time="208.87">[03:28.87]</span>So, what about <span class="underline">Realism</span>? <span class="time" data-times="4.91" data-time="212.03">[03:32.03]</span>What are the elements of <span class="underline">Realism</span> we should be looking for in Frantzen's work?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.04" data-time="216.94">[03:36.94]</span>Student: Um... real <span class="underline">honest</span> depictions of <span class="underline">subject</span> matter, <span class="underline">pretty</span> unidealized <span class="underline">stuff</span>, and <span class="underline">pretty</span> everyday <span class="underline">subject</span> matter, too.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.24" data-time="226.98">[03:46.98]</span>Professor: Good. One other painting I really want you to look at is of a young woman surrounded by pumpkins. <span class="time" data-times="5.95" data-time="234.22">[03:54.22]</span>You will notice that the woman's face is so <span class="underline">realistic</span> looking that it's almost like a <span class="underline">photograph</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.98" data-time="240.17">[04:00.17]</span>The woman's nose is a little less than <span class="underline">perfect</span> and her hair is kind of messed up. <span class="time" data-times="2.4" data-time="246.15">[04:06.15]</span>This is <span class="underline">realism</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="16.34" data-time="248.55">[04:08.55]</span>But then, the background of the painting, this woman with the pumpkins is wrapped in a <span class="underline">blanket</span> of <span class="underline">broad</span> thick brushstrokes, and, it's all kinds of zigzagging brushstrokes and lines, kind of <span class="underline">chaotic</span> almost when you look at it close. <span class="time" data-times="2.83" data-time="264.89">[04:24.89]</span>And there are <span class="underline">vibrant</span> colors. <span class="time" data-times="4.78" data-time="267.72">[04:27.72]</span>There's lots of orange, with little hints of an electric blue peeking out.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.01" data-time="272.5">[04:32.50]</span>I find Frantzen to be a very <span class="underline">accessible</span> artist. <span class="time" data-times="4.92" data-time="276.51">[4:36.51]</span>I mean, some artists, to <span class="underline">appreciate</span> them, you have to know their life story. <span class="time" data-times="3.97" data-time="281.43">[04:41.43]</span>But here's a little bit about Rose Frantzen's life anyway. <span class="time" data-times="9.14" data-time="285.4">[04:45.40]</span>She attended art school, but was told by one of her instructors that she was not good at <span class="underline">illustration</span>, that she should go into advertising <span class="underline">instead</span>. <span class="time" data-times="11.75" data-time="294.54">[04:54.54]</span>So she took advertising classes and fine arts classes too, until she was convinced by the head of an advertising <span class="underline">agency</span> that her work was really good, that she could be an artist.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="11.66" data-time="306.29">[05:06.29]</span>But of <span class="underline">course</span>, it's not as easy as that, and so Frantzen had to paint other people's portraits at places like art fairs just to make money to buy paint for her more <span class="underline">series</span> of art work. <span class="time" data-times="3.24" data-time="317.95">[05:17.95]</span>No matter what, she never stopped painting. <span class="time" data-times="2.66" data-time="321.19">[05:21.19]</span>And now, Frantzen is doing extremely well. <span class="time" data-times="2.75" data-time="323.85">[05:23.85]</span>And her work is being shown all over the country. <span class="time" data-times="6.69" data-time="326.6">[05:26.60]</span>So I think most of us would be discouraged if we had to face challenges and difficulties like that. <span class="time" data-times="5.03" data-time="333.29">[05:33.29]</span>But what's important is that you keep at it that you don't give up. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="338.32">[05:38.32]</span>That's what is really important to remember.</p>
