            <span class="time" data-times="4.84" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in a <span class="highlight">geology</span> class.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.07" data-time="4.84">[00:04.84]</span>Professor: Ok, let's get started. <span class="time" data-times="10.8" data-time="7.91">[00:07.91]</span>Great. Today I want to talk about a way in which we are able to <span class="highlight">determine</span> how old a piece of land, or some other geologic feature is - dating techniques. <span class="time" data-times="3.33" data-time="18.71">[00:18.71]</span>I'm going to talk about a <span class="highlight">particular</span> dating <span class="highlight">technique</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.71" data-time="22.04">[00:22.04]</span>Why? Good dating is a key to good <span class="highlight">analysis</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.14" data-time="26.75">[00:26.75]</span>In other words, if you want to know how a land <span class="highlight">formation</span> was formed, the first thing you probably want to know is how old it is. <span class="time" data-times="1.53" data-time="34.89">[00:34.89]</span>It's <span class="highlight">fundamental</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.03" data-time="36.42">[00:36.42]</span>Um... Take the Grand <span class="highlight">Canyon</span> for <span class="highlight">instance</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9" data-time="39.45">[00:39.45]</span>Now, we geologists thought we had a <span class="highlight">pretty</span> good idea of how the Grand <span class="highlight">Canyon</span> in the southwestern United States was formed. <span class="time" data-times="7.67" data-time="48.45">[00:48.45]</span>We knew that it was formed from sandstone that solidified somewhere between 150 and 300 million years ago. <span class="time" data-times="4.12" data-time="56.12">[00:56.12]</span>Before it solidified, it was just <span class="highlight">regular</span> sand. <span class="time" data-times="2.93" data-time="60.24">[01:00.24]</span> <span class="highlight">Essentially</span>, it was part of a <span class="highlight">vast</span> <span class="highlight">desert</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="9.44" data-time="63.17">[01:03.17]</span>And until just recently, most of us thought the sand had come from an <span class="highlight">ancient</span> mountain <span class="highlight">range</span> <span class="highlight">fairly</span> close by that flattened out over time. <span class="time" data-times="4.93" data-time="72.61">[01:12.61]</span>That's been the <span class="highlight">conventional</span> wisdom among geologists for quite some time. <span class="time" data-times="8.53" data-time="77.54">[01:17.54]</span>But now we've learned something different, and quite surprising, using a <span class="highlight">technique</span> called Uranium-Lead Dating.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.99" data-time="86.07">[01:26.07]</span>I should say that Uranium-Lead Dating has been around for quite a while. <span class="time" data-times="2.85" data-time="91.06">[01:31.06]</span>But there have been some recent refinements. <span class="time" data-times="1.84" data-time="93.91">[01:33.91]</span>I will get into this in a <span class="highlight">minute</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.74" data-time="95.75">[01:35.75]</span>Anyway, Uranium-Lead Dating has produced some surprises. <span class="time" data-times="8.67" data-time="100.49">[01:40.49]</span>Two geologists discovered that about half of the sand from the Grand <span class="highlight">Canyon</span> was actually once part of the Appalachian Mountains. <span class="time" data-times="9.36" data-time="109.16">[01:49.16]</span>That's really eye-opening news, since the Appalachian Mountain <span class="highlight">Range</span> is, of <span class="highlight">course</span>, thousands of kilometers to the east of the Grand <span class="highlight">Canyon</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.58" data-time="118.52">[01:58.52]</span>Sounds <span class="highlight">pretty</span> unbelievable, right?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.59" data-time="121.1">[02:01.10]</span>Of <span class="highlight">course</span>, the <span class="highlight">obvious</span> question is how did that sand end up so far west? <span class="time" data-times="8.36" data-time="127.69">[02:07.69]</span>The <span class="highlight">theory</span> is that huge rivers and wind carried the sand west where it mixed in with the sand that was already there. <span class="time" data-times="3.24" data-time="136.05">[02:16.05]</span>Well, this was a <span class="highlight">pretty</span> <span class="highlight">revolutionary</span> finding. <span class="time" data-times="4.12" data-time="139.29">[02:19.29]</span>Um... and it was basically because of Uranium-Lead Dating. <span class="time" data-times="1.15" data-time="143.41">[02:23.41]</span>Why?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="11.6" data-time="144.56">[02:24.56]</span>Well, as everyone in this class should know, we usually look at the <span class="highlight">grain</span> type <span class="highlight">within</span> sandstone, meaning the actual particles in the sandstone, to <span class="highlight">determine</span> where it came from. <span class="time" data-times="9.04" data-time="156.16">[02:36.16]</span>You can do other things too, like look at the wind or water that brought the grains to their location and <span class="highlight">figure</span> out which way it was flowing. <span class="time" data-times="5.36" data-time="165.2">[02:45.20]</span>But that's only useful up to a point, and that's not what these two geologists did.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.95" data-time="170.56">[02:50.56]</span>Uranium-Lead Dating allowed them to go about it in an <span class="highlight">entirely</span> different way. <span class="time" data-times="4.75" data-time="175.51">[02:55.51]</span>What they did was: they looked at the grains of Zircon in the sandstone. <span class="time" data-times="7.67" data-time="180.26">[03:00.26]</span>Zircon is a <span class="highlight">material</span> that contains <span class="highlight">radioactive</span> Uranium, which makes it very useful for dating purposes.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.91" data-time="187.93">[03:07.93]</span>Zircon starts off as <span class="highlight">molten</span> <span class="highlight">magma</span>, the hot <span class="highlight">lava</span> from volcanoes. <span class="time" data-times="2.46" data-time="193.84">[03:13.84]</span>This <span class="highlight">magma</span> then crystallizes. <span class="time" data-times="5.6" data-time="196.3">[03:16.30]</span>And when Zircon crystallizes, the Uranium inside it begins to change into <span class="highlight">Lead</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.86" data-time="201.9">[03:21.90]</span>So if you <span class="highlight">measure</span> the <span class="highlight">amount</span> of <span class="highlight">Lead</span> in the Zircon <span class="highlight">grain</span>, you can <span class="highlight">figure</span> out when the <span class="highlight">grain</span> was formed. <span class="time" data-times="5.2" data-time="208.76">[03:28.76]</span>After that, you can <span class="highlight">determine</span> the age of Zircon from different mountain ranges.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="7.79" data-time="213.96">[03:33.96]</span>Once you do that, you can <span class="highlight">compare</span> the age of the Zircon in the sandstone in your <span class="highlight">sample</span> to the age of the Zircon in the mountains. <span class="time" data-times="9.5" data-time="221.75">[03:41.75]</span>If the age of the Zircon matches the age of one of your mountain ranges, then it means the sandstone actually used to be part of that <span class="highlight">particular</span> mountain <span class="highlight">range</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.05" data-time="231.25">[03:51.25]</span>Is everybody with me on that? <span class="time" data-times="12.41" data-time="233.3">[03:53.30]</span>Good. So, in this case, Uranium-Lead Dating was used to <span class="highlight">establish</span> that half of the sandstone in the samples was formed at the same time the <span class="highlight">granite</span> in the Appalachian Mountains was formed.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="11.43" data-time="245.71">[04:05.71]</span>So because of this, this new way of doing Uranium-Lead Dating, we've been able to <span class="highlight">determine</span> that one of our <span class="highlight">major</span> assumptions about the Grand <span class="highlight">Canyon</span> was wrong. <span class="time" data-times="4.58" data-time="257.14">[04:17.14]</span>Like I said before, Uranium-Lead Dating has been with us for a while. <span class="time" data-times="6.42" data-time="261.72">[04:21.72]</span>But, um... until recently, in order to do it, you really had to study many <span class="highlight">individual</span> grains. <span class="time" data-times="3.06" data-time="268.14">[04:28.14]</span>And it took a long time before you got results. <span class="time" data-times="2.39" data-time="271.2">[04:31.20]</span>It just wasn't very <span class="highlight">efficient</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.03" data-time="273.59">[04:33.59]</span>And it wasn't very <span class="highlight">accurate</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.71" data-time="275.62">[04:35.62]</span>But <span class="highlight">technical</span> advances have cut down on the number of grains you have to study, so you get your results faster. <span class="time" data-times="6.96" data-time="282.33">[04:42.33]</span>So I'll <span class="highlight">predict</span> that Uranium-Lead Dating is going to become an increasingly <span class="highlight">popular</span> dating <span class="highlight">method</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.04" data-time="289.29">[04:49.29]</span>There are a few <span class="highlight">pretty</span> <span class="highlight">exciting</span> possibilities for Uranium-Lead Dating.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.34" data-time="294.33">[04:54.33]</span>Here is one that comes to <span class="highlight">mind</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.45" data-time="296.67">[04:56.67]</span>You know the <span class="highlight">theory</span> that earth's continents were once joined together and only <span class="highlight">split</span> apart <span class="highlight">relatively</span> recently? <span class="time" data-times="4.87" data-time="303.12">[05:03.12]</span>Well, with Uranium-Lead Dating, we could prove that more conclusively. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="307.99">[05:07.99]</span>If they show <span class="highlight">evidence</span> of once having been joined, that could really tell us a lot about the early <span class="highlight">history</span> of the <span class="highlight">planet</span>'s <span class="highlight">geology</span>.</p>
