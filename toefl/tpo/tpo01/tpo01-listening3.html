An ancient lake located in the American Southwest</p><p>B. A desert that once connected two continents</p><p>C. Sands carried by a river from the Appalachian Mountains</p><p>D. A nearby mountain range that had flattened out over time</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>And until just now, most of us thought the sand had come from an ancient mountain range fairly close by that flattened out over time. That's been the conventional wisdom among geologists for quite some time. But now we've learned something different, and The tips of using a technique called Uranium-Lead Dating. Until just remind us that most of the people who previously believed that these sandstones came from a nearby ancient mountain range that has been smoothed out by the wind and sand after a certain period of time. Of course, the opinions of most people before this are certain. It is wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>In the talk, the professor describes th sequence of uraniumlead dating. Summarize the sequence by putting the events in the correct order.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.Zircon in the sandstone is matched to the zircon in a particular mountain range</p><p>B.The amount of lead in sandstone zircon is measured.</p><p>C.The age of zircon in a sandstone sample is determined.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="BCA"><p>Uranium-Lead Dating allowed them to go about it in an entirely different way. What they did was: they looked at the grains of Zircon in the sandstone. Zircon is a material that contains radioactive Uranium, which makes it very useful for dating purposes. Zircon starts off as molten magma, the hot larva from volcanoes. This magma then crystallizes. And when Zircon crystallizes, the Uranium inside it begins to change into Lead. So if you measure the amount of Lead in the Zircon grain, you can figure out when the grain was formed. After that, you can determine the age of Zircon from different mountain ranges. Once you do that, you can compare the age of the Zircon in the sandstone in your sample to the age of the Zircon in the mountains. If the age of the Zircon matches the age of one of the mountain ranges, then it means the sandstone actually used to be part of that particular mountain range. </p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor, what change has caused uranium-lead dating to gain popularity recently?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

It can be used in fields other than geology</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Before the ULD technology measured many particles, it was slow and inaccurate, and it was not efficient. However, the power of the measurement was reduced and the speed was increased, so the efficiency increased. Therefore, professors predict that this technology will become more and more popular.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor talk about the breaking apart of Earth's continents?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

To disprove a theory about the age of Earth's first mountain ranges</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>There are a few pretty exciting possibilities for Uranium-Lead Dating. Here is one that comes to mind. You know the theory that earth's continents were once joined together and only divided apart now? Well, with Uranium-Lead Dating, we could prove That more conclusively. ULD can be applied to the continental drift hypothesis, referring to why continental plate division is an example of ULD's specific use.</p></div></div><div class="replay" id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor imply when he says this</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.
