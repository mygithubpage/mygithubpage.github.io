            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.14" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in a <span class="underline">literature</span> class.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.93" data-time="6.14">[00:06.14]</span>Professor: Now we can't really talk about fairy tales without first talking about folktales because there's a strong connection between these two genres, these two types of stories. <span class="time" data-times="3.92" data-time="16.07">[00:16.07]</span>In fact, many fairy tales started out as folktales. <span class="time" data-times="3.34" data-time="19.99">[00:19.99]</span>So, what's a folktale?<span class="time" data-times="2.88" data-time="23.33">[00:23.33]</span>How would you <span class="underline">characterize</span> them? Jeff?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.47" data-time="26.21">[00:26.21]</span>Jeff: Well, they are old stories, <span class="underline">traditional</span> stories. <span class="time" data-times="6.79" data-time="29.68">[00:29.68]</span>They were passed down orally <span class="underline">within</span> cultures from <span class="underline">generation</span> to <span class="underline">generation</span>, so they changed a lot over time. <span class="time" data-times="6.89" data-time="36.47">[00:36.47]</span>I mean, every storyteller, or, maybe every town, might have had a <span class="underline">slightly</span> different <span class="underline">version</span> of the same folktale.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.63" data-time="43.36">[00:43.36]</span>Professor: That's right. There's <span class="underline">local</span> <span class="underline">difference</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.41" data-time="45.99">[00:45.99]</span>And that's why we say folktales are <span class="underline">communal</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.8" data-time="49.4">[00:49.40]</span>By <span class="underline">communal</span>, we mean they <span class="underline">reflect</span> the traits and the concerns of a <span class="underline">particular</span> <span class="underline">community</span> at a <span class="underline">particular</span> time. <span class="time" data-times="7.94" data-time="58.2">[00:58.20]</span>So <span class="underline">essentially</span> the same tale could be told in different communities, with certain aspects of the tale adapted to fit the <span class="underline">specific</span> <span class="underline">community</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.05" data-time="66.14">[01:06.14]</span>Um, not the <span class="underline">plot</span>, the details of what happens in the story would <span class="underline">remain</span> <span class="underline">constant</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.79" data-time="73.19">[01:13.19]</span>That was the <span class="underline">thread</span> that held the tale together. <span class="time" data-times="6.62" data-time="75.98">[01:15.98]</span>But all the other elements, like the location or characters, might be modified for each <span class="underline">audience</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.45" data-time="82.6">[01:22.60]</span>Okay. So what about fairy tales? <span class="time" data-times="7.11" data-time="88.05">[01:28.05]</span>They also are found in most cultures, but how are they different from folktales? <span class="time" data-times="3.67" data-time="95.16">[01:35.16]</span>I guess the first question is: what is a fairy tale? <span class="time" data-times="10.57" data-time="98.83">[01:38.83]</span>And don't anyone say "a story with a fairy in it" because we all know that very few fairy tales actually have those tiny magical creatures in them. <span class="time" data-times="3.55" data-time="109.4">[01:49.40]</span>But, what else can we say about them? Mary.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.09" data-time="112.95">[01:52.95]</span>Mary: Well, they <span class="underline">seem</span> to be less <span class="underline">realistic</span> than folktales...like they have something <span class="underline">improbable</span> happening - a frog turning into a prince, say. <span class="time" data-times="4.48" data-time="121.04">[02:01.04]</span>Oh, that's another <span class="underline">common</span> <span class="underline">element</span>, royalty - a prince or princess. <span class="time" data-times="6.01" data-time="125.52">[02:05.52]</span>And fairy tales all <span class="underline">seem</span> to take place in a location that's nowhere and everywhere at the same time.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.43" data-time="131.53">[02:11.53]</span>Professor: What's the line-up? <span class="time" data-times="1.74" data-time="132.96">[02:12.96]</span>How do all those stories start? <span class="time" data-times="14.2" data-time="134.7">[02:14.70]</span>Once upon a time, in a faraway land... oh, in the case of folktales, each storyteller would <span class="underline">specify</span> a <span class="underline">particular</span> location and time, though the time and location would differ for different storytellers. <span class="time" data-times="7.1" data-time="148.9">[02:28.90]</span>With fairy tales, however, the location is generally unspecified, no matter who the storyteller is. <span class="time" data-times="4.26" data-time="156">[02:36.00]</span>That land far away... We'll come back to this point in a few minutes.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.41" data-time="160.26">[02:40.26]</span>Student: Um... I, I thought that a fairy tale was just a written <span class="underline">version</span> of an <span class="underline">oral</span> folktale.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.67" data-time="165.67">[02:45.67]</span>Professor: Well, not exactly, though that is how many fairy tales developed. <span class="time" data-times="7.42" data-time="171.34">[02:51.34]</span>For example, in the late 18th <span class="underline">century</span>, the Grimm Brothers traveled <span class="underline">throughout</span> what's now Germany, recording <span class="underline">local</span> folktales. <span class="time" data-times="7.1" data-time="178.76">[02:58.76]</span>These were <span class="underline">eventually</span> published as fairy tales, but not before undergoing a <span class="underline">process</span> of <span class="underline">evolution</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.44" data-time="185.86">[03:05.86]</span>Now, a number of things happen when an <span class="underline">oral</span> tale gets written down.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.99" data-time="190.3">[03:10.30]</span>First, the language changes. <span class="time" data-times="5.98" data-time="192.29">[03:12.29]</span>It becomes more <span class="underline">formal</span>, more <span class="underline">standard</span> - some might say, "Less colorful". <span class="time" data-times="5.63" data-time="198.27">[03:18.27]</span>It's like the <span class="underline">difference</span> in your language depending on whether you are talking to someone, or writing them a letter.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.68" data-time="203.9">[03:23.90]</span>
              <span class="underline">Second</span>, when an orally transmitted story is written down, an authoritative <span class="underline">version</span> with a recognized author is created. <span class="time" data-times="2.41" data-time="212.58">[03:32.58]</span>The <span class="underline">communal</span> <span class="underline">aspect</span> gets lost. <span class="time" data-times="2.85" data-time="214.99">[03:34.99]</span>The tale no longer belongs to the <span class="underline">community</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.66" data-time="217.84">[03:37.84]</span>It belongs to the world, so to speak.<span class="time" data-times="5.96" data-time="220.5">[03:40.50]</span> Because of this, elements like place and time can no longer be tailored to suit a <span class="underline">particular</span> <span class="underline">audience</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.51" data-time="226.46">[03:46.46]</span>So they become less <span class="underline">identifiable</span>, more generalizable to any <span class="underline">audience</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.68" data-time="230.97">[03:50.97]</span>On the other hand, descriptions of characters and settings can be developed more completely. <span class="time" data-times="5.98" data-time="235.65">[03:55.65]</span>In folktales, characters might be identified by a name, but you wouldn't know anything more about them. <span class="time" data-times="4.21" data-time="241.63">[04:01.63]</span>But in fairy tales, people no longer have to remember plots. <span class="time" data-times="1.8" data-time="245.84">[04:05.84]</span>They're written down, right? <span class="time" data-times="5.63" data-time="247.64">[04:07.64]</span>So more energy can be put into other elements of the story like <span class="underline">character</span> and <span class="underline">setting</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="11.51" data-time="253.27">[04:13.27]</span>So you get more details about the characters, about where the <span class="underline">action</span> takes place, what people's houses were like, ur, whether they're small cabins or grand palaces. <span class="time" data-times="6.16" data-time="264.78">[04:24.78]</span>And it's <span class="underline">worth</span> investing that energy because the story, now in book form, isn't in danger of being lost. <span class="time" data-times="2.17" data-time="270.94">[04:30.94]</span>Those details won't be forgotten. <span class="time" data-times="6.06" data-time="273.11">[04:33.11]</span>If a folktale isn't repeated by each <span class="underline">generation</span>, it may be lost for all time. <span class="time" data-times="7.35" data-time="279.17">[04:39.17]</span>But with a fairy tale, it's always there in a book, waiting to be discovered, again and again.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.41" data-time="286.52">[04:46.52]</span>Another interesting <span class="underline">difference</span> involves the change in <span class="underline">audience</span>. <span class="time" data-times="1.77" data-time="290.93">[04:50.93]</span>Who the stories are meant for? <span class="time" data-times="6.79" data-time="292.7">[04:52.70]</span> <span class="underline">Contrary</span> to what many people believe today, folktales were originally intended for adults, not for children. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="299.49">[04:59.49]</span>So, why is it that fairy tales <span class="underline">seem</span> targeted toward children nowadays?</p>
