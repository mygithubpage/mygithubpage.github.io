Jeff?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.47" data-time="26.21">[00:26.21]</span>Jeff: Well, they are old stories, <span class="highlight">traditional</span> stories. <span class="time" data-times="6.79" data-time="29.68">[00:29.68]</span>They were passed down orally <span class="highlight">within</span> cultures from <span class="highlight">generation</span> to <span class="highlight">generation</span>, so they changed a lot over time. <span class="time" data-times="6.89" data-time="36.47">[00:36.47]</span>I mean, every storyteller, or, maybe every town, might have had a <span class="highlight">slightly</span> different <span class="highlight">version</span> of the same folktale.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.63" data-time="43.36">[00:43.36]</span>Professor: That's right. There's <span class="highlight">local</span><span class="highlight">difference</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.41" data-time="45.99">[00:45.99]</span>And that's why we say folktales are <span class="highlight">communal</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.8" data-time="49.4">[00:49.40]</span>By <span class="highlight">communal</span>, we mean they <span class="highlight">reflect</span> the traits and the concerns of a <span class="highlight">particular</span><span class="highlight">community</span> at a <span class="highlight">particular</span> time. <span class="time" data-times="7.94" data-time="58.2">[00:58.20]</span>So <span class="highlight">essentially</span> the same tale could be told in different communities, with certain aspects of the tale adapted to fit the <span class="highlight">specific</span><span class="highlight">community</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.05" data-time="66.14">[01:06.14]</span>Um, not the <span class="highlight">plot</span>, the details of what happens in the story would <span class="highlight">remain</span><span class="highlight">constant</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.79" data-time="73.19">[01:13.19]</span>That was the <span class="highlight">thread</span> that held the tale together. <span class="time" data-times="6.62" data-time="75.98">[01:15.98]</span>But all the other elements, like the location or characters, might be modified for each <span class="highlight">audience</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.45" data-time="82.6">[01:22.60]</span>Okay. So what about fairy tales? <span class="time" data-times="7.11" data-time="88.05">[01:28.05]</span>They also are found in most cultures, but how are they different from folktales? <span class="time" data-times="3.67" data-time="95.16">[01:35.16]</span>I guess the first question is: what is a fairy tale? <span class="time" data-times="10.57" data-time="98.83">[01:38.83]</span>And don't anyone say "a story with a fairy in it" because we all know that very few fairy tales actually have those tiny magical creatures in them. <span class="time" data-times="3.55" data-time="109.4">[01:49.40]</span>But, what else can we say about them? Mary.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="8.09" data-time="112.95">[01:52.95]</span>Mary: Well, they <span class="highlight">seem</span> to be less <span class="highlight">realistic</span> than folktales...like they have something <span class="highlight">improbable</span> happening - a frog turning into a prince, say. <span class="time" data-times="4.48" data-time="121.04">[02:01.04]</span>Oh, that's another <span class="highlight">common</span><span class="highlight">element</span>, royalty - a prince or princess. <span class="time" data-times="6.01" data-time="125.52">[02:05.52]</span>And fairy tales all <span class="highlight">seem</span> to take place in a location that's nowhere and everywhere at the same time.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="1.43" data-time="131.53">[02:11.53]</span>Professor: What's the line-up? <span class="time" data-times="1.74" data-time="132.96">[02:12.96]</span>How do all those stories start? <span class="time" data-times="14.2" data-time="134.7">[02:14.70]</span>Once upon a time, in a faraway land... oh, in the case of folktales, each storyteller would <span class="highlight">specify</span> a <span class="highlight">particular</span> location and time, though the time and location would differ for different storytellers. <span class="time" data-times="7.1" data-time="148.9">[02:28.90]</span>With fairy tales, however, the location is generally unspecified, no matter who the storyteller is. <span class="time" data-times="4.26" data-time="156">[02:36.00]</span>That land far away...

<span class="time" data-times="5.63" data-time="247.64">[04:07.64]</span>So more energy can be put into other elements of the story like <span class="highlight">character</span> and <span class="highlight">setting</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="11.51" data-time="253.27">[04:13.27]</span>So you get more details about the characters, about where the <span class="highlight">action</span> takes place, what people's houses were like, ur, whether they're small cabins or grand palaces. <span class="time" data-times="6.16" data-time="264.78">[04:24.78]</span>And it's <span class="highlight">worth</span> investing that energy because the story, now in book form, isn't in danger of being lost. <span class="time" data-times="2.17" data-time="270.94">[04:30.94]</span>Those details won't be forgotten. <span class="time" data-times="6.06" data-time="273.11">[04:33.11]</span>If a folktale isn't repeated by each <span class="highlight">generation</span>, it may be lost for all time. <span class="time" data-times="7.35" data-time="279.17">[04:39.17]</span>But with a fairy tale, it's always there in a book, waiting to be discovered, again and again.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.41" data-time="286.52">[04:46.52]</span>Another interesting <span class="highlight">difference</span> involves the change in <span class="highlight">audience</span>. <span class="time" data-times="1.77" data-time="290.93">[04:50.93]</span>Who the stories are meant for?

Hidden meaning in folktales and fairy tales.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The first sentence of the professor said that it would be difficult to analyze the fairy tales without referring to the folk tales, then start In fact, many fairy tales started out as folk tales. Compare the two, that is, C. The focus is not hidden. Because only one sentence has passed, so D is wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor mean when he says that folktales are communal?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

They relate important events in the history of a community.</p><p>D. They can be adapted to meet the needs of a community.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>Due to the regional nature of folktales, it will gradually change with the characteristics of the region. That is, they can be adapted to meet the needs of a community. Selecting D does not enhance personal relationships in the community, so B is wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor clarify the concept of a "fairy tale"?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To explain the origins of the term "fairy tale".</p><p>B. To eliminate a possible definition of the term" fairy tale".</p><p>C. To support a claim about the function of fairy tales.</p><p>D. To indicate that fairies are a major element in fairy tale.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The professor emphasized that the specific definition of the fairytales is clearly And don?t? Sa say "a story with a fairy in it" to exclude some general or incorrect definitions. So choose B. Very few fairy tales actually have those tiny magical creatures in them. The description of fairy is not the main one, so D is wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor say about the setting of fairy tales?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The tales are usually set in a nonspecific location.</p><p>B. The location is determined by the country of origin of a tale.</p><p>C. The tales are set in a location familiar to the author.</p><p>D. A storyteller varies the location of a tale depending on the audience.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>Folktales are regional but fairtales are not.
