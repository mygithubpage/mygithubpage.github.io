To introduce a method that can help students remember new information.</p><p>B. To introduce a way to study how information passes from one person to another.</p><p>C. To explain the differences between biological information and cultural information.</p><p>D. To explain the differences between stories, songs, and other pieces of information.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The professor first told the story and then said that the song of the little star was to elicit the theme that is the theory of meme. And what is A meme is defined as a piece of information copied from person to person.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor tell the story about alligators?.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To explain the difference between true and false stories.</p><p>B. To draw an analogy between alligator reproduction and cultural transmission.</p><p>C. To give an example of a piece of information that functions as a meme.</p><p>D. To show how a story can gradually change into a song.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>From the original text, story is represented by an example of a piece of information that functions as a meme. Story doesn't gradually become a song so D is wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor, which of the following are examples of meme transfer?Click on 2 answers.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Telling familiar stories.</p><p>B. Sharing feelings.</p><p>C. Composing original music.</p><p>D. Learning a scientific theory.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="AD"><p>Profesor has listed a series of examples about meme, including stories and scientific theories.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What example does the professor give of a meme's longevity?.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. A story has been changing since it first appeared in the 1930s.</p><p>B. A person remembers a story for many years.</p><p>C. A gene is passed on through many generations without changing.</p><p>D. A song quickly becomes popular all over the world.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Obviously the memory is an example of the professor's longevity for meme. C is not for meme's longeivity.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor compare to a housefly laying many eggs?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. A child learning many different ideas from or her parents.</p><p>B. Alligators reproducing in New York sewers.</p><p>C. Different people remembering different versions of a story.</p><p>D. A person singing the "Twinkle, twinkle" song many times.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>Professor here compares How many times have you sung the "twinkle, twinkle song" to someone? and a housefly laying many eggs. C is not an object of comparison but an evaluation and judgment of facts.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor say this?.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To explain why some memes do not change much.</p><p>B. To ask the students for their opinion about songs as memes.</p><p>C. To acknowledge a problem with the meme theory.</p><p>D. To ask the student to test an idea about memes.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>From the statement of Professor, it can be seen that there is a kind of meme that can change little over time. So to say this is to explain why some memes do not change much. A is consistent, first analyzed the story and then song, so it is not just for song.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
