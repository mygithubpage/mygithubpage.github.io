            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.4" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in a <span class="underline">sociology</span> class.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.73" data-time="4.4">[00:04.40]</span>Professor: Have you ever heard the one about alligators living in New York sewers? <span class="time" data-times="13.73" data-time="8.13">[00:08.13]</span>The story goes like this: a family went on <span class="underline">vacation</span> in Florida and bought a <span class="underline">couple</span> of baby alligators as presents for their children, then returned from <span class="underline">vacation</span> to New York, bringing the alligators home with them as pets.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.79" data-time="21.86">[00:21.86]</span>But the alligators would <span class="underline">escape</span> and find their way into the New York <span class="underline">sewer</span> system where they started reproducing, grew to huge sizes and now <span class="underline">strike</span> fear into <span class="underline">sewer</span> workers. <span class="time" data-times="1.53" data-time="32.65">[00:32.65]</span>Have you heard this story? <span class="time" data-times="2.9" data-time="34.18">[00:34.18]</span>Well, it isn't true and it never happened. <span class="time" data-times="4.27" data-time="37.08">[00:37.08]</span>But despite that, the story has been around since the 1930s. <span class="time" data-times="9.54" data-time="41.35">[00:41.35]</span>Or how about the song 'twinkle, twinkle little star', you know, 'twinkle, twinkle, little star, how I <span class="underline">wonder</span> what you are'. <span class="time" data-times="1.9" data-time="50.89">[00:50.89]</span>Well we've all heard this song.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.71" data-time="52.79">[00:52.79]</span>Where am I going with this? <span class="time" data-times="4.54" data-time="54.5">[00:54.50]</span>Well, both the song and the story are examples of memes. <span class="time" data-times="3.57" data-time="59.04">[00:59.04]</span>And that's what we would talk about, the <span class="underline">theory</span> of memes. <span class="time" data-times="5.57" data-time="62.61">[01:02.61]</span>A meme is defined as a piece of information copied from person to person. <span class="time" data-times="7.67" data-time="68.18">[01:08.18]</span>By this <span class="underline">definition</span>, most of what you know, ideas, skills, stories, songs are memes. <span class="time" data-times="11.66" data-time="75.85">[01:15.85]</span>All the words you know, all the <span class="underline">scientific</span> theories you've learned, the rules your parents taught you to <span class="underline">observe</span>, all are memes that have been passed on from person to person.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.57" data-time="87.51">[01:27.51]</span>So what? You may say. <span class="time" data-times="3.67" data-time="89.08">[01:29.08]</span>Passing on ideas from one person to another is nothing new. <span class="time" data-times="10.98" data-time="92.75">[01:32.75]</span>Well, the whole point of defining this <span class="underline">familiar</span> <span class="underline">process</span> as transmission of memes is so that we can <span class="underline">explore</span> its <span class="underline">analogy</span> with the transmission of genes. <span class="time" data-times="6.15" data-time="103.73">[01:43.73]</span>As you know, all living organisms pass on biological information <span class="underline">through</span> the genes.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.35" data-time="109.88">[01:49.88]</span>What's a <span class="underline">gene</span>? <span class="time" data-times="9.96" data-time="111.23">[01:51.23]</span>A <span class="underline">gene</span> is a piece of biological information that gets copied or replicated, and the copy or replica is passed on to the new <span class="underline">generation</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.81" data-time="121.19">[02:01.19]</span>So genes are defined as replicators.<span class="time" data-times="7.12" data-time="125">[02:05.00]</span> Genes are replicators that pass on information about properties and characteristics of organisms. <span class="time" data-times="12.37" data-time="132.12">[02:12.12]</span>By <span class="underline">analogy</span>, memes also get replicated and in the <span class="underline">process</span> pass on cultural information from person to person, <span class="underline">generation</span> to <span class="underline">generation</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.59" data-time="144.49">[02:24.49]</span>So memes are also replicators.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.21" data-time="147.08">[02:27.08]</span>To be a successful replicator, there are three key characteristics: <span class="underline">longevity</span>, fecundity and <span class="underline">fidelity</span>. <span class="time" data-times="1.77" data-time="157.29">[02:37.29]</span>Let's take a closer look. <span class="time" data-times="2.4" data-time="159.06">[02:39.06]</span>First, <span class="underline">longevity</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.01" data-time="161.46">[02:41.46]</span>A replicator must exist long enough to be able to get copied, and <span class="underline">transfer</span> its information. <span class="time" data-times="6.25" data-time="167.47">[02:47.47]</span>Clearly, the longer a replicator survives, the better its chances of getting its message copied and passed on. <span class="time" data-times="3.87" data-time="173.72">[02:53.72]</span>So <span class="underline">longevity</span> is a key <span class="underline">characteristic</span> of a replicator. <span class="time" data-times="7.01" data-time="177.59">[02:57.59]</span>If you take the alligator story, it can exist for a long time in <span class="underline">individual</span> memory, let's say, my memory. <span class="time" data-times="5.36" data-time="184.6">[03:04.60]</span>I can tell you the story now or ten years from now, the same with the twinkle, twinkle song. <span class="time" data-times="5.57" data-time="189.96">[03:09.96]</span>So these memes have <span class="underline">longevity</span> because they are memorable for one <span class="underline">reason</span> or another.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.91" data-time="195.53">[03:15.53]</span>Next, fecundity. <span class="time" data-times="3.96" data-time="197.44">[03:17.44]</span>Fecundity is the <span class="underline">ability</span> to <span class="underline">reproduce</span> in large numbers. <span class="time" data-times="10.18" data-time="201.4">[03:21.40]</span>For example, the <span class="underline">common</span> housefly reproduces by laying several thousand eggs, so each fly <span class="underline">gene</span> gets copied thousands of times. <span class="time" data-times="3.91" data-time="211.58">[03:31.58]</span>Memes, well, they can be reproduced in large numbers as well. <span class="time" data-times="3.57" data-time="215.49">[03:35.49]</span>How many times have you sung the 'twinkle, twinkle song' to someone? <span class="time" data-times="7.93" data-time="219.06">[03:39.06]</span>Each time you replicated the song, and maybe passed it <span class="underline">along</span> to someone who did not know it yet, a small child maybe.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.75" data-time="226.99">[03:46.99]</span>And finally, <span class="underline">fidelity</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.79" data-time="229.74">[03:49.74]</span> <span class="underline">Fidelity</span> means <span class="underline">accuracy</span> of the copying <span class="underline">process</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.16" data-time="234.53">[03:54.53]</span>We know <span class="underline">fidelity</span> is an <span class="underline">essential</span> <span class="underline">principle</span> of <span class="underline">genetic</span> transmission. <span class="time" data-times="6.42" data-time="239.69">[03:59.69]</span>If a copy of a <span class="underline">gene</span> is a bit different from the <span class="underline">original</span>, that's called a <span class="underline">genetic</span> <span class="underline">mutation</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.94" data-time="246.11">[04:06.11]</span>And mutations are usually bad news. <span class="time" data-times="4.02" data-time="249.05">[04:09.05]</span>An <span class="underline">organism</span> often cannot <span class="underline">survive</span> with a mutated <span class="underline">gene</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.62" data-time="253.07">[04:13.07]</span>And so a <span class="underline">gene</span> usually cannot be passed on, unless it's an <span class="underline">exact</span> copy.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.96" data-time="258.69">[04:18.69]</span>For memes however, <span class="underline">fidelity</span> is not always so important. <span class="time" data-times="8.98" data-time="263.65">[04:23.65]</span>For example, if you tell someone the alligator story I told you today, it probably won't be word for word exactly as I said it. <span class="time" data-times="6.83" data-time="272.63">[04:32.63]</span>Still, it will be basically the same story, and the person who hears the story will be able to pass it <span class="underline">along</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.69" data-time="279.46">[04:39.46]</span>Other memes are replicated with higher <span class="underline">fidelity</span> though, like the twinkle, twinkle song.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.31" data-time="285.15">[04:45.15]</span>It had the <span class="underline">exact</span> same words 20 years ago as it does now. <span class="time" data-times="7.07" data-time="289.46">[04:49.46]</span>Well, that's because we see songs as something that has to be performed accurately each time. <span class="time" data-times="3.98" data-time="296.53">[04:56.53]</span>If you change a word, the others will usually bring you in <span class="underline">line</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.13" data-time="300.51">[05:00.51]</span>They'll say, 'that's not how you sing it', right? <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="303.64">[05:03.64]</span>So, you can see how looking at pieces of cultural information as replicators, as memes, and analyzing them in terms of <span class="underline">longevity</span>, fecundity and <span class="underline">fidelity</span>, we can gain some <span class="underline">insight</span> about how they <span class="underline">spread</span>, <span class="underline">persist</span> or change.</p>
