Melanesia, in the southwest <span class="highlight">Pacific</span>, contains the large islands of New <span class="highlight">Guinea</span>, the Solomons, Vanuatu, and New Caledonia. Micronesia, the area north of Melanesia, consists <span class="highlight">primarily</span> of small <span class="highlight">scattered</span> islands. Polynesia is the central <span class="highlight">Pacific</span> area in the great <span class="highlight">triangle</span> defined by Hawaii, <span class="highlight">Easter</span> Island, and New Zealand. Before the arrival of Europeans, the islands in the two largest cultural areas, Polynesia and Micronesia, together contained a <span class="highlight">population</span> estimated at 700,000.</p><p>Speculation on the <span class="highlight">origin</span> of these <span class="highlight">Pacific</span> islanders began as soon as outsiders encountered them, in the <span class="highlight">absence</span> of <span class="highlight">solid</span><span class="highlight">linguistic</span>, <span class="highlight">archaeological</span>, and biological <span class="highlight">data</span>,
many fanciful and <span class="question2"><span class="highlight">mutually</span><span class="highlight">exclusive</span></span> theories were devised. <span class="highlight">Pacific</span> islanders are variously thought to have come from North America, South America, Egypt, Israel,
and India, as well as Southeast Asia. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>Many older theories implicitly deprecated the navigational abilities and <span class="highlight">overall</span> cultural <span class="highlight">creativity</span> of the <span class="highlight">Pacific</span> islanders.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>For example, British anthropologists G. Elliot Smith and W. J. Perry assumed that only Egyptians would have been skilled enough to <span class="highlight">navigate</span> and <span class="highlight">colonize</span> the <span class="highlight">Pacific</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>They inferred that the Egyptians <span class="highlight">even</span> crossed the <span class="highlight">Pacific</span> to found the great civilizations of the New World (North and South America). 
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>In 1947 Norwegian adventurer Thor Heyerdahl drifted on a balsa-log <span class="highlight">raft</span> westward with the winds and currents <span class="highlight">across</span> the <span class="highlight">Pacific</span> from South America to prove his <span class="highlight">theory</span> that 
<span class="highlight">Pacific</span> islanders were Native Americans (also called American Indians). Later Heyerdahl suggested that the <span class="highlight">Pacific</span> was peopled by three migrations:
by Native Americans from the <span class="highlight">Pacific</span> Northwest of North America drifting to Hawaii, by Peruvians drifting to <span class="highlight">Easter</span> Island, and by Melanesians. 
In 1969 he crossed the Atlantic in an Egyptian-style reed boat to prove Egyptian influences in the Americas. <span class="highlight">Contrary</span> to these theorists, 
the <span class="question3">overwhelming</span><span class="highlight">evidence</span> of <span class="highlight">physical</span><span class="highlight">anthropology</span>, linguistics, and <span class="highlight">archaeology</span> shows that the <span class="highlight">Pacific</span> islanders came from Southeast 
Asia and were skilled enough as navigators to sail against the <span class="highlight">prevailing</span> winds and currents.</p><p>The <span class="highlight">basic</span> cultural requirements for the successful <span class="highlight">colonization</span> of the <span class="highlight">Pacific</span> islands include the <span class="highlight">appropriate</span> boat-building, sailing, and <span class="highlight">navigation</span> skills to get to the islands in the first place, <span class="highlight">domesticated</span> plants and gardening skills suited to often marginal conditions, and a <span class="highlight">varied</span><span class="highlight">inventory</span> of fishing <span class="question6">implements</span> and techniques. It is now generally believed that these prerequisites originated with peoples speaking Austronesian languages (a group of several hundred related languages) and began to <span class="highlight">emerge</span> in Southeast Asia by about 5000 B.C.E. The <span class="highlight">culture</span> of that time, based on <span class="highlight">archaeology</span> and <span class="highlight">linguistic</span><span class="highlight">reconstruction</span>, is assumed to have had a <span class="highlight">broad</span><span class="highlight">inventory</span> of <span class="highlight">cultivated</span> plants including taro, yarns, banana, sugarcane, breadfruit, coconut, sago, and rice. Just as important, the <span class="highlight">culture</span> also possessed the <span class="highlight">basic</span><span class="highlight">foundation</span> for an <span class="highlight">effective</span><span class="highlight">maritime</span><span class="highlight">adaptation</span>, including outrigger canoes and a <span class="highlight">variety</span> of fishing techniques that could be <span class="highlight">effective</span> for <span class="highlight">overseas</span> voyaging.</p><p><span class="question9"><span class="highlight">Contrary</span> to the arguments of some that much of the <span class="highlight">pacific</span> was settled by Polynesians accidentally marooned after being lost and adrift, it seems <span class="highlight">reasonable</span> that this <span class="highlight">feat</span> was <span class="highlight">accomplished</span> by <span class="highlight">deliberate</span><span class="highlight">colonization</span> expeditions that set out fully stocked with food and <span class="highlight">domesticated</span> plants and animals.</span> Detailed studies of the winds and currents using computer simulations suggest that drifting canoes would have been a most <span class="highlight">unlikely</span> means of colonizing the <span class="highlight">Pacific</span>. These expeditions were likely driven by <span class="highlight">population</span> growth and <span class="highlight">political</span> dynamics on the home islands, as well as the <span class="highlight">challenge</span> and excitement of exploring unknown waters. Because all Polynesians, Micronesians, and many Melanesians speak Austronesian languages and grow crops derived from Southeast Asia, all these peoples most certainly derived from that <span class="highlight">region</span> and not the New World or elsewhere. The <span class="question10">undisputed</span> pre-Columbian presence in <span class="highlight">Oceania</span> of the sweet potato, which is a New World <span class="highlight">domesticate</span>, has sometimes been used to support Heyerdahl's "American Indians in the <span class="highlight">Pacific</span>" theories. However, this is one plant out of a long <span class="highlight">list</span> of Southeast Asian domesticates. As <span class="question12">Patrick Kirch</span>, an American <span class="highlight">anthropologist</span>, points out, rather than being brought by rafting South Americans, sweet potatoes might just have easily been brought back by returning <span class="highlight">Polynesian</span> navigators who could have reached the west <span class="highlight">coast</span> of South America.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 1, all of the following are true statements about Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia EXCEPT:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Collectively, these regions are traditionally known as Oceania.</p><p>B. These islands of Micronesia are small and spread out.</p><p>C. Hawaii, Easter Island, and New Zealand mark the boundaries of Polynesia.</p><p>D. Melanesia is situated to the north of Micronesia.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D AEXCEPT questions, exclusion. A corresponds to the part before the second comma of the first sentence, correct, not selected; B option corresponds to the second sentence, note that the scattered is spread out, so correct, not selected; and the second sentence is also opposite to the D option, it should be Micronesia In the north of Melanesia, so D is wrong, election; C option corresponds to the third sentence, correct, not selected.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>By stating that the theories are "<span class="highlight">mutually exclusive</span>" the author means that</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. if one of the theories is true, then all the others must be false</p><p>B. the differences between the theories are unimportant</p><p>C. taken together, the theories cover all possibilities</p><p>D. the theories support each other</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="mutually exclusive A"><p>Mutual: Common, exclusive think of exclude and think of include, so it is not included, exclusive, that the mutually exclusive meaning is incompatible, conflicting, so the answer should be A. Corresponding to the original: Formulation of the origin of these Pacific islanders began as soon as outsiders encountered them, in the absence of solid linguistic, archaeological, and biological data, many fanciful and mutually exclusive theories were devised. The foregoing stated that due to the lack of evidence Various kinds of imagination and what kind of theory are designed. From the perspective of context, there should be a wide variety of theories and different theories. Therefore, A's substitution is very much in line with this context.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question3">overwhelming</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. powerful</p><p>B. favorable</p><p>C. current</p><p>D. reasonable</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" A"><p>Overwhelming: Overwhelming, unstoppable, and over means over or over, so A is correct. The original text: Contrary to these theorists, the <span class="question3">overwhelming</span> evidence of physical anthropology, linguistics, and archaeology shows that the Pacific islanders came from Southeast Asia and were skilled enough as navigators to sail against the prevailing winds and currents. What kind of evidence shows that these Pacific Islanders come from Southeast Asia. First of all the original did not mention the concept of time, so the current is wrong; the original did not say before the unreasonable, so reasonable is not correct; favorable agree, tend to fly, but from the context of collocation and the overall context, or A degree Closer to the original word.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 2, which of the following led some early researchers to believe that the Pacific islanders originally came from Egypt?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Egyptians were known to have founded other great civilizations.</p><p>B. Sailors from other parts of the world were believed to lack the skills needed to travel across the ocean.</p><p>C. Linguistic, archaeological, and biological data connected the islands to Egypt.</p><p>D. Egyptian accounts claimed responsibility for colonizing the Pacific as well as the Americas.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B. With the Egypt and early researchers double-tracking the keywords back to the fourth sentence (For example), saying that two people think that only Egyptians have the ability to navigate to and occupy the islands of the Pacific Ocean. As for the latter part of the sentence, they are inferred by two people. Things are not answers, so A is wrong and B and C and D are not.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the following can be inferred from paragraph 2 about early theories of where the first inhabitants of the Pacific islands came from?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They were generally based on solid evidence.</p><p>B. They tried to account for the origin of the characteristic features of the languages spoken by Pacific islanders.</p><p>C. They assumed that the peoples living in Southeast Asia did not have the skills needed to sail to the Pacific islands.</p><p>D. They questioned the ideas of Elliot Smith and W. J. Perry.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C uses the keyword of early (older) theories to locate the third sentence, saying that the early theories considered that those islanders were not able to sail, followed by an example. That is, the phrase that was used to locate the previous question. Only Egyptians have the ability to sail. To and occupy these islands, so by example to prove that C is correct, Southeast Asians do not have the technical route to these islands; the original says no evidence, so A is against; B and D did not say.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question6">implements</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. skills</p><p>B. tools</p><p>C. opportunities</p><p>D. practices</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>Implement: (verb) implementation, execution; (noun) tool. The original is a noun. So B is correct. Corresponding to the original: The basic cultural requirements for the successful colonization of the Pacific islands include the appropriate boat-building, sailing, and navigation skills to get to the islands in the first place, domesticated plants and gardening skills suitable to often marginal conditions, and a Various inventory of fishing <span class="question6">implements</span> and techniques. The original sentence is tied to it in the technology, so the meaning should be close to but different from the technology, so A wrong; C and D can not be juxtaposed with technology, the most appropriate tools, tools and technology .</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>All of the following are mentioned in paragraph 3 as required for successful colonization of the Pacific islands EXCEPT</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. knowledge of various Austronesian languages</p><p>B. a variety of fishing techniques</p><p>C. navigational skills</p><p>D. knowledge of plant cultivation</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A EXCEPT question, exclusion method, B/C/D three answers are all in the first sentence. As soon as we say, the condition of successful colonization is blabla. The problem of A language is stated in the next sentence. It is not a condition, so A Wrong, choose.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>In paragraph 3, why does the author provide information about the types of crops grown and boats used in Southeast Asia during the period around 5000 B.C.E.?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To evaluate the relative importance of agriculture and fishing to early Austronesian peoples</p><p>B. To illustrate the effectiveness of archaeological and linguistic methods in discovering details about life in ancient times</p><p>C. To contrast living conditions on the continent of Asia with living conditions on the Pacific islands</p><p>D. To demonstrate that people from this region had the skills and resources necessary to travel to and survive on the Pacific islands</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The title of the function is targeted to the second sentence with 5000 BCE as the key word, but in fact the information about the crop of the species is in the third sentence of "The culture of that time". Looking to the second sentence, these preconditions are Some people in A language, that is to say A has the ability to occupy the Pacific island, the correct answer D.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Some people have argued that the Pacific was settled by traders who became lost while transporting domesticated plants and animals.</p><p>B. The original Polynesian settlers were probably marooned on the islands, but they may have been joined later by carefully prepared colonization expeditions.</p><p>C. Although it seems reasonable to believe that colonization expeditions would set out fully stocked, this is contradicted by much of the evidence.</p><p>D. The settlement of the Pacific islands was probably intentional and well planned rather than accidental as some people have proposed.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The main logic of the D original sentence is opposite, while the content of the contrast to guide is relatively minor, the main content is the latter half of the sentence. The original sentence says: This feat was accomplished through intentional occupation. We do not know deliberately and look behind the explanation. It is filled with things, of course, prepared; instead of being accidentally intended to occupy. A said that these people were lost on these islands, and they opposed; B said that two groups of people, the first batch were lost, and later they were filled with things to join them, contradicting the logic of the original text, and the content was larger, jioned later The meaning of the original was arbitrarily rewritten; C also said that lost, note that the text behind the although is contrary to the true meaning of the sentence; so only the D pair.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question10">undisputed</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. mysterious</p><p>B. unexpected</p><p>C. acknowledged</p><p>D. significant</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" C"><p>Dispute: Debate, <span class="question10">undisputed</span>: irrefutable, no doubt. So C's acknowledged (widely acknowledged) is correct. A is mysterious; B is unexpected and unexpected; D is significant and meaningful. The original text: The <span class="question10">undisputed</span> pre-Columbian presence in Oceania of the sweet potato, which is a New World domesticate, has sometimes been used to support Heyerdahl's "American Indians in the Pacific" theories. Someone's theory, AB is obviously not reliable, significant seems to be correct, but has nothing to do with the meaning of dispute, nor right.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, which of the following is NOT an explanation for why a group of people might have wanted to colonize the Pacific islands?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. As their numbers increased, they needed additional territory.</p><p>B. The winds and currents made the islands easy to reach.</p><p>C. The political situation at home made emigration desirable.</p><p>D. They found exploration challenging and exciting.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>EXCEPT questions, exclusions, and ACD all target the third sentence: These expeditions were likely driven by population growth and political dynamics on the home islands, as well as the challenge and excitement of exploring unknown waters. The third sentence of the original population of population growth; correct, not selected; C's political situation at home corresponds to the third sentence of the political dynamics on the home islands, correct, not selected; D option of challenging and exciting corresponding to the third sentence of the challenge And excitement, correct, not selected; B did not say, choose.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the author mention the views of "<span class="highlight"><span class="question12">Patrick Kirch</span></span>"</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To present evidence in favor of Heyerdahl's idea about American Indians reaching Oceania</p><p>B. To emphasize the familiarity of Pacific islanders with crops from many different regions of the world</p><p>C. To indicate that supposed proof for Heyerdahl's theory has an alternative explanation</p><p>D. To demonstrate that some of the same crops were cultivated in both South America and Oceania</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" C"><p>For the purpose of the function, look forward. The sentence of howe has a close connection with the preceding sentence, so look ahead. Say that the emergence of sweet potatoes supports H's theory, followed by a turning point, indicating that PK's point of view does not support H's point of view, A's back; C's alternative explanation is correct; B and D did not say.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Later theories concentrate on journeys in the other direction..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D Two transition points, lateer theories and other direction. According to the Later Theories, A must be wrong. The old theory has not yet said that new theories cannot be introduced; for example after B and they after C all indicate that the transitions between these two places are very close, and no sentence can be inserted. D is correct; and D said before that from Egypt to South America, D said after starting from South America, just corresponds to the other direction in the insert sentence.</p></div></div><div id="question14" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>Together, Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia make up the region described as the Pacific islands, or Oceania.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.The first Europeans to reach the area assumed that the islands' original inhabitants must have drifted to Oceania, perhaps from Egypt or the Americas.</p><p>B.It is now believed that the process of colonization required a great deal of skill, determination, and planning and could not have happened by chance.</p><p>C.Using linguistic and archaeological evidence, anthropologists have determined that the first Pacific islanders were Austronesian people from Southeast Asia.</p><p>D.New evidence suggests that, rather than being isolated, Pacific islanders engaged in trade and social interaction with peoples living in Southeast Asia.</p><p>E.Computer simulations of the winds and currents in the Pacific have shown that reaching the Pacific islands was probably much easier than previously thought.</p><p>F.Although early colonizers of the islands probably came from agriculture-based societies, they were obliged to adopt an economy based on fishing.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="ABC"><p>From the title of the article, we can see that it may be a phenomenon explanation and an explanation of the origin of Pacific Islanders.</p><p>The first paragraph introduces the geographical background information of the Pacific, population information.</p><p>The second paragraph introduces early research on the origin of the islanders. The last sentence refutes these early theories with evidence.</p><p>The three paragraphs said that the technical conditions for early voyages arrived here, saying that A people from Southeast Asia had these conditions.</p><p>The fourth paragraph continues the three paragraphs and says that A's navigational motivations, and the current study refutes earlier studies.</p><p>The guide sentence is a summary of the first paragraph of background information. The correct answer should be the subject of the subsequent paragraphs.</p><p>The A (the first) option corresponds to the first half of the second paragraph of the original text, correct.</p><p>The B (it is now) option corresponds to the third paragraph of the original text, correct.</p><p>The C(using) option corresponds to the last sentence and the third and fourth paragraphs of the second paragraph of the original text. It is correct.</p><p>The D (new) option is wrong. The original article just said that the sweet potatoes may have been brought from South America, and it was also suggested that the islanders could bring them back with themselves. It was not a trade, not an election.</p><p>E (although) options did not say the original, do not choose.</p><p>The F (computer) option contradicts one of the details in the fourth paragraph. The original text says drifting conoes would have been a most unwanted means. It is not easier.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
