            <b>The Origin of the Pacific Island People</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>The greater <span class="underline">Pacific</span> <span class="underline">region</span>, traditionally called <span class="underline">Oceania</span>, consists of three cultural areas: Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia. Melanesia, in the southwest <span class="underline">Pacific</span>, contains the large islands of New <span class="underline">Guinea</span>, the Solomons, Vanuatu, and New Caledonia. Micronesia, the area north of Melanesia, consists <span class="underline">primarily</span> of small <span class="underline">scattered</span> islands. Polynesia is the central <span class="underline">Pacific</span> area in the great <span class="underline">triangle</span> defined by Hawaii, <span class="underline">Easter</span> Island, and New Zealand. Before the arrival of Europeans, the islands in the two largest cultural areas, Polynesia and Micronesia, together contained a <span class="underline">population</span> estimated at 700,000.</p>
          <p>Speculation on the <span class="underline">origin</span> of these <span class="underline">Pacific</span> islanders began as soon as outsiders encountered them, in the <span class="underline">absence</span> of <span class="underline">solid</span> <span class="underline">linguistic</span>, <span class="underline">archaeological</span>, and biological <span class="underline">data</span>,
many fanciful and <span class="underline">mutually</span> <span class="underline">exclusive</span> theories were devised. <span class="underline">Pacific</span> islanders are variously thought to have come from North America, South America, Egypt, Israel,
and India, as well as Southeast Asia. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>Many older theories implicitly deprecated the navigational abilities and <span class="underline">overall</span> cultural <span class="underline">creativity</span> of the <span class="underline">Pacific</span> islanders.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>For example, British anthropologists G. Elliot Smith and W. J. Perry assumed that only Egyptians would have been skilled enough to <span class="underline">navigate</span> and <span class="underline">colonize</span> the <span class="underline">Pacific</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>They inferred that the Egyptians <span class="underline">even</span> crossed the <span class="underline">Pacific</span> to found the great civilizations of the New World (North and South America). 
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>In 1947 Norwegian adventurer Thor Heyerdahl drifted on a balsa-log <span class="underline">raft</span> westward with the winds and currents <span class="underline">across</span> the <span class="underline">Pacific</span> from South America to prove his <span class="underline">theory</span> that 
<span class="underline">Pacific</span> islanders were Native Americans (also called American Indians). Later Heyerdahl suggested that the <span class="underline">Pacific</span> was peopled by three migrations:
by Native Americans from the <span class="underline">Pacific</span> Northwest of North America drifting to Hawaii, by Peruvians drifting to <span class="underline">Easter</span> Island, and by Melanesians. 
In 1969 he crossed the Atlantic in an Egyptian-style reed boat to prove Egyptian influences in the Americas. <span class="underline">Contrary</span> to these theorists, 
the overwhelming <span class="underline">evidence</span> of <span class="underline">physical</span> <span class="underline">anthropology</span>, linguistics, and <span class="underline">archaeology</span> shows that the <span class="underline">Pacific</span> islanders came from Southeast 
Asia and were skilled enough as navigators to sail against the <span class="underline">prevailing</span> winds and currents.</p>
          <p>The <span class="underline">basic</span> cultural requirements for the successful <span class="underline">colonization</span> of the <span class="underline">Pacific</span> islands include the <span class="underline">appropriate</span> boat-building, sailing, and <span class="underline">navigation</span> skills to get to the islands in the first place, <span class="underline">domesticated</span> plants and gardening skills suited to often marginal conditions, and a <span class="underline">varied</span> <span class="underline">inventory</span> of fishing implements and techniques. It is now generally believed that these prerequisites originated with peoples speaking Austronesian languages (a group of several hundred related languages) and began to <span class="underline">emerge</span> in Southeast Asia by about 5000 B.C.E. The <span class="underline">culture</span> of that time, based on <span class="underline">archaeology</span> and <span class="underline">linguistic</span> <span class="underline">reconstruction</span>, is assumed to have had a <span class="underline">broad</span> <span class="underline">inventory</span> of <span class="underline">cultivated</span> plants including taro, yarns, banana, sugarcane, breadfruit, coconut, sago, and rice. Just as important, the <span class="underline">culture</span> also possessed the <span class="underline">basic</span> <span class="underline">foundation</span> for an <span class="underline">effective</span> <span class="underline">maritime</span> <span class="underline">adaptation</span>, including outrigger canoes and a <span class="underline">variety</span> of fishing techniques that could be <span class="underline">effective</span> for <span class="underline">overseas</span> voyaging.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="underline">Contrary</span> to the arguments of some that much of the <span class="underline">pacific</span> was settled by Polynesians accidentally marooned after being lost and adrift, it seems <span class="underline">reasonable</span> that this <span class="underline">feat</span> was <span class="underline">accomplished</span> by <span class="underline">deliberate</span> <span class="underline">colonization</span> expeditions that set out fully stocked with food and <span class="underline">domesticated</span> plants and animals. Detailed studies of the winds and currents using computer simulations suggest that drifting canoes would have been a most <span class="underline">unlikely</span> means of colonizing the <span class="underline">Pacific</span>. These expeditions were likely driven by <span class="underline">population</span> growth and <span class="underline">political</span> dynamics on the home islands, as well as the <span class="underline">challenge</span> and excitement of exploring unknown waters. Because all Polynesians, Micronesians, and many Melanesians speak Austronesian languages and grow crops derived from Southeast Asia, all these peoples most certainly derived from that <span class="underline">region</span> and not the New World or elsewhere. The undisputed pre-Columbian presence in <span class="underline">Oceania</span> of the sweet potato, which is a New World <span class="underline">domesticate</span>, has sometimes been used to support Heyerdahl's "American Indians in the <span class="underline">Pacific</span>" theories. However, this is one plant out of a long <span class="underline">list</span> of Southeast Asian domesticates. As Patrick Kirch, an American <span class="underline">anthropologist</span>, points out, rather than being brought by rafting South Americans, sweet potatoes might just have easily been brought back by returning <span class="underline">Polynesian</span> navigators who could have reached the west <span class="underline">coast</span> of South America.</p>
