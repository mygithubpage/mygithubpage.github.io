        <article>
          <p>Listen to a conversation between two students.</p>
          <p>(man) Susan, what happened to your arm?</p>
          <p>(woman) It's my wrist, actually. I sprained it last weekend and I am kind of upset about it because I'm supposed to play the violin in my string quartet's big concert next week. We've been practicing for weeks and we've already sold a bunch of tickets.</p>
          <p>(man) Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. What are you gonna do?</p>
          <p>(woman) Well, I was thinking about trying to play anyway, I mean, I really don't want to let the other three group members down. Plus the doctor said my wrist should be feeling better by then.</p>
          <p>(man) Oh, OK, so problem solved, right?</p>
          <p>(woman) Not exactly. I'm worried I'm gonna be out of practice, like I haven't been able to play the violin since I sprained my wrist. What if I don't play well? I'd make the rest of the group sound bad.</p>
          <p>(man) Why don't you get somebody else to take your place?</p>
          <p>(woman) Well, there's only one other person I know who could do it and that's Jim. He's a great violinist and I'm sure he'd say yes. The thing is he's not very reliable. I mean, I'm in the orchestra with him and he's always showing up late for rehearsals.</p>
          <p>(man) Oh, so you're not sure you can depend on him.</p>
          <p>(woman) Exactly, and we have less than a week left to rehearse for the concert. We'd really need him to show up on time for all our rehearsals.</p>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>Well, the woman's problem is that she sprained her wrist but she's supposed to play the violin in her string quartet's big concert next week. Accordingly she is thinking that maybe she could try playing anyway, or as the man suggested she should get someone to replace her. Well, I guess the woman should find some substitute for her quartet instead of playing by herself anyway. For one thing, sprained wrist is definitely a disaster for any violin player. If she does not take enough rest to recover her wrist completely, she'll probably risk herself with some unpleasant consequences that she would feel sorry for some day in the future. Second, finding a substitude player will do good to her team. After all, a successful concert depends on healthy players' team-work. So based on the reasons given above I think finding someone to replace the woman would be a better idea. (150 words)</p>
