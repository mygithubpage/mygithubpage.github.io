The soil is the <span class="highlight">source</span> of these minerals, which are absorbed by the plant with the water from the soil. <span class="highlight">Even</span><span class="highlight">nitrogen</span>, which is a gas in its elemental <span class="highlight">state</span>, is <span class="highlight">normally</span> absorbed from the soil as <span class="highlight">nitrate</span> ions. Some soils are notoriously <span class="highlight">deficient</span> in micro nutrients and are <span class="highlight">therefore</span> unable to support most plant life. So-called serpentine soils, for example, are <span class="highlight">deficient</span> in <span class="highlight">calcium</span>, and only plants able to <span class="highlight">tolerate</span> low levels of this <span class="highlight">mineral</span> can <span class="highlight">survive</span>. In modern <span class="highlight">agriculture</span>, <span class="highlight">mineral</span> depletion of soils is a <span class="highlight">major</span><span class="highlight">concern</span>, since harvesting crops interrupts the recycling of nutrients back to the soil.</p><p><span class="highlight">Mineral</span> deficiencies can often be detected by <span class="highlight">specific</span> symptoms such as chlorosis (loss of <span class="highlight">chlorophyll</span> resulting in yellow or white leaf <span class="highlight">tissue</span>), necrosis (<span class="highlight">isolated</span> dead patches), anthocyanin <span class="highlight">formation</span> (<span class="highlight">development</span> of deep red <span class="highlight">pigmentation</span> of leaves or <span class="highlight">stem</span>), stunted growth, and <span class="highlight">development</span> of woody <span class="highlight">tissue</span> in an <span class="highlight">herbaceous</span> plant. Soils are most commonly <span class="highlight">deficient</span> in <span class="highlight">nitrogen</span> and <span class="highlight">phosphorus</span>. Nitrogen-deficient plants <span class="highlight"><span class="question2">exhibit</span></span> many of the symptoms just described. Leaves develop chlorosis; stems are short and <span class="highlight">slender</span>, and anthocyanin discoloration occurs on stems, petioles, and <span class="highlight">lower</span> leaf surfaces. Phosphorus-deficient plants are often stunted, with leaves turning a <span class="highlight">characteristic</span> dark green, often with the <span class="highlight">accumulation</span> of anthocyanin. Typically, older leaves are affected first as the <span class="highlight">phosphorus</span> is mobilized to young growing <span class="highlight">tissue</span>. Iron <span class="highlight">deficiency</span> is characterized by chlorosis between veins in young leaves.</p><p>Much of the research on <span class="highlight">nutrient</span> deficiencies is based on growing plants hydroponically, that is, in soilless <span class="highlight">liquid</span><span class="highlight">nutrient</span> solutions. This <span class="highlight">technique</span> allows researchers to create solutions that selectively <span class="highlight">omit</span> certain nutrients and then <span class="highlight">observe</span> the resulting effects on the plants. Hydroponics has applications beyond <span class="highlight">basic</span> research, since it <span class="question5">facilitates</span> the growing of greenhouse vegetables during winter. Aeroponics, a <span class="highlight">technique</span> in which plants are <span class="highlight"><span class="question7">suspended</span></span> and the roots misted with a <span class="highlight">nutrient</span><span class="highlight">solution</span>, is another <span class="highlight">method</span> for growing plants without soil.</p><p>While <span class="highlight">mineral</span> deficiencies can limit the growth of plants, an overabundance of certain minerals can be <span class="highlight">toxic</span> and can also limit growth. Saline soils, which have high concentrations of <span class="highlight">sodium</span> chloride and other salts, limit plant growth, and research continues to <span class="highlight">focus</span> on developing salt-tolerant varieties of agricultural crops. Research has focused on the <span class="highlight">toxic</span> effects of heavy metals such as <span class="highlight">lead</span>, cadmium, <span class="highlight">mercury</span>, and <span class="highlight">aluminum</span>; however, <span class="highlight">even</span><span class="highlight">copper</span> and <span class="highlight">zinc</span>, which are <span class="highlight">essential</span> elements, can become <span class="highlight">toxic</span> in high concentrations. Although most plants cannot <span class="highlight">survive</span> in these soils, certain plants have the <span class="highlight">ability</span> to <span class="highlight">tolerate</span> high levels of these minerals.</p><p>Scientists have known for some time that certain plants, called hyperaccumulators, can <span class="highlight">concentrate</span> minerals at levels a hundredfold or greater than normal.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>A <span class="highlight">survey</span> of known hyperaccumulators identified that 75 percent of them amassed <span class="highlight">nickel</span>, cobalt, <span class="highlight">copper</span>, <span class="highlight">zinc</span>, manganese, <span class="highlight">lead</span>, and cadmium are other minerals of choice.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>Hyperaccumulators run the entire <span class="highlight">range</span> of the plant world. 
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>They may be herbs, shrubs, or trees. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>Many members of the mustard family, spurge family, <span class="highlight">legume</span> family, and grass family are top hyperaccumulators.
Many are found in <span class="highlight">tropical</span> and subtropical areas of the world, where <span class="highlight">accumulation</span> of high concentrations of metals may <span class="highlight"><span class="question9">afford</span></span> some protection against plant-eating insects and microbial pathogens.</p><p>Only recently have investigators considered using these plants to clean up soil and <span class="highlight">waste</span> sites that have been contaminated by <span class="highlight">toxic</span> levels of heavy metalsï¿½an environmentally friendly <span class="highlight">approach</span> known as phytoremediation. <span class="question10">This <span class="highlight">scenario</span> begins with the planting of hyperaccumulating <span class="highlight">species</span> in the <span class="highlight">target</span> area, such as an abandoned <span class="highlight">mine</span> or an <span class="highlight">irrigation</span> pond contaminated by <span class="highlight">runoff</span>.</span><span class="highlight">Toxic</span> minerals would first be absorbed by roots but later relocated to the <span class="highlight">stem</span> and leaves. A <span class="highlight">harvest</span> of the shoots would remove the <span class="highlight">toxic</span> compounds off site to be burned or composted to <span class="highlight">recover</span> the metal for <span class="highlight">industrial</span> uses. After several years of <span class="highlight">cultivation</span> and <span class="highlight">harvest</span>, the site would be restored at a <span class="highlight">cost</span> much <span class="highlight">lower</span> than the price of <span class="highlight">excavation</span> and reburial, the <span class="highlight">standard</span> practice for <span class="highlight">remediation</span> of contaminated soils. For examples, in <span class="highlight">field</span> trials, the plant <span class="highlight">alpine</span> pennycress removed <span class="highlight">zinc</span> and cadmium from soils near a <span class="highlight">zinc</span> smelter, and <span class="question12">Indian mustard</span>, native to Pakistan and India, has been <span class="highlight">effective</span> in reducing levels of selenium salts by 50 percent in contaminated soils.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 1, what is true of plants that can grow in serpentine soil?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They absorb micronutrients unusually well.</p><p>B. They require far less calcium than most plants do.</p><p>C. They are able to absorb nitrogen in its elemental state.</p><p>D. They are typically crops raised for food.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B. The serpentine soil was used as the key word to locate the penultimate sentence. This kind of soil lacks calcium, and only plants with low calcium requirements can survive. The question asked what kind of plant can survive, so B is correct. A micronutrients did not say, C's nitrogen and elemental state have nothing to do with the problem, D; food of D did not say.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question2">exhibit</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. fight off</p><p>B. show</p><p>C. cause</p><p>D. spread</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>B <span class="question2">exhibit</span>: Display, show. B is the show, shows; C is the cause; D is the spread. So B's show is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 2, which of the following symptoms occurs in phosphorus-deficient plants but not in plants deficient in nitrogen or iron?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Chlorosis on leaves</p><p>B. Change in leaf pigmentation to a dark shade of green</p><p>C. Short, stunted appearance of stems</p><p>D. Reddish pigmentation on the leaves or stem</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B. Positioning the keyword to phosphorus-deficient plants to the penultimate sentence. Phosphorus-deficient, phosphorus-deficient plants are easy to fall, and leaves will turn dark green, B is the answer. The chlorosis chlorosis in A, the discoloration disease did not say; the stem in C was very short and the original did not say; the original reddish pigmentation in D did not say.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 2, a symptom of iron deficiency is the presence in young leaves of</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. deep red discoloration between the veins</p><p>B. white or yellow tissue between the veins</p><p>C. dead spots between the veins</p><p>D. characteristic dark green veins</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B. With iron deficiency and young leaves as the key words to the last sentence, the chlorosis discoloration disease, chlorosis, so the B white or yellow tissue just right. A deep red did not say, wrong; C's dead spots original did not say, wrong; D's dark green is the lack of phosphorus symptoms, wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question5">facilitates</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. slows down</p><p>B. affects</p><p>C. makes easier</p><p>D. focuses on</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" C"><p>Facilitate: Help, help, make it easy. A is slow; B is affect; C is easy; D is focused. So C's makes easier. The original sentence: Hydroponics has applications beyond basic research, since it <span class="question5">facilitates</span> the growing of greenhouse vegetables during winter. The original sentence says that hydroponic has other applications besides basic research. It is the actual application. Grow. From an emotional point of view, this place requires a positive word, A's slow down and B's affect are not correct. Focus on does not work, is a neutral word, must be positive, so the answer is to make easier.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 3, what is the advantage of hydroponics for research on nutrient deficiencies in plants?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It allows researchers to control what nutrients a plant receives.</p><p>B. It allows researchers to observe the growth of a large number of plants simultaneously.</p><p>C. It is possible to directly observe the roots of plants.</p><p>D. It is unnecessary to keep misting plants with nutrient solutions.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The keyword is targeted to the first sentence with the nutrient deficiency, but the first sentence only defines this soilless culture, and the second sentence starts to say that: This technique allows researchers to create solutions that selective omit certain nutrients and then observe The resulting effects on the plants. enable researchers to intentionally remove some of the nutrients and then look at the effects, that is, what A said can choose to allow the plants to absorb what nutrients; the other three are completely silent.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question7">suspended</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. grown</p><p>B. protected</p><p>C. spread out</p><p>D. hung</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" D"><p>Suspend: hanging, hanging. A is planted; B is protected; C is unfolded and rolled out; D is hanging. So D's hung is the correct answer. Corresponding to the original: Aeroponics, a technique in which plants are <span class="question7">suspended</span> and the roots misted with a nutrient solution, is another method for growing plants without soil. The original sentence in the acroponics means air cultivation, acro stands for vacant, so the following explanation is to How about plants, and with the rear of the mist, mist mixed. Mixing and growing can not be tied, grow wrong; the same spread of C is not right; protect is completely unreliable.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the author mention "herbs", "shrubs", and "trees"?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To provide examples of plant types that cannot tolerate high levels of harmful minerals.</p><p>B. To show why so many plants are hyperaccumulators.</p><p>C. To help explain why hyperaccumulators can be found in so many different places.</p><p>D. To emphasize that hyperaccumulators occur in a wide range of plant types.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The purpose of the function, and there is a word in this sentence, referring to the previous article, the previous look, said that HA is widely distributed throughout the plant community, the latter several plants are examples of HA, so the answer is D. A said can not tolerate back; the original did not say the reason, so B/C is wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question9">afford</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. offer</p><p>B. prevent</p><p>C. increase</p><p>D. remove</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" A"><p>Give: Give, give. A is provided; B is prevented; C is increased; D is one. So offer is given as the correct answer. Corresponding to the original: Many are found in tropical and subtropical areas of the world, where accumulation of high concentrations of metals may <span class="question9">afford</span> some protection against plant-eating insects and microbial pathogens. Many species are found in tropical and subtropical regions where high concentrations of metals are How can the plants be protected from predation by plant-eating insects? From the original point of view, high concentrations of metals should have played a positive role. B's prevent protection and D's removal protection are certainly not correct; increase protection is increased on the basis of the original, the original did not say that the original protection, so the wrong wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Before considering phytoremediation, hyperaccumulating species of plants local to the target area must be identified.</p><p>B. The investigation begins with an evaluation of toxic sites in the target area to determine the extent of contamination.</p><p>C. The first step in phytoremediation is the planting of hyperaccumulating plants in the area to be cleaned up.</p><p>D. Mines and irrigation ponds can be kept from becoming contaminated by planting hyperaccumulating species in targeted areas.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The main part of this sentence C is not long, such as behind the beginning of the example, you can ignore the first look. The trunk said: This program starts with planting species. Begin by... Corresponding to the first step of the C option, C is correct. Before in A was not said, the original text has been saying what this thing started, why did it not be said before this matter; the original has a hard-to-replace word HAS, and this word is not in B's answer, so B's wrong ;C Synonymous substitution, correct; D turns the example in the inside into the main part of the sentence, changing the structure, wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>It can be inferred from paragraph 6 that compared with standard practices for remediation of contaminated soils, phytoremediation</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. does not allow for the use of the removed minerals for industrial purposes</p><p>B. can be faster to implement</p><p>C. is equally friendly to the environment</p><p>D. is less suitable for soils that need to be used within a short period of time</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D. Use the contaminated soil and remediation as the key words to locate the penultimate sentence. After several years of cultivation and harvesting, the place will be restored, indicating that it cannot be restored without years. Therefore, D is correct. A/C has no relevant information; B said that it should be the traditional method of mining faster, and the new method of planting plants is slow.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the author mention "<span class="highlight"><span class="question12">Indian mustard</span></span>"?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To warn about possible risks involved in phytoremediation</p><p>B. To help illustrate the potential of phytoremediation</p><p>C.

To explain how zinc contamination can be reduced</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>For the purpose of the function, <span class="question12">Indian mustard</span> is targeted to the last sentence. This sentence is an example, and the previous sentence is an example. Going forward is the same sentence as above, which means that after several years of cultivation and harvesting, that place will become better, which is how this method is useful, so the answer B is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Certain minerals are more likely to be accumulated in large quantities than others..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A Three transition points, certain minerals, large quantities, and pronouns other, there are only two options for Mineral with A and B; after entering, it is found that A is correct, and the inserted sentence says that some minerals are more easily deposited than other minerals. The second sentence of the original sentence is an interpretation of the sentence to be inserted, so it should be placed after the sentence to be inserted, so A is wrong with B.</p></div></div><div id="question14" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>Plants need to absorb certain minerals from the soil in adequate quantities for normal growth and develop.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.Some plants are able to accumulate extremely high levels of certain minerals and thus can be used to clean up soils contaminated with toxic levels of these minerals.</p><p>B.Though beneficial in lower levels, high levels of salts, other minerals, and heavy metals can be harmful to plants.</p><p>C.When plants do not absorb sufficient amounts of essential minerals, characteristic abnormalities result.</p><p>D.Because high concentrations of sodium chloride and other salts limit growth in most plants, much research has been done in an effort to develop salt-tolerant agricultural crops.</p><p>E.Some plants can tolerate comparatively low levels of certain minerals, but such plants are of little use for recycling nutrients back into depleted soils.</p><p>F.Mineral deficiencies in many plants can be cured by misting their roots with a nutrient solution or by transferring the plants to a soilless nutrient solution.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="ABC"><p>A.B.C can be roughly guessed from the title of the article that there may be several directions. The importance of matter to plants Several aspects of the description / why it is particularly important to explain / lack of material or too many solutions.</p><p>The first paragraph roughly stated the importance of matter to plants.</p><p>The second paragraph describes the symptoms of substance deficiency.</p><p>The third paragraph introduces the research method of substance deficiency mentioned in the second paragraph: control variables</p><p>The fourth paragraph said that too much material harm to plants.</p><p>The five-stage specific plant can be used to absorb substances, and what is actually said is a possible solution to the problem.</p><p>The last paragraph is about the specific operation of the five-stage solution and the latest progress.</p><p>The quoting sentence summarizes the first paragraph.
