            <b>Minerals and Plants</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>Research has shown that certain minerals are required by plants for normal growth and <span class="underline">development</span>. The soil is the <span class="underline">source</span> of these minerals, which are absorbed by the plant with the water from the soil. <span class="underline">Even</span> <span class="underline">nitrogen</span>, which is a gas in its elemental <span class="underline">state</span>, is <span class="underline">normally</span> absorbed from the soil as <span class="underline">nitrate</span> ions. Some soils are notoriously <span class="underline">deficient</span> in micro nutrients and are <span class="underline">therefore</span> unable to support most plant life. So-called serpentine soils, for example, are <span class="underline">deficient</span> in <span class="underline">calcium</span>, and only plants able to <span class="underline">tolerate</span> low levels of this <span class="underline">mineral</span> can <span class="underline">survive</span>. In modern <span class="underline">agriculture</span>, <span class="underline">mineral</span> depletion of soils is a <span class="underline">major</span> <span class="underline">concern</span>, since harvesting crops interrupts the recycling of nutrients back to the soil.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="underline">Mineral</span> deficiencies can often be detected by <span class="underline">specific</span> symptoms such as chlorosis (loss of <span class="underline">chlorophyll</span> resulting in yellow or white leaf <span class="underline">tissue</span>), necrosis (<span class="underline">isolated</span> dead patches), anthocyanin <span class="underline">formation</span> (<span class="underline">development</span> of deep red <span class="underline">pigmentation</span> of leaves or <span class="underline">stem</span>), stunted growth, and <span class="underline">development</span> of woody <span class="underline">tissue</span> in an <span class="underline">herbaceous</span> plant. Soils are most commonly <span class="underline">deficient</span> in <span class="underline">nitrogen</span> and <span class="underline">phosphorus</span>. Nitrogen-deficient plants <span class="underline">exhibit</span> many of the symptoms just described. Leaves develop chlorosis; stems are short and <span class="underline">slender</span>, and anthocyanin discoloration occurs on stems, petioles, and <span class="underline">lower</span> leaf surfaces. Phosphorus-deficient plants are often stunted, with leaves turning a <span class="underline">characteristic</span> dark green, often with the <span class="underline">accumulation</span> of anthocyanin. Typically, older leaves are affected first as the <span class="underline">phosphorus</span> is mobilized to young growing <span class="underline">tissue</span>. Iron <span class="underline">deficiency</span> is characterized by chlorosis between veins in young leaves.</p>
          <p>Much of the research on <span class="underline">nutrient</span> deficiencies is based on growing plants hydroponically, that is, in soilless <span class="underline">liquid</span> <span class="underline">nutrient</span> solutions. This <span class="underline">technique</span> allows researchers to create solutions that selectively <span class="underline">omit</span> certain nutrients and then <span class="underline">observe</span> the resulting effects on the plants. Hydroponics has applications beyond <span class="underline">basic</span> research, since it facilitates the growing of greenhouse vegetables during winter. Aeroponics, a <span class="underline">technique</span> in which plants are <span class="underline">suspended</span> and the roots misted with a <span class="underline">nutrient</span> <span class="underline">solution</span>, is another <span class="underline">method</span> for growing plants without soil.</p>
          <p>While <span class="underline">mineral</span> deficiencies can limit the growth of plants, an overabundance of certain minerals can be <span class="underline">toxic</span> and can also limit growth. Saline soils, which have high concentrations of <span class="underline">sodium</span> chloride and other salts, limit plant growth, and research continues to <span class="underline">focus</span> on developing salt-tolerant varieties of agricultural crops. Research has focused on the <span class="underline">toxic</span> effects of heavy metals such as <span class="underline">lead</span>, cadmium, <span class="underline">mercury</span>, and <span class="underline">aluminum</span>; however, <span class="underline">even</span> <span class="underline">copper</span> and <span class="underline">zinc</span>, which are <span class="underline">essential</span> elements, can become <span class="underline">toxic</span> in high concentrations. Although most plants cannot <span class="underline">survive</span> in these soils, certain plants have the <span class="underline">ability</span> to <span class="underline">tolerate</span> high levels of these minerals.</p>
          <p>Scientists have known for some time that certain plants, called hyperaccumulators, can <span class="underline">concentrate</span> minerals at levels a hundredfold or greater than normal.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>A <span class="underline">survey</span> of known hyperaccumulators identified that 75 percent of them amassed <span class="underline">nickel</span>, cobalt, <span class="underline">copper</span>, <span class="underline">zinc</span>, manganese, <span class="underline">lead</span>, and cadmium are other minerals of choice.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>Hyperaccumulators run the entire <span class="underline">range</span> of the plant world. 
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>They may be herbs, shrubs, or trees. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>Many members of the mustard family, spurge family, <span class="underline">legume</span> family, and grass family are top hyperaccumulators.
Many are found in <span class="underline">tropical</span> and subtropical areas of the world, where <span class="underline">accumulation</span> of high concentrations of metals may <span class="underline">afford</span> some protection against plant-eating insects and microbial pathogens.</p>
          <p>Only recently have investigators considered using these plants to clean up soil and <span class="underline">waste</span> sites that have been contaminated by <span class="underline">toxic</span> levels of heavy metals–an environmentally friendly <span class="underline">approach</span> known as phytoremediation. This <span class="underline">scenario</span> begins with the planting of hyperaccumulating <span class="underline">species</span> in the <span class="underline">target</span> area, such as an abandoned <span class="underline">mine</span> or an <span class="underline">irrigation</span> pond contaminated by <span class="underline">runoff</span>. <span class="underline">Toxic</span> minerals would first be absorbed by roots but later relocated to the <span class="underline">stem</span> and leaves. A <span class="underline">harvest</span> of the shoots would remove the <span class="underline">toxic</span> compounds off site to be burned or composted to <span class="underline">recover</span> the metal for <span class="underline">industrial</span> uses. After several years of <span class="underline">cultivation</span> and <span class="underline">harvest</span>, the site would be restored at a <span class="underline">cost</span> much <span class="underline">lower</span> than the price of <span class="underline">excavation</span> and reburial, the <span class="underline">standard</span> practice for <span class="underline">remediation</span> of contaminated soils. For examples, in <span class="underline">field</span> trials, the plant <span class="underline">alpine</span> pennycress removed <span class="underline">zinc</span> and cadmium from soils near a <span class="underline">zinc</span> smelter, and Indian mustard, native to Pakistan and India, has been <span class="underline">effective</span> in reducing levels of selenium salts by 50 percent in contaminated soils.</p>
