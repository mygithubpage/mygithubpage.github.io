The last event marks the beginning of the <span class="highlight">Cambrian</span> period. Animals originated <span class="highlight"><span class="question2">relatively</span></span> late in the <span class="highlight">history</span> of Earth-in only the last 10 percent of Earth's <span class="highlight">history</span>. During a geologically <span class="highlight">brief</span> 100-million-year period, all modern animal groups (<span class="highlight">along</span> with other animals that are now <span class="highlight">extinct</span>) evolved. This rapid <span class="highlight">origin</span> and <span class="highlight"><span class="question3">diversification</span></span> of animals is often referred to as "the <span class="highlight">Cambrian</span><span class="highlight">explosion</span>."</p><p>Scientists have asked important questions about this <span class="highlight"><span class="question4">explosion</span></span> for more than a <span class="highlight">century</span>. Why did it <span class="highlight">occur</span> so late in the <span class="highlight">history</span> of Earth? The <span class="highlight">origin</span> of <span class="highlight">multicellular</span> forms of life seems a <span class="highlight">relatively</span> simple step compared to the <span class="highlight">origin</span> of life itself. Why does the <span class="highlight">fossil</span><span class="highlight">record</span> not document the <span class="highlight">series</span> of <span class="highlight">evolutionary</span> changes during the <span class="highlight">evolution</span> of animals? Why did animal life <span class="highlight">evolve</span> so quickly? Paleontologists continue to search the <span class="highlight">fossil</span><span class="highlight">record</span> for answers to these questions.</p><p>One <span class="highlight">interpretation</span> regarding the <span class="highlight">absence</span> of fossils during this important 100-million-year period is that early animals were <span class="highlight">soft</span> bodied and <span class="highlight">simply</span> did not <span class="highlight">fossilize</span>.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span><span class="highlight">Fossilization</span> of soft-bodied animals is less likely than <span class="highlight">fossilization</span> of hard-bodied animals, but it does <span class="highlight">occur</span>. 
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>Conditions that <span class="highlight"><span class="question7">promote</span></span><span class="highlight">fossilization</span> of soft-bodied animals include very rapid covering by sediments that create an environment that discourages <span class="highlight">decomposition</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>In fact, <span class="highlight">fossil</span> beds containing soft-bodied animals have been known for many years. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p><p>The Ediacara <span class="highlight">fossil</span><span class="highlight">formation</span>, which contains the oldest known animal fossils, consists <span class="highlight">exclusively</span> of soft-bodied forms. Although named after a site in Australia, the Ediacara <span class="highlight">formation</span> is worldwide in <span class="highlight">distribution</span> and dates to <span class="highlight">Precambrian</span> times. This 700-million-year-old <span class="highlight">formation</span> gives few clues to the origins of modern animals, however, because paleontologists believe it represents an <span class="highlight">evolutionary</span> experiment that failed. It contains no ancestors of modern animal groups.</p><p>A <span class="highlight">slightly</span> younger <span class="highlight">fossil</span><span class="highlight">formation</span> containing animal remains is the Tommotian <span class="highlight">formation</span>, named after a locale in Russia. It dates to the very early <span class="highlight">Cambrian</span> period, and it also contains only soft-bodied forms. <span class="question9">At one time, the animals present in these <span class="highlight">fossil</span> beds were assigned to various modern animal groups, but most paleontologists now agree that all Tommotian fossils <span class="highlight">represent</span><span class="highlight">unique</span> body forms that arose in the early <span class="highlight">Cambrian</span> period and disappeared before the end of the period, leaving no descendants in modern animal groups.</span></p><p>A third <span class="highlight">fossil</span><span class="highlight">formation</span> containing both soft-bodied and hard-bodied animals provides <span class="highlight">evidence</span> of the result of the <span class="highlight">Cambrian</span><span class="highlight">explosion</span>. This <span class="highlight">fossil</span><span class="highlight">formation</span>, called the Burgess Shale, is in Yoho National Park in the Canadian Rocky Mountains of British Columbia. <span class="highlight">Shortly</span> after the <span class="highlight">Cambrian</span><span class="highlight">explosion</span>, mud slides rapidly buried thousands of <span class="highlight">marine</span> animals under conditions that <span class="highlight">favored</span><span class="highlight">fossilization</span>. These <span class="highlight">fossil</span> beds provide <span class="highlight">evidence</span> of about 32 modern animal groups, plus about 20 other animal body forms that are so different from any modern animals that they cannot be assigned to any one of the modern groups. These unassignable animals include a large swimming <span class="highlight">predator</span> called Anomalocaris and a soft-bodied animal called Wiwaxia, which ate <span class="highlight">detritus</span> or <span class="highlight">algae</span>. The Burgess Shale <span class="highlight">formation</span> also has fossils of many <span class="highlight">extinct</span> representatives of modern animal groups. For example, a well-known Burgess Shale animal called <span class="question11">Sidneyia</span> is a <span class="highlight">representative</span> of a <span class="highlight">previously</span> unknown group of arthropods (a <span class="highlight">category</span> of animals that includes insects, spiders, mites, and crabs).</p><p><span class="highlight">Fossil</span> formations like the Burgess Shale show that <span class="highlight">evolution</span> cannot always be thought of as a slow progression. The <span class="highlight">Cambrian</span><span class="highlight">explosion</span> involved rapid <span class="highlight">evolutionary</span><span class="highlight">diversification</span>, followed by the <span class="highlight">extinction</span> of many <span class="highlight">unique</span> animals. Why was this <span class="highlight">evolution</span> so rapid? No one really knows. Many zoologists believe that it was because so many <span class="highlight">ecological</span> niches were <span class="highlight">available</span> with <span class="highlight">virtually</span> no competition from existing <span class="highlight">species</span>. Will zoologists ever know the <span class="highlight">evolutionary</span> sequences in the <span class="highlight">Cambrian</span><span class="highlight">explosion</span>? Perhaps another <span class="highlight">ancient</span><span class="highlight">fossil</span> bed of soft-bodied animals from 600-million-year-old seas is awaiting discovery.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">significant</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. numerous</p><p>B. important</p><p>C. unexplained</p><p>D. sudden</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B significant: Significant and important. A is many; B is important; C is unexplained; D is sudden. Answer B's important is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">relatively</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. surprisingly</p><p>B. collectively</p><p>C. comparatively</p><p>D. characteristically</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Relatively: Relatively. A is surprising; B is commonly; C is relatively; D is typically. So comparatively correct. Corresponding to the original: Animals originated late late in the history of Earth - in only the last 10 percent of Earth's history. The original sentence is relatively late and is followed by a dash. This explains that the last 10% of the history of the earth is, of course, relatively backward. of. A surprised B gathered D have characteristics are not right.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">diversification</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. emergence of many varieties</p><p>B. steady decline in number</p><p>C. gradual increase in body size</p><p>D. sudden disappearance</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>Diversification: Differentiation. Think of diverse diversity, so A has a lot of variants correct. Corresponding to the original: This rapid origin and diversification of animals is often referred to as "the Cambrian explosion." The original is tied with the original (origin), with the meaning of the emergence, so the emergence of the right; B's decline and D's Disappear all said; C's body size has nothing to do with the original.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The period discussed in the passage is referred to as an "<span class="highlight">explosion</span>" because it</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. occurred 0.6 billion years ago, late in Earth's history</p><p>B. was characterized by the unusually fast evolution of many new life-forms</p><p>C. was characterized by widespread animal extinction</p><p>D. was characterized by violent volcanic eruptions</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B. Use the keywords of explosion to locate the last sentence of the first paragraph. Note that the relevant information for this question is not in the second paragraph but in the first paragraph. Said rapid origin and diversification is called explosion, so B is correct. A's time can not be used as the basis for explosion; C is extinct; anti-D volcano did not say.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to Paragraph2, which of the following is NOT a question that paleontologists asked about the Cambrian explosion?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Why was the origin of life a simple step in Earth's history?</p><p>B. Why did it take so long for multicellular organisms to develop?</p><p>C. Why did animal life evolve so rapidly?</p><p>D. Why does the fossil record lack evidence of animal evolution during that time?</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A EXCEPT questions, exclusion. A simple step keyword positioning to the third sentence, but this sentence is not a problem, so A wrong, election; B option so long corresponding to the second sentence of the original sentence so late, so correct, do not choose, be careful not to Targeting multicellular organisms will lead to positioning errors; C will correspond to the penultimate sentence, correct, and will not be selected; D's lack evidence will correspond to the original sentence of the penultimate sentence of the original text, correct, and will not be selected.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the following best describes the relationship between paragraph 2 and paragraph 3?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Paragraph 2 puts forward several scientific claims, one of which is rejected in paragraph 3.</p><p>B. Paragraph 2 poses several questions, and paragraph 3 offers a possible answer to one of them.</p><p>C. Paragraph 2 presents outdated traditional views, while paragraph 3 presents the current scientific conclusions.</p><p>D. Paragraph 2 introduces a generalization that is illustrated by specific examples in paragraph 3.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B asked the entire paragraph of the question, pay attention to the beginning of the paragraph; the second paragraph put forward a lot of questions, and the beginning of the third paragraph gave an explanation, that is the second paragraph of the third paragraph of the answer, so B is correct. There is no comparison or opposition between the third paragraph and the second paragraph, so neither A and C are correct; neither is it elaborated. D is wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question7">promote</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. complicate</p><p>B. prevent</p><p>C. encourage</p><p>D. affect</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" C"><p>Promote: Promote, <span class="question7">promote</span>. So C's encourage is correct. A is to make ... complex; B is to prevent; D is to influence. Corresponding to the original: Conditions that <span class="question7">promote</span> fossilization of soft-bodied animals include very rapid covering by sediments that create an environment that discourages decomposition. The original condition should be a positive effect on fossilization, and B's prevent and D's affect are negative. , so it is not right; complicated is to make the complex, the original does not give relevant information, wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the following is NOT mentioned in paragraph 4 as being true of the Ediacara formation?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It contains fossils that date back to the Precambrian period.</p><p>B. It contains only soft-bodied animal fossils.</p><p>C. It is located on a single site in Australia.</p><p>D. It does not contain any fossils of the ancestors of modern animals.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C A's Precambrian corresponds to the second sentence, correct, not selected; C's related information is also from the second sentence, but the second sentence is said that the world in distribution, not only in Australia, so C is negative, choose:</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The animals found in the Tommotian fossil bed were once thought to belong to a variety of modern animal groups, but now they are thought to have descended from a single group.</p><p>B. Animals in the Tommotian fossil beds were initially assigned to modern animal groups but are now thought to belong to groups that emerged and died out during the Cambrian period.</p><p>C. Though at first they thought otherwise, paleontologists now agree that the animals in the Tommotian have body forms from which modern animals have descended.</p><p>D. It is unclear whether the Tommotian fossils from the early Cambrian period represent unique body forms or whether they should be assigned to various modern animal groups.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The core relationship of B original sentence is the turning point, and the latter half is the true meaning of the author. After the turning point, said: Most paleontologists agree that these fossils represent very special body forms, appeared early in the Cambrian, died at the end, leaving no future generations. Item D has no definite conclusion (from whether or not), the original has, so D is wrong; the latter part of the original text says that T appeared in the early C, there was no later in the period, and there were no offspring. A and C all said that there were offspring, wrong; so Answer B is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the author mention "Anomalocaris" and "Wiwaxia"?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To contrast predators with animals that eat plants such as algae</p><p>B. To question the effects of rapid mud slides on fossilization</p><p>C. To suggest that much is still unknown about animals found in the Burgess Shale</p><p>D. To provide examples of fossils that cannot be assigned to a modern animal group</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>Anomalocaris and Wiwaxia are examples of two unassignable animals. Looking forward, these fossil beds provide evidence of about 32 modern animal groups, plus about 20 other animal body forms that are so different from any modern animals that they cannot be assigned to any one The preceding sentence makes it very clear that some animals cannot be grouped in any group, and then they are given as examples. Therefore, D is correct and nothing else is said.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>"<span class="highlight"><span class="question11">Sidneyia</span></span>" is an example of</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. a relative of Anomalocaris and Wiwaxia</p><p>B. a previously unknown Burgess Shale animal</p><p>C. an extinct member of a currently existing category of animals</p><p>D. an animal that cannot be assigned to any modern animal group</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" C"><p>C is also a functional goal. The first sentence says that BS has a lot of extinct animals. They are representatives of modern animal groups. Then it gives an example of S. So C is correct. Don't be disturbed by B. The original text says that S is A representative of an anthropod that was not known before, did not say it was a representative of BS that was not previously known, so it was wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What can be inferred from paragraph 7 about why the Cambrian explosion is so unusual?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It generated new ecological niches through the extinction of many unique animals.</p><p>B. It was a period of rapid evolution, and evolution is often thought of as a slow process.</p><p>C. It is a period whose evolutionary sequences are clearly marked.</p><p>D. It generated a very large number of ancient fossil beds containing soft-bodied animals.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B. Use Cambrian Explosion as the key word to locate the second sentence. Note that there is also a Cambrian Explosion in the penultimate sentence, but because it has nothing to do with the question, it is not read. This sentence says that the Cambrian explosion included the rapid emergence of many animals and then quickly died, then asked why the problem was so quick and gave answers. Therefore, the problem of unusual is that the abnormality is not fast, so the answer B is correct. A's new ecological niches original no relevant information; C original is just a problem, C becomes the answer, not right; D wrong, the original sentence in the last sentence that a bed, not a lot of beds, but awaiting discovery, not already found.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>It is relatively rare because the fossilization of soft-bodied animals requires a special environment..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B two transition points, fossilization of soft-bodied animals and special environment, with the first A/B/C are possible, but the special environment indicates that A is wrong, and it should be said first that a special environment is needed and then the environment is What, not the other way around. What's more, the condition after point B corresponds to the environment in the insert sentence.</p></div></div><div id="question14" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>The term "Cambrian explosion" refers to the geologically brief period during which all modern animal groups evolved.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.Little is known about the stages of evolution during the Cambrian period, in part because early animals were soft bodied and could fossilize only under particular conditions.</p><p>B.While animal fossils from before the Cambrian explosion have no modern descendants, many animals that evolved during the Cambrian explosion can be assigned to modern groups.</p><p>C.The Cambrian period is significant because it marks the emergence of eukaryotic life-forms-organisms that have cells with true nuclei.</p><p>D.The Ediacara fossil formation provides the most information about the Cambrian explosion, while the earlier, Tommotian and Burgess Shale formations give clues about Precambrian evolution.</p><p>E.Zoologists are awaiting the discovery of a 600-million-year-old fossil formation in order to be able to form a theory of how animal evolution progressed.</p><p>F.Although the reasons for the rapid evolution of animals during the Cambrian period are not known, one proposed explanation is an abundance of niches with a lack of competitors.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="ABF"><p>The A.B.F little option corresponds to the first sentence of the third paragraph of the original text, correct. The while option corresponds to the last sentence of the fifth paragraph of the original text and the second last sentence of the first paragraph, correct. The Cambrian option mixes the two irrelevant concepts of the original text together, making nonsense. The Edicara option corresponds to the first sentence of the fourth paragraph, but because the entire fourth paragraph is an example, this is a detail and not selected. The zoologist option corresponds to the last sentence of the seventh paragraph, but the details are not selected. The although option corresponds to the seventh last paragraph of the original text, correct.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
