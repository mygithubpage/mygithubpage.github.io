            <b>The Cambrian Explosion</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>The geologic timescale is <span class="underline">marked</span> by <span class="light"><span class="underline">significant</span></span> geologic and biological events, including the <span class="underline">origin</span> of Earth about 4.6 billion years ago, the <span class="underline">origin</span> of life about 3.5 billion years ago, the <span class="underline">origin</span> of eukaryotic life-forms (living things that have cells with true <span class="underline">nuclei</span>) about 1.5 billion years ago, and the <span class="underline">origin</span> of animals about 0.6 billion years ago. The last event marks the beginning of the <span class="underline">Cambrian</span> period. Animals originated <span class="underline">relatively</span> late in the <span class="underline">history</span> of Earth-in only the last 10 percent of Earth's <span class="underline">history</span>. During a geologically <span class="underline">brief</span> 100-million-year period, all modern animal groups (<span class="underline">along</span> with other animals that are now <span class="underline">extinct</span>) evolved. This rapid <span class="underline">origin</span> and <span class="underline">diversification</span> of animals is often referred to as "the <span class="underline">Cambrian</span> <span class="underline">explosion</span>."</p>
          <p>Scientists have asked important questions about this <span class="underline">explosion</span> for more than a <span class="underline">century</span>. Why did it <span class="underline">occur</span> so late in the <span class="underline">history</span> of Earth? The <span class="underline">origin</span> of <span class="underline">multicellular</span> forms of life seems a <span class="underline">relatively</span> simple step compared to the <span class="underline">origin</span> of life itself. Why does the <span class="underline">fossil</span> <span class="underline">record</span> not document the <span class="underline">series</span> of <span class="underline">evolutionary</span> changes during the <span class="underline">evolution</span> of animals? Why did animal life <span class="underline">evolve</span> so quickly? Paleontologists continue to search the <span class="underline">fossil</span> <span class="underline">record</span> for answers to these questions.</p>
          <p>One <span class="underline">interpretation</span> regarding the <span class="underline">absence</span> of fossils during this important 100-million-year period is that early animals were <span class="underline">soft</span> bodied and <span class="underline">simply</span> did not <span class="underline">fossilize</span>.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> <span class="underline">Fossilization</span> of soft-bodied animals is less likely than <span class="underline">fossilization</span> of hard-bodied animals, but it does <span class="underline">occur</span>. 
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>Conditions that <span class="underline">promote</span> <span class="underline">fossilization</span> of soft-bodied animals include very rapid covering by sediments that create an environment that discourages <span class="underline">decomposition</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>In fact, <span class="underline">fossil</span> beds containing soft-bodied animals have been known for many years. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p>
          <p>The Ediacara <span class="underline">fossil</span> <span class="underline">formation</span>, which contains the oldest known animal fossils, consists <span class="underline">exclusively</span> of soft-bodied forms. Although named after a site in Australia, the Ediacara <span class="underline">formation</span> is worldwide in <span class="underline">distribution</span> and dates to <span class="underline">Precambrian</span> times. This 700-million-year-old <span class="underline">formation</span> gives few clues to the origins of modern animals, however, because paleontologists believe it represents an <span class="underline">evolutionary</span> experiment that failed. It contains no ancestors of modern animal groups.</p>
          <p>A <span class="underline">slightly</span> younger <span class="underline">fossil</span> <span class="underline">formation</span> containing animal remains is the Tommotian <span class="underline">formation</span>, named after a locale in Russia. It dates to the very early <span class="underline">Cambrian</span> period, and it also contains only soft-bodied forms. At one time, the animals present in these <span class="underline">fossil</span> beds were assigned to various modern animal groups, but most paleontologists now agree that all Tommotian fossils <span class="underline">represent</span> <span class="underline">unique</span> body forms that arose in the early <span class="underline">Cambrian</span> period and disappeared before the end of the period, leaving no descendants in modern animal groups.</p>
          <p>A third <span class="underline">fossil</span> <span class="underline">formation</span> containing both soft-bodied and hard-bodied animals provides <span class="underline">evidence</span> of the result of the <span class="underline">Cambrian</span> <span class="underline">explosion</span>. This <span class="underline">fossil</span> <span class="underline">formation</span>, called the Burgess Shale, is in Yoho National Park in the Canadian Rocky Mountains of British Columbia. <span class="underline">Shortly</span> after the <span class="underline">Cambrian</span> <span class="underline">explosion</span>, mud slides rapidly buried thousands of <span class="underline">marine</span> animals under conditions that <span class="underline">favored</span> <span class="underline">fossilization</span>. These <span class="underline">fossil</span> beds provide <span class="underline">evidence</span> of about 32 modern animal groups, plus about 20 other animal body forms that are so different from any modern animals that they cannot be assigned to any one of the modern groups. These unassignable animals include a large swimming <span class="underline">predator</span> called Anomalocaris and a soft-bodied animal called Wiwaxia, which ate <span class="underline">detritus</span> or <span class="underline">algae</span>. The Burgess Shale <span class="underline">formation</span> also has fossils of many <span class="underline">extinct</span> representatives of modern animal groups. For example, a well-known Burgess Shale animal called Sidneyia is a <span class="underline">representative</span> of a <span class="underline">previously</span> unknown group of arthropods (a <span class="underline">category</span> of animals that includes insects, spiders, mites, and crabs).</p>
          <p>
            <span class="underline">Fossil</span> formations like the Burgess Shale show that <span class="underline">evolution</span> cannot always be thought of as a slow progression. The <span class="underline">Cambrian</span> <span class="underline">explosion</span> involved rapid <span class="underline">evolutionary</span> <span class="underline">diversification</span>, followed by the <span class="underline">extinction</span> of many <span class="underline">unique</span> animals. Why was this <span class="underline">evolution</span> so rapid? No one really knows. Many zoologists believe that it was because so many <span class="underline">ecological</span> niches were <span class="underline">available</span> with <span class="underline">virtually</span> no competition from existing <span class="underline">species</span>. Will zoologists ever know the <span class="underline">evolutionary</span> sequences in the <span class="underline">Cambrian</span> <span class="underline">explosion</span>? Perhaps another <span class="underline">ancient</span> <span class="underline">fossil</span> bed of soft-bodied animals from 600-million-year-old seas is awaiting discovery.</p>
