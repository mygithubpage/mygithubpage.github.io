lecture in an Astronomy Class </p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.7" data-time="4.64">[00:04.64]</span>Professor: Last week, we covered some arguments against going back to the Moon. <span class="time" data-times="9.98" data-time="10.34">[00:10.34]</span>But there are <span class="highlight">compelling</span> reasons in <span class="highlight">favor</span> of another Moon <span class="highlight">landing</span> too, um... not the <span class="highlight">least</span> of which is trying to <span class="highlight">pinpoint</span> the moon's age. <span class="time" data-times="9.18" data-time="20.32">[00:20.32]</span>We could do this in <span class="highlight">theory</span> by studying an <span class="highlight">enormous</span><span class="highlight">impact</span><span class="highlight">crater</span>, known as the South Pole-Aitken <span class="highlight">Basin</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.51" data-time="29.5">[00:29.50]</span>Um...it's located in the moon's South Polar <span class="highlight">Region</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.4" data-time="34.01">[00:34.01]</span>But, since it's on the far side of the moon, it can only be seen from <span class="highlight">space</span>. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.28" data-time="39.41">[00:39.41]</span>Here is an <span class="highlight">image</span> of...we'll call it the SPA <span class="highlight">Basin</span>. <span class="time" data-times="13.91" data-time="43.69">[00:43.69]</span>This color-coated <span class="highlight">image</span> of the SPA <span class="highlight">Basin</span>, those aren't its actual colors <span class="highlight">obviously</span>, this <span class="highlight">image</span> is from the mid-90s, from the American <span class="highlight">spacecraft</span> called Clementine. <span class="time" data-times="7.51" data-time="57.6">[00:57.60]</span>Um... unlike earlier <span class="highlight">lunar</span> missions, Clementine didn't <span class="highlight">orbit</span> only around the moon's <span class="highlight">equator</span>. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="23.18" data-time="65.11">[01:05.11]</span>Its orbits enabled it to send back <span class="highlight">data</span> to create this <span class="highlight">topographical</span> map of ... well, the grey and white area towards the bottom is the South <span class="highlight">Pole</span>, the purples and <span class="highlight">blues</span> in the middle <span class="highlight">correspond</span> to low elevations - the SPA <span class="highlight">Basin</span> itself, the oranges and reds around it are higher elevations. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="9.49" data-time="88.29">[01:28.29]</span>The <span class="highlight">basin</span> measures an amazing 2,500 km in <span class="highlight">diameter</span>, and its <span class="highlight">average</span> depth is 12 km. <span class="time" data-times="7.21" data-time="97.78">[01:37.78]</span>That makes it the biggest known <span class="highlight">crater</span> in our <span class="highlight">solar</span> system and it may well be the oldest. <span class="time" data-times="11.41" data-time="104.99">[01:44.99]</span>You know <span class="highlight">planetary</span> researchers love studying deep craters to learn about the impacts that created them, how they redistributed pieces of the <span class="highlight">planet</span>'s <span class="highlight">crust</span>. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="9.58" data-time="116.4">[01:56.40]</span>And in this case, we especially want to know if any of the <span class="highlight">mantle</span>, the <span class="highlight">layer</span><span class="highlight">beneath</span> the <span class="highlight">crust</span>, was <span class="highlight">exposed</span> by the <span class="highlight">impact</span>. <span class="time" data-times="10.05" data-time="125.98">[02:05.98]</span>Not everyone agrees, but some experts are convinced that whatever created the SPA <span class="highlight">Basin</span> did <span class="highlight">penetrate</span> the Moon's <span class="highlight">mantle</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9.98" data-time="136.03">[02:16.03]</span>And we need to find out, because much more than the <span class="highlight">crust</span>, the <span class="highlight">mantle</span> contains information about a <span class="highlight">planet</span>'s or Moon's total <span class="highlight">composition</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.91" data-time="146.01">[02:26.01]</span>And that's key to understanding <span class="highlight">planet</span><span class="highlight">formation</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.01" data-time="149.92">[02:29.92]</span>Um...Dian? </p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.04" data-time="151.93">[02:31.93]</span>Dian: So, the only way to know the <span class="highlight">basin</span>'s age is to study its rocks directly? </p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.77" data-time="156.97">[02:36.97]</span>Professor: Well, from radio <span class="highlight">survey</span><span class="highlight">data</span>, we know that the <span class="highlight">basin</span> contains lots of smaller craters. <span class="time" data-times="6.25" data-time="163.74">[02:43.74]</span>So it must be really old, about 4 billion years, give or take a few hundred million years. <span class="time" data-times="2.91" data-time="169.99">[02:49.99]</span>But that's not very <span class="highlight">precise</span>. <span class="time" data-times="13.55" data-time="172.9">[02:52.90]</span>If we had rock samples to study, we'd know whether these small craters were formed by impacts during the final stages of <span class="highlight">planetary</span><span class="highlight">formation</span>, or if they resulted from later <span class="highlight">meteor</span> showers. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.94" data-time="186.45">[03:06.45]</span>Dian : But if we know around how old the <span class="highlight">Basin</span> is, I'm not sure that's <span class="highlight">reason</span> enough to go to the Moon again. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.29" data-time="192.39">[03:12.39]</span>Professor: No..., but such <span class="highlight">crude</span> estimates...um...we can do better than that. <span class="time" data-times="6.22" data-time="197.68">[03:17.68]</span><span class="highlight">Besides</span>, there's other things <span class="highlight">worth</span> investigating, like is there water ice on the moon? <span class="time" data-times="6.89" data-time="203.9">[03:23.90]</span>Clementine's <span class="highlight">data</span> indicated that the wall of the south-polar <span class="highlight">crater</span> was more reflective than expected. <span class="time" data-times="4.22" data-time="210.79">[03:30.79]</span>So some experts think there's probably ice there. <span class="time" data-times="11.77" data-time="215.01">[03:35.01]</span>Also, <span class="highlight">data</span> from a later <span class="highlight">mission</span> indicates <span class="highlight">significant</span> concentrations of <span class="highlight">hydrogen</span> and by inference water, less than a meter <span class="highlight">underground</span> at both poles. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.5" data-time="226.78">[03:46.78]</span>Student: Well, if there's water, how did it get there? <span class="time" data-times="1.22" data-time="229.28">[03:49.28]</span><span class="highlight">Underground</span> rivers? </p><p><span class="time" data-times="8.44" data-time="230.5">[03:50.50]</span>Professor: We think meteors that crashed into the moon or tails of passing comets may have introduced water molecules. <span class="time" data-times="12.54" data-time="238.94">[03:58.94]</span>Any water molecules that found their way to the floors of craters near the moon's poles, that water would be perpetually frozen, because the floors of those craters are always in shadow. <span class="time" data-times="7.43" data-time="251.48">[04:11.48]</span>Um...furthermore, if the water ice was mixed in with rock and dust, it would be protected from <span class="highlight">evaporation</span>. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.72" data-time="258.91">[04:18.91]</span>Dian: So are you saying there might be <span class="highlight">primitive</span> life on the moon? </p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.28" data-time="262.63">[04:22.63]</span>Professor: That's not my point at all. <span class="time" data-times="3.5" data-time="264.91">[04:24.91]</span>Um... OK, say there is water ice on the moon. <span class="time" data-times="5.28" data-time="268.41">[04:28.41]</span>That would be of very <span class="highlight">practical</span> value for a future moon <span class="highlight">base</span> for astronauts. <span class="time" data-times="3.68" data-time="273.69">[04:33.69]</span>Water ice could be melted and purified for drinking. <span class="time" data-times="5.54" data-time="277.37">[04:37.37]</span>It could also be broken down into its <span class="highlight">component</span> parts - <span class="highlight">oxygen</span> and <span class="highlight">hydrogen</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.92" data-time="282.91">[04:42.91]</span><span class="highlight">Oxygen</span> could be used to breathe, and <span class="highlight">hydrogen</span> could be turned into <span class="highlight">fuel</span>, rocket <span class="highlight">fuel</span>. <span class="time" data-times="11.34" data-time="289.83">[04:49.83]</span>So water ice could enable the creation of a self-sustaining moon <span class="highlight">base</span> someday, a <span class="highlight">mining</span> camp perhaps or a departure point for further <span class="highlight">space</span><span class="highlight">exploration</span>. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.76" data-time="301.17">[05:01.17]</span>Student: But hauling tons of equipment to the moon to make <span class="highlight">fuel</span> and build a life support system for a moon <span class="highlight">base</span>, wouldn't that be too expensive? </p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.65" data-time="308.93">[05:08.93]</span>Professor: <span class="highlight">Permanent</span><span class="highlight">base</span>, maybe a ways off, but we shouldn't have to wait for that. <span class="time" data-times="6.34" data-time="314.58">[05:14.58]</span>The dust at the bottom of the SPA <span class="highlight">Basin</span> really does have a <span class="highlight">fascinating</span> story to tell. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="320.92">[05:20.92]</span>I wouldn't give for a few samples of it. </p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the main purpose of the lecture?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To explain why scientists disagree about the age of the Moon.</p><p>B. To present arguments in favor of another Moon landing.</p><p>C. To explain how scientists discovered a crater on the far side of the Moon.</p><p>D. To review some finding of a recent mission to the Moon.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>From the professor's analysis it can be understood from Crater that Moon's age and later mooncraft of spacecraft's can come to the conclusion that Today's focus is To present arguments in favor of another Moon landing. That is the B option.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor imply about the spacecraft Clementine?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It sent back the first color photographs of the Moon.</p><p>B. It was powered by solar energy.</p><p>C. It landed in the far side of the Moon.</p><p>D. It flew over the Moon's polar regions.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>From the analysis of the professor, it can be seen that spacecraft Clementine photographed South Pole, which means that the spacecraft crossed the polar regions, that is, the D option. From the previous description, it can be seen that the place of land is not the far side of moon, so C is wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor mention the Moon's mantle?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To explain why scientists believe that meteor impacts cannot affect the Moon's mantle.</p><p>B. To explain what kind of information scientists hope to obtain from the mantle.</p><p>C. To point out that the Moon's crust and mantle are made of similar materials.</p><p>D. To point out that the Moon's mantle and Earth's mantle have different compositions.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>It can be seen that the professor mentioned mantle just for the information that mantle can provide for the researcher, that is, To explain what kind of information scientists hope to obtain from the mantle. There is no comparison between Mantle on Moon and Earth Mountain, D is wrong. Mantle itself is the layer beneath the crust so there is no To point out that the Moon's crust and mantle are made of similar materials. C is wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why is the South Pole-Aitken Basin thought to be exceptionally old?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The walls of the Basin are more reflective than those of most other craters.</p><p>B. Testing of rocks from the Basin's floor proves them to be as old as the Moon itself.</p><p>C. Many small craters have been detected at the bottom of the Basin.</p><p>D. A large amount of dust has been detected in and around the Basin.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The professor mentioned that because it contains lots of smaller craters, it must be really old. It can be concluded that those who infer old evidence are those craters. The A option is followed by Clementine's data indicated that the wall of the south-polar crater was more reflective than expected. So some experts think there?s probably ice there. Not related to old.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor consider it important to find out if water ice exists on the Moon?Click on 2 answers.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Water ice could be processed to provide breathable air for astronauts.</p><p>B. One component of water ice could be used as a fuel for rockets.</p><p>C. Water ice could contain evidence of primitive life on the Moon.</p><p>D. Water ice could be tested to find out what type of meteors crashed into the Moon.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="AB"><p>Oxygen could be used to breathe that is A. Water ice could be processed to provide breathable air for astronauts. And hydrogen could be turned into fuel, rocket fuel is B. One component of water ice could be used as a fuel for rockets.</p></div></div><div class="replay" id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor imply when he says this :</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The current age estimates for the South Pole-Aitken Basin are based on incorrect assumptions.</p><p>B. The technology to analyze Moon rocks has not advanced much since the days of the Moon landings</p><p>C. Too few of the original Moon-rock samples were dated accurately</p><p>D. Only by testing samples from South Pole-Aitken Basin can its age be precisely determined</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>First of all, craters can't provide accurate time information, but rock sample can, and these samples are from South Pole-Aitken Basin and therefore D. A is not the age that the craters provided is inferred to be wrong, but is not very precise. Therefore A is wrong.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
