          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.7" data-time="4.64">[00:04.64]</span>Professor: Last week, we covered some arguments against going back to the Moon. <span class="time" data-times="9.98" data-time="10.34">[00:10.34]</span>But there are <span class="highlight">compelling</span> reasons in <span class="highlight">favor</span> of another Moon <span class="highlight">landing</span> too, um... not the <span class="highlight">least</span> of which is trying to <span class="highlight">pinpoint</span> the moon's age. <span class="time" data-times="9.18" data-time="20.32">[00:20.32]</span>We could do this in <span class="highlight">theory</span> by studying an <span class="highlight">enormous</span> <span class="highlight">impact</span> <span class="highlight">crater</span>, known as the South Pole-Aitken <span class="highlight">Basin</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.51" data-time="29.5">[00:29.50]</span>Um...it's located in the moon's South Polar <span class="highlight">Region</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.4" data-time="34.01">[00:34.01]</span>But, since it's on the far side of the moon, it can only be seen from <span class="highlight">space</span>. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.28" data-time="39.41">[00:39.41]</span>Here is an <span class="highlight">image</span> of...we'll call it the SPA <span class="highlight">Basin</span>. <span class="time" data-times="13.91" data-time="43.69">[00:43.69]</span>This color-coated <span class="highlight">image</span> of the SPA <span class="highlight">Basin</span>, those aren't its actual colors <span class="highlight">obviously</span>, this <span class="highlight">image</span> is from the mid-90s, from the American <span class="highlight">spacecraft</span> called Clementine. <span class="time" data-times="7.51" data-time="57.6">[00:57.60]</span>Um... unlike earlier <span class="highlight">lunar</span> missions, Clementine didn't <span class="highlight">orbit</span> only around the moon's <span class="highlight">equator</span>. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="23.18" data-time="65.11">[01:05.11]</span>Its orbits enabled it to send back <span class="highlight">data</span> to create this <span class="highlight">topographical</span> map of ... well, the grey and white area towards the bottom is the South <span class="highlight">Pole</span>, the purples and <span class="highlight">blues</span> in the middle <span class="highlight">correspond</span> to low elevations - the SPA <span class="highlight">Basin</span> itself, the oranges and reds around it are higher elevations. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="9.49" data-time="88.29">[01:28.29]</span>The <span class="highlight">basin</span> measures an amazing 2,500 km in <span class="highlight">diameter</span>, and its <span class="highlight">average</span> depth is 12 km. <span class="time" data-times="7.21" data-time="97.78">[01:37.78]</span>That makes it the biggest known <span class="highlight">crater</span> in our <span class="highlight">solar</span> system and it may well be the oldest. <span class="time" data-times="11.41" data-time="104.99">[01:44.99]</span>You know <span class="highlight">planetary</span> researchers love studying deep craters to learn about the impacts that created them, how they redistributed pieces of the <span class="highlight">planet</span>'s <span class="highlight">crust</span>. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="9.58" data-time="116.4">[01:56.40]</span>And in this case, we especially want to know if any of the <span class="highlight">mantle</span>, the <span class="highlight">layer</span> <span class="highlight">beneath</span> the <span class="highlight">crust</span>, was <span class="highlight">exposed</span> by the <span class="highlight">impact</span>. <span class="time" data-times="10.05" data-time="125.98">[02:05.98]</span>Not everyone agrees, but some experts are convinced that whatever created the SPA <span class="highlight">Basin</span> did <span class="highlight">penetrate</span> the Moon's <span class="highlight">mantle</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9.98" data-time="136.03">[02:16.03]</span>And we need to find out, because much more than the <span class="highlight">crust</span>, the <span class="highlight">mantle</span> contains information about a <span class="highlight">planet</span>'s or Moon's total <span class="highlight">composition</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.91" data-time="146.01">[02:26.01]</span>And that's key to understanding <span class="highlight">planet</span> <span class="highlight">formation</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.01" data-time="149.92">[02:29.92]</span>Um...Dian? </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.04" data-time="151.93">[02:31.93]</span>Dian: So, the only way to know the <span class="highlight">basin</span>'s age is to study its rocks directly? </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.77" data-time="156.97">[02:36.97]</span>Professor: Well, from radio <span class="highlight">survey</span> <span class="highlight">data</span>, we know that the <span class="highlight">basin</span> contains lots of smaller craters. <span class="time" data-times="6.25" data-time="163.74">[02:43.74]</span>So it must be really old, about 4 billion years, give or take a few hundred million years. <span class="time" data-times="2.91" data-time="169.99">[02:49.99]</span>But that's not very <span class="highlight">precise</span>. <span class="time" data-times="13.55" data-time="172.9">[02:52.90]</span>If we had rock samples to study, we'd know whether these small craters were formed by impacts during the final stages of <span class="highlight">planetary</span> <span class="highlight">formation</span>, or if they resulted from later <span class="highlight">meteor</span> showers. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.94" data-time="186.45">[03:06.45]</span>Dian : But if we know around how old the <span class="highlight">Basin</span> is, I'm not sure that's <span class="highlight">reason</span> enough to go to the Moon again. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.29" data-time="192.39">[03:12.39]</span>Professor: No..., but such <span class="highlight">crude</span> estimates...um...we can do better than that. <span class="time" data-times="6.22" data-time="197.68">[03:17.68]</span> <span class="highlight">Besides</span>, there's other things <span class="highlight">worth</span> investigating, like is there water ice on the moon? <span class="time" data-times="6.89" data-time="203.9">[03:23.90]</span>Clementine's <span class="highlight">data</span> indicated that the wall of the south-polar <span class="highlight">crater</span> was more reflective than expected. <span class="time" data-times="4.22" data-time="210.79">[03:30.79]</span>So some experts think there's probably ice there. <span class="time" data-times="11.77" data-time="215.01">[03:35.01]</span>Also, <span class="highlight">data</span> from a later <span class="highlight">mission</span> indicates <span class="highlight">significant</span> concentrations of <span class="highlight">hydrogen</span> and by inference water, less than a meter <span class="highlight">underground</span> at both poles. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.5" data-time="226.78">[03:46.78]</span>Student: Well, if there's water, how did it get there? <span class="time" data-times="1.22" data-time="229.28">[03:49.28]</span> <span class="highlight">Underground</span> rivers? </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="8.44" data-time="230.5">[03:50.50]</span>Professor: We think meteors that crashed into the moon or tails of passing comets may have introduced water molecules. <span class="time" data-times="12.54" data-time="238.94">[03:58.94]</span>Any water molecules that found their way to the floors of craters near the moon's poles, that water would be perpetually frozen, because the floors of those craters are always in shadow. <span class="time" data-times="7.43" data-time="251.48">[04:11.48]</span>Um...furthermore, if the water ice was mixed in with rock and dust, it would be protected from <span class="highlight">evaporation</span>. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.72" data-time="258.91">[04:18.91]</span>Dian: So are you saying there might be <span class="highlight">primitive</span> life on the moon? </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.28" data-time="262.63">[04:22.63]</span>Professor: That's not my point at all. <span class="time" data-times="3.5" data-time="264.91">[04:24.91]</span>Um... OK, say there is water ice on the moon. <span class="time" data-times="5.28" data-time="268.41">[04:28.41]</span>That would be of very <span class="highlight">practical</span> value for a future moon <span class="highlight">base</span> for astronauts. <span class="time" data-times="3.68" data-time="273.69">[04:33.69]</span>Water ice could be melted and purified for drinking. <span class="time" data-times="5.54" data-time="277.37">[04:37.37]</span>It could also be broken down into its <span class="highlight">component</span> parts - <span class="highlight">oxygen</span> and <span class="highlight">hydrogen</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.92" data-time="282.91">[04:42.91]</span> <span class="highlight">Oxygen</span> could be used to breathe, and <span class="highlight">hydrogen</span> could be turned into <span class="highlight">fuel</span>, rocket <span class="highlight">fuel</span>. <span class="time" data-times="11.34" data-time="289.83">[04:49.83]</span>So water ice could enable the creation of a self-sustaining moon <span class="highlight">base</span> someday, a <span class="highlight">mining</span> camp perhaps or a departure point for further <span class="highlight">space</span> <span class="highlight">exploration</span>. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="7.76" data-time="301.17">[05:01.17]</span>Student: But hauling tons of equipment to the moon to make <span class="highlight">fuel</span> and build a life support system for a moon <span class="highlight">base</span>, wouldn't that be too expensive? </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.65" data-time="308.93">[05:08.93]</span>Professor: <span class="highlight">Permanent</span> <span class="highlight">base</span>, maybe a ways off, but we shouldn't have to wait for that. <span class="time" data-times="6.34" data-time="314.58">[05:14.58]</span>The dust at the bottom of the SPA <span class="highlight">Basin</span> really does have a <span class="highlight">fascinating</span> story to tell. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="320.92">[05:20.92]</span>I wouldn't give for a few samples of it. </p>
