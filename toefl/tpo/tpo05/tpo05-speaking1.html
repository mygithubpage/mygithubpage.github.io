It is still open now. It's only 5-minute's walk away from my home and sits beside the street. The internet bar is not very big. It only has two rooms and each is full of computers. In summer vacations, My friends and I usually went there early in the morning playing many computer games such as Age of Empire, Star War and Counter Strike. The owner of the bar is a very kind person. He opened the door very early in the morning just for us. My friends and I occupied a room, sit side by side and yelled to each other when we were playing games. It was a lot of fun.</p></article></div></main></body></html>
