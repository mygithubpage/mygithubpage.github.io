        <h3>Listening Text</h3>
        <article>
          <p>Narrator: Listen to a conversation between a student and a counselor at the University Counseling Center.</p>
          <p>:Student: Hi, thanks for seeing me on such short notice.</p>
          <p>:Counselor: No problem. How can I help?</p>
          <p>:Student: Well, I think I might have made a mistake coming to the school.</p>
          <p>:Counselor: What makes you say that?</p>
          <p>:Student: I'm a little overwhelmed by the size of this place. I come from a small town. There were only 75 of us in my high school graduating class.Everyone knew everyone. We all grew up together.</p>
          <p>:Counselor: So it's a bit of a culture shock for you? Being one of 15,000 students on a big campus in an unfamiliar city?</p>
          <p>:Student: That's an understatement. I just can't get comfortable in class or in the dorms. You know, socially.</p>
          <p>:Counselor: Ummm...well, let's start with your academics. Tell me about your classes.</p>
          <p>:Student: I'm taking mostly introductory courses and some are taught in these huge lecture halls.</p>
          <p>:Counselor: And you are having trouble in keeping pace with the material?</p>
          <p>:Student: No, in fact I got an A on my first economics paper. It's just that, it's so impersonal, I'm not used to it.</p>
          <p>:Counselor: Are all your classes impersonal?</p>
          <p>:Student: No, it's just that...for example, in sociology yesterday, the professor asked a question, so I raised my hand, several of us raised our hands. And I kept my hand up because I did the reading and knew the answer. But the professor just answered his own question and continued with the lecture.</p>
          <p>:Counselor: Well, in a big room it's possible he didn't notice you. Maybe he was trying to save time. In either case I wouldn't take it personally.</p>
          <p>:Student: I suppose. But I just don't know how to, you know, distinguish myself.</p>
          <p>:Counselor: Why not stop by his office during office hours?</p>
          <p>:Student: That wouldn't seem right. You know, taking time from other students who need help?</p>
          <p>:Counselor: Don't say that. That's what office hours are for. There is no reason you couldn't pop in to say hi and to make yourself known. If you are learning a lot in class, let the professor know. Wouldn't you appreciate positive feedback if you were a professor?</p>
          <p>:Student: You are right. That's a good idea.</p>
          <p>:Counselor: OK, er...let's turn to your social life. How's it going in the dorms?</p>
          <p>:Student: I don't have much in common with my roommate or anyone else I've met so far. Everyone's into sports and I'm more artsy, you know, into music. I play the cello.</p>
          <p>:Counselor: Hah, have you been playing long?</p>
          <p>:Student: Since age ten. It's a big part of my life. At home I was the youngest member of our community orchestra.</p>
          <p>:Counselor: You are not going to believe this. There is a string quartet on campus, all students. And it so happened that the cellist graduated last year. They've been searching high and low for a replacement, someone with experience. Would you be interested in auditioning?</p>
          <p>:Student: Absolutely. I wanted to get my academic work settled before pursuing my music here. But I think this would be a good thing for me. I guess if I really want to fit in here I should find people who love music as much as I do. Thank you.</p>
          <p>:Counselor: My pleasure.</p>
