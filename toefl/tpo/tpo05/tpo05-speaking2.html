Why or why not? Use details and examples to explain your answer.
It is more important to study math or science than it is to study art or literature.</p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>I strongly disagree with the statement that studying math or science is more important than studying art or literature. Of course, math and science are very important. But it is meaningless to say that they are more important than art or literature. We admire Newton for his scientific achievements such as Newton's first law. We equally admire Leonardo for his art accomplishments such as MonaLisa. These two people are not comparable because they are in two different fields. So some people may like studying science. Some may like studying literature. They all make contributions to the human civilizations. So math or science and art or literature, they are equally important.</p></article></div></main></body></html>
