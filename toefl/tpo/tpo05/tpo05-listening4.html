              <span class="time" data-times="4.64" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to a <span class="underline">conversation</span> between a student and a professor. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.76" data-time="4.64">[00:04.64]</span>Student: Hi, I was wondering if I could talk with you about the <span class="underline">assignment</span> in the <span class="underline">film</span> <span class="underline">theory</span> class. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="0.94" data-time="9.4">[00:09.40]</span>Professor: Of <span class="underline">course</span>, Jill. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.28" data-time="10.34">[00:10.34]</span>Student: It seems that <span class="underline">pretty</span> much everyone else in the class gets what they are supposed to be doing but I'm not so sure. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.26" data-time="16.62">[00:16.62]</span>Professor: Well, the class is for students who are really serious about <span class="underline">film</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.83" data-time="20.88">[00:20.88]</span>You must have taken <span class="underline">film</span> courses before. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.14" data-time="23.71">[00:23.71]</span>Student: Yeah, in high school, <span class="underline">film</span> <span class="underline">appreciation</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.41" data-time="26.85">[00:26.85]</span>Professor: Hmmm...I wouldn't think that would be enough. <span class="time" data-times="3.75" data-time="30.26">[00:30.26]</span>Did you <span class="underline">concentrate</span> mainly on form or <span class="underline">content</span>? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.57" data-time="34.01">[00:34.01]</span>Student: Oh, <span class="underline">definitely</span> <span class="underline">content</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.08" data-time="35.58">[00:35.58]</span>We'd watch, say Lord of the Flies, and then discuss it. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.23" data-time="39.66">[00:39.66]</span>Professor: Oh, that <span class="underline">approach</span>, treating <span class="underline">film</span> as <span class="underline">literature</span>, ignoring what makes it <span class="underline">unique</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.1" data-time="44.89">[00:44.89]</span>Student: I liked it, though. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.59" data-time="46.99">[00:46.99]</span>Professor: Sure, but that kind of class. <span class="time" data-times="2.61" data-time="49.58">[00:49.58]</span>Well, I'm not surprised that you are feeling a little lost. <span class="time" data-times="13.07" data-time="52.19">[00:52.19]</span>You know, we have two <span class="underline">introductory</span> courses that are supposed to be taken before you get to my <span class="underline">course</span>, one in <span class="underline">film</span> art, techniques, <span class="underline">technical</span> <span class="underline">stuff</span> and another in <span class="underline">film</span> <span class="underline">history</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.13" data-time="65.26">[01:05.26]</span>So students in the class you are in should be <span class="underline">pretty</span> far <span class="underline">along</span> in <span class="underline">film</span> studies. <span class="time" data-times="12.1" data-time="70.39">[01:10.39]</span>In fact, usually the system blocks anyone trying to sign up for a class they shouldn't be taking, who hasn't taken the courses you are required to do first as prerequisites. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.96" data-time="82.49">[01:22.49]</span>Student: Well, I did have a problem with that but I discussed it with one of your office <span class="underline">staff</span>, and she gave me <span class="underline">permission</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.56" data-time="88.45">[01:28.45]</span>Professor: Of <span class="underline">course</span>. No matter how many times I tell them, they just keep on... <span class="time" data-times="7.06" data-time="94.01">[01:34.01]</span>Well, for your own good, I'd really suggest dropping back and starting at the usual place. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.42" data-time="101.07">[01:41.07]</span>Student: Yes. But I've already been in this class for 4 weeks. <span class="time" data-times="4.75" data-time="104.49">[01:44.49]</span>I'd hate to just <span class="underline">drop</span> it now especially since I find it so different, so interesting. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.82" data-time="109.24">[01:49.24]</span>Professor: I guess so. <span class="time" data-times="2.91" data-time="111.06">[01:51.06]</span>Frankly I can't believe you've lasted this long. <span class="time" data-times="6.02" data-time="113.97">[01:53.97]</span>These are <span class="underline">pretty</span> in-depth theories we've been discussing and you've been doing OK so far, I guess. <span class="time" data-times="4.88" data-time="119.99">[01:59.99]</span>But still, the program's been designed to progress <span class="underline">through</span> certain stages. <span class="time" data-times="4.58" data-time="124.87">[02:04.87]</span>Like any other <span class="underline">professional</span> training we build on pervious knowledge. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.3" data-time="129.45">[02:09.45]</span>Student: Then maybe you could <span class="underline">recommend</span> some <span class="underline">extra</span> reading I can do to... catch up? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.32" data-time="133.75">[02:13.75]</span>Professor: Well, are you intending to study <span class="underline">film</span> as your main <span class="underline">concentration</span>? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.65" data-time="138.07">[02:18.07]</span>Student: No, no. I am just interested. <span class="time" data-times="3.11" data-time="140.72">[02:20.72]</span>I'm actually in marketing, but there seems to be a connection. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="15.94" data-time="143.83">[02:23.83]</span>Professor: Oh...well, in...in that case, if you're taking the <span class="underline">course</span> just out of <span class="underline">interest</span>, I mean I still highly <span class="underline">recommend</span> signing up for the <span class="underline">introductory</span> courses at some point, but in the <span class="underline">meantime</span>, there is no harm I guess in trying to keep up with this class. <span class="time" data-times="2.32" data-time="159.77">[02:39.77]</span>The <span class="underline">interest</span> is clearly there. <span class="time" data-times="7.21" data-time="162.09">[02:42.09]</span>Eh, <span class="underline">instead</span> of any <span class="underline">extra</span> reading just now though, you could view some of the old <span class="underline">introductory</span> lectures. <span class="time" data-times="1.33" data-time="169.3">[02:49.30]</span>We have them on video. <span class="time" data-times="2.76" data-time="170.63">[02:50.63]</span>That would give you a better <span class="underline">handle</span> on the <span class="underline">subject</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.02" data-time="173.39">[02:53.39]</span>It's still a <span class="underline">pretty</span> tall order, and we will be moving right <span class="underline">along</span>, so you will really need to stay on top of it. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.35" data-time="179.41">[02:59.41]</span>Student: OK, I've been warned.<span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="181.76">[03:01.76]</span> Now, could I tell you about my idea for the <span class="underline">assignment</span>? </p>
