          <h4 class="w3-center">Target Marketing</h4>
          <p>Advertisers in the past have used radio and television in an attempt to provide information about their products to large, general audiences; it was once thought that the best way to sell a product was to advertise it to as many people as possible. However, more recent trends in advertising have turned toward target marketing. Target marketing is the strategy of advertising to smaller, very specific audiences– audiences that have been determined to have the greatest need or desire for the product being marketed. Target marketing has proved to be very effective in reaching potential customers.</p>

You know, the phone has bright colors and they show kids having a good time with their friends. And, well, the company wants the kids watching TV at this time to want to buy this phone, this phone that's made especially for them.But, the same company will make a different commercial to be shown during, say, a program about business or a business news show. Now, for this group of people, business people, the company will have to show how efficient their phone is, how it can handle all business easily and maybe even save money. And here is the thing: it's basically the same phone. The company has just made two different commercials to appeal to different groups of people.</p>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>Targeted marketing is an effective marketing strategy, that is, a company advertises the product to a smaller and more specific audience so it's more likely to attract the customers in need. For example, a cellphone company may show a cellphone commercial emphasizing its variety of colors and entertainment functions during entertainment programs for young people like pop concerts or the like, since the audience then are usually teenagers, and they're very likely to be fascinated and ask their parents to buy the fun phone for them. However, the company may also create a different commercial that shows how convenient and productively helpful the phone is and put it during the business news hour to attract business people. According to the two examples, the cellphone company can maximize the sales of its cellphones with the help of target marketing. (137 words)</p>
