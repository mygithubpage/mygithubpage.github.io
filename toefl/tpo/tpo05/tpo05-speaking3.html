          <h4 class="w3-center">Campus Dining Club Announced</h4>
          <p>Starting this year, the university dining hall will be transformed into The Campus Dining Club for one week at the end of each semester. During the last week of each semester, the dining hall will feature special meals prepared by the university's culinary arts students. The school feels that this will give students who are studying cooking and food preparation valuable experience that will help them later, when they pursue careers. The university has announced that it will charge a small additional fee for these dinners in order to pay for the special gourmet food ingredients that will be required.</p>

          <p>Now listen to two students discussing the article.</p>
          <p>(woman) Did you see that article?</p>
          <p>(man) Yeah, and it sounds like a great idea. It's really good for students in that program.</p>
          <p>(woman) Don't they cook in class anyway?</p>
          <p>(man) Well, yeah, they do. But, my cousin was in the program a few years ago, and she said that it's very different to cook for a lot of people in that kind of atmosphere than to cook for classmates.</p>
          <p>(woman) Why is that?</p>
          <p>(man) Well, in class you can take your time, but, cooking for more people, there's more pressure, I mean, you're in a rush, people are waiting and it might be easy to make a mistake with all that stress.</p>
          <p>(woman) Then I'll think you are a bad chef, right?</p>
          <p>(man) Absolutely!</p>
          <p>(woman) So, OK, it's good practice. But what about the extra cost?</p>
          <p>(man) Well, look at it this way. You've eaten at some of the fancier restaurants in town, right?</p>
          <p>(woman) Yeah, there are some great places to eat around here.</p>
          <p>(man) Well, these students, they'll be making fantastic meals and it's gonna be cheaper than going out to one of those restaurants.</p>
          <p>(woman) Much cheaper, actually.</p>
          <p>(man) So, you know, it'll be worth it. The meals will be as good as the ones in those expensive restaurants.</p>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>The man agrees with the university's plan for two main reasons. First of all, he thinks it's a very good practice for the culinary art students. For them cooking in class is a lot easier than cooking for classmates in the dining hall, because while cooking in class they can take their time, but cooking in the dining hall is quite a different atmosphere, a more stressful one. The second reason from the man is that the culinary art students would make fantastic meals which are gonna be cheaper, and thus the students could save more money not dinning out in some of the expensive restaurants.
