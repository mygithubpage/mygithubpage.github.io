          <p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.27" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in a chemistry class.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.03" data-time="4.27">[00:04.27]</span>Professor: Okay. I know you all have a lot of questions about this lab <span class="underline">assignment</span> that's coming out so ... <span class="time" data-times="2.44" data-time="9.3">[00:09.30]</span>I'm <span class="underline">gonna</span> take a little time this morning to discuss it. <span class="time" data-times="4.01" data-time="11.74">[00:11.74]</span>So, you know the <span class="underline">assignment</span> has to do with Spectroscopy, right? <span class="time" data-times="3.48" data-time="15.75">[00:15.75]</span>And your reading should help you get a good idea of what that's all about. <span class="time" data-times="4.34" data-time="19.23">[00:19.23]</span>But, let's talk about Spectroscopy a little now just to cover the basics.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.92" data-time="23.57">[00:23.57]</span>What is Spectroscopy? <span class="time" data-times="8.55" data-time="26.49">[00:26.49]</span>Well, the simplest <span class="underline">definition</span> I can give you is that Spectroscopy is the study of the <span class="underline">interaction</span> between matter and light. <span class="time" data-times="9.45" data-time="35.04">[00:35.04]</span>Now, <span class="underline">visible</span> light consists of different colors or wavelengths, which together make up what's called <span class="underline">spectrum</span>, a <span class="underline">band</span> of colors, like you see in a <span class="underline">rainbow</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.27" data-time="44.49">[00:44.49]</span>And all substances, all forms of matter, can be <span class="underline">distinguished</span> according to what wavelength of light they <span class="underline">absorb</span> and which ones they <span class="underline">reflect</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.8" data-time="53.76">[00:53.76]</span>It's like, um, well, every <span class="underline">element</span> has, what we call, its own spectral signature. <span class="time" data-times="3.42" data-time="59.56">[00:59.56]</span>If we can read that signature, we can <span class="underline">identify</span> the <span class="underline">element</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.77" data-time="62.98">[01:02.98]</span>And that's exactly what spectroscopy does.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="12.12" data-time="65.75">[01:05.75]</span>Now, <span class="underline">Laser</span> Spectroscopy, which is the <span class="underline">focus</span> of your <span class="underline">assignment</span>, works by measuring very precisely what parts of the <span class="underline">spectrum</span> are absorbed by different substances. <span class="time" data-times="3.35" data-time="77.87">[01:17.87]</span>And it has applications in a lot of different disciplines. <span class="time" data-times="5.62" data-time="81.22">[01:21.22]</span>And your <span class="underline">assignment</span> will be to choose a <span class="underline">discipline</span> that interests you, and <span class="underline">devise</span> an experiment.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.92" data-time="86.84">[01:26.84]</span>For example, I'm <span class="underline">gonna</span> talk about art. <span class="time" data-times="6.4" data-time="89.76">[01:29.76]</span>I'm interested in the art and to me it's interesting how spectroscopy is used to <span class="underline">analyze</span> art. <span class="time" data-times="4.69" data-time="96.16">[01:36.16]</span>Let's say a museum curator comes to you with a problem. <span class="time" data-times="4.67" data-time="100.85">[01:40.85]</span>She's come <span class="underline">across</span> this painting that appears to be an <span class="underline">original</span> - let's say, a Rembrandt. <span class="time" data-times="2.65" data-time="105.52">[01:45.52]</span>And she wants to <span class="underline">acquire</span> it for her museum. <span class="time" data-times="4.77" data-time="108.17">[01:48.17]</span>But she's got a problem: she's not <span class="underline">absolutely</span> certain it's an <span class="underline">original</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.03" data-time="112.94">[01:52.94]</span>So, what do you do? <span class="time" data-times="2.78" data-time="114.97">[01:54.97]</span>How do you <span class="underline">determine</span> whether the painting's <span class="underline">authentic</span>?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.07" data-time="117.75">[01:57.75]</span>Okay. Think about the <span class="underline">scientific</span> <span class="underline">process</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.98" data-time="120.82">[02:00.82]</span>You've got the question: Is the painting a Rembrandt? <span class="time" data-times="6.13" data-time="123.8">[02:03.80]</span>So first, you'll need to make a <span class="underline">list</span> of characteristics the painting would have to have to be a Rembrandt. <span class="time" data-times="5.02" data-time="129.93">[02:09.93]</span>Then you have to discover whether the painting in question has those characteristics.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.66" data-time="134.95">[02:14.95]</span>So first of all, you'll need to know the techniques Rembrandt used when he applied paint to <span class="underline">canvas</span> - his brushstrokes, how thickly he applied his paint. <span class="time" data-times="5.54" data-time="144.61">[02:24.61]</span>So you'd need to work with an art historian who has expert knowledge of Rembrandt's style. <span class="time" data-times="16.51" data-time="150.15">[02:30.15]</span>You'd have to know when he created his paintings, um... what pigments he used, in other words, what ingredients he used to make different colors of paint, 'cause the ingredients used in paints and binding agents plus burnishes, finishes, what have you, have changed over time.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.3" data-time="166.66">[02:46.66]</span>Since you're trying to <span class="underline">verify</span> if it's a Rembrandt, the ingredients in the <span class="underline">pigment</span> would need to have been used during Rembrandt's lifetime - in the 17th <span class="underline">century</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.43" data-time="175.96">[02:55.96]</span>And that's where chemistry comes in. <span class="time" data-times="9.73" data-time="178.39">[02:58.39]</span>You've got to find out what's in those pigments, learn their <span class="underline">composition</span>, and that requires lab work - <span class="underline">detective</span> work really - in a word, Spectroscopy. <span class="time" data-times="3.02" data-time="188.12">[03:08.12]</span>So, how do we use Spectroscopy? <span class="time" data-times="6.52" data-time="191.14">[03:11.14]</span>Well, we put an <span class="underline">infrared</span> <span class="underline">microscope</span> - a spectroscope - on tiny tiny bits of paint. <span class="time" data-times="5.41" data-time="197.66">[03:17.66]</span>And using <span class="underline">ultraviolet</span> light we can see the spectral signature of each <span class="underline">component</span> part of the <span class="underline">pigment</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.35" data-time="203.07">[03:23.07]</span>Then we <span class="underline">compare</span> these signatures with those of <span class="underline">particular</span> elements like <span class="underline">zinc</span> or <span class="underline">lead</span>, to <span class="underline">determine</span> what the <span class="underline">pigment</span> was made of. <span class="time" data-times="5.79" data-time="211.42">[03:31.42]</span>So, you can see why this type of <span class="underline">analysis</span> requires a knowledge of the <span class="underline">history</span> of pigments, right? <span class="time" data-times="1.78" data-time="217.21">[03:37.21]</span>How and when they were made? <span class="time" data-times="3.9" data-time="218.99">[03:38.99]</span>Say we <span class="underline">determined</span> a <span class="underline">pigment</span> was made with <span class="underline">zinc</span>, for example. <span class="time" data-times="2.47" data-time="222.89">[03:42.89]</span>We know the spectral signature of <span class="underline">zinc</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.09" data-time="225.36">[03:45.36]</span>And it matches that of the paint <span class="underline">sample</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.18" data-time="227.45">[03:47.45]</span>We also know that <span class="underline">zinc</span> wasn't discovered until the 18th <span class="underline">century</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.02" data-time="231.63">[03:51.63]</span>And since Rembrandt lived during the 17th <span class="underline">century</span>, we know he couldn't have painted it.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.46" data-time="236.65">[03:56.65]</span>Now, Spectroscopy has a very <span class="underline">distinct</span> <span class="underline">advantage</span> over <span class="underline">previous</span> methods of analyzing our works, because it's not invasive. <span class="time" data-times="5.38" data-time="245.11">[04:05.11]</span>You don't have to remove big chips of paint to do your <span class="underline">analysis</span>, which is what other methods <span class="underline">require</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.1" data-time="250.49">[04:10.49]</span>All you do is to train the <span class="underline">microscope</span> on tiny flecks of paint and <span class="underline">analyze</span> them.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.19" data-time="255.59">[04:15.59]</span>Now a word or two about <span class="underline">restoration</span>. <span class="time" data-times="12.63" data-time="258.78">[04:18.78]</span>Sometimes <span class="underline">original</span> art works <span class="underline">appear</span> questionable or inauthentic because they've had so many restorers add touch-up layers to cover up damage, damage from the paint having deteriorated over time. <span class="time" data-times="4.92" data-time="271.41">[04:31.41]</span>Well, spectroscopy can <span class="underline">reveal</span> the <span class="underline">composition</span> of those touch-up layers too. <span class="time" data-times="2.46" data-time="276.33">[04:36.33]</span>So we can find out when they were applied. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="278.79">[04:38.79]</span>Then if we want to undo some bad <span class="underline">restoration</span> attempts, we can <span class="underline">determine</span> what kind of <span class="underline">process</span> we can use to remove them to <span class="underline">dissolve</span> the paint and uncover the <span class="underline">original</span>.</p>
