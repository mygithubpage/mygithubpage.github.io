I know you all have a lot of questions about this lab <span class="highlight">assignment</span> that's coming out so ... <span class="time" data-times="2.44" data-time="9.3">[00:09.30]</span>I'm <span class="highlight">gonna</span> take a little time this morning to discuss it. <span class="time" data-times="4.01" data-time="11.74">[00:11.74]</span>So, you know the <span class="highlight">assignment</span> has to do with Spectroscopy, right? <span class="time" data-times="3.48" data-time="15.75">[00:15.75]</span>And your reading should help you get a good idea of what that's all about. <span class="time" data-times="4.34" data-time="19.23">[00:19.23]</span>But, let's talk about Spectroscopy a little now just to cover the basics.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.92" data-time="23.57">[00:23.57]</span>What is Spectroscopy? <span class="time" data-times="8.55" data-time="26.49">[00:26.49]</span>Well, the simplest <span class="highlight">definition</span> I can give you is that Spectroscopy is the study of the <span class="highlight">interaction</span> between matter and light. <span class="time" data-times="9.45" data-time="35.04">[00:35.04]</span>Now, <span class="highlight">visible</span> light consists of different colors or wavelengths, which together make up what's called <span class="highlight">spectrum</span>, a <span class="highlight">band</span> of colors, like you see in a <span class="highlight">rainbow</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="9.27" data-time="44.49">[00:44.49]</span>And all substances, all forms of matter, can be <span class="highlight">distinguished</span> according to what wavelength of light they <span class="highlight">absorb</span> and which ones they <span class="highlight">reflect</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.8" data-time="53.76">[00:53.76]</span>It's like, um, well, every <span class="highlight">element</span> has, what we call, its own spectral signature. <span class="time" data-times="3.42" data-time="59.56">[00:59.56]</span>If we can read that signature, we can <span class="highlight">identify</span> the <span class="highlight">element</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.77" data-time="62.98">[01:02.98]</span>And that's exactly what spectroscopy does.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="12.12" data-time="65.75">[01:05.75]</span>Now, <span class="highlight">Laser</span> Spectroscopy, which is the <span class="highlight">focus</span> of your <span class="highlight">assignment</span>, works by measuring very precisely what parts of the <span class="highlight">spectrum</span> are absorbed by different substances. <span class="time" data-times="3.35" data-time="77.87">[01:17.87]</span>And it has applications in a lot of different disciplines. <span class="time" data-times="5.62" data-time="81.22">[01:21.22]</span>And your <span class="highlight">assignment</span> will be to choose a <span class="highlight">discipline</span> that interests you, and <span class="highlight">devise</span> an experiment.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.92" data-time="86.84">[01:26.84]</span>For example, I'm <span class="highlight">gonna</span> talk about art. <span class="time" data-times="6.4" data-time="89.76">[01:29.76]</span>I'm interested in the art and to me it's interesting how spectroscopy is used to <span class="highlight">analyze</span> art. <span class="time" data-times="4.69" data-time="96.16">[01:36.16]</span>Let's say a museum curator comes to you with a problem. <span class="time" data-times="4.67" data-time="100.85">[01:40.85]</span>She's come <span class="highlight">across</span> this painting that appears to be an <span class="highlight">original</span> - let's say, a Rembrandt. <span class="time" data-times="2.65" data-time="105.52">[01:45.52]</span>And she wants to <span class="highlight">acquire</span> it for her museum. <span class="time" data-times="4.77" data-time="108.17">[01:48.17]</span>But she's got a problem: she's not <span class="highlight">absolutely</span> certain it's an <span class="highlight">original</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.03" data-time="112.94">[01:52.94]</span>So, what do you do? <span class="time" data-times="2.78" data-time="114.97">[01:54.97]</span>How do you <span class="highlight">determine</span> whether the painting's <span class="highlight">authentic</span>?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.07" data-time="117.75">[01:57.75]</span>Okay. Think about the <span class="highlight">scientific</span><span class="highlight">process</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.98" data-time="120.82">[02:00.82]</span>You've got the question: Is the painting a Rembrandt? <span class="time" data-times="6.13" data-time="123.8">[02:03.80]</span>So first, you'll need to make a <span class="highlight">list</span> of characteristics the painting would have to have to be a Rembrandt. <span class="time" data-times="5.02" data-time="129.93">[02:09.93]</span>Then you have to discover whether the painting in question has those characteristics.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="9.66" data-time="134.95">[02:14.95]</span>So first of all, you'll need to know the techniques Rembrandt used when he applied paint to <span class="highlight">canvas</span> - his brushstrokes, how thickly he applied his paint. <span class="time" data-times="5.54" data-time="144.61">[02:24.61]</span>So you'd need to work with an art historian who has expert knowledge of Rembrandt's style. <span class="time" data-times="16.51" data-time="150.15">[02:30.15]</span>You'd have to know when he created his paintings, um... what pigments he used, in other words, what ingredients he used to make different colors of paint, 'cause the ingredients used in paints and binding agents plus burnishes, finishes, what have you, have changed over time.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="9.3" data-time="166.66">[02:46.66]</span>Since you're trying to <span class="highlight">verify</span> if it's a Rembrandt, the ingredients in the <span class="highlight">pigment</span> would need to have been used during Rembrandt's lifetime - in the 17th <span class="highlight">century</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.43" data-time="175.96">[02:55.96]</span>And that's where chemistry comes in. <span class="time" data-times="9.73" data-time="178.39">[02:58.39]</span>You've got to find out what's in those pigments, learn their <span class="highlight">composition</span>, and that requires lab work - <span class="highlight">detective</span> work really - in a word, Spectroscopy. <span class="time" data-times="3.02" data-time="188.12">[03:08.12]</span>So, how do we use Spectroscopy? <span class="time" data-times="6.52" data-time="191.14">[03:11.14]</span>Well, we put an <span class="highlight">infrared</span><span class="highlight">microscope</span> - a spectroscope - on tiny tiny bits of paint. <span class="time" data-times="5.41" data-time="197.66">[03:17.66]</span>And using <span class="highlight">ultraviolet</span> light we can see the spectral signature of each <span class="highlight">component</span> part of the <span class="highlight">pigment</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="8.35" data-time="203.07">[03:23.07]</span>Then we <span class="highlight">compare</span> these signatures with those of <span class="highlight">particular</span> elements like <span class="highlight">zinc</span> or <span class="highlight">lead</span>, to <span class="highlight">determine</span> what the <span class="highlight">pigment</span> was made of. <span class="time" data-times="5.79" data-time="211.42">[03:31.42]</span>So, you can see why this type of <span class="highlight">analysis</span> requires a knowledge of the <span class="highlight">history</span> of pigments, right? <span class="time" data-times="1.78" data-time="217.21">[03:37.21]</span>How and when they were made? <span class="time" data-times="3.9" data-time="218.99">[03:38.99]</span>Say we <span class="highlight">determined</span> a <span class="highlight">pigment</span> was made with <span class="highlight">zinc</span>, for example. <span class="time" data-times="2.47" data-time="222.89">[03:42.89]</span>We know the spectral signature of <span class="highlight">zinc</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.09" data-time="225.36">[03:45.36]</span>And it matches that of the paint <span class="highlight">sample</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.18" data-time="227.45">[03:47.45]</span>We also know that <span class="highlight">zinc</span> wasn't discovered until the 18th <span class="highlight">century</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.02" data-time="231.63">[03:51.63]</span>And since Rembrandt lived during the 17th <span class="highlight">century</span>, we know he couldn't have painted it.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="8.46" data-time="236.65">[03:56.65]</span>Now, Spectroscopy has a very <span class="highlight">distinct</span><span class="highlight">advantage</span> over <span class="highlight">previous</span> methods of analyzing our works, because it's not invasive. <span class="time" data-times="5.38" data-time="245.11">[04:05.11]</span>You don't have to remove big chips of paint to do your <span class="highlight">analysis</span>, which is what other methods <span class="highlight">require</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.1" data-time="250.49">[04:10.49]</span>All you do is to train the <span class="highlight">microscope</span> on tiny flecks of paint and <span class="highlight">analyze</span> them.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.19" data-time="255.59">[04:15.59]</span>Now a word or two about <span class="highlight">restoration</span>. <span class="time" data-times="12.63" data-time="258.78">[04:18.78]</span>Sometimes <span class="highlight">original</span> art works <span class="highlight">appear</span> questionable or inauthentic because they've had so many restorers add touch-up layers to cover up damage, damage from the paint having deteriorated over time. <span class="time" data-times="4.92" data-time="271.41">[04:31.41]</span>Well, spectroscopy can <span class="highlight">reveal</span> the <span class="highlight">composition</span> of those touch-up layers too. <span class="time" data-times="2.46" data-time="276.33">[04:36.33]</span>So we can find out when they were applied. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="278.79">[04:38.79]</span>Then if we want to undo some bad <span class="highlight">restoration</span> attempts, we can <span class="highlight">determine</span> what kind of <span class="highlight">process</span> we can use to remove them to <span class="highlight">dissolve</span> the paint and uncover the <span class="highlight">original</span>.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the main purpose of the lecture?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To discuss recent innovations in laboratory equipment.</p><p>B. To give an example of a practical use for a particular scientific technique.</p><p>C. To familiarize students with the chemical composition of paint pigments.</p><p>D. To show how researchers were able to restore a particular work of art.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The professor had said a large section to review the concept of Spectroscopy, and the content after now is the focus of today, namely the application of the specific analysis of Laser Spectroscopy, that is, To give an example of a practical use for a particular scientific technique.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor imply when he mentions an art historian?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Art historians have been learning how to use spectroscopes.</p><p>B. Scientists need to learn how art historians analyze paintings.</p><p>C. Confirming the authenticity of artworks requires collaboration.</p><p>D. Spectroscopic analysis can help identify a painter's techniques.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>To identify the authenticity of a painting requires an analysis of the figment's age. This is also the reason for the need for art historians. Only by collaborating with scholars in the field of art can the publicity of spectroscopes be fully realized, that is, the appraisal work requires collaboration.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor discuss the presence of zinc in paint pigments?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To explain why some paints may deteriorate over the course of time.</p><p>B. To stress the need for caution when attempting to restore old artworks.</p><p>C. To show how pigments differ from varnishes and binding agents.</p><p>D. To show how spectroscopy can help establish the age of a painting.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>By analyzing the zinc with spectroscopy and art historian's knowledge of pigment, the painting is not a real trace. From this process, it is illustrated how the spectroscopy helps identification, that is, the D option.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor, what is the primary advantage of spectroscopy over other laboratory methods for analyzing artworks?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It does not damage the artworks.</p><p>B. It provides a more accurate analysis than other methods do.</p><p>C. It uses equipment that can be transferred to other locations.</p><p>D. It can be used by individuals with little scientific training.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>From the professor's introduction to Spectroscopy, it can be seen that its superiority over other methods of identification is that it is not invasive, ie it does not destroy the work. D obviously requires specialized scientific training to be able to use Spectroscopy so wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is one way the professor mention that can help with art restoration?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. By re-creating the pigments and binding agents used by artists of earlier eras.</p><p>B. By removing pigments and binding agents that dissolve paintings over time.</p><p>C. By creating protective coatings of paint that do not damage original paintings.</p><p>D. By developing ways to safely remove paint added by previous restorers.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>In lecture's last professor, Now a word or two about restoration Then briefly introduced the use of spectroscopy in restoration, that is, it can be used to eliminate and dissolve the bad part of the restoration. That is the D option. Not making a pigment from A so wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor say this?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. He is searching for a synonym for the term.</p><p>B. He is not sure how much information the student need.</p><p>C. He is going to briefly address a related topic.</p><p>D. He is giving the students a writing assignment.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>In Professor Last's lecture, Now a word or two about restoration Then briefly introduced the use of spectroscopy in restoration, that is, it can be used to eliminate and dissolve the bad part of the restoration. So choose C.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
