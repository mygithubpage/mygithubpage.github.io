            <b>Speciation in Geographically Isolated Populations</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>
            <span class="underline">Evolutionary</span> biologists believe that <span class="underline">speciation</span>, the <span class="underline">formation</span> of a new <span class="underline">species</span>, often begins when some kind of <span class="underline">physical</span> <span class="underline">barrier</span> arises and divides a <span class="underline">population</span> of a single <span class="underline">species</span> into <span class="underline">separate</span> subpopulations. <span class="underline">Physical</span> separation between subpopulations <span class="light">promotes</span> the <span class="underline">formation</span> of new <span class="underline">species</span> because once the members of one subpopulation can no longer <span class="underline">mate</span> with members of another subpopulation, they cannot <span class="underline">exchange</span> <span class="underline">variant</span> genes that arise in one of the subpopulations. In the <span class="underline">absence</span> of <span class="underline">gene</span> flow between the subpopulations, <span class="underline">genetic</span> differences between the groups begin to <span class="underline">accumulate</span>. Eventually the subpopulations become so <span class="underline">genetically</span> <span class="underline">distinct</span> that they cannot interbreed <span class="underline">even</span> if the <span class="underline">physical</span> barriers between them were removed. At this point the subpopulations have evolved into <span class="underline">distinct</span> <span class="underline">species</span>. This <span class="underline">route</span> to <span class="underline">speciation</span> is known as allopatry ("allo-" means "different", and "patria" means "homeland").</p>
          <p>Allopatric <span class="underline">speciation</span> may be the main <span class="underline">speciation</span> <span class="underline">route</span>. This should not be surprising, since allopatry is <span class="underline">pretty</span> <span class="underline">common</span>. In general, subpopulations of most <span class="underline">species</span> are separated from each other by some measurable distance. So <span class="underline">even</span> under normal situations the <span class="underline">gene</span> flow among the subpopulations is more of an intermittent trickle than a <span class="underline">steady</span> <span class="underline">stream</span>. In <span class="underline">addition</span>, barriers can rapidly arise and shut off the trickle. For example, in the 1800s a monstrous earthquake changed the <span class="underline">course</span> of the Mississippi River, a large river flowing in the central part of the United States of America. The change separated populations of insects now living <span class="underline">along</span> <span class="underline">opposite</span> shores, completely cutting off <span class="underline">gene</span> flow between them.</p>
          <p>Geographic isolation can also <span class="underline">proceed</span> slowly, over great spans of time. We find <span class="underline">evidence</span> of such extended events in the <span class="underline">fossil</span> <span class="underline">record</span>, which affords <span class="underline">glimpse</span> into the breakup of formerly <span class="underline">continuous</span> environments. For example, during past ice ages, glaciers <span class="underline">advanced</span> down <span class="underline">through</span> North America and Europe and <span class="underline">gradually</span> cut off parts of populations from one another. When the glaciers retreated, the separated populations of plants and animals came into <span class="underline">contact</span> again. Some groups that had descended from the same parent <span class="underline">population</span> were no longer reproductively <span class="underline">compatible</span> – they had evolved into <span class="underline">separate</span> <span class="underline">species</span>. In other groups, however, <span class="underline">genetic</span> divergences had not proceeded so far, and the descendants could still interbreed – for them, <span class="underline">reproductive</span> isolation was not completed, and so <span class="underline">speciation</span> had not occurred.</p>
          <p>Allopatric <span class="underline">speciation</span> can also be brought by the imperceptibly slow but <span class="underline">colossal</span> movements of the <span class="underline">tectonic</span> plates that make up Earth's surface. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>About 5 million years ago such geologic movements created the land bridge between North America and South America that we call the <span class="underline">Isthmus</span> of Panama . <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>While <span class="underline">previously</span> the <span class="underline">gap</span> between the continents had allowed a free flow of water, now the <span class="underline">isthmus</span> presented a <span class="underline">barrier</span> that divided the Atlantic Ocean from the <span class="underline">Pacific</span> Ocean. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>This <span class="underline">division</span> set the <span class="underline">stage</span> for allopatric <span class="underline">speciation</span> among populations of fishes and other <span class="underline">marine</span> <span class="underline">species</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p>
          <p>In the 1980s, John Graves studied two populations of closely related fishes, one <span class="underline">population</span> from the Atlantic side of <span class="underline">isthmus</span>, the other from the <span class="underline">Pacific</span> side. He compared four enzymes found in the muscles of each <span class="underline">population</span>. Graves found that all four <span class="underline">Pacific</span> enzymes <span class="underline">function</span> better at <span class="underline">lower</span> temperatures than the four Atlantic versions of the same enzymes. This is <span class="underline">significant</span> because <span class="underline">Pacific</span> seawater if typically 2 to 3 degrees cooler than seawater on the Atlantic side of <span class="underline">isthmus</span>. <span class="underline">Analysis</span> by gel electrophoresis revealed <span class="underline">slight</span> differences in <span class="underline">amino</span> <span class="underline">acid</span> <span class="underline">sequence</span> of the enzymes of two of the four pairs. This is <span class="underline">significant</span> because the <span class="underline">amino</span> <span class="underline">acid</span> <span class="underline">sequence</span> of an <span class="underline">enzyme</span> is <span class="underline">determined</span> by genes.</p>
          <p>Graves drew two conclusions from these observations. First, at <span class="underline">least</span> some of the observed differences between the enzymes of the Atlantic and <span class="underline">Pacific</span> fish populations were not <span class="underline">random</span> but were the result of <span class="underline">evolutionary</span> <span class="underline">adaptation</span>. <span class="underline">Second</span>, it appears that closely related populations of fishes on both sides of the <span class="underline">isthmus</span> are starting to <span class="underline">genetically</span> <span class="underline">diverge</span> from each other. Because Graves' study of geographically <span class="underline">isolated</span> populations of <span class="underline">isthmus</span> fishes offers a <span class="underline">glimpse</span> of the beginning of a <span class="underline">process</span> of <span class="underline">gradual</span> <span class="underline">accumulation</span> of mutations that are <span class="underline">neutral</span> or <span class="underline">adaptive</span>, divergences here might be <span class="underline">evidence</span> of allopatric <span class="underline">speciation</span> in <span class="underline">process</span>.</p>
