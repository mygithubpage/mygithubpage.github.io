In the <span class="highlight">absence</span> of <span class="highlight">gene</span> flow between the subpopulations, <span class="highlight">genetic</span> differences between the groups begin to <span class="highlight"><span class="question4">accumulate</span></span>. Eventually the subpopulations become so <span class="highlight">genetically</span><span class="highlight">distinct</span> that they cannot interbreed <span class="highlight">even</span> if the <span class="highlight">physical</span> barriers between them were removed. At this point the subpopulations have evolved into <span class="highlight">distinct</span><span class="highlight">species</span>. This <span class="highlight">route</span> to <span class="highlight">speciation</span> is known as allopatry ("allo-" means "different", and "patria" means "homeland").</p><p>Allopatric <span class="highlight">speciation</span> may be the main <span class="highlight">speciation</span><span class="highlight">route</span>. This should not be surprising, since allopatry is <span class="highlight">pretty</span><span class="highlight">common</span>. In general, <span class="question3">subpopulations of most <span class="highlight">species</span> are separated from each other by some measurable distance.</span> So <span class="highlight">even</span> under normal situations the <span class="highlight">gene</span> flow among the subpopulations is more of an intermittent trickle than a <span class="highlight">steady</span><span class="highlight">stream</span>. In <span class="highlight">addition</span>, barriers can rapidly arise and shut off the trickle. For example, in the 1800s a monstrous earthquake changed the <span class="highlight">course</span> of the Mississippi River, a large river flowing in the central part of the United States of America. The change separated populations of insects now living <span class="highlight">along</span><span class="highlight">opposite</span> shores, completely cutting off <span class="highlight">gene</span> flow between them.</p><p>Geographic isolation can also <span class="highlight">proceed</span> slowly, over great spans of time. We find <span class="highlight">evidence</span> of such extended events in the <span class="highlight">fossil</span><span class="highlight">record</span>, which affords <span class="highlight">glimpse</span> into the breakup of formerly <span class="highlight">continuous</span> environments. For example, during past ice ages, glaciers <span class="highlight">advanced</span> down <span class="highlight">through</span> North America and Europe and <span class="highlight">gradually</span> cut off parts of populations from one another. When the glaciers retreated, the separated populations of plants and animals came into <span class="highlight">contact</span> again. Some groups that had descended from the same parent <span class="highlight">population</span> were no longer reproductively <span class="highlight">compatible</span> ï¿½ they had evolved into <span class="highlight">separate</span><span class="highlight">species</span>. In other groups, however, <span class="highlight">genetic</span> divergences had not proceeded so far, and the descendants could still interbreed ï¿½ for them, <span class="highlight">reproductive</span> isolation was not completed, and so <span class="highlight">speciation</span> had not occurred.</p><p>Allopatric <span class="highlight">speciation</span> can also be brought by the imperceptibly slow but <span class="highlight"><span class="question7">colossal</span></span> movements of the <span class="highlight">tectonic</span> plates that make up Earth's surface. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>About 5 million years ago such geologic movements created the land bridge between North America and South America that we call the <span class="highlight">Isthmus</span> of Panama . <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>While <span class="highlight">previously</span> the <span class="highlight">gap</span> between the continents had allowed a free flow of water, now the <span class="highlight">isthmus</span> presented a <span class="highlight">barrier</span> that divided the Atlantic Ocean from the <span class="highlight">Pacific</span> Ocean. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>This <span class="highlight">division</span> set the <span class="highlight">stage</span> for allopatric <span class="highlight">speciation</span> among populations of fishes and other <span class="highlight">marine</span><span class="highlight">species</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p><p>In the 1980s, John Graves studied two populations of closely related fishes, one <span class="highlight">population</span> from the Atlantic side of <span class="highlight">isthmus</span>, the other from the <span class="highlight">Pacific</span> side. He compared four enzymes found in the muscles of each <span class="highlight">population</span>. Graves found that all four <span class="highlight">Pacific</span> enzymes <span class="highlight">function</span> better at <span class="highlight">lower</span> temperatures than the four Atlantic versions of the same enzymes. This is <span class="highlight">significant</span> because <span class="highlight">Pacific</span> seawater if typically 2 to 3 degrees cooler than seawater on the Atlantic side of <span class="highlight">isthmus</span>. <span class="highlight">Analysis</span> by gel electrophoresis revealed <span class="highlight">slight</span> differences in <span class="highlight">amino</span><span class="highlight">acid</span><span class="highlight"><span class="question9">sequence</span></span> of the enzymes of two of the four pairs. This is <span class="highlight">significant</span> because the <span class="highlight">amino</span><span class="highlight">acid</span><span class="highlight"><span class="question9">sequence</span></span> of an <span class="highlight">enzyme</span> is <span class="highlight">determined</span> by genes.</p><p>Graves drew two conclusions from these observations. First, at <span class="highlight">least</span> some of the observed differences between the enzymes of the Atlantic and <span class="highlight">Pacific</span> fish populations were not <span class="highlight">random</span> but were the result of <span class="highlight">evolutionary</span><span class="highlight">adaptation</span>. <span class="highlight">Second</span>, it appears that closely related populations of fishes on both sides of the <span class="highlight">isthmus</span> are starting to <span class="highlight">genetically</span><span class="highlight">diverge</span> from each other. <span class="question12">Because Graves' study of geographically <span class="highlight">isolated</span> populations of <span class="highlight">isthmus</span> fishes offers a <span class="highlight">glimpse</span> of the beginning of a <span class="highlight">process</span> of <span class="highlight">gradual</span><span class="highlight">accumulation</span> of mutations that are <span class="highlight">neutral</span> or <span class="highlight">adaptive</span>, divergences here might be <span class="highlight">evidence</span> of allopatric <span class="highlight">speciation</span> in <span class="highlight">process</span>.</span></p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">promotes</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. describes</p><p>B. encourages</p><p>C. delays</p><p>D. requires</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Promote: promote. Corresponds to the B option encourage. Corresponding to the original: Physical separation between subpopulations promotes the formation of new species because once the members of one subpopulation can no longer mate with members of another subpopulation, they cannot exchange variant genes that arise in one of the subpopulations. Also the original sentence means subpopulations The physical partition between the promoters promotes the formation of new species, substituting four options, the A option description, B, C, and D. So B is the most appropriate.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 1, allopatric speciation involves which of the following?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The division of a population into subspecies</p><p>B. The reuniting of separated populations after they have become distinct species</p><p>C. The movement of a population to a new homeland</p><p>D. The absence of gene flow between subpopulations</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>Based on the positioning of allopatric, you can navigate to the last sentence of this paragraph. The last sentence is a naming and definition of the previous phenomenon. In other words, the previous content is the meaning of allopatry. D is correct, corresponding to starting from In the first to the last.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the author provide the information that "<span class="highlight">subpopulations of most species are separated from each other by some measurable distance</span>"?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To indicate how scientists are able to determine whether subpopulations of a species are allopathic.</p><p>B. To define what it means for a group of animals or plants to be a subpopulation.</p><p>C. To suggest that allopathic speciation is not the only route to speciation.</p><p>D. To help explain why allopatric speciation is a common way for new species to come about.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="subpopulations of most species are separated from each other by some measurable distance D"><p>The sentence preceding the highlighted sentence, which is the first sentence (subject sentence) of this paragraph, is the main speciation route. This paragraph is all about this topic. So choose D.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question4">accumulate</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Become more significant</p><p>B. Occur randomly</p><p>C. Gradually increase in number</p><p>D. Cause changes</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" C"><p>Accumulate: Accumulation, accumulation. The gradually increased in number corresponding to the C option (increasing in number)</p><p>Corresponding to the original: In the absence of gene flow between the subpopulations, genetic differences between the groups begin to <span class="question4">accumulate</span>.</p><p>The vocabulary of the sentence said that the difference between the genes in the community began to <span class="question4">accumulate</span> . Eventually is helpful for understanding this word. How it happened, eventually reached the effect of this sentence. Well, that is to say, it is gradually developed to be able to say the end. So the answer lies between A and C. But because it emphasizes the slow process, it is gradually more appropriate.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>In paragraph 2, why does the author mention that some insect populations were separated from each other by a change in the course of Mississippi River caused by an earthquake?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To make the point that some kind of physical barrier separates the subpopulations of most species</p><p>B. To support the claim that the condition of allopatry can sometimes arise in a short time</p><p>C. To provide an example of a situation in which gene flow among the subpopulations of a species happens at a slow rate</p><p>D. To explain insects living along opposite shores of the Mississippi River are very different from each other</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Position the text with earthquake, followed by the content of the question in the For example. This means that the author uses this as an example to support the previous point of view. The previous point is that barriers can happen suddenly and then truncate the trickle. So the corresponding is B.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 3, separation of subpopulations by glaciers resulted in speciation in those groups of plants and animals that</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. were reproductively isolated even after the glaciers disappeared</p><p>B. had adjusted to the old conditions caused by the glaciers</p><p>C. were able to survive being separated from their parent population</p><p>D. had experienced some genetic divergences from their parent population</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>Position "When the glaciers retereated ...." according to Glaciers and plants and animals. The sentence is the result of glacier separation. So corresponds to option A.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question7">colossal</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. consistent</p><p>B. gradual</p><p>C. enormous</p><p>D. effective</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" C"><p>Colossal: Huge, very, here corresponds to the c option of enormous (huge, huge).</p><p>Corresponding to the original: Allopatric speciation can also be brought by the imperceptibly slow but <span class="question7">colossal</span> movements of the tectonic plates that make up Earth's surface. Analysis of the original text can also get the correct answer, the text has a clear turning logic, that is, before and after the <span class="question7">colossal</span> and Slow, the two have a turning point. After inferring that a slow process, but a large amount, it is enough to make a huge change. So choose C. The consistent (consistent) option of A, the gradual (gradual) option of B, and the effective (effective) option of D are not appropriate.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, which of the following is true of the geologic movements that brought about the Isthmus of Panama?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The movement brought populations of certain fishes and marine organisms into contact with one another for the first time.</p><p>B. The movement transferred populations of fishes and other marine animals between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans.</p><p>C. The movement created conditions that allowed water to flow more freely between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans.</p><p>D. The movement created conditions for the formation of new species of fished and other marine animals.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>Targeted by Isthmus of Panama. Starting from About, the last sentence of this paragraph says the result of isthmus of Panama and corresponds to the D option.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "sequence" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. quality</p><p>B. order</p><p>C. function</p><p>D. number</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Sequence: order. Corresponds to the order of the B option.</p><p>Corresponding to the original: Analysis by gel electrophoresis revealed slightly differences in amino acid sequence of the enzymes of two of the four pairs.</p><p>The sentence in which the word is highlighted mentions amino acids, enzymes, and pairs. In fact, it is a pair of genes. Gel electrophoresis analysis revealed a small amount of amino acid sequence differences. A quality, C function, and D quantity are not correct, and B sequence should be selected. (Understand a little biological knowledge is easy to understand it) and the sequence itself is the sequence, the meaning of the order.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 5, by comparing the enzymes from two related groups of fishes on opposite sides of the Isthmus, Graves found evidence that</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. there were slight genetic divergences between the two groups</p><p>B. the Atlantic group of fishes were descended from the Pacific group of fishes</p><p>C. the temperature of water on either side of the Isthmus had changed</p><p>D. genetic changes in the Atlantic group of fishes were more rapid and frequent than in the Pacific group of fishes</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The position corresponding to the above question is the same. Or you can position it according to Graves found. Reading A can be easily done by reading the following sections.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>It can be inferred from paragraph 5 and 6 that the reason Graves concluded that some of the differences between the Pacific and Atlantic enzymes were not random was that</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. each of the Pacific enzymes works better in cooler waters</p><p>B. the Enzymes of the Atlantic fish populations had not changed since the formation of the Isthmus of Panama</p><p>C. gel electrophoresis showed that the changes benefited both the Atlantic and the Pacific fish populations</p><p>D. the differences between the enzymes disappeared when the two fish populations were experimentally switched to other side of the isthmus</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A corresponds to the fifth paragraph of information sentence, B is obviously wrong, the article has been saying change. The C article mentions that gel electrophoresis only means that the order of amino acids has changed, but did not say both benefited. D article also did not mention.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Graves's study provides evidence that isthmus fishes are in the process of becoming geographically isolated.</p><p>B. Graves's study of mutating isthmus fishes yields results that differ from results of other studies involving allopatric speciation.</p><p>C. Graves's study of isolated populations of isthmus fishes provides some evidence that allopatric speciation might be beginning.</p><p>D. Graves's study indicates that when isolated, populations of isthmus fishes register neutral or adaptive mutations.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The original sentence is obviously a causal logic. The study of Graves's geographical segregation of isthmus fish provides some clues for the gradual accumulation process of neutral or adaptive mutations, and the differences here may be given to the ongoing exotic species. Formation provides evidence. Among them, the reason is Graves's study offers a glimpse of beginning. The result is divergence might be evidence. The C option summarizes these two points by rewriting. The A option seems to be correct, but it ignores the might of the original text, which becomes a fact, and the original text says it is possible; the B option and the original sentence are too different; the D option misses the content of the results section.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The formation of the isthmus had important consequences for global patterns of ocean water flow..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The sentence to be inserted refers to the formation of the isthmus, then the isthmus already appears in the front of the proof sentence, and the consequences are explained later. The second empty is logical, so choose B.</p></div></div><div id="question14" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>Prose Summary. Allopatric speciation takes place when physically separated populations of a single species gradually diverge genetically to the point of becoming unable to interbreed.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.Allopatric speciation is common because the gene flow between subpopulations is generally limited and the barriers that completely separate subpopulations can arise in a variety of ways.</p><p>B.During past ice ages, some, but not all, subpopulations separated by glaciers evolved into distinct species.</p><p>C.Speciation does not need to take place through allopatry because subpopulations will form distinct species whenever there are adaptive advantages to not interbreeding with other subpopulations.</p><p>D.Physical barriers from glaciers and the movement of tectonic plates form so slowly that the subpopulations on either side of the barriers usually do not form distinct species.</p><p>E.Graves's study of fish populations separately by the Isthmus of Panama may well provide a picture of the beginning stages of speciation.</p><p>F.Graves's study of physically separated fish populations show that there must be large differences between the environments of the isolated populations if allopatric speciation is to take place.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="ABE"><p>A: Corresponding to the second paragraph of the article.</p><p>B: The third paragraph of the corresponding article.</p><p>C: Errors and conflicts with the article. The article has always emphasized that allopatry is the most important speciation route.</p><p>D: Error. Corresponding to the third paragraph of the article, reference can be made to the analysis of the vocabulary question <span class="question7">colossal</span>. The article mentions not only the large number of slow but also the distinct species.</p><p>E: Same as the corresponding position of 12 questions.</p><p>F: Error, contradicting the sentence where the vocabulary question is located in the article. That sentence mentions a slight difference.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
