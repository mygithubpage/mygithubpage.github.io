            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.99" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a <span class="underline">conversation</span> between a student and her United States <span class="underline">History</span> professor.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.32" data-time="6.99">[00:06.99]</span>Professor: So, Amanda, you've asked a lot of questions about <span class="underline">trade</span> during the <span class="underline">colonial</span> period of the United States. <span class="time" data-times="3" data-time="14.31">[00:14.31]</span>Has our discussion clarified things for you?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.38" data-time="17.31">[00:17.31]</span>Student: Well, yeah, but now, I think writing about <span class="underline">trade</span> for my paper isn't going to work.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.66" data-time="23.69">[00:23.69]</span>Professor: Oh, so your questions about shipping routes were for your research paper?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.9" data-time="28.35">[00:28.35]</span>Student: Yeah. But now, I see that I probably need to come up with a new paper topic. <span class="time" data-times="3.64" data-time="33.25">[00:33.25]</span>Actually, there was one other idea I had. <span class="time" data-times="6.49" data-time="36.89">[00:36.89]</span>I have been thinking about doing something about <span class="underline">community</span> planning in the early British settlements in Eastern North America.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.02" data-time="43.38">[00:43.38]</span>Professor: Oh. OK. I am <span class="underline">curious</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.19" data-time="46.4">[00:46.40]</span>Why are you interested in doing something on <span class="underline">community</span> planning in <span class="underline">colonial</span> times?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.55" data-time="51.59">[00:51.59]</span>Student: Well, I am much more into <span class="underline">architecture</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.83" data-time="54.14">[00:54.14]</span>It's my <span class="underline">major</span> and I mean, planning out a town or city goes <span class="underline">along</span> with that. <span class="time" data-times="9.3" data-time="58.97">[00:58.97]</span>I mean, not that I don't like <span class="underline">history</span>...I am interested in <span class="underline">history</span>...really interested...But I think, you know, for a <span class="underline">career</span>, <span class="underline">architecture</span> is more for me.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.3" data-time="68.27">[01:08.27]</span>Professor: That's great.<span class="time" data-times="5.23" data-time="69.57">[01:09.57]</span> I've gotten some very thought-provoking papers from students whose interests go beyond <span class="underline">history</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.72" data-time="74.8">[01:14.80]</span>Student: OK. But for the paper you <span class="underline">wanted</span> us to try to include a <span class="underline">comparison</span>, right?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.37" data-time="80.52">[01:20.52]</span>Professor: Yes. Actually, that was really the purpose of the <span class="underline">assignment</span>. <span class="time" data-times="13.74" data-time="83.89">[01:23.89]</span>The way the United States developed or perhaps I should say the colonies, since the land that would become the Eastern United States...uh...there were British colonies there four hundred years ago. <span class="time" data-times="5.13" data-time="97.63">[01:37.63]</span>But anyway...uh... <span class="underline">development</span> in the colonies differed greatly depending on geography. <span class="time" data-times="9.77" data-time="102.76">[01:42.76]</span>I am looking for papers that have ideas about how something that happened one way in the Northern colonies happened a different way in the Southern colonies.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.67" data-time="112.53">[01:52.53]</span>Student: Is that true in terms of <span class="underline">urban</span> planning?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.91" data-time="115.2">[01:55.20]</span>Professor: Very true. Towns in the Northern colonies were <span class="underline">centralized</span> and <span class="underline">compact</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.6" data-time="121.11">[02:01.11]</span>They provided a meeting point for exchanging goods, for participatory <span class="underline">government</span>, and for practicing <span class="underline">religion</span>.<span class="time" data-times="4.05" data-time="128.71">[02:08.71]</span>Houses would be built <span class="underline">along</span> the roads that led into town.<span class="time" data-times="9.72" data-time="132.76">[02:12.76]</span>And just outside the developed area, there would usually be an open area of some <span class="underline">sort</span> for <span class="underline">grazing</span> animals and also group activities. <span class="time" data-times="9.27" data-time="142.48">[02:22.48]</span>Actually, the model for planning a town in the Northern colonies was not unlike the model for the <span class="underline">development</span> of towns in <span class="underline">medieval</span> Europe.<span class="time" data-times="6.64" data-time="151.75">[02:31.75]</span>After all, the colonists had just come from Europe and the <span class="underline">medieval</span> period was just ended.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.41" data-time="158.39">[02:38.39]</span>Student: <span class="underline">Medieval</span> Europe. But what about the South? <span class="time" data-times="7.36" data-time="162.8">[02:42.80]</span>If I remember correctly... In the South, at <span class="underline">least</span> <span class="underline">initially</span>, they didn't build towns so much as they built trading posts.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.9" data-time="170.16">[02:50.16]</span>Professor: That's right. Most of the settlers in the North <span class="underline">wanted</span> to start a whole new life.<span class="time" data-times="6.68" data-time="175.06">[02:55.06]</span>But most of the people who came from Europe to the South just <span class="underline">wanted</span> to make some money and then go back. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="181.74">[03:01.74]</span>It is not surprising that some of most <span class="underline">common</span> buildings were <span class="underline">storage</span> facilities and port facilities.</p>
