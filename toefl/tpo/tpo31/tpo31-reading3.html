One <span class="highlight">theory</span> behind savanna <span class="highlight">formation</span> is that wet forest <span class="highlight">species</span> are unable to <span class="highlight">withstand</span> the dry <span class="highlight">season</span>, and thus savanna, rather than rain forest, is <span class="highlight">favored</span> on the site. Savannas experience an <span class="highlight">annual</span><span class="highlight">rainfall</span> of between 1,000 and 2,000 millimeters, most of it falling in a five- to eight-month wet <span class="highlight">season</span>. Though plenty of rain may fall on a savanna during the year, for at <span class="highlight">least</span> part of the year little does, creating the <span class="highlight">drought</span><span class="highlight">stress</span><span class="highlight">ultimately</span> favoring grasses. Such conditions <span class="highlight">prevail</span><span class="highlight">throughout</span> much of northern South America and Cuba, <span class="question2">but many Central American savannas as well as coastal areas of Brazil and the island of Trinidad do not fit this <span class="highlight">pattern</span>.</span> In these areas, <span class="highlight">rainfall</span> per month exceeds that in the above <span class="highlight">definition</span>, so other factors must <span class="highlight">contribute</span> to savanna <span class="highlight">formation</span>.</p><p>In many characteristics, savanna soils are <span class="highlight">similar</span> to those of some rain forests, though more <span class="highlight">extreme</span>. For example, savanna soils, like many rain forest soils, are typically oxisols (dominated by certain <span class="highlight">oxide</span> minerals) and ultisols (soils containing no <span class="highlight">calcium</span><span class="highlight">carbonate</span>), with a high <span class="highlight">acidity</span> and <span class="highlight"><span class="question4">notably</span></span> low concentrations of such minerals as <span class="highlight">phosphorus</span>, <span class="highlight">calcium</span>, <span class="highlight">magnesium</span>, and <span class="highlight">potassium</span>, while <span class="highlight">aluminum</span> levels are high. Some savannas <span class="highlight">occur</span> on wet, waterlogged soils; others on dry, sandy, well-drained soils. This may <span class="highlight">seem</span><span class="highlight">contradictory</span>, but it only means that <span class="highlight">extreme</span> soil conditions, either too wet or too dry for forests, are satisfactory for savannas. More <span class="highlight">moderate</span> conditions support <span class="highlight">moist</span> forests.</p><p>Waterlogged soils <span class="highlight">occur</span> in areas that are <span class="highlight">flat</span> or have poor <span class="highlight">drainage</span>. These soils usually <span class="highlight">contain</span> large amounts of <span class="highlight">clay</span> and easily become water saturated. <span class="highlight">Air</span> cannot <span class="highlight">penetrate</span> between the soil particles, making the soil oxygen-poor. By <span class="highlight">contrast</span>, dry soils are sandy and <span class="highlight">porous</span>, their <span class="highlight">coarse</span> textures permitting water to <span class="highlight">drain</span> rapidly. Sandy soils are <span class="highlight">prone</span> to the leaching of nutrients and minerals and so <span class="highlight">tend</span> to be nutritionally poor. Though most savannas are found on sites with poor soils (because of either <span class="highlight">moisture</span> conditions or <span class="highlight">nutrient</span> levels of both), <span class="question7">poor soils can and do support <span class="highlight">lush</span> rain forest</span></p><p>Most savannas probably experience <span class="highlight">mild</span> fires frequently and <span class="highlight">major</span> burns every two years or so. Many savanna and dry-forest plant <span class="highlight">species</span> are called pyrophytes, meaning they are adapted in various ways to <span class="highlight">withstand</span><span class="highlight">occasional</span> burning. <span class="question8">Frequent fire is a <span class="highlight">factor</span> to which rain forest <span class="highlight">species</span><span class="highlight">seem</span> unable to <span class="highlight">adapt</span>, although <span class="highlight">ancient</span><span class="highlight">charcoal</span> remains from Amazon forest soils dating <span class="highlight">prior</span> to the arrival of humans suggest that <span class="highlight">moist</span> forests also occasionally burn.</span> Experiments suggest that if fire did not <span class="highlight">occur</span> in savannas in the Americas, <span class="highlight">species</span><span class="highlight">composition</span> would change <span class="highlight">significantly</span>. When burning occurs, it prevents competition among plant <span class="highlight">species</span> from progressing to the point where some <span class="highlight">species</span><span class="highlight">exclude</span> others, reducing the <span class="highlight">overall</span><span class="highlight">diversity</span> of the <span class="highlight">ecosystem</span>. But in <span class="highlight">experimental</span> areas protected from fire, a few <span class="highlight">perennial</span> grass <span class="highlight">species</span><span class="highlight">eventually</span> come to <span class="highlight">dominate</span>, outcompeting all others. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span><span class="highlight">Evidence</span> from other studies suggests that exclusion of fire results in <span class="highlight"><span class="question9">markedly</span></span> decreased plant-species richness, often with an increase in tree <span class="highlight">density</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>There is generally little <span class="highlight">doubt</span> that fire is a <span class="highlight">significant</span><span class="highlight">factor</span> in maintaining savanna, certainly in most regions.</p><p><span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>On certain sites, particularly in South America, savanna <span class="highlight">formation</span> seems related to frequent cutting and burning of <span class="highlight">moist</span> forests for pastureland. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>Increase in pastureland and <span class="highlight"><span class="question11">subsequent</span></span> overgrazing have resulted in an <span class="highlight">expansion</span> of savanna. The thin upper <span class="highlight">layer</span> of <span class="highlight">humus</span> (<span class="highlight">decayed</span><span class="highlight">organic</span> matter) is destroyed by cutting and burning. <span class="highlight">Humus</span> is necessary for rapid <span class="highlight">decomposition</span> of leaves by <span class="highlight">bacteria</span> and <span class="highlight">fungi</span> and for recycling by surface roots. Once the <span class="highlight">humus</span><span class="highlight">layer</span> disappears, nutrients cannot be recycled and <span class="highlight">leach</span> from the soil, converting soil from <span class="highlight">fertile</span> to infertile and making it <span class="highlight">suitable</span> only for savanna <span class="highlight">vegetation</span>. Forests on white, sandy soil are most <span class="highlight">susceptible</span> to <span class="highlight">permanent</span><span class="highlight">alteration</span>.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">prolonged</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. predictable</p><p>B. destructive</p><p>C. lengthy</p><p>D. unproductive</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Prolonged: Prolonged, protracted. Corresponding to the C option lengthy (long, long)</p><p>Corresponding to the original: Savannas typical experience a rather prolonged dry season.</p><p>According to the root analysis, prolonged in the original, the root is long, length. Prolonged for prolonged. In the options, C and length are originally the meaning of length, and lengthy becomes the adjective format, which accords with the meaning of the original word. It can also be guessed from the context of the next sentence, which emphasizes the fact that species in humid forests cannot tolerate the drought season, so savannah is more advantageous in this place. Substituting the four options, the predictable (predictable) option of A, the destructive (destructive) of B, and the unproductive (D) option are not appropriate, and the characteristics of these droughts are not reflected below.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>In paragraph 2, the author mentions savannas in Central America, Brazil, and the island of Trinidad in order to:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. argue that these savannas are similar to those in South America and Cuba</p><p>B. point out exceptions to the pattern of savanna formation in areas with drought stress</p><p>C. provide additional examples of savannas in areas with five-to-eight-month wet seasons</p><p>D. indicate areas where savannas are being gradually replaced by rain forests</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The savannas in Central America, Brazil, and the island of Trinidad are used as keywords to locate the penultimate sentence. See the transition between but and the first half of the sentence, that is to say the central amercia, brazil these places and the previous introduction It's not the same, so it's the exception. It is also possible to look back, and further summarize the characteristics of these places, saying that the monthly rainfall in these places exceeds what was said before. Correspond to B option.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 3, rain forests and savannas differ in that:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. the soils in rain forests contain fewer minerals than savanna soils do</p><p>B. savannas affect soil conditions more than rain forests do</p><p>C. unlike rain forests, savannas prefer sandy, well-drained soils to solids that are very wet</p><p>D. unlike rain forests, savannas may develop under both very dry and very wet soil conditions</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The first sentence of this paragraph points out that the soil of rain forest and savannas is similar, but more extreme. We will give examples later. The last sentence gives a summary of the two soils "this may seem.. Either too wet or too dry for forests"</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question4">notably</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. similarly</p><p>B. especially</p><p>C. usually</p><p>D. relatively</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>Notably: Notably, especially. Should be especially (especially, especially) within the B option.</p><p>Corresponding author: For example, savanna soils, like many rain forest soils, are typically oxisols (dominated by certain oxide minerals) and ultisols (soils containing no calcium carbonate), with a high acidity and <span class="question4">notably</span> low concentrations of such minerals as phosphorus, calcium , magnesium, and potassium, while aluminum levels are high. From the structure of the word itself, the <span class="question4">notably</span> root is note (note, record), plus the suffix of can (like...), ly adverbial , you can guess what it means. So choose B. It can also be inferred by the parallel format of and . High acidity and <span class="question4">notably</span> low concentrations. Among the four options, the A option is similarly similar, the C option is usually (usually), and the D option is relatively appropriate.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 3, all of the following are true of savanna soils EXCEPT</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They have high concentrations of potassium.</p><p>B. They contain high levels of aluminum.</p><p>C. They are very acidic.</p><p>D. They contain large amounts of certain oxide minerals.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>This question corresponds to the content behind for example, A contradiction, and therefore is the option to be selected.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, which of the following is true of waterlogged soils?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Their upper layers are usually sandy and porous.</p><p>B. They cannot support savannas.</p><p>C. They contain little oxygen.</p><p>D. They are prone to the leaching of nutrients and minerals.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Using waterlogged soil to locate, found that the first three sentences of this paragraph describe the characteristics of this type of soil: Waterlogged soils occur in areas that are flat or have poor drainage. These soils usually contain large amounts of clay and easily become water saturated. The oxygen-poor in the third sentence corresponds to the little oxygen of the C option. The air cannot penetrate between the soil particles, making the soil oxygen-poor. So C is the correct option. A. The phrase "by contrast..." describes the characteristics of sandy soil and is not characteristic of waterlogged soils. B contradicts the original. In the last paragraph, it was said that it was either very dry or wet, and the waterlogged type was very wet. D corresponds to "Sandy soils are prone to ....." and describes the characteristics of sandy soil, so it is wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The fact that "<span class="highlight">poor soils can and do support lush rain forest</span>" suggests that:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. poor soils alone may not be enough to explain why an area becomes a savanna</p><p>B. rain forest vegetation can significantly lower the quality of soils</p><p>C. drought stress is the single most important factor in savanna formation</p><p>D. minerals are more important than moisture for the growth of trees</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="poor soils can and do support lush rain forest A"><p>This saying says that although almost all of the savannas happen on poor soils, poor soils are enough to support a lush tropical rainforest. This is a turning point, indicating that poor soils are not the only factors that determine savannas. There are others.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentence below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Rain forest species seem unable to adapt to fires created by humans.</p><p>B. Ancient charcoal remains suggest that, prior to the arrival of humans, fires occurred frequently in rain forests.</p><p>C. Ancient charcoal remains in Amazon forests suggest that rain forest species adapted to the area long before the arrival of humans.</p><p>D. Rain forest species appear unable to adapt to frequent fires, but evidence from the past suggests that rain forests sometimes do burn.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The backbone of the original sentence is that frequent fire is the cause of the failure to form tropical rain forests. Occasionally, even before the advent of humans, the Amazon rainforest had occasional burning. The main logic of this sentence is the turning point. Therefore, D is the most complete meaning, and the logical logic of the transition guided by but also corresponds to the original sentence. The A option lacks the content after the transition, and the second sentence of the B option contradicts the original. The C option semantics is completely incorrect.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question9">markedly</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. dangerously</p><p>B. noticeably</p><p>C. rapidly</p><p>D. gradually</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>Markedly: obviously, significantly. The corresponding B option is noticeably (significantly, obviously).</p><p>Corresponding to the original: Evidence from other studies suggest that exclusion of fire results in <span class="question9">markedly</span> decreased plant-species richness, often with an increase in tree density. According to the root judgment, the root of the original word is mark, which is similar to the notice of B in the option. , so choose B. It is also possible to use the causal logic of the original sentence to speculate. The reason for this is the exclusion of fire, and the result is <span class="question9">markedly</span> decreased decline plant-species richness. Substitute four options to see which option is substituted for causality. The A option's dangerously dangerous, C option's rapidly (rapidly) and D options's gradually (gradually) are not suitable.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Paragraph 5 supports which of the following statements regarding the importance of fires in maintaining savannas?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Fires prevent the growth of pyrophytes.</p><p>B. Fires eliminate some species and thus reduce the overall diversity of the ecosystem.</p><p>C. Fires that occur once every two years are unlikely to help maintain savannas.</p><p>D. Fires prevent some species from eliminating other species with which they compete.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>With the importance of fire to locate, the corresponding parts start from but in experimental areas as protected from fire, and the following contents explain their significance: But in experimental areas protected from fire, a few perennial grass species eventually come to dominate, Outcompeting all others. Evidence from other studies suggest that exclusion of fire results in <span class="question9">markedly</span> decreased plant-species richness, often with an increase in tree density. As you can see from these two sentences, if there is no fire to keep savannas, then there are few There are perennial grass species that can outcompeting other species, thereby reducing the abundance of plant-species, and the density of the trees will be greater. Corresponds to the description of D. The ABC options are not mentioned in the original.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question11">subsequent</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. expanded in area</p><p>B. harmful</p><p>C. following in time</p><p>D. repeated</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" C"><p>The subsequence is the meaning of the consequence, <span class="question11">subsequent</span> is the meaning of the later, and then. So choose C.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 6, human activity affects soils in all of the following ways EXCEPT</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Decomposition of leaves occurs too fast for surface roots to obtain nutrients.</p><p>B. Nutrients are not recycled.</p><p>C. Humus is destroyed.</p><p>D. certain soils become unable to support vegetation other than savanna vegetation</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The human activity includes cutting and burning, and then the sentence begins with "increase...." as a consequence. First say that humus is destroyed, corresponding to C, then humus is very necessary for the decomposition, and human activity destroy humus, so slow down the decomposition, and A contradiction. Said later the nuttrients cannot be recycled, corresponding to B. The expression that corresponds to D.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>In addition, humans have contributed to the conditions favoring the formation of savannas..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The sentence to be inserted describes the cause of formation of savannas, and the beginning is in addition. The proof is a supplement to the preceding sentence. The preceding sentence should be one of the reasons for the formation of savannas, corresponding to the second sentence. And the sentence after the third empty mentions cutting and burning, these are human activity. So choose C.</p></div></div><div id="question14" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>Prose Summary. Several factors seem to play important roles in savanna formation.Answer Choices.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.Savannas can form in areas with a five to eight month wet season, but they more commonly have a longer wet season.</p><p>B.Soil stress caused by drought, extreme moisture, or low nutrient levels favors the formation of savannas.</p><p>C.Studies conducted in various regions indicate that an upper layer of white, sandy, soil is present in most permanent savannas.</p><p>D.Drought stress affects trees and shrubs in savannas far less than it affects savanna grasses.</p><p>E.Frequent fire is a major factor contributing to the formation and maintenance of savannas.</p><p>F.In some areas, human cutting and burning is associated with savanna formation, and increase in pastureland had led to savanna expansion.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="BEF"><p>A mistake, corresponding to the first sentence of the second paragraph of the original text, savannas has a prolong dry season. B corresponds to the second paragraph of the original text. The original text of C did not say that, but said that sandy is a soil of savannas. D, Savannas itself is less on the tree and shrubs, the original did not make such a comparison of drought pressure. E corresponds to the original paragraph to the second paragraph. F corresponds to the first paragraph of the original countdown.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
