            <b>Savanna Formation</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>Savannas typically experience a rather <span class="light"><span class="underline">prolonged</span></span> dry <span class="underline">season</span>. One <span class="underline">theory</span> behind savanna <span class="underline">formation</span> is that wet forest <span class="underline">species</span> are unable to <span class="underline">withstand</span> the dry <span class="underline">season</span>, and thus savanna, rather than rain forest, is <span class="underline">favored</span> on the site. Savannas experience an <span class="underline">annual</span> <span class="underline">rainfall</span> of between 1,000 and 2,000 millimeters, most of it falling in a five- to eight-month wet <span class="underline">season</span>. Though plenty of rain may fall on a savanna during the year, for at <span class="underline">least</span> part of the year little does, creating the <span class="underline">drought</span> <span class="underline">stress</span> <span class="underline">ultimately</span> favoring grasses. Such conditions <span class="underline">prevail</span> <span class="underline">throughout</span> much of northern South America and Cuba, but many Central American savannas as well as coastal areas of Brazil and the island of Trinidad do not fit this <span class="underline">pattern</span>. In these areas, <span class="underline">rainfall</span> per month exceeds that in the above <span class="underline">definition</span>, so other factors must <span class="underline">contribute</span> to savanna <span class="underline">formation</span>.</p>
          <p>In many characteristics, savanna soils are <span class="underline">similar</span> to those of some rain forests, though more <span class="underline">extreme</span>. For example, savanna soils, like many rain forest soils, are typically oxisols (dominated by certain <span class="underline">oxide</span> minerals) and ultisols (soils containing no <span class="underline">calcium</span> <span class="underline">carbonate</span>), with a high <span class="underline">acidity</span> and <span class="underline">notably</span> low concentrations of such minerals as <span class="underline">phosphorus</span>, <span class="underline">calcium</span>, <span class="underline">magnesium</span>, and <span class="underline">potassium</span>, while <span class="underline">aluminum</span> levels are high. Some savannas <span class="underline">occur</span> on wet, waterlogged soils; others on dry, sandy, well-drained soils. This may <span class="underline">seem</span> <span class="underline">contradictory</span>, but it only means that <span class="underline">extreme</span> soil conditions, either too wet or too dry for forests, are satisfactory for savannas. More <span class="underline">moderate</span> conditions support <span class="underline">moist</span> forests.</p>
          <p>Waterlogged soils <span class="underline">occur</span> in areas that are <span class="underline">flat</span> or have poor <span class="underline">drainage</span>. These soils usually <span class="underline">contain</span> large amounts of <span class="underline">clay</span> and easily become water saturated. <span class="underline">Air</span> cannot <span class="underline">penetrate</span> between the soil particles, making the soil oxygen-poor. By <span class="underline">contrast</span>, dry soils are sandy and <span class="underline">porous</span>, their <span class="underline">coarse</span> textures permitting water to <span class="underline">drain</span> rapidly. Sandy soils are <span class="underline">prone</span> to the leaching of nutrients and minerals and so <span class="underline">tend</span> to be nutritionally poor. Though most savannas are found on sites with poor soils (because of either <span class="underline">moisture</span> conditions or <span class="underline">nutrient</span> levels of both), poor soils can and do support <span class="underline">lush</span> rain forest</p>
          <p>Most savannas probably experience <span class="underline">mild</span> fires frequently and <span class="underline">major</span> burns every two years or so. Many savanna and dry-forest plant <span class="underline">species</span> are called pyrophytes, meaning they are adapted in various ways to <span class="underline">withstand</span> <span class="underline">occasional</span> burning. Frequent fire is a <span class="underline">factor</span> to which rain forest <span class="underline">species</span> <span class="underline">seem</span> unable to <span class="underline">adapt</span>, although <span class="underline">ancient</span> <span class="underline">charcoal</span> remains from Amazon forest soils dating <span class="underline">prior</span> to the arrival of humans suggest that <span class="underline">moist</span> forests also occasionally burn. Experiments suggest that if fire did not <span class="underline">occur</span> in savannas in the Americas, <span class="underline">species</span> <span class="underline">composition</span> would change <span class="underline">significantly</span>. When burning occurs, it prevents competition among plant <span class="underline">species</span> from progressing to the point where some <span class="underline">species</span> <span class="underline">exclude</span> others, reducing the <span class="underline">overall</span> <span class="underline">diversity</span> of the <span class="underline">ecosystem</span>. But in <span class="underline">experimental</span> areas protected from fire, a few <span class="underline">perennial</span> grass <span class="underline">species</span> <span class="underline">eventually</span> come to <span class="underline">dominate</span>, outcompeting all others. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> <span class="underline">Evidence</span> from other studies suggests that exclusion of fire results in <span class="underline">markedly</span> decreased plant-species richness, often with an increase in tree <span class="underline">density</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>There is generally little <span class="underline">doubt</span> that fire is a <span class="underline">significant</span> <span class="underline">factor</span> in maintaining savanna, certainly in most regions.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C">
            </span>On certain sites, particularly in South America, savanna <span class="underline">formation</span> seems related to frequent cutting and burning of <span class="underline">moist</span> forests for pastureland. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>Increase in pastureland and <span class="underline">subsequent</span> overgrazing have resulted in an <span class="underline">expansion</span> of savanna. The thin upper <span class="underline">layer</span> of <span class="underline">humus</span> (<span class="underline">decayed</span> <span class="underline">organic</span> matter) is destroyed by cutting and burning. <span class="underline">Humus</span> is necessary for rapid <span class="underline">decomposition</span> of leaves by <span class="underline">bacteria</span> and <span class="underline">fungi</span> and for recycling by surface roots. Once the <span class="underline">humus</span> <span class="underline">layer</span> disappears, nutrients cannot be recycled and <span class="underline">leach</span> from the soil, converting soil from <span class="underline">fertile</span> to infertile and making it <span class="underline">suitable</span> only for savanna <span class="underline">vegetation</span>. Forests on white, sandy soil are most <span class="underline">susceptible</span> to <span class="underline">permanent</span> <span class="underline">alteration</span>.</p>
