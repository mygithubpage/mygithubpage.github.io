part of a lecture in a <span class="highlight">Marine</span><span class="highlight">Biology</span> class.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="13.17" data-time="5.14">[00:05.14]</span>Professor: We've been talking about the <span class="highlight">decline</span> of <span class="highlight">coral</span> reefs in <span class="highlight">tropical</span> areas all over the world...um... how natural and man-made stresses are causing them to <span class="highlight">degrade</span>, and in some cases, to die.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="11.83" data-time="18.31">[00:18.31]</span>So now let's <span class="highlight">focus</span> on a <span class="highlight">specific</span> example of a natural <span class="highlight">predator</span> that can cause a lot of damage to <span class="highlight">coral</span> reefs-the Crown of Thorns, or CoT starfish. <span class="time" data-times="8.31" data-time="30.14">[00:30.14]</span>The Cot starfish is found on <span class="highlight">coral</span> reefs in the <span class="highlight">tropical</span><span class="highlight">Pacific</span> Ocean and it eats <span class="highlight">coral</span>.<span class="time" data-times="4.69" data-time="38.45">[00:38.45]</span>Now, in small numbers, the starfish don't <span class="highlight">affect</span><span class="highlight">coral</span> reefs <span class="highlight">dramatically</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.83" data-time="43.14">[00:43.14]</span>But <span class="highlight">periodically</span>, starfish <span class="highlight">population</span> explodes.<span class="time" data-times="7.47" data-time="46.97">[00:46.97]</span> And when that happens, the reefs can become badly damaged or <span class="highlight">even</span> destroyed, something we are trying very hard to prevent. <span class="time" data-times="8.72" data-time="54.44">[00:54.44]</span>For example, during the 1960s, there was an <span class="highlight">outbreak</span> of CoT starfish in the Great <span class="highlight">Barrier</span><span class="highlight">Reef</span>, off the east <span class="highlight">coast</span> of Australia. <span class="time" data-times="6.16" data-time="63.16">[01:03.16]</span>Luckily, the CoT starfish <span class="highlight">population</span><span class="highlight">gradually</span> declined on its own and the reefs recovered.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.98" data-time="69.32">[01:09.32]</span>But we were left wondering – what cause the <span class="highlight">population</span> to increase so suddenly? <span class="time" data-times="4.08" data-time="74.3">[01:14.30]</span>Well, over the years, we've come up with a few hypotheses. <span class="time" data-times="2.16" data-time="78.38">[01:18.38]</span>All still hotly debated.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="10.06" data-time="80.54">[01:20.54]</span>One <span class="highlight">hypothesis</span> is that it's a natural <span class="highlight">phenomenon</span>, that the starfish naturally <span class="highlight">undergo</span><span class="highlight">population</span> fluctuations following particularly good spawning years.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.47" data-time="90.6">[01:30.60]</span>There are also several hypotheses that suggest some <span class="highlight">sort</span> of human activities are <span class="highlight">partly</span><span class="highlight">responsible</span>, like fishing. <span class="time" data-times="8.66" data-time="98.07">[01:38.07]</span>There are fish and snails that eat starfish, particularly the <span class="highlight">giant</span> triton snail, which is the main <span class="highlight">predator</span> of the starfish. <span class="time" data-times="7.02" data-time="106.73">[01:46.73]</span>These fish and snails have themselves experienced a <span class="highlight">decline</span> in <span class="highlight">population</span> because of overfishing by humans. <span class="time" data-times="5.21" data-time="113.75">[01:53.75]</span>So with a <span class="highlight">decline</span> in starfish predators, the starfish <span class="highlight">population</span> can increase.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.15" data-time="118.96">[01:58.96]</span>Another hypothesized human-related cause is <span class="highlight">fertilizer</span><span class="highlight">runoff</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.82" data-time="124.11">[02:04.11]</span>People use <span class="highlight">fertilizer</span> for their crops and plants and a lot of it <span class="highlight">eventually</span> makes its way from land into the seas. <span class="time" data-times="2.88" data-time="130.93">[02:10.93]</span>It's <span class="highlight">fertilizer</span>, so it has a lot of nutrients.<span class="time" data-times="6.61" data-time="133.81">[02:13.81]</span> These nutrients have an effect on the starfish, because they cause an increase in the growth of <span class="highlight">phytoplankton</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.28" data-time="140.42">[02:20.42]</span><span class="highlight">Phytoplankton</span> are <span class="highlight">microscopic</span> plants that grow in the ocean. <span class="time" data-times="12.18" data-time="144.7">[02:24.70]</span>Larval CoT starfish eat <span class="highlight">phytoplankton</span> in their first month of life, so more <span class="highlight">fertilizer</span> in the ocean means more <span class="highlight">phytoplankton</span>, which means more starfish, bad for the reefs.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.67" data-time="156.88">[02:36.88]</span>Now, the final <span class="highlight">hypothesis</span> has to do with storm events. <span class="time" data-times="8.61" data-time="162.55">[02:42.55]</span>If some reefs are destroyed by storms, starfish populations that inhabited those reefs would have to <span class="highlight">condense</span> and <span class="highlight">concentrate</span> on the reefs that are left. <span class="time" data-times="3.48" data-time="171.16">[02:51.16]</span>So this can cause a kind of <span class="highlight">mass</span> feeding <span class="highlight">frenzy</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.62" data-time="174.64">[02:54.64]</span>So we have ideas, but no real answer.<span class="time" data-times="6.08" data-time="178.26">[02:58.26]</span> And because we aren't sure of the causes for starfish <span class="highlight">population</span> increases, it's difficult to prevent them. <span class="time" data-times="2.52" data-time="184.34">[03:04.34]</span>I mean, some progress has been made. <span class="time" data-times="8.72" data-time="186.86">[03:06.86]</span>For example, new <span class="highlight">survey</span> techniques have enabled us to <span class="highlight">detect</span><span class="highlight">population</span> increases when the starfish are quite young, so we can be ready for them.<span class="time" data-times="4.58" data-time="195.58">[03:15.58]</span>But <span class="highlight">meaningful</span> progress requires much better <span class="highlight">evidence</span> about the cause.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="9.63" data-time="200.16">[03:20.16]</span>On the bright side, in all the research being done on causes, we have discovered something related to how starfish populations might <span class="highlight">affect</span><span class="highlight">coral</span><span class="highlight">reef</span><span class="highlight">diversity</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.15" data-time="209.79">[03:29.79]</span>We think that when reefs are damaged, after a few years, the fastest-growing corals <span class="highlight">repopulate</span> the areas. <span class="time" data-times="8.09" data-time="215.94">[03:35.94]</span>And these fast-growing <span class="highlight">species</span> can grow over the slower-growing <span class="highlight">species</span> of <span class="highlight">coral</span>, denying them light and preventing them from recovery.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.38" data-time="224.03">[03:44.03]</span>However, the faster-growing <span class="highlight">species</span> are the preferred food of the CoT starfish. <span class="time" data-times="8.17" data-time="229.41">[03:49.41]</span>So when an <span class="highlight">outbreak</span> of CoT starfish occurs, they thin out the fast-growing <span class="highlight">coral</span> and may give the slower ones a <span class="highlight">chance</span> to reestablish. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="237.58">[03:57.58]</span>So without the <span class="highlight">outbreak</span>, the <span class="highlight">diversity</span> of <span class="highlight">coral</span> would be reduced. </p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the lecture mainly about?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

It competes with CoT starfish for food</p><p>B. Its shells provides habitat for CoT starfish</p><p>C. It is a predator of CoT starfish</p><p>D. It can repair coral that has been damaged by CoT starfish</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>There are fish and snails that eat starfish, particularly the giant triton snail, which is the main predator of the starfish The triton snail directly mentioned in the speech is the starfish's main predator.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>How might fertilizer runoff effect CoT starfish population?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

It might make phytoplankton dangerous for CoT starfish to eat</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The Larval CoT starfish eat phytoplankton in their first month of life, so more fertilizer in the ocean means more phytoplankton, which means more starfish, bad for the reefs. It has been speculated that because of the large amount of fertilizer flowing into the ocean, the rich nutrient elements of the fertilizer make Plankton increased, and starfish that feed on plankton increased.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor, how might storms affect CoT starfish?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Storms might interfere with CoT starfish' spawning cycle</p><p>B. Storms might reduce the amount of plankton eaten by CoT starfish</p><p>C. Storms might carry starfish predators close to reef system</p><p>D. Storms might reduce the number of feeding areas available to CoT starfish</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The article said that if a storm hits and some of the reefs are destroyed, starfish will focus on those surviving reefs. Will cause mass feeding frenzy.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor say about controlling the CoT starfish population?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

To indicate that the behavior of CoT starfish has changed over time</p><p>D. To emphasize the danger posed by CoT starfish to coral reefs</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>So when an outbreak of CoT starfish occurs, they thin out the fast-growing coral and may give the slower ones a chance to reestablish. The end of the speech emphasizes that starfish also brings benefits. They will eat a part of the fast-growing coral and give it a slow speed. Increase the chance of coral survival.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
