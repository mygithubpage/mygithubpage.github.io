            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.14" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in a <span class="underline">Marine</span> <span class="underline">Biology</span> class.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="13.17" data-time="5.14">[00:05.14]</span>Professor: We've been talking about the <span class="underline">decline</span> of <span class="underline">coral</span> reefs in <span class="underline">tropical</span> areas all over the world...um... how natural and man-made stresses are causing them to <span class="underline">degrade</span>, and in some cases, to die.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="11.83" data-time="18.31">[00:18.31]</span>So now let's <span class="underline">focus</span> on a <span class="underline">specific</span> example of a natural <span class="underline">predator</span> that can cause a lot of damage to <span class="underline">coral</span> reefs-the Crown of Thorns, or CoT starfish. <span class="time" data-times="8.31" data-time="30.14">[00:30.14]</span>The Cot starfish is found on <span class="underline">coral</span> reefs in the <span class="underline">tropical</span> <span class="underline">Pacific</span> Ocean and it eats <span class="underline">coral</span>.<span class="time" data-times="4.69" data-time="38.45">[00:38.45]</span>Now, in small numbers, the starfish don't <span class="underline">affect</span> <span class="underline">coral</span> reefs <span class="underline">dramatically</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.83" data-time="43.14">[00:43.14]</span>But <span class="underline">periodically</span>, starfish <span class="underline">population</span> explodes.<span class="time" data-times="7.47" data-time="46.97">[00:46.97]</span> And when that happens, the reefs can become badly damaged or <span class="underline">even</span> destroyed, something we are trying very hard to prevent. <span class="time" data-times="8.72" data-time="54.44">[00:54.44]</span>For example, during the 1960s, there was an <span class="underline">outbreak</span> of CoT starfish in the Great <span class="underline">Barrier</span> <span class="underline">Reef</span>, off the east <span class="underline">coast</span> of Australia. <span class="time" data-times="6.16" data-time="63.16">[01:03.16]</span>Luckily, the CoT starfish <span class="underline">population</span> <span class="underline">gradually</span> declined on its own and the reefs recovered.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.98" data-time="69.32">[01:09.32]</span>But we were left wondering – what cause the <span class="underline">population</span> to increase so suddenly? <span class="time" data-times="4.08" data-time="74.3">[01:14.30]</span>Well, over the years, we've come up with a few hypotheses. <span class="time" data-times="2.16" data-time="78.38">[01:18.38]</span>All still hotly debated.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.06" data-time="80.54">[01:20.54]</span>One <span class="underline">hypothesis</span> is that it's a natural <span class="underline">phenomenon</span>, that the starfish naturally <span class="underline">undergo</span> <span class="underline">population</span> fluctuations following particularly good spawning years.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.47" data-time="90.6">[01:30.60]</span>There are also several hypotheses that suggest some <span class="underline">sort</span> of human activities are <span class="underline">partly</span> <span class="underline">responsible</span>, like fishing. <span class="time" data-times="8.66" data-time="98.07">[01:38.07]</span>There are fish and snails that eat starfish, particularly the <span class="underline">giant</span> triton snail, which is the main <span class="underline">predator</span> of the starfish. <span class="time" data-times="7.02" data-time="106.73">[01:46.73]</span>These fish and snails have themselves experienced a <span class="underline">decline</span> in <span class="underline">population</span> because of overfishing by humans. <span class="time" data-times="5.21" data-time="113.75">[01:53.75]</span>So with a <span class="underline">decline</span> in starfish predators, the starfish <span class="underline">population</span> can increase.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.15" data-time="118.96">[01:58.96]</span>Another hypothesized human-related cause is <span class="underline">fertilizer</span> <span class="underline">runoff</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.82" data-time="124.11">[02:04.11]</span>People use <span class="underline">fertilizer</span> for their crops and plants and a lot of it <span class="underline">eventually</span> makes its way from land into the seas. <span class="time" data-times="2.88" data-time="130.93">[02:10.93]</span>It's <span class="underline">fertilizer</span>, so it has a lot of nutrients.<span class="time" data-times="6.61" data-time="133.81">[02:13.81]</span> These nutrients have an effect on the starfish, because they cause an increase in the growth of <span class="underline">phytoplankton</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.28" data-time="140.42">[02:20.42]</span> <span class="underline">Phytoplankton</span> are <span class="underline">microscopic</span> plants that grow in the ocean. <span class="time" data-times="12.18" data-time="144.7">[02:24.70]</span>Larval CoT starfish eat <span class="underline">phytoplankton</span> in their first month of life, so more <span class="underline">fertilizer</span> in the ocean means more <span class="underline">phytoplankton</span>, which means more starfish, bad for the reefs.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.67" data-time="156.88">[02:36.88]</span>Now, the final <span class="underline">hypothesis</span> has to do with storm events. <span class="time" data-times="8.61" data-time="162.55">[02:42.55]</span>If some reefs are destroyed by storms, starfish populations that inhabited those reefs would have to <span class="underline">condense</span> and <span class="underline">concentrate</span> on the reefs that are left. <span class="time" data-times="3.48" data-time="171.16">[02:51.16]</span>So this can cause a kind of <span class="underline">mass</span> feeding <span class="underline">frenzy</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.62" data-time="174.64">[02:54.64]</span>So we have ideas, but no real answer.<span class="time" data-times="6.08" data-time="178.26">[02:58.26]</span> And because we aren't sure of the causes for starfish <span class="underline">population</span> increases, it's difficult to prevent them. <span class="time" data-times="2.52" data-time="184.34">[03:04.34]</span>I mean, some progress has been made. <span class="time" data-times="8.72" data-time="186.86">[03:06.86]</span>For example, new <span class="underline">survey</span> techniques have enabled us to <span class="underline">detect</span> <span class="underline">population</span> increases when the starfish are quite young, so we can be ready for them.<span class="time" data-times="4.58" data-time="195.58">[03:15.58]</span>But <span class="underline">meaningful</span> progress requires much better <span class="underline">evidence</span> about the cause.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.63" data-time="200.16">[03:20.16]</span>On the bright side, in all the research being done on causes, we have discovered something related to how starfish populations might <span class="underline">affect</span> <span class="underline">coral</span> <span class="underline">reef</span> <span class="underline">diversity</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.15" data-time="209.79">[03:29.79]</span>We think that when reefs are damaged, after a few years, the fastest-growing corals <span class="underline">repopulate</span> the areas. <span class="time" data-times="8.09" data-time="215.94">[03:35.94]</span>And these fast-growing <span class="underline">species</span> can grow over the slower-growing <span class="underline">species</span> of <span class="underline">coral</span>, denying them light and preventing them from recovery.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.38" data-time="224.03">[03:44.03]</span>However, the faster-growing <span class="underline">species</span> are the preferred food of the CoT starfish. <span class="time" data-times="8.17" data-time="229.41">[03:49.41]</span>So when an <span class="underline">outbreak</span> of CoT starfish occurs, they thin out the fast-growing <span class="underline">coral</span> and may give the slower ones a <span class="underline">chance</span> to reestablish. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="237.58">[03:57.58]</span>So without the <span class="underline">outbreak</span>, the <span class="underline">diversity</span> of <span class="underline">coral</span> would be reduced. </p>
