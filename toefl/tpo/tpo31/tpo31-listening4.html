        <h3>Listening Text</h3>
        <article>
          <p>Narrator: Listen to a conversation between a student and an employee at the university center for off-campus study.</p>
          <p>:Student: Hi. I am Tom Arnold. I am supposed to pick up a packet from the regional center for marine research. I am doing an internship there this summer.</p>
          <p>:Employee: Yes. I have it right here. The mail carrier dropped it off a few minutes ago.</p>
          <p>:Student: Thanks. Um...I wanted to ask about getting credits for the internship. I don't know if...</p>
          <p>:Employee: I might be able to help you with that. Is there a problem?</p>
          <p>:Student: I just wanted to make sure the details have been corrected. The system should show that I am registered to earn four credits. But as of Friday, nothing was showing up yet. I was told it would be fixed this morning.</p>
          <p>:Employee: Well, I can check on the computer for you. Tom Arnold, right?</p>
          <p>:Student: Yes.</p>
          <p>:Employee: Well, it is showing credits...but only three.</p>
          <p>:Student: Really?! So now what? These all have to be finalized last week.</p>
          <p>:Employee: Well, yes. The course enrollment period ended last week. But since our office was supposed to get this straightened out for you before then... Let me see what I can do. Uh...did the university give approval for you to earn four credits for this internship? Because the other students at the center for marine research are only getting three.</p>
          <p>:Student: Um...I am pretty sure those other students are doing the internship at the center's aquarium, taking classes in marine biology and then teaching visitors about the various displays. I am doing a special research internship with the center. We'll be collecting data on changes to the seafloor out in the open ocean.</p>
          <p>:Employee: Oh. That sounds quite advanced.</p>
          <p>:Student: Well, the internship requires me to have scuba diving certification and to be a senior oceanography student.I want to do advanced study in oceanography when I graduate. So I really want to get a sense of what real research is like.</p>
          <p>:Employee: I see. Now let's try and see if we can... Oh. OK. I see the problem. There are two kinds of internships listed here-regular and research. Yours is listed as regular so it is only showing three credits.</p>
          <p>:Student: Can you switch it?</p>
          <p>:Employee: Not yet. But it lists Professor Leonard as...</p>
          <p>:Student: She is in charge of all the internships.</p>
          <p>:Employee: She just needs to send an email so I have an official record. Then I can switch it. And that should solve everything.</p>
          <p>:Student: Great! And I know Professor Leonard is in her office this afternoon, so I can go there later. It will be such a relief to get all these paperwork completed. </p>
