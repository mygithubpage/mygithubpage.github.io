The <span class="highlight">course</span> <span class="highlight">enrollment</span> period ended last week.<span class="time" data-times="6.15" data-time="58.61">[00:58.61]</span> But since our office was supposed to get this straightened out for you before then... Let me see what I can do. <span class="time" data-times="6.63" data-time="64.76">[01:04.76]</span>Uh...did the university give <span class="highlight">approval</span> for you to earn four credits for this <span class="highlight">internship</span>? <span class="time" data-times="4.92" data-time="71.39">[01:11.39]</span>Because the other students at the center for <span class="highlight">marine</span> research are only getting three.</p>

Now let's try and see if we can... <span class="time" data-times="3.33" data-time="113.47">[01:53.47]</span>Oh. OK. I see the problem. <span class="time" data-times="5.33" data-time="116.8">[01:56.80]</span>There are two kinds of internships listed here-<span class="highlight">regular</span> and research.<span class="time" data-times="3.63" data-time="122.13">[02:02.13]</span> Yours is listed as <span class="highlight">regular</span> so it is only showing three credits.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.21" data-time="125.76">[02:05.76]</span>Student: Can you <span class="highlight">switch</span> it?</p>
