              <span class="time" data-times="6.75" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in an <span class="underline">anthropology</span> class.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.24" data-time="6.75">[00:06.75]</span>Professor: So now that we've discussed how people in <span class="underline">ancient</span> societies tamed animals like cows and chickens for food and other uses. <span class="time" data-times="4.08" data-time="14.99">[00:14.99]</span>I'd like to talk about an <span class="underline">ancient</span> <span class="underline">culture</span> that <span class="underline">domesticated</span> horses. <span class="time" data-times="1.59" data-time="19.07">[00:19.07]</span>It's the Botai people.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.36" data-time="20.66">[00:20.66]</span>The Botai <span class="underline">culture</span> thrived over 5,000 years ago in central Asia, in what is now northern Kazakhstan. <span class="time" data-times="5.03" data-time="29.02">[00:29.02]</span> <span class="underline">Pretty</span> much all of what we know about the Botai comes from three <span class="underline">archaeological</span> sites.<span class="time" data-times="6.53" data-time="34.05">[00:34.05]</span>And we learned that the Botai were able to build large <span class="underline">perennial</span> villages, sometimes with hundreds of homes.<span class="time" data-times="7.02" data-time="40.58">[00:40.58]</span>We also found horse bones at these sites and these can be traced back to the time of the Botai settlements.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.09" data-time="47.6">[00:47.60]</span>The <span class="underline">climate</span> that the Botai <span class="underline">culture</span> lived in...it was <span class="underline">harsh</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.7" data-time="52.69">[00:52.69]</span>And the Botai people...they didn't really <span class="underline">seem</span> to have much in the way of <span class="underline">agriculture</span> going on.<span class="time" data-times="4.73" data-time="58.39">[00:58.39]</span> So their whole <span class="underline">economy</span> was really based on horses. <span class="time" data-times="13.4" data-time="63.12">[01:03.12]</span>And because horses can <span class="underline">withstand</span> the <span class="underline">tough</span> <span class="underline">climate</span>, they can <span class="underline">survive</span> ice storms and they don't need heated barns, the Botai people could <span class="underline">settle</span> in one place and <span class="underline">rely</span> on the horses for food, clothing and <span class="underline">transportation</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.13" data-time="76.52">[01:16.52]</span>Student: So the Botai were the first to <span class="underline">domesticate</span> horses?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.96" data-time="81.65">[01:21.65]</span>Professor: Well, we are <span class="underline">pretty</span> sure that horses were first <span class="underline">domesticated</span> a bit earlier, to the northwest, in the area that is now Ukraine and western Russia. <span class="time" data-times="5.07" data-time="90.61">[01:30.61]</span>It's quite possible that some of those people later migrated east to Kazakhstan.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.26" data-time="95.68">[01:35.68]</span>Student: But what exactly tells us that these Botai people, that the horses in their area were really <span class="underline">domesticated</span>?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.22" data-time="103.94">[01:43.94]</span>Professor: As with most <span class="underline">ancient</span> <span class="underline">history</span>, there is not much that we can be certain about. <span class="time" data-times="4.63" data-time="108.16">[01:48.16]</span>But we know there was a <span class="underline">significant</span> <span class="underline">population</span> of wild horses in that area. <span class="time" data-times="4.98" data-time="112.79">[01:52.79]</span>So there were plenty of opportunities for the Botai people to find horses to <span class="underline">domesticate</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.4" data-time="117.77">[01:57.77]</span>We also know that horse milk was an important <span class="underline">source</span> of food for the Botai people. <span class="time" data-times="3.1" data-time="123.17">[02:03.17]</span>What? Milking a wild horse? <span class="time" data-times="3.8" data-time="126.27">[02:06.27]</span>Well, now, that would be impossible...to milk a wild horse. <span class="time" data-times="3.27" data-time="130.07">[02:10.07]</span>And then... there's the...Oh. Yes? Eric.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.85" data-time="133.34">[02:13.34]</span>Student: So you said last week that for some animals, like for dogs, there were <span class="underline">physical</span> changes taking place over the <span class="underline">course</span> of generations of dogs because of <span class="underline">domestication</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.83" data-time="144.19">[02:24.19]</span>So can we tell from those horse bones if it was <span class="underline">sort</span> of the same for horses?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.24" data-time="149.02">[02:29.02]</span>Professor: Actually, it wasn't. <span class="time" data-times="5.34" data-time="151.26">[02:31.26]</span>We know that horses have not changed a lot physically as a result of <span class="underline">domestication</span>.<span class="time" data-times="5.1" data-time="156.6">[02:36.60]</span>So those <span class="underline">ancient</span> horse bones don't tell us much about <span class="underline">domestication</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.88" data-time="161.7">[02:41.70]</span>But...we've found that...um...we've found what maybe pens or corrals in the Botai settlements. <span class="time" data-times="6.92" data-time="168.58">[02:48.58]</span>And not too long ago, a new <span class="underline">approach</span> was used to find out if the Botai people were keeping horses.<span class="time" data-times="6.66" data-time="175.5">[02:55.50]</span> Soil samples from these pens or corrals show ten times the <span class="underline">concentration</span> of <span class="underline">phosphorus</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.39" data-time="182.16">[03:02.16]</span>Student: Um...<span class="underline">phosphorus</span>?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.1" data-time="185.55">[03:05.55]</span>Professor: Yes. <span class="underline">Phosphorus</span> is a very <span class="underline">significant</span> indicator that horses, large numbers of horses were being kept in the settlements. <span class="time" data-times="8.33" data-time="193.65">[03:13.65]</span>You see, horse <span class="underline">manure</span>, horse <span class="underline">waste</span> is rich in <span class="underline">phosphorus</span> and also <span class="underline">nitrogen</span> compared to normal soil.<span class="time" data-times="3.18" data-time="201.98">[03:21.98]</span> But <span class="underline">nitrogen</span> is an unstable <span class="underline">element</span>.<span class="time" data-times="11.83" data-time="205.16">[03:25.16]</span>It can be washed out when it rains or it can be released to the <span class="underline">atmosphere</span>, whereas <span class="underline">phosphorus</span> combines with <span class="underline">calcium</span> and iron, and can be preserved in the soil for thousands of years.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="17.39" data-time="216.99">[03:36.99]</span>The soil from the Botai <span class="underline">settlement</span> sites was found to have high concentrations of <span class="underline">phosphorus</span> and low <span class="underline">nitrogen</span> concentrations, which is important since it suggests that what we've got is really old, not something added to the soil more recently.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.33" data-time="234.38">[03:54.38]</span>Student: Wait. So if horses have been there recently, there'd still be lots of <span class="underline">nitrogen</span> in the soil.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.12" data-time="240.71">[04:00.71]</span>Professor: That's right. Yes. Karen.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.56" data-time="242.83">[04:02.83]</span>Student: I just read an article. <span class="time" data-times="7.16" data-time="245.39">[04:05.39]</span>It said that one way to <span class="underline">determine</span> if there was an <span class="underline">ancient</span> fireplace at an <span class="underline">archaeological</span> site was to <span class="underline">check</span> the soil for <span class="underline">phosphorus</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.54" data-time="252.55">[04:12.55]</span>So couldn't the <span class="underline">phosphorus</span> at the Botai sites just be from the frequent use of fireplaces?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.68" data-time="258.09">[04:18.09]</span>Professor: You are <span class="underline">absolutely</span> right. <span class="time" data-times="10.49" data-time="259.77">[04:19.77]</span>However, when a fireplace leaves behind a lot of <span class="underline">phosphorus</span> in the soil, we'd also find an unusually high <span class="underline">concentration</span> of <span class="underline">potassium</span>.<span class="time" data-times="10.12" data-time="270.26">[04:30.26]</span>But the soil at the Botai settlements, it was found with <span class="underline">relatively</span> little <span class="underline">potassium</span>, which makes it far more likely that the <span class="underline">phosphorus</span> came from horses. OK?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.77" data-time="280.38">[04:40.38]</span>Now, later on, people of the same <span class="underline">region</span>, northern Kazakhstan, started raising sheep and <span class="underline">cattle</span>.<span class="time" data-times="3.49" data-time="288.15">[04:48.15]</span> And that led to a more <span class="underline">nomadic</span> <span class="underline">culture</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.92" data-time="291.64">[04:51.64]</span>Since sheep and <span class="underline">cattle</span> can't <span class="underline">survive</span> <span class="underline">harsh</span> climates, they needed to be taken south every winter. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="297.56">[04:57.56]</span>Moving around meant working harder but the trade-off was far richer, fattier milk year round and warm clothing from the sheep.</p>
