Evidence that an ancient civilization used domesticated animals</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>I'd like to talk about an ancient culture that domesticated horses. It's the Botai people. As soon as the professor came up, he said that he wanted to tell an ancient civilization that tamed the horses.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor mention milking a wild horse?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To point that the Botai people sometimes did not have enough food</p><p>B. To compare the physical features of domesticated and wild horse</p><p>C. To prove that the horses of the Botai people were domesticated</p><p>D. To emphasize that horse milk was popular in some ancient societies</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>We also know that horse milk was an important source of food for the Botai people. The students questioned how you knew that it must be domestic. The professor said that there are a lot of wild horses in the area, so it is not difficult for the Botai people to catch two horses to raise them, and horse milk is also an important source of food.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What point does the professor make the horse bones found in the Botai settlements?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

They date to the period when the Botai people had become nomads</p><p>D. They suggested that horses were first domesticated by another ancient people</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>Professors of these ancient horse bones don't tell us much about domestication. The professor said that the bones of the horses have not changed much. It is impossible to judge whether they are domestic from the bones.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor, what can a large concentration of phosphorus in the soil indicate?Click on 2 answers.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

They realized that a nomadic lifestyle offered benefits that outweighed the hard work</p><p>C. They had to learn the area due to a rapid increase in population</p><p>D. They learned that growing crops is possible in the southern regions</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Now, later on, people of the same region, northern Kazakhstan, started raising sheep and cattle. And that led to a more nomadic culture. Since sheep and cattle can't survive harsh climates, they need to be taken south every winter. Around meant working harder but the trade-off was far richer, fattier milk year round and warm clothing from the sheep professor pointed out that nomadic life brings more benefits. Moving around meant working harder but the trade-off was far richer, fattier milk year round and warm clothing from the sheep</p></div></div><div class="replay" id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the student say this:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

To find out if he understands correctly what the professor has just explained</p><p>D. To show that he disagrees with the professor</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Wait. So if horses have been there, there's still lots of nitrogen in the soil. The student wants to determine whether or not professors are talking about what he understands. If there are many nitrogen elements, then this means that the horses were not there long ago, otherwise the nitrogen element has already volatilized.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
