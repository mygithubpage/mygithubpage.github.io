          <p>Narrator Listen to a conversation between two students. </p>
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>Male Student Hey. Lin. Whaf s up? </p>
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>Female Student </p>
          <p>Oh. Just getting ready for my grandmother to come to town. She is flying in tomorrow to visit me for a few days at school. </p>
          <p>Male Student Oh. Yeah. Is she going to stay at your apartment? </p>
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>Female Student </p>
          <p>Yeah. It would be good. We can spend some time together and I can show her around campus and stuff. </p>
          <p>Male Student Sounds nice. </p>
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>Female Student </p>
          <p>Yeah. I am looking forward to it. But I am not sure what to do about picking her up from the airport. </p>
          <p>Male Student What do you mean? </p>
          <p>Female Student </p>
          <p>Well, her flight gets in tomorrow. But the problem is, my biology professor scheduled a special review session...uh...for an upcoming biology exam at the same time I am supposed to pick her up. I didn't know there'd be this conflict. </p>
          <p>Male Student </p>
          <p>Oh. Well, how important is the review session? Do you think you can miss it to pick your grandmother up? </p>
          <p>Female Student </p>
          <p>It's optional. But this professor's review sessions are usually really helpful, he does a good job going over what's going to be on the exam. </p>
          <p>So it would be good to go, but... maybe I'll have to miss it. </p>
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>Male Student Is there something else you could do? </p>
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>Female Student </p>
          <p>Yeah. Actually I spoke with my friend Mary and she offered to pick my grandma up from the airport. </p>
          <p>Male Student Great. Why don't you do that then? </p>
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>Female Student </p>
          <p>Maybe. But Mary doesn't even know my grandmother. And I don't know how grandma would feel about being picked up by a stranger. She'd probably be more comfortable being picked up by me. </p>
          <p>Male Student Oh. Well... </p>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>Well, the woman's problem is that she's got a schedule conflicts: she is going to pick up her grandma but she has a special review session to go to at that time. Accordingly, there're two solutions for her. First, she could miss her review session and go to pick up her grandma, and second, she could ask her friend for a favor to pick up her grandma from the airport for her. In my opinion, the woman should turn to her friend for help for two main reasons. Firstly, the special review session is obviously more important than picking up her grandma for the woman because it is always a common sense to all students that a special review session given by the professor is always about final papers or exams especially when a semester is ending. Secondly, I am sure that the woman's friend would be glad to do her such a favor. The woman could print her grandma's name on a paper, and give her friend a photo of her grandma with her grandma's cellphone number on it, so surely her grandma and her friend can find each other at the airport. So I think the woman should take the second solution. (201 words)</p>
