The characteristics of ancient Greek songs.</p><p>D. The attitude of the ancient Greek towards music.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The professor used the syntactic structure of today, I want to... to directly elicit the topic he was discussing about Western music, and he had to discuss it from ancient Greece.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>What two reasons does the professor give for approaching the lecture material as he does? Click on 2 answers.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. We have a limited idea of what ancient Greek music sounded like.</p><p>B. The Greek philosophy of music influenced Western thought.</p><p>C. Greek music shared many characteristics with other types of ancient music.</p><p>D. Greek melodies were admired by musicians from other cultures.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="AB"><p>The professor said that there is not much left in ancient Greek music, so it is unclear what kind of ancient Greek music is. This is why he chose to discuss the influence of ancient Greek music on Western music.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor, what did the ancient Greeks believe about music?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

That music could not be explained by mathematics.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Um...and for the Greeks, the same mathematical principles that govern music also govern the universe as well as the human character, the essence of personality.

To introduce a topic he will discuss later in the lecture.</p><p>D. To find out what kind of music students in the class like best.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>When the professor talked about rock and roll, he said that he liked the music himself but his father thought the music had a negative influence, and later said that Father should be able to get along well with Plato. It can be seen here that they represent the ancient attitude and Modern attitude so A is correct</p><p>  I am thinking back now to when I first started listening to rock 'n' roll and I remember my father saying it was a bad influence on us.
