What can parents do to help their children have healthy lifestyles?</p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>Parents can affect their children in many different ways. In my opinion, there are two ways that parents can do to help their children have healthy lifestyles. Firstly, parents have to lead healthy lifestyles  themselves. For example, since my parents started working out and having healthy diet, I have changed my diet and started going to the gym myself. Children learn from their parents unconsciously. Besides, parents can send their children to summer camps where a group of children live together for a period of time. For example, there are many kinds of summer camps such as Weight Loss Camps and Survival Camps for children to develop different skills. They are very helpful for children to lead a healthy lifestyle.</p></article></div></main></body></html>
