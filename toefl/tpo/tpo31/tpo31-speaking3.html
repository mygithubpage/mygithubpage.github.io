          <h4 class="w3-center">Students Need Access to Movie Collection</h4>
          <p>The university library has a large collection of films on video and DVD that students can borrow. However, students aren't allowed to go into the area where these items are kept. Instead, students need to request a movie title, and then library staff get it for them. I think students should be allowed to go into the area where the videos and DVDS are kept. First, it will be easier for students to choose a good movie because then they can easily see what is available. Also, if students can get movies themselves, the university won't have to pay extra library staff to help students.</p>
          <p>Sincerely,</p>
          <p>Rebecca Smith</p>

        <h3>Listening Text</h3>
        <article>
          <p>Narrator Now listen to two students discussing the letter. </p>
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>Female Student What do you think? </p>
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>Male Student I don't think we need to change anything. </p>
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>Female Student You don't think she is right that it would be easier? </p>
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>Male Student </p>
          <p>Well, I just don't think it's that difficult now. I mean, the library has a really good computer system where you can easily see what they have in their collection, see whaf s available and what's not. </p>
          <p>Female Student </p>
          <p>Yeah. You can always look through the titles on the library computers. </p>
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>Male Student </p>
          <p>Right. And you don't even have to have an exact title in mind. I mean, you can just look for certain types of movies or movies with certain actors or whatever. </p>
          <p>Female Student Good point. </p>
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>Male Student </p>
          <p>And as far as what she said about the staff, the people who do that work are students who really need the money to pay for books and stuff. </p>
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>Female Student True. </p>
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>Male Student </p>
          <p>Plus, I am sure those students don't get paid that much to do the work. </p>
          <p>So I don't think it's going to put any strain on the university's budget. </p>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>The proposal says that students should be allowed to go into the area to get the DVDs and videos by themselves for two reasons. However the man disagrees with the proposal and the reasons given. First of all, he thinks that the library has a really good computer system so students can easily see what's available and what's not in the collection by looking through the titles on the library computers, which means students can look for certain types of movies or movies with certain actors or anything on their minds. Secondly, the man believes that the staff in the library are students who do the work to earn money to cover their books and stuff like that, and they don't get paid that much, so it won't be such strain on the university's budget. So, the man disagrees with the proposal for the reasons stated above. (145 words)</p>
