These Arctic animals have adapted to the extremely cold temperatures primarily because of certain body features that help them to survive in the cold Arctic climate. Let's look at a few of them. For one thing, many Arctic animals have developed a protective covering on their feet. The covering usually consists of fur or feathers which act as a protective layer between the cold and the animals' skin. Since they spend so much of their time on snowy, icy surfaces, whether they are standing on the ground or swimming in the water, they can easily lose heat through their feet. This is especially true of Arctic birds. A bird like the Arctic Snowy Owl, for example, has feathers on its body the way other birds do. But unlike most birds, it also has feathers all over its feet. This shields and protects the feet from the icy ground so that very little of the owl's foot actually touches snowy or icy surfaces, which helps its feet to stay warm.Another physical characteristic that some Arctic animals share is having smaller bodies and smaller, shorter body parts. In other words, their bodies are often more compact than other animals'. And the parts of their bodies that stick out or protrude like the legs, ears or tails are smaller and shorter. And the result is that there is less body surface exposed to the cold air. A great example is the Arctic wolf. Unlike the larger grey wolves that live in warmer climates, Arctic wolves have relatively small, compact bodies that efficiently retain heat. They also have smaller ears and shorter legs so that they lose less body heat than animals with larger bodies or longer body parts. And in the climate where the temperature is below zero most of the year, that's very important."</p></article><section id="question"><h4>Question</h4><p>Using the example of the owl and the wolf, explain how two special body features have helped Arctic animals adapt to the cold. </p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>The arctic animals usually develop some body features to help survive in the harshly cold Arctic region. The first development mentioned is a protective covering on their feet, which is a layer covered with feathers or furs. Animals usually have to stand in the freezing ground for a long time, which makes it easy for them to lose heat through their feet. So they need the protective layer to protect them from the cold. For example, a bird called Arctic snowy owl has feathers all over its feet so very little part of its foot actually touches snow surfaces and it stays warm this way. Another body feature is having a more compact body so that there's less body surface exposed to the cold air. For example, the Arctic wolves have small bodies and body parts that can effectively reserve heat. Their ears are smaller, and legs shorter, so that they lose less heat than animals with larger bodies. (157 words)</p></article></div></main></body></html>
