            <b>Early Childhood Education</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>Preschools – educational programs for children under the age of five – differ <span class="underline">significantly</span> from one country to another according to the views that different societies hold regarding the purpose of early childhood education. For <span class="underline">instance</span>, in a cross-country <span class="underline">comparison</span> of preschools in China, Japan, and the United States, researchers found that parents in the three countries view the purpose of preschools very differently. Whereas parents in China <span class="underline">tend</span> to see preschools <span class="underline">primarily</span> as a way of giving children a good start academically, Japanese parents view them <span class="underline">primarily</span> as a way of giving children the <span class="underline">opportunity</span> to be members of a group. In the United States, in <span class="underline">comparison</span>, parents regard the <span class="underline">primary</span> purpose of preschools as making children more <span class="underline">independent</span> and self-reliant, although obtaining a good <span class="underline">academic</span> start and having group experience are also important.</p>
          <p>While many programs designed for preschoolers <span class="underline">focus</span> <span class="underline">primarily</span> on social and <span class="underline">emotional</span> factors, some are geared mainly toward promoting <span class="underline">cognitive</span> gains and preparing preschoolers for the <span class="underline">formal</span> <span class="underline">instruction</span> they will experience when they start kindergarten. In the United States, the best-known program designed to <span class="underline">promote</span> future <span class="underline">academic</span> success is Head Start. Established in the 1960s when the United States declared the War on <span class="underline">Poverty</span>, the program has served over 13 million children and their families. The program, which stresses parental <span class="underline">involvement</span>, was designed to serve the "whole child", including children's <span class="underline">physical</span> health, self-confidence, social responsibility, and social and <span class="underline">emotional</span> <span class="underline">development</span>.</p>
          <p>Whether Head Start is seen as successful or not depends on the <span class="underline">lens</span> <span class="underline">through</span> which one is looking. If, for <span class="underline">instance</span>, the program is expected to provide long-term increases in IQ (<span class="underline">intelligence</span> quotient) scores, it is a disappointment. Although graduates of Head Start programs <span class="underline">tend</span> to show <span class="underline">immediate</span> IQ gains, these increases do not last. On the other hand, it is <span class="underline">clear</span> that Head Start is meeting its goal of getting preschoolers ready for school. Preschoolers who <span class="underline">participate</span> in Head Start are better prepared for future schooling than those who do not. Furthermore, graduates of Head Start programs have better future school grade. Finally, some research suggests that <span class="underline">ultimately</span> Head Start graduates show higher <span class="underline">academic</span> performance at the end of high school, although the gains are <span class="underline">modest</span>.</p>
          <p>In <span class="underline">addition</span>, results from other types of readiness programs <span class="underline">indicate</span> that those who <span class="underline">participate</span> and graduate are less likely to repeat grades, and they are more likely to complete school than readiness program, for every dollar spent on the program, taxpayers saved seven dollars by the time the graduates reached the age of 27.</p>
          <p>The most recent <span class="underline">comprehensive</span> evaluation of early intervention programs suggests that, taken as a group, preschool programs can provide <span class="underline">significant</span> benefits, and that <span class="underline">government</span> funds invested early in life may <span class="underline">ultimately</span> <span class="underline">lead</span> to a <span class="underline">reduction</span> in future costs. For <span class="underline">instance</span>, compared with children who did not <span class="underline">participate</span> in early intervention programs, participants in various programs showed gains in <span class="underline">emotional</span> or <span class="underline">cognitive</span> <span class="underline">development</span>, better educational outcomes, increased <span class="underline">economic</span> self-sufficiency, reduced levels of criminal <span class="underline">activity</span>, and improved health-related behaviors. Of <span class="underline">course</span>, not every program produced all these benefits, and not every child benefited to the same <span class="underline">extent</span>. Furthermore, some researchers <span class="underline">argue</span> that less-expensive programs are just as good as <span class="underline">relatively</span> expensive ones, such as Head Start. Still, the results of the evaluation were <span class="underline">promising</span>, suggesting that the <span class="underline">potential</span> benefits of early intervention can be <span class="underline">substantial</span>.</p>
          <p>Not everyone agrees that programs that seek to <span class="underline">enhance</span> <span class="underline">academic</span> skills during the preschool years are a good thing. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>In fact, according to developmental psychologist David Elkind,
United States society tends to push children so rapidly that they begin to feel <span class="underline">stress</span> and <span class="underline">pressure</span> at a young age. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>Elkind argues that <span class="underline">academic</span> success is largely dependent upon factors
out of parents' control, such as <span class="underline">inherited</span> abilities and a child's <span class="underline">rate</span> of maturation. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>Consequently, children of a <span class="underline">particular</span> age cannot be expected to master educational <span class="underline">material</span> without
taking into <span class="underline">account</span> their <span class="underline">current</span> <span class="underline">level</span> of <span class="underline">cognitive</span> <span class="underline">development</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>In short, children <span class="underline">require</span> <span class="underline">development</span> <span class="underline">appropriate</span> educational practice, which is education that is based on both <span class="underline">typical</span> <span class="underline">development</span> and the <span class="underline">unique</span> characteristics of a <span class="underline">given</span> child.</p>
