          <p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.27" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in a <span class="underline">geology</span> class. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.87" data-time="5.27">[00:05.27]</span>Professor: As we've discussed, Earth's <span class="underline">crust</span> is made up of large plates that rest on a <span class="underline">mantle</span> of <span class="underline">molten</span> rock. <span class="time" data-times="4.76" data-time="12.14">[00:12.14]</span>These plates...uh...now these <span class="underline">tectonic</span> plates support the continents and oceans.<span class="time" data-times="5.98" data-time="16.9">[00:16.90]</span>Over time, the <span class="underline">tectonic</span> plates move and <span class="underline">shift</span>, which moves the continents and the ocean floors too.<span class="time" data-times="10.61" data-time="22.88">[00:22.88]</span>Once it was understood how these plates move, it was possible to <span class="underline">determine</span> past movements of Earth's continents and how these slow movements have reshaped Earth's features at different times. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.44" data-time="33.49">[00:33.49]</span>OK. Well, (as) studying the movements of the plates can tell us about the location of the continents in the past, it can <span class="underline">conceivably</span> tell us about their location in the future too, right? <span class="time" data-times="7.53" data-time="43.93">[00:43.93]</span>So, in recent years, some geologists have used <span class="underline">plate</span> <span class="underline">tectonic</span> <span class="underline">theory</span> to make what they call geopredictions.<span class="time" data-times="6.43" data-time="51.46">[00:51.46]</span>Geopredictions are guesses about what Earth's surface might look like millions of years from now. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.24" data-time="57.89">[00:57.89]</span>So, we know how certain continents are currently moving. <span class="time" data-times="8.14" data-time="61.13">[01:01.13]</span>For example, the continents of Africa has been creeping north toward Europe and Australia has been making its way north too, toward Asia. <span class="time" data-times="2.89" data-time="69.27">[01:09.27]</span>Does anyone know what's happening to the Americas? <span class="time" data-times="3.43" data-time="72.16">[01:12.16]</span>I...I think we've talked about that before. Lisa? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.25" data-time="75.59">[01:15.59]</span>Student: They are moving westward, away from Europe and Africa. Right? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.47" data-time="79.84">[01:19.84]</span>Professor: Right. And what makes us think that? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.64" data-time="83.31">[01:23.31]</span>Student: The Atlantic Ocean floor is spreading and getting wider, so there is more ocean between the Americas and Europe and Africa. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.26" data-time="90.95">[01:30.95]</span>Professor: OK. And why is it spreading? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.39" data-time="93.21">[01:33.21]</span>Student: Well, the seafloor is spilt. <span class="time" data-times="3.86" data-time="95.6">[01:35.60]</span>There is a <span class="underline">ridge</span>, a mountain <span class="underline">range</span> that runs north and south there.<span class="time" data-times="9.82" data-time="99.46">[01:39.46]</span>And the rock <span class="underline">material</span> flows up from Earth's <span class="underline">interior</span> here, at the <span class="underline">split</span>, which forces the two sides of the ocean floor to <span class="underline">spread</span> apart, to make room for the new rock <span class="underline">material</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.07" data-time="109.28">[01:49.28]</span>Professor: Good. And that means, over the short <span class="underline">term</span>...uh... and by short <span class="underline">term</span> I mean 50 million years, that's a <span class="underline">blink</span> of the eye in geological time.<span class="time" data-times="10.39" data-time="119.35">[01:59.35]</span>Um...over the short <span class="underline">term</span>, we can <span class="underline">predict</span> that the Americas will continue to move westward, farther away from Europe, while Africa and Australia will continue to move northward. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.43" data-time="129.74">[02:09.74]</span>But what about over the long <span class="underline">term</span>? <span class="time" data-times="2.33" data-time="132.17">[02:12.17]</span>Say 250 million years or more. <span class="time" data-times="5.02" data-time="134.5">[02:14.50]</span>Well, over that length of time, forecasts become more uncertain. <span class="time" data-times="17.48" data-time="139.52">[02:19.52]</span>But lots of geologists <span class="underline">predict</span> that <span class="underline">eventually</span> all the continents, including <span class="underline">Antarctica</span>, will merge and become one <span class="underline">giant</span> land <span class="underline">mass</span>, a super <span class="underline">continent</span>, one researchers calling Pangaea Ultima, which more or less means the last super <span class="underline">continent</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.83" data-time="157">[02:37.00]</span>Now, how that might happen is open to some <span class="underline">debate</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.09" data-time="160.83">[02:40.83]</span>Some geologists believe that the Americas will continue to move westward and <span class="underline">eventually</span> merge with East Asia.<span class="time" data-times="4.21" data-time="166.92">[02:46.92]</span>This <span class="underline">hypothesis</span> is based on the direction the Americas are moving in now.<span class="time" data-times="4.59" data-time="171.13">[02:51.13]</span>But others <span class="underline">hypothesize</span> that a new super <span class="underline">continent</span> will form in a different way. <span class="time" data-times="5.4" data-time="175.72">[02:55.72]</span>They think that a new subduction <span class="underline">zone</span> will might <span class="underline">occur</span> at the western <span class="underline">edge</span> of the Atlantic Ocean. <span class="time" data-times="3.4" data-time="181.12">[03:01.12]</span>Paul, can you <span class="underline">remind</span> us what a subduction <span class="underline">zone</span> is? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.39" data-time="184.52">[03:04.52]</span>Student: Yeah. Um...basically, a subduction <span class="underline">zone</span> is where two <span class="underline">tectonic</span> plates <span class="underline">collide</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.48" data-time="191.91">[03:11.91]</span>So if an ocean floor <span class="underline">tectonic</span> <span class="underline">plate</span> meets the <span class="underline">edge</span> of a <span class="underline">continent</span> and they push against each other, the heavier one sinks down and goes under the other one. <span class="time" data-times="8.79" data-time="200.39">[03:20.39]</span>So the...um...the <span class="underline">oceanic</span> <span class="underline">plate</span> is made of denser and heavier rock, so it begins to sink down under the <span class="underline">continental</span> <span class="underline">plate</span> and into the <span class="underline">mantle</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.18" data-time="209.18">[03:29.18]</span>Professor: Right. So the ocean floor would kind of <span class="underline">slide</span> under the <span class="underline">edge</span> of the <span class="underline">continent</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.04" data-time="214.36">[03:34.36]</span>And once the ocean <span class="underline">plate</span> begins to sink, it would be affected by another force – <span class="underline">slab</span> pull. <span class="time" data-times="9.05" data-time="220.4">[03:40.40]</span> <span class="underline">Slab</span> pull happens at the subduction <span class="underline">zone</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9.32" data-time="229.45">[03:49.45]</span>So to continue our example... As the ocean floor <span class="underline">plate</span> begins to sink down into the <span class="underline">mantle</span>, it would <span class="underline">drag</span> or pull the entire <span class="underline">plate</span> <span class="underline">along</span> with it. <span class="time" data-times="6.32" data-time="238.77">[03:58.77]</span>So more and more of this <span class="underline">plate</span>, the ocean floor, would go down under the <span class="underline">continent</span> into the <span class="underline">mantle</span>. OK? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="14.85" data-time="245.09">[04:05.09]</span>So, as I said, currently the Atlantic Ocean floor is spreading, getting wider, but some researchers <span class="underline">speculate</span> that <span class="underline">eventually</span> a subduction <span class="underline">zone</span> will <span class="underline">occur</span> where the <span class="underline">oceanic</span> <span class="underline">plate</span> meets the <span class="underline">continental</span> <span class="underline">plate</span> of the Americas. <span class="time" data-times="10.45" data-time="259.94">[04:19.94]</span>If that happens, <span class="underline">slab</span> pull could <span class="underline">draw</span> the <span class="underline">oceanic</span> <span class="underline">crust</span> under the <span class="underline">continent</span>, actually causing the Americas to move eastward toward Europe and the ocean floor to get smaller. <span class="time" data-times="8.69" data-time="270.39">[04:30.39]</span>That is, the Atlantic Ocean would start to close up, narrowing the distance between the eastern <span class="underline">edge</span> of the Americas and Europe and Africa. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="279.08">[04:39.08]</span>So they form a single super <span class="underline">continent</span>.   </p>
