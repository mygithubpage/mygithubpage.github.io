            <span class="time" data-times="5.27" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in a <span class="highlight">geology</span> class. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.87" data-time="5.27">[00:05.27]</span>Professor: As we've discussed, Earth's <span class="highlight">crust</span> is made up of large plates that rest on a <span class="highlight">mantle</span> of <span class="highlight">molten</span> rock. <span class="time" data-times="4.76" data-time="12.14">[00:12.14]</span>These plates...uh...now these <span class="highlight">tectonic</span> plates support the continents and oceans.<span class="time" data-times="5.98" data-time="16.9">[00:16.90]</span>Over time, the <span class="highlight">tectonic</span> plates move and <span class="highlight">shift</span>, which moves the continents and the ocean floors too.<span class="time" data-times="10.61" data-time="22.88">[00:22.88]</span>Once it was understood how these plates move, it was possible to <span class="highlight">determine</span> past movements of Earth's continents and how these slow movements have reshaped Earth's features at different times. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="10.44" data-time="33.49">[00:33.49]</span>OK. Well, (as) studying the movements of the plates can tell us about the location of the continents in the past, it can <span class="highlight">conceivably</span> tell us about their location in the future too, right? <span class="time" data-times="7.53" data-time="43.93">[00:43.93]</span>So, in recent years, some geologists have used <span class="highlight">plate</span> <span class="highlight">tectonic</span> <span class="highlight">theory</span> to make what they call geopredictions.<span class="time" data-times="6.43" data-time="51.46">[00:51.46]</span>Geopredictions are guesses about what Earth's surface might look like millions of years from now. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.24" data-time="57.89">[00:57.89]</span>So, we know how certain continents are currently moving. <span class="time" data-times="8.14" data-time="61.13">[01:01.13]</span>For example, the continents of Africa has been creeping north toward Europe and Australia has been making its way north too, toward Asia. <span class="time" data-times="2.89" data-time="69.27">[01:09.27]</span>Does anyone know what's happening to the Americas? <span class="time" data-times="3.43" data-time="72.16">[01:12.16]</span>I...I think we've talked about that before. Lisa? </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.25" data-time="75.59">[01:15.59]</span>Student: They are moving westward, away from Europe and Africa. Right? </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.47" data-time="79.84">[01:19.84]</span>Professor: Right. And what makes us think that? </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="7.64" data-time="83.31">[01:23.31]</span>Student: The Atlantic Ocean floor is spreading and getting wider, so there is more ocean between the Americas and Europe and Africa. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.26" data-time="90.95">[01:30.95]</span>Professor: OK. And why is it spreading? </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.39" data-time="93.21">[01:33.21]</span>Student: Well, the seafloor is spilt. <span class="time" data-times="3.86" data-time="95.6">[01:35.60]</span>There is a <span class="highlight">ridge</span>, a mountain <span class="highlight">range</span> that runs north and south there.<span class="time" data-times="9.82" data-time="99.46">[01:39.46]</span>And the rock <span class="highlight">material</span> flows up from Earth's <span class="highlight">interior</span> here, at the <span class="highlight">split</span>, which forces the two sides of the ocean floor to <span class="highlight">spread</span> apart, to make room for the new rock <span class="highlight">material</span>. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="10.07" data-time="109.28">[01:49.28]</span>Professor: Good. And that means, over the short <span class="highlight">term</span>...uh... and by short <span class="highlight">term</span> I mean 50 million years, that's a <span class="highlight">blink</span> of the eye in geological time.<span class="time" data-times="10.39" data-time="119.35">[01:59.35]</span>Um...over the short <span class="highlight">term</span>, we can <span class="highlight">predict</span> that the Americas will continue to move westward, farther away from Europe, while Africa and Australia will continue to move northward. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.43" data-time="129.74">[02:09.74]</span>But what about over the long <span class="highlight">term</span>? <span class="time" data-times="2.33" data-time="132.17">[02:12.17]</span>Say 250 million years or more. <span class="time" data-times="5.02" data-time="134.5">[02:14.50]</span>Well, over that length of time, forecasts become more uncertain. <span class="time" data-times="17.48" data-time="139.52">[02:19.52]</span>But lots of geologists <span class="highlight">predict</span> that <span class="highlight">eventually</span> all the continents, including <span class="highlight">Antarctica</span>, will merge and become one <span class="highlight">giant</span> land <span class="highlight">mass</span>, a super <span class="highlight">continent</span>, one researchers calling Pangaea Ultima, which more or less means the last super <span class="highlight">continent</span>. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.83" data-time="157">[02:37.00]</span>Now, how that might happen is open to some <span class="highlight">debate</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.09" data-time="160.83">[02:40.83]</span>Some geologists believe that the Americas will continue to move westward and <span class="highlight">eventually</span> merge with East Asia.<span class="time" data-times="4.21" data-time="166.92">[02:46.92]</span>This <span class="highlight">hypothesis</span> is based on the direction the Americas are moving in now.<span class="time" data-times="4.59" data-time="171.13">[02:51.13]</span>But others <span class="highlight">hypothesize</span> that a new super <span class="highlight">continent</span> will form in a different way. <span class="time" data-times="5.4" data-time="175.72">[02:55.72]</span>They think that a new subduction <span class="highlight">zone</span> will might <span class="highlight">occur</span> at the western <span class="highlight">edge</span> of the Atlantic Ocean. <span class="time" data-times="3.4" data-time="181.12">[03:01.12]</span>Paul, can you <span class="highlight">remind</span> us what a subduction <span class="highlight">zone</span> is? </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="7.39" data-time="184.52">[03:04.52]</span>Student: Yeah. Um...basically, a subduction <span class="highlight">zone</span> is where two <span class="highlight">tectonic</span> plates <span class="highlight">collide</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.48" data-time="191.91">[03:11.91]</span>So if an ocean floor <span class="highlight">tectonic</span> <span class="highlight">plate</span> meets the <span class="highlight">edge</span> of a <span class="highlight">continent</span> and they push against each other, the heavier one sinks down and goes under the other one. <span class="time" data-times="8.79" data-time="200.39">[03:20.39]</span>So the...um...the <span class="highlight">oceanic</span> <span class="highlight">plate</span> is made of denser and heavier rock, so it begins to sink down under the <span class="highlight">continental</span> <span class="highlight">plate</span> and into the <span class="highlight">mantle</span>. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.18" data-time="209.18">[03:29.18]</span>Professor: Right. So the ocean floor would kind of <span class="highlight">slide</span> under the <span class="highlight">edge</span> of the <span class="highlight">continent</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.04" data-time="214.36">[03:34.36]</span>And once the ocean <span class="highlight">plate</span> begins to sink, it would be affected by another force – <span class="highlight">slab</span> pull. <span class="time" data-times="9.05" data-time="220.4">[03:40.40]</span> <span class="highlight">Slab</span> pull happens at the subduction <span class="highlight">zone</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9.32" data-time="229.45">[03:49.45]</span>So to continue our example... As the ocean floor <span class="highlight">plate</span> begins to sink down into the <span class="highlight">mantle</span>, it would <span class="highlight">drag</span> or pull the entire <span class="highlight">plate</span> <span class="highlight">along</span> with it. <span class="time" data-times="6.32" data-time="238.77">[03:58.77]</span>So more and more of this <span class="highlight">plate</span>, the ocean floor, would go down under the <span class="highlight">continent</span> into the <span class="highlight">mantle</span>. OK? </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="14.85" data-time="245.09">[04:05.09]</span>So, as I said, currently the Atlantic Ocean floor is spreading, getting wider, but some researchers <span class="highlight">speculate</span> that <span class="highlight">eventually</span> a subduction <span class="highlight">zone</span> will <span class="highlight">occur</span> where the <span class="highlight">oceanic</span> <span class="highlight">plate</span> meets the <span class="highlight">continental</span> <span class="highlight">plate</span> of the Americas. <span class="time" data-times="10.45" data-time="259.94">[04:19.94]</span>If that happens, <span class="highlight">slab</span> pull could <span class="highlight">draw</span> the <span class="highlight">oceanic</span> <span class="highlight">crust</span> under the <span class="highlight">continent</span>, actually causing the Americas to move eastward toward Europe and the ocean floor to get smaller. <span class="time" data-times="8.69" data-time="270.39">[04:30.39]</span>That is, the Atlantic Ocean would start to close up, narrowing the distance between the eastern <span class="highlight">edge</span> of the Americas and Europe and Africa. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="279.08">[04:39.08]</span>So they form a single super <span class="highlight">continent</span>.   </p>

              <p>OK. Well, (as)studying the movements of the plates can tell us about the location of the continents in the past, it can conceivably tell us about their location in the future too, right? So, in recent years, some geologists have Professor used plate tectonic theory to make what they call geopredictions. Proceeding from the movement of the earth plate, the concept of georediction was introduced. Later, the paper also discusses some ideas about plate movement.</p>

              <p>But lots of geologists predict that eventually all the continents, including Antarctica, will merge and become one giant land mass, a super continent, one others calling Pangaea Ultima, which more more or less means the last super continent. Many geologists speculate that eventually there will be Land mass formation.</p>

So the...um...the oceanic plate is made of denser and heavier rock, so it The professor began to sink down under the continental plate and into the mantle. The professor asked the students to explain what the subduction zone was. When two plates collided, the middle one would sink, and eventually the oceanic plat was getting denser. More and more heavy, sink to the mainland plate and enter the mantle.</p>
