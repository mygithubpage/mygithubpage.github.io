Um...basically, a subduction <span class="highlight">zone</span> is where two <span class="highlight">tectonic</span> plates <span class="highlight">collide</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.48" data-time="191.91">[03:11.91]</span>So if an ocean floor <span class="highlight">tectonic</span><span class="highlight">plate</span> meets the <span class="highlight">edge</span> of a <span class="highlight">continent</span> and they push against each other, the heavier one sinks down and goes under the other one. <span class="time" data-times="8.79" data-time="200.39">[03:20.39]</span>So the...um...the <span class="highlight">oceanic</span><span class="highlight">plate</span> is made of denser and heavier rock, so it begins to sink down under the <span class="highlight">continental</span><span class="highlight">plate</span> and into the <span class="highlight">mantle</span>. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.18" data-time="209.18">[03:29.18]</span>Professor: Right.

As the ocean floor <span class="highlight">plate</span> begins to sink down into the <span class="highlight">mantle</span>, it would <span class="highlight">drag</span> or pull the entire <span class="highlight">plate</span><span class="highlight">along</span> with it. <span class="time" data-times="6.32" data-time="238.77">[03:58.77]</span>So more and more of this <span class="highlight">plate</span>, the ocean floor, would go down under the <span class="highlight">continent</span> into the <span class="highlight">mantle</span>. OK? </p><p><span class="time" data-times="14.85" data-time="245.09">[04:05.09]</span>So, as I said, currently the Atlantic Ocean floor is spreading, getting wider, but some researchers <span class="highlight">speculate</span> that <span class="highlight">eventually</span> a subduction <span class="highlight">zone</span> will <span class="highlight">occur</span> where the <span class="highlight">oceanic</span><span class="highlight">plate</span> meets the <span class="highlight">continental</span><span class="highlight">plate</span> of the Americas. <span class="time" data-times="10.45" data-time="259.94">[04:19.94]</span>If that happens, <span class="highlight">slab</span> pull could <span class="highlight">draw</span> the <span class="highlight">oceanic</span><span class="highlight">crust</span> under the <span class="highlight">continent</span>, actually causing the Americas to move eastward toward Europe and the ocean floor to get smaller. <span class="time" data-times="8.69" data-time="270.39">[04:30.39]</span>That is, the Atlantic Ocean would start to close up, narrowing the distance between the eastern <span class="highlight">edge</span> of the Americas and Europe and Africa. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="279.08">[04:39.08]</span>So they form a single super <span class="highlight">continent</span>.   </p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the lecture mainly about?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.
