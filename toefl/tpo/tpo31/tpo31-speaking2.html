Other students prefer to take easier classes in which they know they will get a good grade. Which do you prefer? Explain why.</p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>Personally speaking, I prefer to take difficult classes even if I know I might not get a good grade for several reasons. Firstly, taking difficult classes is a challenge that will benefit us in the long run as many skills can be developed through the challenges. For example, I took a literature class when I was still a freshman. At that point, I had a hard time understanding the readings. However, after finishing that class, I developed my communicating skills by frequently asking the professor and my classmates questions, which benefited my through my college. Besides, I can actually learn new things by taking difficult classes. There is no point of taking the same class over and over again. For example, my friend Jenny took two language courses in university and now she can speak four languages fluently. </p></article></div></main></body></html>
