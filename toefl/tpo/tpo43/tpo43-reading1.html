Alexander the Great took his Greek armies to the east and in only a few years completed his creation of an <span class="highlight">empire</span> out of much of southwest Asia. In the new <span class="highlight">empire</span>, barriers to <span class="highlight">trade</span> and the movement of peoples were removed; markets were put in touch with one another. In the next <span class="highlight">generation</span> thousands of Greek traders and artisans would enter this wider world to seek their fortunes. Alexander's actions had several important consequences for the <span class="highlight">region</span> occupied by the <span class="highlight">empire</span>.</p><p>The first of these was the <span class="highlight">expansion</span> of Greek <span class="highlight">civilization</span><span class="highlight">throughout</span> the Middle East. Greek became the great international language. Towns and cities were established not only as garrisons (<span class="highlight">military</span> posts) but as centers for the <span class="highlight"><span class="question2">diffusion</span></span> of Greek language, <span class="highlight">literature</span>, and thought, particularly <span class="highlight">through</span> libraries, as at Antioch (in modern <span class="highlight">Turkey</span>) and the most famous of all, at Alexandria in Egypt, which would be the finest in the world for the next thousand years.</p><p><span class="highlight">Second</span>, this internationalism spelled the end of the <span class="highlight">classical</span> Greek city-state - the unit of <span class="highlight">government</span> in <span class="highlight">ancient</span> Greece - and everything it stood for. Most city-states had been quite small in terms of citizenry, and this was considered to be a good thing. <span class="question4">The <span class="highlight">focus</span> of life was the agora, the open marketplace where assemblies could be held and where issues of the day, as well as more <span class="highlight">fundamental</span> topics such as the purpose of <span class="highlight">government</span> or the relationship between law and freedom</span>, could be discussed and decisions made by individuals in person. The <span class="highlight">philosopher</span> Plato (428-348 B.C.) felt that the <span class="highlight">ideal</span> city-state should have about 5,000 citizens, because to the Greeks it was important that everyone in the <span class="highlight">community</span> should know each other. In decision making, the whole body of citizens together would have the necessary knowledge in order generally to <span class="highlight">reach</span> the right decision, <span class="highlight">even</span> though the <span class="highlight">individual</span> might not be particularly qualified to decide. <span class="question6">The <span class="highlight">philosopher</span><span class="highlight">Aristotle</span></span> (384-322 B.C.), who lived at a time when the city-state system was <span class="question7">declining</span>, believed that a <span class="highlight">political</span> entity of 100,000 <span class="highlight">simply</span> would not be able to <span class="highlight">govern</span> itself.</p><p>This implied that the city-state was based on the idea that citizens were not specialists but had <span class="highlight">multiple</span> interests and talents - each a so-called jack-of-all-trades who could <span class="highlight">engage</span> in many areas of life and <span class="highlight">politics</span>. It implied a <span class="highlight">respect</span> for the wholeness of life and a <span class="highlight">consequent</span> dislike of <span class="highlight">specialization</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> It implied <span class="highlight">economic</span> and <span class="highlight">military</span> self-sufficiency. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> But with the <span class="highlight">development</span> of <span class="highlight">trade</span> and <span class="highlight">commerce</span> in Alexander's <span class="highlight">empire</span> came the growth of cities; it was no longer possible to be a jack-of-all-trades. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span> One now had to <span class="highlight">specialize</span>, and with <span class="highlight">specialization</span> came professionalism. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span> There were getting to be too many persons to know, an easily observable <span class="highlight">community</span> of interests was being replaced by a multiplicity of interests. The city-state was <span class="highlight">simply</span> too "small-time".</p><p>Third, Greek <span class="highlight">philosophy</span> was opened up to the <span class="highlight">philosophy</span> and <span class="highlight">religion</span> of the East. At the <span class="highlight"><span class="question9">peak</span></span> of the Greek city-state, <span class="highlight">religion</span> played an important part. Its gods - such as Zeus, father of the gods, and his wife Hera - were thought of very much as being like human beings but with superhuman abilities. Their worship was linked to the rituals connected with one's progress <span class="highlight">through</span> life - birth, marriage, and death - and with invoking protection against danger, making prophecies, and promoting <span class="highlight">healing</span>, rather than to any <span class="highlight">code</span> of <span class="highlight">behavior</span>. Nor was there much of a <span class="highlight">theory</span> of afterlife.</p><p><span class="highlight">Even</span> before Alexander's time, a life spent in the service of their city-state no longer seemed <span class="highlight">ideal</span> to Greeks. The Athenian <span class="highlight">philosopher</span> Socrates (470-399 B.C.) was the first person in Greece to <span class="highlight"><span class="question12">propose</span></span> a <span class="highlight">morality</span> based on <span class="highlight">individual</span><span class="highlight">conscience</span> rather than the demands of the <span class="highlight">state</span>, and for this he was accused of not believing in the city's gods and so corrupting the youth, and he was condemned to death. Greek <span class="highlight">philosophy</span> - or <span class="highlight">even</span> a <span class="highlight">focus</span> on <span class="highlight">conscience</span> - might <span class="highlight">complement</span><span class="highlight">religion</span> but was no <span class="highlight">substitute</span> for it, and this made Greeks receptive to the <span class="highlight">religious</span> systems of the Middle East, <span class="highlight">even</span> if they never adopted them completely. The <span class="highlight">combination</span> of the <span class="highlight">religious</span><span class="highlight">instinct</span> of Asia with the philosophic spirit of Greece <span class="highlight">spread</span><span class="highlight">across</span> the world in the <span class="highlight">era</span> after Alexander's death, blending the <span class="highlight">culture</span> of the Middle East with the <span class="highlight">culture</span> of Greece.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 1, Alexander the Great did which of the following?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.
