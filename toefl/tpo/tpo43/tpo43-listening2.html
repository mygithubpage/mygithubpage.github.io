lecture in a <span class="highlight">botany</span> class.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="9.61" data-time="5.51">[00:05.51]</span>Professor:It's autumn and as you know in most parts of the United States, the leaves on the trees are changing color from green to yellow, orange and lots of other colors. <span class="time" data-times="8.66" data-time="15.12">[00:15.12]</span>So this will be a great time to talk about how and why some of these leaves turn one color in <span class="highlight">particular</span> and that's bright red. <span class="time" data-times="12.31" data-time="23.78">[00:23.78]</span>Well, before we discuss why leaves turn red, first, let's, urn, look, I know this is very old <span class="highlight">material</span>, but just to play it safe, let's first go over why leaves are usually green. <span class="time" data-times="1.96" data-time="36.09">[00:36.09]</span>It's <span class="highlight">chlorophyll</span>, right?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.04" data-time="38.05">[00:38.05]</span>Leaves get their green color from <span class="highlight">chlorophyll</span>, the chemical that's <span class="highlight">responsible</span> for <span class="highlight">photosynthesis</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9.01" data-time="45.09">[00:45.09]</span>The <span class="highlight">chlorophyll</span> in the leaves collects energy from the Sun in the form of sunlight and it converts this energy into sugar which is food for the plant. <span class="time" data-times="3.86" data-time="54.1">[00:54.10]</span>It's <span class="highlight">chlorophyll</span> that makes leaves green most of the time. <span class="time" data-times="4.51" data-time="57.96">[00:57.96]</span>Now, the <span class="highlight">classic</span> explanation for why leaves change color is this.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.95" data-time="62.47">[01:02.47]</span>In autumn, the leaves start preparing for the winter and stop synthesizing new <span class="highlight">chlorophyll</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.57" data-time="68.42">[01:08.42]</span>Since <span class="highlight">chlorophyll</span> is <span class="highlight">sensitive</span> to sunlight and to cold temperatures both of which you get in autumn. <span class="time" data-times="6.41" data-time="74.99">[01:14.99]</span>The existing <span class="highlight">chlorophyll</span> in the leaves breaks down and since it's not been replaced by the new <span class="highlight">chlorophyll</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.61" data-time="81.4">[01:21.40]</span>The green color of the leaves <span class="highlight">gradually</span> fades away. <span class="time" data-times="4.96" data-time="85.01">[01:25.01]</span>As this happens, the other pigments present in the leaf become <span class="highlight">visible</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.62" data-time="89.97">[01:29.97]</span>According to the <span class="highlight">classic</span><span class="highlight">theory</span>, this is true for the red <span class="highlight">pigment</span> as well. <span class="time" data-times="5.41" data-time="94.59">[01:34.59]</span>It was there in the leaf all <span class="highlight">along</span> but it was hidden by the green <span class="highlight">chlorophyll</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.88" data-time="100">[01:40.00]</span>OK, so that's the <span class="highlight">classic</span> explanation and it's <span class="highlight">partially</span> right. <span class="time" data-times="2.21" data-time="104.88">[01:44.88]</span>Why do I say <span class="highlight">partially</span>?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.33" data-time="107.09">[01:47.09]</span>Well, it's probably true for pigments like yellow or orange, but it doesn't <span class="highlight">seem</span> to hold for the red <span class="highlight">pigment</span>. <span class="time" data-times="1.51" data-time="114.42">[01:54.42]</span>Let's back up a bit. <span class="time" data-times="3.41" data-time="115.93">[01:55.93]</span>Just what produces this red color in leaves?<span class="time" data-times="5.24" data-time="119.34">[01:59.34]</span>It's a red <span class="highlight">pigment</span> called anthocyanin.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.46" data-time="124.58">[02:04.58]</span>Here is where the <span class="highlight">classic</span> explanation doesn't <span class="highlight">seem</span> to <span class="highlight">apply</span> to red. <span class="time" data-times="6.77" data-time="129.04">[02:09.04]</span>What's interesting is that during the summer there was very little if any anthocyanin in the leaves. <span class="time" data-times="7.33" data-time="135.81">[02:15.81]</span>But in the weeks before a tree is about to <span class="highlight">drop</span> its leaves, the production of anthocyanins increases <span class="highlight">significantly</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.9" data-time="143.14">[02:23.14]</span>In other words, unlike those other pigments, anthocyanins are not just unmasked by the breakdown of <span class="highlight">chlorophyll</span> in autumn. <span class="time" data-times="3.41" data-time="152.04">[02:32.04]</span>They are actually created at this time.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.28" data-time="155.45">[02:35.45]</span>So that raises a question, why would a tree produce more anthocyanin just before dropping its leaves?<span class="time" data-times="5.4" data-time="162.73">[02:42.73]</span>Why does the tree spend so much of its resources doing this just before the leaves fall off?<span class="time" data-times="2.79" data-time="168.13">[02:48.13]</span>On the surface, that doesn't make <span class="highlight">sense</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.59" data-time="170.92">[02:50.92]</span>It'd be likes spending money to...l don't know...to have your old car repainted when you know the car's not going to last more than a <span class="highlight">couple</span> of months. <span class="time" data-times="4.14" data-time="179.51">[02:59.51]</span>All this <span class="highlight">extra</span> anthocyanin in the autumn seems like a <span class="highlight">waste</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5" data-time="183.65">[03:03.65]</span>But remember nature is very <span class="highlight">economical</span> with its resources. <span class="time" data-times="7.57" data-time="188.65">[03:08.65]</span>So that means anthocyanin must be serving some <span class="highlight">function</span> that's important for the tree. <span class="time" data-times="5.3" data-time="196.22">[03:16.22]</span>Today, there are some theories about what that <span class="highlight">function</span> might be.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.84" data-time="201.52">[03:21.52]</span>One of them involves <span class="highlight">predatory</span> insects; another involves <span class="highlight">fungi</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.64" data-time="206.36">[03:26.36]</span>You know, the more I read about these theories and the related research, it always created more questions for me than answers. <span class="time" data-times="5" data-time="215">[03:35.00]</span>So I was really glad to learn about a totally different <span class="highlight">theory</span>, a new one. <span class="time" data-times="4.4" data-time="220">[03:40.00]</span>It seems to come with research and <span class="highlight">data</span> that give a full explanation. <span class="time" data-times="1.6" data-time="224.4">[03:44.40]</span>So here it is.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.88" data-time="226">[03:46.00]</span>Remember I said the <span class="highlight">chlorophyll</span> breaks down?<span class="time" data-times="6.22" data-time="228.88">[03:48.88]</span>Well, in autumn, a whole lot of other chemical constituents of the leaf <span class="highlight">break</span> down as well. <span class="time" data-times="9.62" data-time="235.1">[03:55.10]</span>I don't mean they are totally destroyed 'cause actually they <span class="highlight">break</span> down into other different chemicals that the tree can reabsorb from the leaves and reuse later.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.74" data-time="244.72">[04:04.72]</span>Now, this reabsorption <span class="highlight">process</span> is very important for the tree and here is the key. <span class="time" data-times="7.49" data-time="250.46">[04:10.46]</span>It's <span class="highlight">sensitive</span> to light, meaning that too much <span class="highlight">exposure</span> to sunlight can <span class="highlight">interfere</span> with this <span class="highlight">process</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.1" data-time="257.95">[04:17.95]</span>So where does anthocyanin fit in here?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.84" data-time="261.05">[04:21.05]</span>Well, anthocyanin is more <span class="highlight">stable</span> than <span class="highlight">chlorophyll</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.88" data-time="264.89">[04:24.89]</span>It's not harmed as easily by the Sun or the cold. <span class="time" data-times="4.29" data-time="268.77">[04:28.77]</span>So it's still working long after the <span class="highlight">chlorophyll</span> breaks down. <span class="time" data-times="1.66" data-time="273.06">[04:33.06]</span>But what does it do?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.97" data-time="274.72">[04:34.72]</span>The <span class="highlight">theory</span> is that anthocyanin protects the reabsorption <span class="highlight">process</span> from the sunlight. <span class="time" data-times="11.05" data-time="280.69">[04:40.69]</span>For example, if you look closely at a red leaf on a tree, you'll notice that most of the red <span class="highlight">pigment</span> is on the upper side of the leaf, the side facing the sun. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="291.74">[04:51.74]</span>This new <span class="highlight">theory</span> suggests that what the anthocyanin is doing there on top is shielding the rest of the leaf from the sunlight, and more importantly, allowing those important chemicals to be reabsorbed by the tree.</p></p></article></section><div id="question"><div id="question1"><p>What is the main purpose of the lecture?</p><label class="my-label"><span>A.
