Yes, Laura.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.69" data-time="131.42">[02:11.42]</span>Student:Since you almost always get <span class="highlight">lightning</span> with thunderstorms, we can pick up VLF waves <span class="highlight">pretty</span> often, right?<span class="time" data-times="2.26" data-time="138.11">[02:18.11]</span>You just have to wait until there is a thunderstorm.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.63" data-time="140.37">[02:20.37]</span>Professor:Ah, do you? Have to wait?<span class="time" data-times="5.88" data-time="143">[02:23.00]</span>VLF receivers are very <span class="highlight">sensitive</span> and VLF waves travel very far. <span class="time" data-times="4.93" data-time="148.88">[02:28.88]</span>So we can pick up emissions from <span class="highlight">lightning</span> that's far away. <span class="time" data-times="9.3" data-time="153.81">[02:33.81]</span>So actually, you can <span class="highlight">pretty</span> much listen to them all the time because <span class="highlight">lightning</span> strikes Earth <span

data-time="178.53">[02:58.53]</span>Daytime isn't as good as night time, for example. <span class="time" data-times="6.26" data-time="182.33">[03:02.33]</span>And what's more, my <span

them is around <span class="highlight">sunset</span> or sunrise. <span class="time" data-times="3.92" data-time="194.22">[03:14.22]</span>That's when there're natural waveguides in the <span

class="time" data-times="2.2" data-time="200.13">[03:20.13]</span>Professor:Yes, a waveguide. <span class="time" data-times="5.87" data-time="202.33">[03:22.33]</span>Usually it refers to a <span

waveguides also <span class="highlight">occur</span> naturally. <span class="time" data-times="3.77" data-time="212">[03:32.00]</span>They make a <span class="highlight">path</span> for radio waves to

the Sun is rising or <span class="highlight">setting</span>, which makes sunrise and <span class="highlight">sunset</span> good times to pick up VLF emissions.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="14.57" data-time="226.02">[03:46.02]</span>Now, there are a few different sounds that you can hear on a VLF <span class="highlight">receiver</span>, because when <span class="highlight">lightning</span> strikes, the radio waves travel different distances and in different ways before they <span class="highlight">reach</span> the <span class="highlight">receiver</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.13" data-time="240.59">[04:00.59]</span>Some really interesting ones are called whistlers. <span class="time" data-times="10.48" data-time="244.72">[04:04.72]</span>Whistlers come from lightning-generated radio waves that leave earth's <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span> and travel into earth's

well, we call them whistlers because they <span class="highlight">sound</span> like slowly descending tones. <span class="time" data-times="2.86" data-time="265.52">[04:25.52]</span>And no two whistlers are <span class="highlight">alike</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.95" data-time="268.38">[04:28.38]</span>To me, they're the most <span

class="time" data-times="5.83" data-time="276.55">[04:36.55]</span>Tweeks are the result of VLF waves that have travelled a long distance <span class="highlight">through</span> the waveguides. <span class="time" data-times="9.38" data-time="282.38">[04:42.38]</span>They produce a chirpy <span class="highlight">sound</span> because the higher <span class="highlight">frequency</span> parts of the

data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor mainly discuss?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Methods of converting radio waves into sound waves</p><p>B. Features of different types of electromagnetic radiation</p><p>C. The various paths that very-low-frequency waves follow on Earth</p><p>D. The emission and detection of very-low-frequency waves</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>At the beginning, the professor said that he wanted to talk about low frequencies of radio waves. Then the students asked to talk about the difference between sound waves and radio waves. The professor said that this was a good start and then began to speak differently. After completing the difference, the professor started to talk about how to detect, use VLF to detect, so choose D, the article has been talking about low frequency waves, only in the final mention of two different electromagnetic whistlers and tweeks (note that the sound wave is not an electromagnetic wave )</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is one difference between radio waves and sound waves that the professor emphasizes?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Radio waves have a lower frequency.</p><p>B. Water stops radio waves from spreading but does not stop sound waves</p><p>C. Unlike sound waves, radio waves can travel outside Earth's atmosphere.</p><p>D. Naturally occurring radio waves are difficult to detect on Earth at night.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Asked about the difference between radio waves and sound waves here, the professor mentioned that radio waves can travel anywhere, corresponding to option C.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What explanation does the professor give for the constant occurrence of VLF emissions on Earth?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. At any given time, some part of the world is experiencing sunrise or sunset</p><p>B. Waveguides constantly form in the atmosphere.</p><p>C. Earth's magnetosphere directs interplanetary waves toward Earth's surface.</p><p>D. Lightning occurs constantly on the planet.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The main source of VLF release mentioned here is lightning, which can often be heard on the earth, corresponding to option D.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why are sunrise and sunset the best times to listen to VLF signals?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Because thunderstorms are most likely to occur then</p><p>B. Because radio waves travel through natural waveguides then</p><p>C. Because higher-frequency signals are less active then</p><p>D. Because temperatures are not extremely high or low then</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The professor here mentioned his colleague's statement that the best time to hear the VLF is in the evening or the sunrise. At this time, the local atmosphere contains a natural electromagnetic waveguide, corresponding to Option B.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor discuss whistlers and tweeks?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To illustrate that the path a VLF wave travels can affect the sound it makes on a radio</p><p>B. To point out that VLF waves can affect the sounds heard on a household or car radio</p><p>C. To describe how a colleague discovered the origin of VLF waves</p><p>D. To clarify the difference between VLF waves and other kinds of waves</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>Here we need to combine context reversal. Whistlers and tweeks are two examples to explain that the radio mentioned above can hear a few different sounds, and then explain the difference between whistlers and tweeks in detail. Corresponds to option A.</p></div></div><div class="replay" id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor imply when he says this:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. He needs to think before he can answer the woman's question.</p><p>B. The woman has underestimated how often VLF waves can be detected.</p><p>C. The woman does not realize that waiting for a thunderstorm can take a long time.</p><p>D. The woman does not understand the relationship between thunderstorms and lightning.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Students asked: Is it right? We need to wait for a thunderstorm to get the VLF wave, but the professor said, do we really need to wait? Obviously throwing doubts, in fact, we do not need to wait, then he explained that because the ultra-low frequency receiver is very sensitive, and VLF waves travel far. Therefore, we can extract the VLF wave from lightning in the distance. So what the professor said indicates that students underestimated our ability to detect VLF waves, so the B option is the correct answer.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
