              <span class="time" data-times="4.35" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator:Listen to part of a lecture in a physics class. <span class="time" data-times="5.8" data-time="4.35">[00:04.35]</span>The professor has been discussing <span class="underline">electromagnetic</span> waves.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.16" data-time="10.15">[00:10.15]</span>Professor:So are there any questions before we continue our discussion of different types of <span class="underline">electromagnetic</span> waves?<span class="time" data-times="7.29" data-time="16.31">[00:16.31]</span>Um, today, we'll <span class="underline">focus</span> on radio waves, and <span class="underline">specifically</span>, very low <span class="underline">frequency</span> radio waves. <span class="time" data-times="1.9" data-time="23.6">[00:23.60]</span>Yes, Tim.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.85" data-time="25.5">[00:25.50]</span>Student:Are you going to talk at all about the <span class="underline">difference</span> between radio waves and <span class="underline">sound</span> waves?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.73" data-time="29.35">[00:29.35]</span>Professor:Uh, Ok. That might be a good place to start actually. <span class="time" data-times="3.27" data-time="33.08">[00:33.08]</span> <span class="underline">Sound</span> waves are <span class="underline">mechanical</span> in nature, right?<span class="time" data-times="7.9" data-time="36.35">[00:36.35]</span> They can only <span class="underline">originate</span> and <span class="underline">spread</span> in places where there's some <span class="underline"><span class="underline">dense</span></span> <span class="underline">physical</span> <span class="underline">medium</span>, like <span class="underline">atmosphere</span> or water. <span class="time" data-times="6.01" data-time="44.25">[00:44.25]</span>They result from changes in <span class="underline">pressure</span> in that <span class="underline">medium</span>, like changes in <span class="underline">air</span> <span class="underline">pressure</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9.07" data-time="50.26">[00:50.26]</span>So they can't travel <span class="underline">through</span> a <span class="underline">vacuum</span>, where there is no <span class="underline"><span class="underline">dense</span></span> <span class="underline">physical</span> <span class="underline">medium</span>, which is why they can't travel <span class="underline">through</span> <span class="underline">interplanetary</span> <span class="underline">space</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.88" data-time="59.33">[00:59.33]</span>Radio waves, on the other hand, are fundamentally different from <span class="underline">sound</span> waves. <span class="time" data-times="2.59" data-time="64.21">[01:04.21]</span>They are <span class="underline">electromagnetic</span>. <span class="time" data-times="17.21" data-time="66.8">[01:06.80]</span>They result from oscillations of the <span class="underline">electromagnetic</span> <span class="underline">field</span> and don't need a <span class="underline">physical</span> <span class="underline">medium</span>, so they, like other types of <span class="underline">electromagnetic</span> wave, can travel basically anywhere, <span class="underline">through</span> a <span class="underline">vacuum</span>, or <span class="underline">through</span> <span class="underline">atmosphere</span> or water.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.51" data-time="84.01">[01:24.01]</span>Now, radio waves can be detected. <span class="time" data-times="22.52" data-time="86.52">[01:26.52]</span>For example, very low <span class="underline">frequency</span> radio waves can be detected with a <span class="underline">special</span> type of radio <span class="underline">receiver</span> called a very low <span class="underline">frequency</span> radio or VLF radio, which can pick up radio waves with very low frequencies, from 3 to 30 kilohertz, which aren't really picked up by a <span class="underline">regular</span> <span class="underline">household</span> or car radio. <span class="time" data-times="7.05" data-time="109.04">[01:49.04]</span>So VLF radios pick up VLF radio waves and <span class="underline">convert</span> them to sounds we can hear.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="15.33" data-time="116.09">[01:56.09]</span>Urn, on Earth, the main <span class="underline">source</span> of naturally occurring VLF emissions is <span class="underline">lightning</span>, which generates a <span class="underline">pulse</span> of radio waves every time it flashes. Yes, Laura.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.69" data-time="131.42">[02:11.42]</span>Student:Since you almost always get <span class="underline">lightning</span> with thunderstorms, we can pick up VLF waves <span class="underline">pretty</span> often, right?<span class="time" data-times="2.26" data-time="138.11">[02:18.11]</span>You just have to wait until there is a thunderstorm.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.63" data-time="140.37">[02:20.37]</span>Professor:Ah, do you? Have to wait?<span class="time" data-times="5.88" data-time="143">[02:23.00]</span>VLF receivers are very <span class="underline">sensitive</span> and VLF waves travel very far. <span class="time" data-times="4.93" data-time="148.88">[02:28.88]</span>So we can pick up emissions from <span class="underline">lightning</span> that's far away. <span class="time" data-times="9.3" data-time="153.81">[02:33.81]</span>So actually, you can <span class="underline">pretty</span> much listen to them all the time because <span class="underline">lightning</span> strikes Earth <span class="underline">constantly</span>, about a hundred times per <span class="underline">second</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9.64" data-time="163.11">[02:43.11]</span> <span class="underline">Even</span> if there is no <span class="underline">lightning</span> where you are, with a VLF radio, you can hear the crackling from storms that are thousands of kilometers away.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.78" data-time="172.75">[02:52.75]</span>However, some times of day are better than others for picking up VLF waves. <span class="time" data-times="3.8" data-time="178.53">[02:58.53]</span>Daytime isn't as good as night time, for example. <span class="time" data-times="6.26" data-time="182.33">[03:02.33]</span>And what's more, my <span class="underline">colleague</span> Denis Gallagher says, and in my opinion, he's right. <span class="time" data-times="5.63" data-time="188.59">[03:08.59]</span>He says the best time to listen for them is around <span class="underline">sunset</span> or sunrise. <span class="time" data-times="3.92" data-time="194.22">[03:14.22]</span>That's when there're natural waveguides in the <span class="underline">local</span> <span class="underline">atmosphere</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.99" data-time="198.14">[03:18.14]</span>Student:Did you say waveguide?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.2" data-time="200.13">[03:20.13]</span>Professor:Yes, a waveguide. <span class="time" data-times="5.87" data-time="202.33">[03:22.33]</span>Usually it refers to a <span class="underline">device</span>, like a metal <span class="underline">conductor</span> that's used to guide and direct waves. <span class="time" data-times="3.8" data-time="208.2">[03:28.20]</span>But waveguides also <span class="underline">occur</span> naturally. <span class="time" data-times="3.77" data-time="212">[03:32.00]</span>They make a <span class="underline">path</span> for radio waves to follow in our <span class="underline">atmosphere</span>. <span class="time" data-times="10.25" data-time="215.77">[03:35.77]</span>These natural waveguides <span class="underline">occur</span> when the Sun is rising or <span class="underline">setting</span>, which makes sunrise and <span class="underline">sunset</span> good times to pick up VLF emissions.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="14.57" data-time="226.02">[03:46.02]</span>Now, there are a few different sounds that you can hear on a VLF <span class="underline">receiver</span>, because when <span class="underline">lightning</span> strikes, the radio waves travel different distances and in different ways before they <span class="underline">reach</span> the <span class="underline">receiver</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.13" data-time="240.59">[04:00.59]</span>Some really interesting ones are called whistlers. <span class="time" data-times="10.48" data-time="244.72">[04:04.72]</span>Whistlers come from lightning-generated radio waves that leave earth's <span class="underline">atmosphere</span> and travel into earth's magnetosphere before bouncing back down. <span class="time" data-times="10.32" data-time="255.2">[04:15.20]</span>Not all radio waves do this and the <span class="underline">sound</span> they make, well, we call them whistlers because they <span class="underline">sound</span> like slowly descending tones. <span class="time" data-times="2.86" data-time="265.52">[04:25.52]</span>And no two whistlers are <span class="underline">alike</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.95" data-time="268.38">[04:28.38]</span>To me, they're the most <span class="underline">intriguing</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.22" data-time="272.33">[04:32.33]</span>Another interesting <span class="underline">sound</span> is the tweek. <span class="time" data-times="5.83" data-time="276.55">[04:36.55]</span>Tweeks are the result of VLF waves that have travelled a long distance <span class="underline">through</span> the waveguides. <span class="time" data-times="9.38" data-time="282.38">[04:42.38]</span>They produce a chirpy <span class="underline">sound</span> because the higher <span class="underline">frequency</span> parts of the wave <span class="underline">reach</span> the radio <span class="underline">receiver</span> before the <span class="underline">lower</span> <span class="underline">frequency</span> parts. <span class="time" data-times="3.51" data-time="291.76">[04:51.76]</span>The entire wave is still considered very low <span class="underline">frequency</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="295.27">[04:55.27]</span>It's just that some parts of the wave have <span class="underline">lower</span> frequencies than others, OK?</p>
