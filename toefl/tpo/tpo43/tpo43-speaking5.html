I don't think we can put together next month's issue. There just aren't enough good photos.</p><p>Woman:It's getting harder and harder to put together an issue.</p><p>Man:Yeah. And this month is the worst ever! I don't get it. I mean, students are submitting lots of photographs, but I think we've only got fifteen that are worth publishing. And we can't print the magazine with only fifteen photographs.</p><p>Woman:Well, maybe we're being too selective. What if we use photos that maybe aren't great, but...</p><p>Man:But that aren't horrible?</p><p>Woman:Right. I mean some of these photographs we get from beginning photographers may not be the best. But if we lowered our standards just a bit, we'd have a lot more photos to publish.</p><p>Man:Sure. But we'd have to be careful. We don't want to get a reputation for publishing low-quality work.</p><p>Woman:Well...maybe...you know, maybe we are just publishing too frequently. What if we stop publishing every month and instead, you know, if we just published every two months, we'd have a lot more submissions to choose from so we could pick and choose and still publish only the good ones.</p><p>Man:I guess. But people on campus sort of expect us to publish every month. I mean, we are Campus Photo Monthly, aren't we?</p></article><section id="question"><h4>Question</h4><p>The speakers discuss two possible solutions to their problem. Briefly summarize the problem. Then state which solution you prefer and explain why. </p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>In this conversation, the man thinks he and Barbara are having a hard time dealing with the problem that there aren't enough good photos to publish on the magazine. He said only fifteen photos are worth publishing. And the woman offers him two possible solutions. One solution is that they can just lower their standards a little, maybe they are too selective. The other one is to publish the magazine every two month rather than monthly. And if it were my choice, I would choose the former one, because they called the photography magazine as Campus Photo Monthly. So it should be published monthly, and other students are looking forward to read their magazines. Although lowering their standards might made the man feeling worried, at least it'll guarantee there are enough good photos to publish.</p></article></div></main></body></html>
