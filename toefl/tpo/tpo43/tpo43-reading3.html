            <span id="arrow">
            </span>The cold Humboldt <span class="underline">Current</span> of the <span class="underline">Pacific</span> Ocean flows toward the <span class="underline">equator</span> <span class="underline">along</span> the coasts of Ecuador and Peru in South America. When the <span class="underline">current</span><span class="light">approaches</span> the <span class="underline">equator</span>, the westward-flowing <span class="underline">trade</span> winds cause nutrient-rich cold water <span class="underline">along</span> the <span class="underline">coast</span> to rise from deeper depths to more <span class="underline">shallow</span> ones. This upwelling of water has <span class="underline">economic</span> repercussions. Fishing, especially for anchovies, is a <span class="underline">major</span> <span class="underline">local</span> <span class="underline">industry</span>.</p>
          <p>Every year during the months of December and January, a weak, warm <span class="underline">countercurrent</span> replaces the <span class="underline">normally</span> cold coastal waters. Without the upwelling of nutrients from below to feed the fish, fishing comes to a standstill. Fishers in this <span class="underline">region</span> have known the <span class="underline">phenomenon</span> for hundreds of years. In fact, this is the time of year they traditionally set aside to <span class="underline">tend</span> to their equipment and await the return of cold water. The residents of the <span class="underline">region</span> have <span class="underline">given</span> this <span class="underline">phenomenon</span> the name of El Nifio, which is Spanish for "the child," because it occurs at about the time of the celebration of birth of the Christ child.</p>
          <p>While the warm-water <span class="underline">countercurrent</span> usually lasts for two months or less, there are occasions when the disruption to the normal flow lasts for many months. In these situations, water temperatures are raised not just <span class="underline">along</span> the <span class="underline">coast</span>, but for thousands of kilometers offshore. Over the last few decades, the <span class="underline">term</span> El Nifio has come to be used to <span class="underline">describe</span> these exceptionally strong episodes and not the <span class="underline">annual</span> event. During the past 60 years, at <span class="underline">least</span> ten El Nifios have been observed. Not only do El Nifios <span class="underline">affect</span> the <span class="underline">temperature</span> of the <span class="underline">equatorial</span> <span class="underline">Pacific</span>, but the strongest of them <span class="underline">impact</span> global weather.</p>
          <p>The processes that <span class="underline">interact</span> to produce an El Nifio <span class="underline">involve</span> conditions all <span class="underline">across</span> the <span class="underline">Pacific</span>, not just in the waters off South America. Over 60 years ago, Sir Gilbert Walker, a British scientist, discovered a connection between surface <span class="underline">pressure</span> readings at weather stations on the eastern and western sides of the <span class="underline">Pacific</span>. He <span class="underline">noted</span> that a rise in <span class="underline">atmospheric</span> <span class="underline">pressure</span> in the eastern <span class="underline">Pacific</span> is usually accompanied by a fall in <span class="underline">pressure</span> in the western <span class="underline">Pacific</span> and vice versa. He called this seesaw <span class="underline">pattern</span> the Southern Oscillation. It was later realized that there is a close link between El Nifio and the Southern Oscillation. In fact, the link between the two is so great that they are often referred to jointly as ENSO (El Nifio-Southern Oscillation).</p>
          <p>During a <span class="underline">typical</span> year, the eastern <span class="underline">Pacific</span> has a higher <span class="underline">pressure</span> than the western <span class="underline">Pacific</span> does. This east-to-west <span class="underline">pressure</span> <span class="underline">gradient</span> enhances the <span class="underline">trade</span> winds over the <span class="underline">equatorial</span> waters. This results in a warm surface <span class="underline">current</span> that moves east to west at the <span class="underline">equator</span>. The western <span class="underline">Pacific</span> develops a thick, warm <span class="underline">layer</span> of water while the eastern <span class="underline">Pacific</span> has the cold Humboldt <span class="underline">Current</span> enhanced by upwelling. However, in other years the Southern Oscillation, for unknown reasons, swings in the <span class="underline">opposite</span> direction, <span class="underline">dramatically</span> changing the usual conditions described above, with <span class="underline">pressure</span> increasing in the western <span class="underline">Pacific</span> and decreasing in the eastern <span class="underline">Pacific</span>. This change in the <span class="underline">pressure</span> <span class="underline">gradient</span> causes the <span class="underline">trade</span> winds to weaken or, in some cases, to <span class="underline">reverse</span>. This then causes the warm water in the western <span class="underline">Pacific</span> to flow eastward, increasing sea-surface temperatures in the central and eastern <span class="underline">Pacific</span>. The eastward <span class="underline">shift</span> signals the beginning of an El Nifio.</p>
          <p>Scientists try to document as many past El Nifio events as possible by piecing together bits of historical <span class="underline">evidence</span>, such as sea-surface <span class="underline">temperature</span> records, daily observations of <span class="underline">atmospheric</span> <span class="underline">pressure</span> and <span class="underline">rainfall</span>, fisheries' records from South America, and the writings of Spanish colonists dating back to the fifteenth <span class="underline">century</span>. From such historical <span class="underline">evidence</span> we know that El Nifios have occurred as far back as records go. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> It would <span class="underline">seem</span> that they are becoming more frequent. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> Records <span class="underline">indicate</span> that during the sixteenth <span class="underline">century</span>, an El Nifio occurred on <span class="underline">average</span> every six years. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span> <span class="underline">Evidence</span> gathered over the past few decades indicates that El Nifios are now occurring on <span class="underline">average</span> a little over every two years. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span> <span class="underline">Even</span> more alarming is the fact that they <span class="underline">appear</span> to be getting stronger. The 1997-1998 El Nifio brought <span class="underline">copious</span> and damaging <span class="underline">rainfall</span> to the southern United States, from California to Florida. Snowstorms in the northeast <span class="underline">portion</span> of the United States were more frequent and <span class="underline">intense</span> than in most years.</p>
