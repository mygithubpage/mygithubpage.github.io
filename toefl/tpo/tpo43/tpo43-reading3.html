When the <span class="highlight">current</span><span class="highlight question1">approaches</span> the <span class="highlight">equator</span>, the westward-flowing <span class="highlight">trade</span> winds cause nutrient-rich cold water <span class="highlight">along</span> the <span class="highlight">coast</span> to rise from deeper depths to more <span class="highlight">shallow</span> ones. This upwelling of water has <span class="highlight">economic</span> repercussions. Fishing, especially for anchovies, is a <span class="highlight">major</span><span class="highlight">local</span><span class="highlight">industry</span>.</p><p>Every year during the months of December and January, a weak, warm <span class="highlight">countercurrent</span> replaces the <span class="highlight">normally</span> cold coastal waters. Without the upwelling of nutrients from below to feed the fish, fishing comes to a standstill. Fishers in this <span class="highlight">region</span> have known the <span class="highlight">phenomenon</span> for hundreds of years. In fact, this is the time of year they traditionally set aside to <span class="highlight">tend</span> to their equipment and await the return of cold water. The residents of the <span class="highlight">region</span> have <span class="highlight">given</span> this <span class="highlight">phenomenon</span> the name of El Nifio, which is Spanish for "the child," because it occurs at about the time of the celebration of birth of the Christ child.</p><p>While the warm-water <span class="highlight">countercurrent</span> usually lasts for two months or less, there are occasions when the disruption to the normal flow lasts for many months. In these situations, water temperatures are raised not just <span class="highlight">along</span> the <span class="highlight">coast</span>, but for thousands of kilometers offshore. Over the last few decades, the <span class="highlight">term</span> El Nifio has come to be used to <span class="highlight">describe</span> these <span class="question4">exceptionally</span> strong episodes and not the <span class="highlight">annual</span> event. During the past 60 years, at <span class="highlight">least</span> ten El Nifios have been observed. Not only do El Nifios <span class="highlight">affect</span> the <span class="highlight">temperature</span> of the <span class="highlight">equatorial</span><span class="highlight">Pacific</span>, but the strongest of them <span class="highlight">impact</span> global weather.</p><p>The processes that <span class="highlight">interact</span> to produce an El Nifio <span class="highlight">involve</span> conditions all <span class="highlight">across</span> the <span class="highlight">Pacific</span>, not just in the waters off South America. Over 60 years ago, Sir Gilbert Walker, a British scientist, discovered a connection between surface <span class="highlight">pressure</span> readings at weather stations on the eastern and western sides of the <span class="highlight">Pacific</span>. He <span class="highlight">noted</span> that a rise in <span class="highlight">atmospheric</span><span class="highlight">pressure</span> in the eastern <span class="highlight">Pacific</span><span class="question6">is usually accompanied by</span> a fall in <span class="highlight">pressure</span> in the western <span class="highlight">Pacific</span> and vice versa. He called this seesaw <span class="highlight">pattern</span> the Southern Oscillation. It was later realized that there is a close link between El Nifio and the Southern Oscillation. In fact, the link between the two is so great that they are often referred to <span class="question7">jointly</span> as ENSO (El Nifio-Southern Oscillation).</p><p>During a <span class="highlight">typical</span> year, the eastern <span class="highlight">Pacific</span> has a higher <span class="highlight">pressure</span> than the western <span class="highlight">Pacific</span> does. This east-to-west <span class="highlight">pressure</span><span class="highlight">gradient</span> enhances the <span class="highlight">trade</span> winds over the <span class="highlight">equatorial</span> waters. This results in a warm surface <span class="highlight">current</span> that moves east to west at the <span class="highlight">equator</span>. The western <span class="highlight">Pacific</span> develops a thick, warm <span class="highlight">layer</span> of water while the eastern <span class="highlight">Pacific</span> has the cold Humboldt <span class="highlight">Current</span> enhanced by upwelling. However, in other years the Southern Oscillation, for unknown reasons, swings in the <span class="highlight">opposite</span> direction, <span class="highlight">dramatically</span> changing the usual conditions described above, with <span class="highlight">pressure</span> increasing in the western <span class="highlight">Pacific</span> and decreasing in the eastern <span class="highlight">Pacific</span>. This change in the <span class="highlight">pressure</span><span class="highlight">gradient</span> causes the <span class="highlight">trade</span> winds to weaken or, in some cases, to <span class="highlight">reverse</span>. This then causes the warm water in the western <span class="highlight">Pacific</span> to flow eastward, increasing sea-surface temperatures in the central and eastern <span class="highlight">Pacific</span>. The eastward <span class="highlight">shift</span> signals the beginning of an El Nifio.</p><p>Scientists try to document as many past El Nifio events as possible by piecing together bits of historical <span class="highlight">evidence</span>, such as sea-surface <span class="highlight">temperature</span> records, daily observations of <span class="highlight">atmospheric</span><span class="highlight">pressure</span> and <span class="highlight">rainfall</span>, fisheries' records from South America, and the writings of Spanish colonists dating back to the fifteenth <span class="highlight">century</span>. From such historical <span class="highlight">evidence</span> we know that El Nifios have occurred as far back as records go. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> It would <span class="highlight">seem</span> that they are becoming more frequent. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> Records <span class="highlight">indicate</span> that during the sixteenth <span class="highlight">century</span>, an El Nifio occurred on <span class="highlight">average</span> every six years. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span><span class="highlight">Evidence</span> gathered over the past few decades indicates that El Nifios are now occurring on <span class="highlight">average</span> a little over every two years. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span><span class="highlight">Even</span> more alarming is the fact that they <span class="highlight">appear</span> to be getting stronger. The 1997-1998 El Nifio brought <span class="highlight">copious</span> and damaging <span class="highlight">rainfall</span> to the southern United States, from California to Florida. <span class="question12">Snowstorms in the northeast <span class="highlight">portion</span> of the United States were more frequent and <span class="highlight">intense</span> than in most years.</span></p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">approaches</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. nears</p><p>B. crosses</p><p>C. travels along</p><p>D. leaves</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The approach is near, near, and corresponds to option A, near.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 1, what happens when the Humboldt Current interacts with westward flowing trade winds?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.
