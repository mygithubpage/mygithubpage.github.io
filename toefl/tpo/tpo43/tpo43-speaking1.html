Actually, I'd like to make some changes to keep fit. As a result, the goal I'd like to achieve in the near future is to keep doing certain exercises at least once a week. Firstly, I need to start with some easy sports, like jogging. These kinds of sports don't need much space and many facilities to do, all you need is just a pair of sneakers. Then, after several months of regular jogging, I will begin to show up in the gym to join the aerobics classes. In this stage, I will need greater amount of exercises and more professional training. Finally, I'd like to book a badminton court at least twice a month to playing badminton with my family members, which can strength the family bonds as well. It is not easy to achieve this goal for me actually, because I have heavy workloads every day. But once I decided to make a difference, I will spare my time for sports. Because for me, it's really important to improve my health condition.</p></article></section></main></body></html>
