of the lecture in a children's <span class="highlight">literature</span> class. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.16" data-time="6.31">[00:06.31]</span>Professor:Today we'll start looking at the most important children's book authors of the twentieth <span class="highlight">century</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.38" data-time="11.47">[00:11.47]</span>And I'd like to start with an author illustrator whom some of you probably grew up reading: Dr. Seuss. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.19" data-time="17.85">[00:17.85]</span>His actual name was Theodor Seuss Geisel. <span class="time" data-times="13.2" data-time="22.04">[00:22.04]</span>Geisel's work was hugely <span class="highlight">popular</span> among beginning readers and their parents, but it wasn't always considered <span class="highlight">literature</span> or subjected to serious <span class="highlight">academic</span> inquiry until <span class="highlight">relatively</span> recently. <span class="time" data-times="8.18" data-time="35.24">[00:35.24]</span>In fact, not only weren't his books considered <span class="highlight">literature</span>, but they weren't always considered good school books. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="14.03" data-time="43.42">[00:43.42]</span>In the late 1950s and <span class="highlight">even</span><span class="highlight">through</span> the 60s, US teachers resisted Seuss's books because they perceived them as having a <span class="highlight">comic</span> book style...fun, maybe, but not...not <span class="highlight">appropriate</span> for the classroom. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.91" data-time="57.45">[00:57.45]</span>None of Geisel's books individually won him a Pulitzer <span class="highlight">Prize</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.87" data-time="61.36">[01:01.36]</span>And he didn't receive any top children's <span class="highlight">literary</span> awards either. <span class="time" data-times="13.59" data-time="65.23">[01:05.23]</span>Although the Pulitzer <span class="highlight">Prize</span><span class="highlight">committee</span> did give him a citation in 1984 for his...uh..."<span class="highlight">special</span><span class="highlight">contribution</span> over nearly half a <span class="highlight">century</span> to the education and enjoyment of America's children and their parents." <span class="time" data-times="3.86" data-time="78.82">[01:18.82]</span>But again, that wasn't until 1984. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.72" data-time="82.68">[01:22.68]</span>Perhaps one <span class="highlight">reason</span> his books weren't taken seriously is that <span class="highlight">even</span> though they often <span class="highlight">rhyme</span>, you wouldn't call him a great poet. <span class="time" data-times="2.61" data-time="90.4">[01:30.40]</span>Geisel's <span class="highlight">rhyme</span> schemes are very simple. <span class="time" data-times="8.47" data-time="93.01">[01:33.01]</span>And often, to make things <span class="highlight">rhyme</span>, he used silly names for his <span class="highlight">imaginary</span> creatures, like the Grinch and Sneetches. <span class="time" data-times="9.22" data-time="101.48">[01:41.48]</span>In fact, one book features 34 pairs of rhymed words, but only eight of those pairs <span class="highlight">consist</span><span class="highlight">entirely</span> of real words. <span class="time" data-times="2.76" data-time="110.7">[01:50.70]</span>The rest are made-up words. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.91" data-time="113.46">[01:53.46]</span>Geisel also illustrated his own books and created a lot of highly memorable characters from a <span class="highlight">visual</span> standpoint. <span class="time" data-times="6.94" data-time="120.37">[02:00.37]</span>Yet as far as his <span class="highlight">artistic</span><span class="highlight">talent</span>, no one's ever called him a great artist or a great illustrator. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.78" data-time="127.31">[02:07.31]</span>For his human characters, he <span class="highlight">pretty</span> much drew the same face over and over. <span class="time" data-times="3.87" data-time="132.09">[02:12.09]</span>Except for <span class="highlight">minor</span> accessories, all the people in his books look the same. <span class="time" data-times="4.21" data-time="135.96">[02:15.96]</span>Not exactly something you'd be encouraged to do in art school. <span class="time" data-times="6.76" data-time="140.17">[02:20.17]</span>And the way he drew <span class="highlight">even</span> nonhuman characters was dismissed by many critics as being overly simplistic. <span class="time" data-times="5.34" data-time="146.93">[02:26.93]</span>His landscapes, on the other hand, they are simple but they are also extremely clever. <span class="time" data-times="7.18" data-time="152.27">[02:32.27]</span>He had this uncanny knack for creating the <span class="highlight">illusion</span> of great distance with some very simple shapes and lines. <span class="time" data-times="3.06" data-time="159.45">[02:39.45]</span>But what about from a pedagogical standpoint? </p><p><span class="time" data-times="12.89" data-time="162.51">[02:42.51]</span>Well, let's <span class="highlight">consider</span> Geisel's most famous book: The Cat in the Hat Now, in a way, this book, The Cat in the Hat, captures the <span class="highlight">essence</span> of Geisel's <span class="highlight">particular</span><span class="highlight">genius</span> as a children's author. <span class="time" data-times="8.98" data-time="175.4">[02:55.40]</span>Geisel actually wrote it in <span class="highlight">response</span> to an article written in 1954 by an acclaimed novelist named John Hersey. <span class="time" data-times="7.95" data-time="184.38">[03:04.38]</span>In this article, Hersey criticized the textbooks being used in <span class="highlight">elementary</span> schools to teach children to read. <span class="time" data-times="4.1" data-time="192.33">[03:12.33]</span>He called the books 'boring, contrived, and <span class="highlight">utterly</span> humorless'. <span class="time" data-times="5.28" data-time="196.43">[03:16.43]</span>After seeing Hersey's article, Geisel must have wondered what made the books so <span class="highlight">dull</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.26" data-time="201.71">[03:21.71]</span>And one thing he found was they use only words from the Dolch <span class="highlight">List</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.88" data-time="206.97">[03:26.97]</span>The Dolch <span class="highlight">List</span> contained a few hundred <span class="highlight">common</span> sight words, words like, well, cat and hat. <span class="time" data-times="7.47" data-time="213.85">[03:33.85]</span>At the time, the Dolch <span class="highlight">List</span> was widely adhered to by publishers of textbooks for beginning readers. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.1" data-time="221.32">[03:41.32]</span>Well, using only words from the Dolch <span class="highlight">List</span>, Geisel tapped into his <span class="highlight">fertile</span> imagination. <span class="time" data-times="12.74" data-time="227.42">[03:47.42]</span>And the result was an incredibly funny and <span class="highlight">engaging</span> storyline about a talking cat that convinces a brother and sister to let him make a huge <span class="highlight">mess</span> in their house while their mother is away. <span class="time" data-times="6.99" data-time="240.16">[04:00.16]</span>Another <span class="highlight">character</span>, a talking fish, tries to warn the children that they'll be blamed for the cat's <span class="highlight">crazy</span> antics. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.33" data-time="247.15">[04:07.15]</span>You can really feel the <span class="highlight">tension</span> building up in those kids as the cat makes the house messier and messier. <span class="time" data-times="3.05" data-time="253.48">[04:13.48]</span><span class="highlight">Ultimately</span> the house gets straightened up in the nick of time. <span class="time" data-times="7.54" data-time="256.53">[04:16.53]</span>And the kids are left speechless when their mom shows up and casually asks if anything interesting happened in her <span class="highlight">absence</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.84" data-time="264.07">[04:24.07]</span>The kids, and <span class="highlight">presumably</span>, Geisel's readers are left thinking: Should they tell the truth?<span class="time" data-times="2.99" data-time="270.91">[04:30.91]</span>And that's where the book ends. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="273.9">[04:33.90]</span><span class="highlight">Brilliant</span>! There aren't too many authors who can set up a <span class="highlight">moral</span><span class="highlight">dilemma</span> like this and then get children to think about it for themselves. </p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the lecture mainly about?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.
