Explain why.</p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>Some people may believe that they only attend college part-time, but I disagree. I don't understand how university students can expect to learn anything if they don't attend colleges for full-time. First, in college they gain the benefit of the professor's knowledge preferentially. The best professors do more than just go over the material in the textbooks. Also, attending colleges on any subject teaches more than just facts. It teaches students how to learn, how to absorb information and then apply what they've learned to other situations. Personal experience can help people learn about themselves and the world outside the classroom, but when it comes to learning about academic subjects, students need to be in college better for a longer time. At last, if you just attend college for part-time, then you will miss important events and chances to make friends. It is hard to keep the same pace with others. So, I will choose to attend college for full-time.</p></article></div></main></body></html>
