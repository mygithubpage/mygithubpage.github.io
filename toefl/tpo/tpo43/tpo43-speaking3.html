          <h4 class="w3-center">University Makes Changes to Orientation Program</h4>Madison University is making a change to the orientation program for first-year students. In the past, as part of orientation, new, incoming students could go on a two-day hiking and camping trip together with other incoming students on the weekend before classes begin. In order to encourage more students to take advantage of the opportunity to get to know one another in an informal setting, the university will now offer a choice of activities: students will be able to either go hiking or participate in organized group games on campus. Additionally, these activities will last one day only, not two, a change many students had requested.</article>

          <p>Now listen to two students discussing the article.</p>
          <p>Man:Interesting, isn't it? I wish they'd made this change two years ago, when we got here. This program is gonna be much more attractive this way, to lots more people.</p>
          <p>Woman:Why?</p>
          <p>Man:Well, it's a question of choice. See, not everyone likes the same things. The way it used to be...if, like, you didn't like sleeping in a tent, well, you just didn't participate. Lots of people didn't.</p>
          <p>Woman:That's true. I didn't go on the camping trip my first year. Hiking and camping isn't my thing. But you know, I did feel I missed out on something.</p>
          <p>Man:Right. Plus, the other reason this is going to work is that you don't have to give up your whole weekend anymore. There are other things people need to do the first few days, you know, like, buy their books, set up their rooms, prepare for the first day of classes, that kind of thing. The big time commitment used to get in the way.</p>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>The orientation program for first-year students will be change into a one- day only trip or campus event. And the man holds a positive view towards the announcement. The first reasons he feels that not everyone likes to do the same things. Many students just missed out the orientation program since they didn't like it. The orientation program should be involved with multiple activities. Second, the man proposes this change can save the whole weekend for the incoming students. It is better for those who need to prepare for the first few days. Therefore, he agrees with that opinion.</p>
