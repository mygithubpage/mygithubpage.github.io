Sure. <span class="time" data-times="7.34" data-time="51.96">[00:51.96]</span>Just think: would a bird choose to feed in a <span class="highlight">bush</span> filled with berries or in a <span

berries I guess.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.98" data-time="61.57">[01:01.57]</span>Professor:And the bird certainly doesn't <span class="highlight">count</span> the berries. <span class="time" data-times="5.31" data-time="64.55">[01:04.55]</span>The bird uses ANS: <span class="highlight">Approximate</span> Number <span class="highlight">Sense</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.02" data-time="69.86">[01:09.86]</span>And that <span class="highlight">ability</span> is <span class="highlight">innate</span>, it's inborn. <span class="time" data-times="11.78" data-time="73.88">[01:13.88]</span>Now I'm not saying that all people have an <span class="highlight">equal</span> skill or that the skill can't be improved, but it's present...uh...as I said...it's present in six-month-old babies. <span class="time" data-times="2.89" data-time="85.66">[01:25.66]</span>It isn't learned.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="8.21" data-time="88.55">[01:28.55]</span>On the other hand, the <span class="highlight">ability</span> to do <span class="highlight">symbolic</span> or <span class="highlight">formal</span><span class="highlight">mathematics</span> is not really what you would call universal. <span class="time" data-times="6.97" data-time="96.76">[01:36.76]</span>You need training in the symbols and in the manipulation of those symbols to work out mathematical problems. <span class="time" data-times="4.41" data-time="103.73">[01:43.73]</span><span class="highlight">Even</span> something as <span

class="highlight">mathematics</span> is not something that little children can do naturally. <span class="time" data-times="5.12" data-time="112.65">[01:52.65]</span>And it wasn't <span class="highlight">even</span> part of human <span class="highlight">culture</span> until a few thousand years ago.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="8.79" data-time="117.77">[01:57.77]</span>Well, it might be interesting to ask the question: Are these two abilities linked somehow?<span class="time" data-times="7.41" data-time="126.56">[02:06.56]</span>Are people who are good at <span class="highlight">approximating</span> numbers also <span class="highlight">proficient</span> in <span class="highlight">formal</span><span class="highlight">mathematics</span>?<span class="time" data-times="8.53" data-time="133.97">[02:13.97]</span>So to find out, researchers created an experiment designed to test ANS in 14-year-olds. <span class="time" data-times="3.32" data-time="142.5">[02:22.50]</span>They had these teenagers sit in front of a computer <span class="highlight">screen</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.7" data-time="145.82">[02:25.82]</span>They then <span class="highlight">flash</span> a <span class="highlight">series</span> of slides in front of them. <span class="time" data-times="4.66" data-time="149.52">[02:29.52]</span>Now, these slides had varying numbers of yellow and blue dots on them. <span class="time" data-times="6.89" data-time="154.18">[02:34.18]</span>One <span class="highlight">slide</span> might have more blue dots than yellow dots, let's say...six yellow dots and nine blue dots. <span class="time" data-times="4.04" data-time="161.07">[02:41.07]</span>The next <span class="highlight">slide</span> might have more yellow dots than blue dots. <span class="time" data-times="3.95" data-time="165.11">[02:45.11]</span>The <span class="highlight">slide</span> would <span class="highlight">flash</span> just for a <span class="highlight">fraction</span> of a <span class="highlight">second</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.24" data-time="169.06">[02:49.06]</span>So you know, there was no time to <span class="highlight">count</span> the dots. <span class="time" data-times="6.74" data-time="172.3">[02:52.30]</span>And then the subjects would <span class="highlight">press</span> a button to <span class="highlight">indicate</span> whether they thought there were more blue dots or yellow dots.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="12.13" data-time="179.04">[02:59.04]</span>So the first thing that jumped out at the researchers when they looked at the result of the experiment was that between individuals, there were big differences in ANS proficiency. <span class="time" data-times="11.61" data-time="191.17">[03:11.17]</span>Some subjects were <span class="highlight">consistently</span> able to <span class="highlight">identify</span> which group of dots was larger <span class="highlight">even</span> if there was a small <span class="highlight">ratio</span>, if the numbers were almost <span class="highlight">equal</span>, like ten to nine. <span class="time" data-times="6.52" data-time="202.78">[03:22.78]</span>Others had problems <span class="highlight">even</span> when differences were <span class="highlight">relatively</span> large, like twelve to eight.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.62" data-time="209.3">[03:29.30]</span>Now, maybe you are asking whether some fourteen-year-olds are just faster, faster in general, not just in math. <span class="time" data-times="3.25" data-time="216.92">[03:36.92]</span>It turns out: that's not so. <span class="time" data-times="5.69" data-time="220.17">[03:40.17]</span>We know this because the fourteen-year-olds had <span class="highlight">previously</span> been tested in a few different areas.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.79" data-time="225.86">[03:45.86]</span>For example, as eight-year-olds, they had been <span class="highlight">given</span> a test of rapid color naming. <span class="time" data-times="4.2" data-time="231.65">[03:51.65]</span>That's a test to see how fast they could <span class="highlight">identify</span> different colors. <span class="time" data-times="5.73" data-time="235.85">[03:55.85]</span>But the result didn't show a relationship with the results of the ANS test. <span class="time" data-times="9.24" data-time="241.58">[04:01.58]</span>The ones who were great at rapidly naming colors when they were eight years old weren't necessarily good at the ANS test when they were fourteen. <span class="time" data-times="6.79" data-time="250.82">[04:10.82]</span>And there was no relationship between ANS <span class="highlight">ability</span> and skills like reading and word knowledge.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="12.16" data-time="257.61">[04:17.61]</span>But among all the abilities tested over those years, there was one that correlated with the ANS results: math, <span class="highlight">symbolic</span> math achievement. <span class="time" data-times="2.99" data-time="269.77">[04:29.77]</span>And this answered the researchers' question. <span class="time" data-times="7.42" data-time="272.76">[04:32.76]</span>They were able to <span class="highlight">correlate</span> learned mathematical <span class="highlight">ability</span> with ANS.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.55" data-time="280.18">[04:40.18]</span>Student:But it doesn't really tell us which came first.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="1.05" data-time="283.73">[04:43.73]</span>Professor:Go on, Laura.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.13" data-time="284.78">[04:44.78]</span>Student:I mean, if someone's born with good <span class="highlight">approximate</span> number <span class="highlight">sense</span>, um, does that cause them to be good at math?<span class="time" data-times="9.83" data-time="291.91">[04:51.91]</span>Or the other way around: If a person develops math <span class="highlight">ability</span>, you know, and really studies <span class="highlight">formal</span><span class="highlight">mathematics</span>, does ANS somehow <span class="highlight">improve</span>?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.05" data-time="301.74">[05:01.74]</span>Professor:Those are very good questions, and I don't think they were answered in these experiments.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="0.79999999999998" data-time="308.79">[05:08.79]</span>Student:But...wait. <span class="time" data-times="1.86" data-time="309.59">[05:09.59]</span>ANS can <span class="highlight">improve</span>?<span class="time" data-times="5.13" data-time="311.45">[05:11.45]</span>Oh, that's right, you said that before...<span class="highlight">even</span> though it's <span class="highlight">innate</span>, it can <span class="highlight">improve</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.45" data-time="316.58">[05:16.58]</span>So wouldn't it be important for teachers in grade schools to...</p><p><span class="time" data-times="1.62" data-time="320.03">[05:20.03]</span>Professor:Teach ANS? <span class="time" data-times="3.92" data-time="321.65">[05:21.65]</span>But shouldn't the questions Laura just posed be answered first? <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="325.57">[05:25.57]</span>Before we make teaching decisions based on the idea that having a good <span class="highlight">approximate</span> number <span class="highlight">sense</span> helps

To point out the difficulty of testing mathematics ability in very young children</p><p>D. To contrast the way infants learn with how older children learn</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>It is mentioned here that ANS is a natural ability, such as a six-month-old baby can use this feeling to some extent. Corresponds to option A.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor stress that the dots in the experiment flashed on the computer screen for only a fraction of a second?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.
