Agnostid fossils can be found in rocks in many areas around the world. From the fossil remains, we know that agnostids were primitive arthropods-relatives of modern-day insects. However, the fossil information does not allow paleontologists to determine with certainty what agnostids ate or how they behaved. There are several different theories about how agnostids may have lived.</p><p>Free-Swimming Predators</p><p>First, the agnostids may have been free-swimming predators that hunted smaller animals. It is known that other types of primitive arthropods were strong swimmers and active predators, so it is reasonable that the agnostids may have lived that way as well. And while the agnostids were small, sometimes just six millimeters long, there were plenty of smaller organisms in the ancient ocean for them to prey on.</p><p>Seafloor Dwellers</p><p>Second, they may have dwelled on the seafloor. Again, there are examples of other types of primitive arthropods living this way, so it is possible that agnostids did too. On the seafloor they would have survived by scavenging dead organisms or by grazing on bacteria.</p><p>Parasites</p><p>Third, there is the possibility that the agnostids were parasites, living on and feeding off larger organisms. One reason that this seems possible is that there are many species of modern-day arthropods that exist as parasites, such as fleas, ticks, and mites. The agnostids might have lived on primitive fish or even on other, larger arthropods. </p></article><div><audio src="tpo43-writing1.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></div><article id="listening-passage" class="passage"><h3>Listening Text</h3><p>Professor Unfortunately, each of the three theories about how agnostids lived has a serious weakness.</p><p>First, we know that other types of arthropods swam in the open ocean, hunting their prey. However, all of those arthropods had large, well- developed eyes, vision is one of the best ways for a predator to track its prey. But agnostids had tiny, poorly developed eyes, and were sometimes completely blind. This seems to rule out the idea that they were predators. If they did chase after prey, they would have had some other special sensory organ to help them find prey. But there's no evidence of this in the fossil record.</p><p>Second, it seems unlikely that agnostids lived on the seafloor. Animals that are seafloor dwellers typically don't have the ability to move very fast or very far. They move slowly across the seafloor and stay in localized areas rather than spreading to new areas. So typically we find each seafloor-dweller species occupying a small geographic area where it had originated and nowhere else. However, many agnostids species inhabited multiple geographic areas spread across large distances. This suggests that agnostids were able to move from one area to another pretty fast.The ability to move easily across large distances would be highly unusual for seafloor-dwellers.</p><p>Finally, the parasite theory. Well, one thing that's typical of parasites is that their populations are not very large. Parasite populations have to stay within certain limits. Because if there were too many parasites, they would kill off the host organisms they live on. But we're pretty sure that the populations of many agnostids were in fact very large. We can tell because for many species we've been able to find vast amounts of fossilized individuals. So the great size of agnostid populations seems to rule out the theory that they were parasites. </p></article><section id="question"><h4>Question</h4><p>Summarize the points made in the lecture, being sure to explain how they challenge specific points made in the reading passage.</p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>The reading mainly presents that there are three theories about how agnostids may have survived. <b>However, the listening challenges what are stated in the passage by providing three strong evidences.</b> </p><p>Firstly, in the reading, it is said that the agnostids may have been free-swimming predators that feed on smaller animals since other types of primitive arthropods were strong swimmers and active predators. In contrast, <b>the listening holds an opposed view that</b> the eyes of agnostids are too small, and there is no evidence of fossil record of their special sensory organs to catch up prey. </p><p>Secondly, the passage asserts that agnostids may have inhabited on the seafloor. However, the professor also maintains an opposite opinion that many agnostids species dwelled on multiple geographic areas. Because seafloor dwellers move slowly across the seafloor and remain living in localized areas.</p><p>Finally, the author of reading passage believes that many species of modern-day arthropods exist as parasites. On the other hand, the lecturer disagrees it with the point that the populations of parasites are not very large. Since too many parasites would kill off the host organisms they live on. However, the populations of many agnostids were in fact very large. </p><p>Under this circumstance, the third theories made by the reading passage is unconvincing.</p></article><article class="response"><h4>My Version</h4><p>The reading express three theories about how agnostids may have lived. but the professor point out their weakness one by one.</p><p>First, the reading suggest agnostids could be predators that hunted smaller animals. However, the professor reject this hypothesis by saying that predators usually has well-developed eyes that help them catch prey. while agnosids only have tiny eyes, which is not very helpful when chasing another animal. In addition, there is no envidents found in the  fossil that agnosids have other special sense that help them hunt. so this suggestion has been proof to be wrong by the professor.</p><p>Second, According to the reading, agnositds could be seafloor dwellers which survived by eating bacteria or dead organisms. In contrast, the professor contradict this theory by pointing out that most seafloor dwellers move slowly and stay in local area. While agnostids could swim very fast and spread in very large area which is unusual for seafloor dweller.</p><p>Third, reading material mention that agnostids might be parasites living on and feeding orf larger organisms. On the contrary. the professor doesn't agree with idea by stating that if the Agnostid were parasites, their population very be restrain in specific number because too many paratsites will kill the host. but the large population of the agnostids has directly contradict this fact. so there is no possibilty that agnostid were parasites.</p></article></div></main></body></html>
