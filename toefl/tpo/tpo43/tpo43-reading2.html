In the ocean, <span class="highlight">microscopic</span><span class="highlight">phytoplankton</span> (tiny floating plants) and <span class="highlight">bacteria</span> (simple, single-celled organisms) are the <span class="highlight">principal</span> sources of <span class="highlight">organic</span> matter that is <span class="question2">trapped</span> and buried in <span class="highlight">sediment</span>. Most of the <span class="highlight">organic</span> matter is buried in <span class="highlight">clay</span> that is slowly <span class="highlight">converted</span> to a <span class="highlight">fine-grained</span><span class="highlight">sedimentary</span> rock known as <span class="highlight">shale</span>. During this <span class="highlight">conversion</span>, <span class="highlight">organic</span> compounds are transformed to oil and natural gas.</p><p><span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> Sampling on the <span class="highlight">continental</span> shelves and <span class="highlight">along</span> the <span class="highlight">base</span> of the <span class="highlight">continental</span> slopes has shown that fine muds <span class="highlight">beneath</span> the seafloor <span class="highlight">contain</span> up to 8 percent <span class="highlight">organic</span> matter. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> Two <span class="highlight">additional</span> kinds of <span class="highlight">evidence</span> support the <span class="highlight">hypothesis</span> that <span class="highlight">petroleum</span> is a product of the <span class="highlight">decomposition</span> of <span class="highlight">organic</span> matter: oil possesses <span class="highlight">optical</span> properties known only in hydrocarbons derived from <span class="highlight">organic</span> matter, and oil contains <span class="highlight">nitrogen</span> and certain compounds believed to <span class="highlight">originate</span> only in living matter. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span> A <span class="highlight">complex</span><span class="highlight">sequence</span> of chemical reactions is involved in converting the <span class="highlight">original</span><span class="highlight">solid</span><span class="highlight">organic</span> matter to oil and gas, and <span class="highlight">additional</span> chemical changes may <span class="highlight">occur</span> in the oil and gas <span class="highlight">even</span> after they have formed. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p><p>It is now well established that <span class="highlight">petroleum</span> migrates <span class="highlight">through</span> aquifers and can become trapped in reservoirs. <span class="highlight">Petroleum</span><span class="highlight">migration</span> is <span class="highlight">analogous</span> to <span class="highlight">groundwater</span><span class="highlight">migration</span>. <span class="question5">When oil and gas are squeezed out of the <span class="highlight">shale</span> in which they originated and enter a body of sandstone or <span class="highlight">limestone</span> somewhere above, they <span class="highlight">migrate</span><span class="highlight">readily</span> because sandstones (consisting of <span class="highlight">quartz</span> grains) and limestones (consisting of <span class="highlight">carbonate</span> minerals) are much more <span class="highlight">permeable</span> than any <span class="highlight">shale</span>.</span><span class="question6">The force of molecular attraction between oil and <span class="highlight">quartz</span> or <span class="highlight">carbonate</span> minerals is weaker than that between water and <span class="highlight">quartz</span> or <span class="highlight">carbonate</span> minerals.</span> Hence, because oil and water do not mix, water remains fastened to the <span class="highlight">quartz</span> or <span class="highlight">carbonate</span> grains, while oil occupies the central parts of the larger openings in the <span class="highlight">porous</span> sandstone or <span class="highlight">limestone</span>. Because oil is lighter than water, it tends to <span class="highlight">glide</span> upward past the carbonate- and quartz-held water. In this way, oil becomes segregated from the water; when it <span class="question7">encounters</span> a <span class="highlight">trap</span>, it can form a pool.</p><p>Most of the <span class="highlight">petroleum</span> that forms in sediments does not find a <span class="highlight"><span class="question8">suitable</span></span><span class="highlight">trap</span> and <span class="highlight">eventually</span> makes its way, <span class="highlight">along</span> with <span class="highlight">groundwater</span>, to the surface of the sea. It is estimated that no more than 0.1 percent of all the <span class="highlight">organic</span> matter originally buried in a <span class="highlight">sediment</span> is <span class="highlight">eventually</span> trapped in an oil pool. It is not surprising, <span class="highlight">therefore</span>, that the highest <span class="highlight">ratio</span> of oil and gas pools to <span class="highlight">volume</span> of <span class="highlight">sediment</span> is found in rock no older than 2.5 million years - young enough so that little of the <span class="highlight">petroleum</span> has leaked away - and that nearly 60 percent of all oil and gas discovered so far has been found in <span class="highlight">strata</span> that formed in the last 65 million years This does not mean that older rocks produced less <span class="highlight">petroleum</span>; it <span class="highlight">simply</span> means that oil in older rocks has had a longer time in which to <span class="highlight">leak</span> away.</p><p>How much oil is there in the world? This <span class="question11">is an extremely <span class="highlight">controversial</span> question.</span> Many billions of barrels of oil have already been pumped out of the ground. A lot of <span class="highlight">additional</span> oil has been located by drilling but is still waiting to be pumped out. Possibly a great <span class="highlight">deal</span> more oil remains to be found by drilling. Unlike <span class="highlight">coal</span>, the <span class="highlight">volume</span> of which can be accurately estimated, the <span class="highlight">volume</span> of undiscovered oil can only be guessed at. Guesses <span class="highlight">involve</span> the use of accumulated experience from a <span class="highlight">century</span> of drilling. Knowing how much oil has been found in an intensively drilled area, such as eastern Texas, experts make estimates of probable volumes in other regions where rock types and structures are <span class="highlight">similar</span> to those in eastern Texas. Using this <span class="highlight">approach</span> and considering all the <span class="highlight">sedimentary</span> basins of the world, experts <span class="highlight">estimate</span> that somewhere between 1,500 and 3,000 billion barrels of oil will <span class="highlight">eventually</span> be discovered.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 1, petroleum is formed in which of the following ways?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Bacteria and tiny plants undergo a change while they are buried in clay</p><p>B. Carbon and hydrogen combine to form shale</p><p>C. Ocean rocks are converted into organic compounds</p><p>D.

In the ocean, captured and buried in sediment Microphytoplankton (microphytoplankton) and bacteria (simple unicellular organisms) are the main source of organic matter. So the correct answer is A.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">trapped</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. hidden</p><p>B. destroyed</p><p>C. caught</p><p>D. found</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Trap; trap; make ... restricted, make ... in trouble, corresponding to option C, capture.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>All of the following are cited in paragraph 2 as evidence that petroleum is a product of the decomposition of organic matter EXCEPT</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. the amount of organic matter found in layers of mud below the seafloor</p><p>B. the chemical changes that occur in oil and natural gas after they have formed</p><p>C. the optical properties of oil</p><p>D. the fact that oil contains nitrogen and other compounds believed to be of organic origin</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>This question is a negative factual information question. The question asked, which of the following is not evidence that petroleum is a decomposition product of organic matter? The A option corresponds to the first sentence of the article, mentioning that up to 8% of organic matter is contained in the seabed mud, so the A option is in accordance with the original text and excluded. The second sentence says "two additional kinds of evidence" corresponds to the C option: optical properties of oil and D options: The nitrogen and certain compounds contained in petroleum originate from organic matter. The B option is mentioned in the last sentence, but has nothing to do with wrapping information, so B is the correct answer.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 2, which of the following is true of the change of solid organic material into oil and gas?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It is more likely to occur along the base of continental slopes than on the continental shelves</p><p>B. It only takes place in areas where the seafloor contains at least 8 percent organic matter</p><p>C. It is a process that can be reversed through chemical changes that occur after the oil and gas have formed</p><p>D. It involves a complicated series of chemical reactions</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The original solid organic matter is involved in converting the original solid organic matter to oil and gas, and additional chemical changes may occur in the oil and gas even after they have formed There is a series of complex chemical reactions involved, and even if oil and natural gas have already formed, other chemical changes may occur. The complex sequence corresponds to the complicated series of option D, so the correct answer is D.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. When oil and gas are squeezed out of the rock in which they originated, it is probably because the layer of rock above them is much more permeable than shale</p><p>B. Sandstones, which are made of quartz grains, and limestones, which are made of carbonate minerals, can hold much more oil and gas than any shale can</p><p>C. When they are squeezed from the shale in which they were formed, oil and gas move easily into the much more permeable layers of sandstone or limestone above</p><p>D. Oil and gas are squeezed out of sandstones, consisting of quartz grains, and migrate readily into limestones, which consist of carbonate minerals and are much more permeable</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>When guiding clauses, the core of the original sentence is: When they are squeezed, oil and gas can more easily move to more easily penetrated sandstone or limestone, corresponding to option C. A lack of migrate this information; B Sandstones subject is wrong, not the core of the original sentence; D much more permeable into a minor component.

It remains in underground pools</p><p>B. It is buried under organic matter</p><p>C. It rises to the surface of the ocean</p><p>D. It combines with the minerals found in groundwater</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Most of the petroleum that forms in sediments does not find a <span class="question8">suitable</span> trap and eventually makes its way, along with groundwater, to the surface of the sea. Most petroleum found in sediments cannot find a <span class="question8">suitable</span> reservoir, Ultimately they find their own way, as the groundwater flows to the surface of the ocean. Corresponds to option C of rises to the surface of the ocean. So the correct answer is C.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Paragraph 4 supports which of the following statements about future petroleum discoveries?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Less petroleum will be found than in the past because the ratio of petroleum pools to volume of sediment will decrease</p><p>B. Most of the petroleum will come from rocks that are less than 65 million years old</p><p>C. Petroleum that has leaked away from older rocks will be the source of most new discoveries</p><p>D. More petroleum will become available because the amount of trapped organic matter will increase</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The title is factual information. The question asked, which of the following paragraphs supports the description of future oil exploration? Need to judge the whole content. This paragraph says that the highest ratio of oil and gas to sediment is found in rocks not older than 2.5 million years old. The oil in these rocks has not yet been leaked. Most of the oil was discovered in rocks over 65 million years old. This does not mean that the old rocks produce less oil, but it means that the oil may leak over a longer period of time. From this, we can deduce that in the future people may mine oil in rock not older than 2.5 million years, because these oils are less likely to leak out. The A and D options are wrong because they are not mentioned in the text. Option C said that oil leaked from old rocks would become a new source of oil. It was wrong because contradicting the fact that oil could not be mined if it leaked. So, B is the correct answer.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The phrase "<span class="highlight">is an extremely controversial question</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. is a question of great importance</p><p>B. is a question causing strong disagreement</p><p>C. is a question that has existed for a long time</p><p>D. is a question composed of many related parts</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="is an extremely controversial question B"><p>The is an extremely controversial question is a very controversial issue.
