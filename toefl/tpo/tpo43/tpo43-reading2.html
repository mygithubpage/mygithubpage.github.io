            <b>The Origin Of Petroleum</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>
            <span class="underline">Petroleum</span> is defined as a <span class="underline">gaseous</span>, <span class="underline">liquid</span>, and semisolid naturally occurring <span class="underline">substance</span> that consists <span class="underline">chiefly</span> of hydrocarbons (chemical compounds of <span class="underline">carbon</span> and <span class="underline">hydrogen</span>). <span class="underline">Petroleum</span> is <span class="underline">therefore</span> a <span class="underline">term</span> that includes both oil and natural gas. <span class="underline">Petroleum</span> is nearly always found in <span class="underline">marine</span> <span class="underline">sedimentary</span> rocks. In the ocean, <span class="underline">microscopic</span> <span class="underline">phytoplankton</span> (tiny floating plants) and <span class="underline">bacteria</span> (simple, single-celled organisms) are the <span class="underline">principal</span> sources of <span class="underline">organic</span> matter that is trapped and buried in <span class="underline">sediment</span>. Most of the <span class="underline">organic</span> matter is buried in <span class="underline">clay</span> that is slowly <span class="underline">converted</span> to a <span class="underline">fine-grained</span> <span class="underline">sedimentary</span> rock known as <span class="underline">shale</span>. During this <span class="underline">conversion</span>, <span class="underline">organic</span> compounds are transformed to oil and natural gas.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A">
            </span> Sampling on the <span class="underline">continental</span> shelves and <span class="underline">along</span> the <span class="underline">base</span> of the <span class="underline">continental</span> slopes has shown that fine muds <span class="underline">beneath</span> the seafloor <span class="underline">contain</span> up to 8 percent <span class="underline">organic</span> matter. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> Two <span class="underline">additional</span> kinds of <span class="underline">evidence</span> support the <span class="underline">hypothesis</span> that <span class="underline">petroleum</span> is a product of the <span class="underline">decomposition</span> of <span class="underline">organic</span> matter: oil possesses <span class="underline">optical</span> properties known only in hydrocarbons derived from <span class="underline">organic</span> matter, and oil contains <span class="underline">nitrogen</span> and certain compounds believed to <span class="underline">originate</span> only in living matter. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span> A <span class="underline">complex</span> <span class="underline">sequence</span> of chemical reactions is involved in converting the <span class="underline">original</span> <span class="underline">solid</span> <span class="underline">organic</span> matter to oil and gas, and <span class="underline">additional</span> chemical changes may <span class="underline">occur</span> in the oil and gas <span class="underline">even</span> after they have formed. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p>
          <p>It is now well established that <span class="underline">petroleum</span> migrates <span class="underline">through</span> aquifers and can become trapped in reservoirs. <span class="underline">Petroleum</span> <span class="underline">migration</span> is <span class="underline">analogous</span> to <span class="underline">groundwater</span> <span class="underline">migration</span>. When oil and gas are squeezed out of the <span class="underline">shale</span> in which they originated and enter a body of sandstone or <span class="underline">limestone</span> somewhere above, they <span class="underline">migrate</span> <span class="underline">readily</span> because sandstones (consisting of <span class="underline">quartz</span> grains) and limestones (consisting of <span class="underline">carbonate</span> minerals) are much more <span class="underline">permeable</span> than any <span class="underline">shale</span>. The force of molecular attraction between oil and <span class="underline">quartz</span> or <span class="underline">carbonate</span> minerals is weaker than that between water and <span class="underline">quartz</span> or <span class="underline">carbonate</span> minerals. Hence, because oil and water do not mix, water remains fastened to the <span class="underline">quartz</span> or <span class="underline">carbonate</span> grains, while oil occupies the central parts of the larger openings in the <span class="underline">porous</span> sandstone or <span class="underline">limestone</span>. Because oil is lighter than water, it tends to <span class="underline">glide</span> upward past the carbonate- and quartz-held water. In this way, oil becomes segregated from the water; when it encounters a <span class="underline">trap</span>, it can form a pool.</p>
          <p>Most of the <span class="underline">petroleum</span> that forms in sediments does not find a <span class="underline">suitable</span> <span class="underline">trap</span> and <span class="underline">eventually</span> makes its way, <span class="underline">along</span> with <span class="underline">groundwater</span>, to the surface of the sea. It is estimated that no more than 0.1 percent of all the <span class="underline">organic</span> matter originally buried in a <span class="underline">sediment</span> is <span class="underline">eventually</span> trapped in an oil pool. It is not surprising, <span class="underline">therefore</span>, that the highest <span class="underline">ratio</span> of oil and gas pools to <span class="underline">volume</span> of <span class="underline">sediment</span> is found in rock no older than 2.5 million years - young enough so that little of the <span class="underline">petroleum</span> has leaked away - and that nearly 60 percent of all oil and gas discovered so far has been found in <span class="underline">strata</span> that formed in the last 65 million years This does not mean that older rocks produced less <span class="underline">petroleum</span>; it <span class="underline">simply</span> means that oil in older rocks has had a longer time in which to <span class="underline">leak</span> away.</p>
          <p>How much oil is there in the world? This is an extremely <span class="underline">controversial</span> question. Many billions of barrels of oil have already been pumped out of the ground. A lot of <span class="underline">additional</span> oil has been located by drilling but is still waiting to be pumped out. Possibly a great <span class="underline">deal</span> more oil remains to be found by drilling. Unlike <span class="underline">coal</span>, the <span class="underline">volume</span> of which can be accurately estimated, the <span class="underline">volume</span> of undiscovered oil can only be guessed at. Guesses <span class="underline">involve</span> the use of accumulated experience from a <span class="underline">century</span> of drilling. Knowing how much oil has been found in an intensively drilled area, such as eastern Texas, experts make estimates of probable volumes in other regions where rock types and structures are <span class="underline">similar</span> to those in eastern Texas. Using this <span class="underline">approach</span> and considering all the <span class="underline">sedimentary</span> basins of the world, experts <span class="underline">estimate</span> that somewhere between 1,500 and 3,000 billion barrels of oil will <span class="underline">eventually</span> be discovered.</p>
