            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.63" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in a linguistics class.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="12.84" data-time="4.63">[00:04.63]</span>Professor: Ok, the conventions or assumptions that <span class="underline">govern</span> <span class="underline">conversation</span>, these may <span class="underline">vary</span> from one <span class="underline">culture</span> to another, but basically, for people to <span class="underline">communicate</span>, there is a ... they have to follow certain rules. <span class="time" data-times="12" data-time="17.47">[00:17.47]</span>Like if I am talking with you and I start saying things that are not true, if you can't tell when I am lying and when I am telling the truth, well, we are not going to have a very satisfactory <span class="underline">conversation</span>, are we? Why? <span class="time" data-times="4.06" data-time="29.47">[00:29.47]</span>Because it violates one of the Gricean Maxims. <span class="time" data-times="7.51" data-time="33.53">[00:33.53]</span>That's a set of rules or maxims a <span class="underline">philosopher</span> name H.P .Grice came up with in 1970s. <span class="time" data-times="5.4" data-time="41.04">[00:41.04]</span>One of these Gricean Maxims is... well, I've already <span class="underline">given</span> you a <span class="underline">hint</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.06" data-time="46.44">[00:46.44]</span>Student: Oh, you just can't go around telling lies.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.17" data-time="49.5">[00:49.50]</span>Professor: Right, or as Grice put it, "Do not say what you believe to be false." <span class="time" data-times="3.95" data-time="54.67">[00:54.67]</span>That's one of Grice's Maxims of <span class="underline">Quality</span> as he called it. <span class="time" data-times="1.44" data-time="58.62">[00:58.62]</span>So that's <span class="underline">pretty</span> <span class="underline">obvious</span>.<span class="time" data-times="1.89" data-time="60.06">[01:00.06]</span> But there are others just as important. <span class="time" data-times="7.33" data-time="61.95">[01:01.95]</span>Like, eh... <span class="underline">suppose</span> you would ask me what time it was and I replied 'my sister just got married', what would you think?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.29" data-time="69.28">[01:09.28]</span>Student: You are not really answering my question.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.57" data-time="71.57">[01:11.57]</span>Professor: No, I am not, am I? <span class="time" data-times="5.75" data-time="73.14">[01:13.14]</span>There is no connection at all, which feels wrong because you generally <span class="underline">expect</span> to find one. <span class="time" data-times="3.5" data-time="78.89">[01:18.89]</span>So one important maxim is simply: be <span class="underline">relevant</span>. <span class="time" data-times="12.12" data-time="82.39">[01:22.39]</span>And using the so-called Maxim of <span class="underline">Relevance</span> we can infer things as well, or rather the speaker can <span class="underline">imply</span> things and the listener can make inferences. <span class="time" data-times="7.68" data-time="94.51">[01:34.51]</span>For <span class="underline">instance</span>, <span class="underline">suppose</span> you say you would really love to have a cup of coffee right now, and I say 'there's a shop around the corner'. <span class="time" data-times="3.16" data-time="102.19">[01:42.19]</span>Now, what can you infer from what I said?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.62" data-time="105.35">[01:45.35]</span>Student: Well, the shop sells coffee for one thing.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.26" data-time="107.97">[01:47.97]</span>Professor: Right, and that I believe it is open now. <span class="time" data-times="5.43" data-time="111.23">[01:51.23]</span>Because if I won't implying those things, my <span class="underline">response</span> would not be <span class="underline">relevant</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.95" data-time="116.66">[01:56.66]</span>It'd have no connection with what you said before. <span class="time" data-times="11.11" data-time="119.61">[01:59.61]</span>But according to the maxim, my <span class="underline">response</span> should be <span class="underline">relevant</span> to your <span class="underline">statement</span>, meaning, we should <span class="underline">assume</span> some connection between the <span class="underline">statement</span> and the <span class="underline">response</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.1" data-time="130.72">[02:10.72]</span>And this maxim of <span class="underline">relevance</span> is quite <span class="underline">efficient</span> to use.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.48" data-time="134.82">[02:14.82]</span>
              <span class="underline">Even</span> if I don't spell out all the details, you can still make some useful <span class="underline">logical</span> inferences, namely, the shop is open and it sells coffee. <span class="time" data-times="7.55" data-time="145.3">[02:25.30]</span>If we actually have to explain all these details, conversations would move <span class="underline">along</span> <span class="underline">pretty</span> slowly, wouldn't they? <span class="time" data-times="10.28" data-time="152.85">[02:32.85]</span>OK, then there's the maxims of <span class="underline">manner</span>, including things like be <span class="underline">clear</span>, and <span class="underline">avoid</span> <span class="underline">ambiguity</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.1" data-time="163.13">[02:43.13]</span>And another more interesting maxims is one of the so-called maxims of <span class="underline">quantity</span>, quantities of information, that is. <span class="time" data-times="5.38" data-time="171.23">[02:51.23]</span>It says, to give as much information as is required in the situation. <span class="time" data-times="9.51" data-time="176.61">[02:56.61]</span>So <span class="underline">suppose</span> you asked me what I did yesterday and I say 'I went to the Art Museum.' You would likely infer that I saw some works of art. <span class="time" data-times="7.24" data-time="186.12">[03:06.12]</span> <span class="underline">Suppose</span>, though, that I did not go inside the museum, I just walked up to it then left. <span class="time" data-times="6.57" data-time="193.36">[03:13.36]</span>Then I violated the <span class="underline">quantity</span> maxim by not giving enough information. <span class="time" data-times="6.42" data-time="199.93">[03:19.93]</span>So you can see how important implications are to our <span class="underline">ability</span> to carry on a <span class="underline">conversation</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.98" data-time="206.35">[03:26.35]</span>But there are times when people will violate these maxims on purpose. <span class="time" data-times="6.76" data-time="211.33">[03:31.33]</span>Let's say a boss is asked to write a letter of recommendation for a <span class="underline">former</span> employee seeking an <span class="underline">engineering</span> job. <span class="time" data-times="2.23" data-time="218.09">[03:38.09]</span>The letter he writes is quite <span class="underline">brief</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.56" data-time="220.32">[03:40.32]</span>Something like, uh, Mr. X is polite and always dresses quite neatly. <span class="time" data-times="3.23" data-time="224.88">[03:44.88]</span>So what does this really mean?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.79" data-time="228.11">[03:48.11]</span>Student: Oh, I see. <span class="time" data-times="11.75" data-time="230.9">[03:50.90]</span>By not mentioning any important qualities related to the job, the boss is ... like, implying that this is best that can be said about Mr. X that he is really not qualified.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.59" data-time="242.65">[04:02.65]</span>Professor: Exactly. It's a written letter not a <span class="underline">conversation</span>, but the <span class="underline">principle</span> is the same. <span class="time" data-times="6.57" data-time="248.24">[04:08.24]</span>The boss is conveying a <span class="underline">negative</span> <span class="underline">impression</span> of Mr. X without actually saying <span class="underline">negative</span> about him. <span class="time" data-times="10.6" data-time="254.81">[04:14.81]</span>So, by violating the maxims, we ...eh... but ... it can be a way to be <span class="underline">subtle</span> or polite, or to <span class="underline">convey</span> humor <span class="underline">through</span> sarcasm or <span class="underline">irony</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.85" data-time="265.41">[04:25.41]</span>Sometimes though people will violate maxims for another purpose: to <span class="underline">deceive</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.91" data-time="271.26">[04:31.26]</span>Now, can you imagine who might do such a thing?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.47" data-time="275.17">[04:35.17]</span>Student: Some politicians.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.83" data-time="276.64">[04:36.64]</span>Student: Or advertisers.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.76" data-time="278.47">[04:38.47]</span>Professor: Right. Anyone who may see an <span class="underline">advantage</span> in implying certain things that are untrue without explicitly saying something untrue. <span class="time" data-times="5.54" data-time="288.23">[04:48.23]</span>They think, hey, don't blame us if our <span class="underline">audience</span> happens to <span class="underline">draw</span> inferences that are <span class="underline">simply</span> not true.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="16.17" data-time="293.77">[04:53.77]</span>So next time you see an advertisement saying some product could be up to 20% more <span class="underline">effective</span>, think of these maxims of <span class="underline">quantity</span> and <span class="underline">relevance</span>, and ask yourself what inferences you are being led to <span class="underline">draw</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.58" data-time="309.94">[05:09.94]</span>Think, more <span class="underline">effective</span> than what exactly? <span class="time" data-times="5.38" data-time="313.52">[05:13.52]</span>And why do they use those little phrases 'could be' and 'up to'? <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="318.9">[05:18.90]</span>These claims give us a lot less information than they <span class="underline">seem</span> to.</p>
