Explain why you think it is an important quality for a team or group member to have.</p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>I think a valuable member of a team should be cooperative. If a member is cooperative, he or she will take the goal of the team as main goal not that of his or her own as the main goal. So he or she is willing to help other team members, to talk with others, to solve problems with others. Once I attended a computer program group. At that time we had four members and only one day left before we had to submit the program. So we all decided to gather together and stay overnight, writing the program, sharing ideas, discussing and solving problems. That was the time I felt we were like a team.</p></article></div></main></body></html>
