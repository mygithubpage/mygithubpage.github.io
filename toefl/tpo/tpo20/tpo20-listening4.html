              <span class="time" data-times="4.54" data-time="5.44">[00:05.44]</span>Student: Professor Jennings, I hope I am not interrupting, but you <span class="underline">wanted</span> to see me? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.32" data-time="9.98">[00:09.98]</span>Professor: Oh, hello, Suzanne. <span class="time" data-times="1.92" data-time="11.3">[00:11.30]</span>Yes, yes, come right in. <span class="time" data-times="1.04" data-time="13.22">[00:13.22]</span>How are you doing? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="0.79" data-time="14.26">[00:14.26]</span>Student: All right. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="0.83" data-time="15.05">[00:15.05]</span>Professor: Well, good. <span class="time" data-times="13.35" data-time="15.88">[00:15.88]</span>The <span class="underline">reason</span> I <span class="underline">wanted</span> to talk to you was that while you were presenting you linguistics <span class="underline">project</span> in class the other day, well, you know, I was thinking you are a <span class="underline">perfect</span> <span class="underline">candidate</span> for the dean's <span class="underline">undergraduate</span> research <span class="underline">fund</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.07" data-time="29.23">[00:29.23]</span>Student: Um ... Professor, I am really sure what the... um ... dean .... </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.35" data-time="34.3">[00:34.30]</span>Professor: <span class="underline">Undergraduate</span> research <span class="underline">fund</span> is ... It is a mouthful I <span class="underline">suppose</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.17" data-time="39.65">[00:39.65]</span>OK. Here's the thing. <span class="time" data-times="6.59" data-time="41.82">[00:41.82]</span>Every year the school has a pool of money to <span class="underline">fund</span> a number of research projects of <span class="underline">undergraduate</span> students. <span class="time" data-times="6.11" data-time="48.41">[00:48.41]</span>Because as you can imagine, in-depth research often requires monetary support. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.9" data-time="54.52">[00:54.52]</span>Student: I would like to <span class="underline">expand</span> on my research. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.02" data-time="57.42">[00:57.42]</span>Professor: Good. First a <span class="underline">panel</span> of professors reviews the applications for the <span class="underline">grant</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.7" data-time="62.44">[01:02.44]</span>And then they decide which <span class="underline">project</span> should be funded. <span class="time" data-times="13.48" data-time="66.14">[01:06.14]</span>The allotted money could be used for travel expenses, to <span class="underline">attend</span> a <span class="underline">conference</span> for example, or things like supplies, research equipment, resources that are necessary to <span class="underline">conduct</span> the research. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="0.81" data-time="79.62">[01:19.62]</span>Student: I see. </p>

              <span class="time" data-times="3.71" data-time="80.43">[01:20.43]</span>Professor: Right. And I think you should <span class="underline">apply</span> for this <span class="underline">grant</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.56" data-time="84.14">[01:24.14]</span>Your <span class="underline">project</span> is <span class="underline">definitely</span> <span class="underline">eligible</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.61" data-time="86.7">[01:26.70]</span>And you can <span class="underline">expand</span> it if you have the necessary resources. <span class="time" data-times="3.05" data-time="90.31">[01:30.31]</span>So, does it <span class="underline">sound</span> like something you would be interested in? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.83" data-time="93.36">[01:33.36]</span>Student: Oh, yeah, sounds great. <span class="time" data-times="5.96" data-time="95.19">[01:35.19]</span>I thought the topic I work on was very interesting, and it is certainly <span class="underline">relevant</span> to my linguistics <span class="underline">major</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.37" data-time="101.15">[01:41.15]</span>I <span class="underline">assume</span> it will also look good when I try to get into graduate school. <span class="time" data-times="1.56" data-time="104.52">[01:44.52]</span>But how do I <span class="underline">apply</span> for the <span class="underline">grant</span>? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.57" data-time="106.08">[01:46.08]</span>Professor: It is <span class="underline">pretty</span> <span class="underline">straightforward</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.55" data-time="107.65">[01:47.65]</span>A <span class="underline">brief</span> description of your proposed <span class="underline">project</span>, and an estimated <span class="underline">budget</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.65" data-time="112.2">[01:52.20]</span>How much you need to spend and what you intend to spend it on. <span class="time" data-times="7.34" data-time="115.85">[01:55.85]</span>Also a glowing letter of recommendation from a linguistics professor wouldn't hurt, which I'd be more than happy to write up for you. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.31" data-time="123.19">[02:03.19]</span>Student: OK. Cool. <span class="time" data-times="5.98" data-time="124.5">[02:04.50]</span>I am <span class="underline">pretty</span> <span class="underline">clear</span> on how to carry out my <span class="underline">project</span>, but I am not sure where I can find more information on the <span class="underline">subject</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.12" data-time="130.48">[02:10.48]</span>Professor: Well, I have already thought of that. <span class="time" data-times="3.55" data-time="132.6">[02:12.60]</span>There's this private library at a university in Boston. <span class="time" data-times="5.51" data-time="136.15">[02:16.15]</span>By the way, because I graduated from that school, I can get you <span class="underline">access</span> to it, no problem. <span class="time" data-times="5.91" data-time="141.66">[02:21.66]</span>You see, the library houses lots of unpublished documents that are <span class="underline">relevant</span> to your topic. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.14" data-time="147.57">[02:27.57]</span>Student: So I can put that on the <span class="underline">application</span> for the <span class="underline">grant</span>, that I plan on using <span class="underline">material</span> from that library for my research and <span class="underline">figure</span> a <span class="underline">trip</span> to Boston into my <span class="underline">budget</span>? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.6" data-time="156.71">[02:36.71]</span>Professor: Exactly. I really think judging from your work in class, and the <span class="underline">relevance</span> and clarity of this <span class="underline">project</span>, you really have a good <span class="underline">chance</span> of getting the <span class="underline">funding</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.3" data-time="167.31">[02:47.31]</span>Student: OK. I'll <span class="underline">definitely</span> <span class="underline">apply</span> then. </p>

              <span class="time" data-times="1.34" data-time="169.61">[02:49.61]</span>Professor: The sooner the better. <span class="time" data-times="1.56" data-time="170.95">[02:50.95]</span>It is <span class="underline">due</span> in a few weeks. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="172.51">[02:52.51]</span>Good Luck! And I'll get that letter written up right away. </p>
