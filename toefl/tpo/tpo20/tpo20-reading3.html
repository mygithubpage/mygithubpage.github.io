            <b>Fossil Preservation</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>When one considers the many ways by which organisms are completely destroyed after death, it is <span class="underline">remarkable</span> that fossils are as <span class="underline">common</span> as they are. Attack by scavengers and <span class="underline">bacteria</span>, chemical <span class="underline">decay</span>, and <span class="underline">destruction</span> by <span class="underline">erosion</span> and other geologic <span class="light">agencies</span> make the odds against <span class="underline">preservation</span> very high. However, the chances of escaping complete <span class="underline">destruction</span> are vastly improved if the <span class="underline">organism</span> happens to have a mineralized <span class="underline">skeleton</span> and dies in a place where it can be quickly buried by <span class="underline">sediment</span>. Both of these conditions are often found on the ocean floors, where shelled invertebrates (organisms without spines) <span class="underline">flourish</span> and are covered by the <span class="underline">continuous</span> rain of <span class="underline">sedimentary</span> particles. Although most fossils are found in <span class="underline">marine</span> <span class="underline">sedimentary</span> rocks, they also are found in <span class="underline">terrestrial</span> deposits left by streams and lakes. On occasion, animals and plants have been preserved after becoming immersed in tar or quicksand, trapped in ice or <span class="underline">lava</span> flows, or engulfed by rapid falls of <span class="underline">volcanic</span> ash.</p>
          <p>The <span class="underline">term</span> "fossil" often implies <span class="underline">petrifaction</span>, <span class="underline">literally</span> a <span class="underline">transformation</span> into stone. After the death of an <span class="underline">organism</span>, the <span class="underline">soft</span> <span class="underline">tissue</span> is ordinarily consumed by scavengers and <span class="underline">bacteria</span>. The empty <span class="underline">shell</span> of a snail or <span class="underline">clam</span> may be left behind, and if it is <span class="underline">sufficiently</span> <span class="underline">durable</span> and <span class="underline">resistant</span> to dissolution, it may <span class="underline">remain</span> basically unchanged for a long period of time. Indeed, unaltered shells of <span class="underline">marine</span> invertebrates are known from deposits over 100 million years old. In many <span class="underline">marine</span> creatures, however, the <span class="underline">skeleton</span> is composed of a <span class="underline">mineral</span> <span class="underline">variety</span> of <span class="underline">calcium</span> <span class="underline">carbonate</span> called aragonite. Although aragonite has the same <span class="underline">composition</span> as the more <span class="underline">familiar</span> <span class="underline">mineral</span> known as calcite, it has a different <span class="underline">crystal</span> form, is <span class="underline">relatively</span> unstable, and in time changes to the more <span class="underline">stable</span> calcite.</p>
          <p>Many other processes may after the <span class="underline">shell</span> of a <span class="underline">clam</span> or snail and <span class="underline">enhance</span> its chances for <span class="underline">preservation</span>. Water containing dissolved <span class="underline">silica</span>, <span class="underline">calcium</span> <span class="underline">carbonate</span>, or iron may <span class="underline">circulate</span> <span class="underline">through</span> the enclosing <span class="underline">sediment</span> and be deposited in cavities such as marrow cavities and canals in bone once occupied by blood vessels and nerves. In such cases, the <span class="underline">original</span> <span class="underline">composition</span> of the bone or <span class="underline">shell</span> remains, but the <span class="underline">fossil</span> is made harder and more <span class="underline">durable</span>. This <span class="underline">addition</span> of a chemically precipitated <span class="underline">substance</span> into <span class="underline">pore</span> spaces is termed "permineralization."</p>
          <p>
            <span class="underline">Petrifaction</span> may also <span class="underline">involve</span> a <span class="underline">simultaneous</span> <span class="underline">exchange</span> of the <span class="underline">original</span> <span class="underline">substance</span> of a dead plant or animal with <span class="underline">mineral</span> matter of a different <span class="underline">composition</span>. This <span class="underline">process</span> is termed " replacement" because solutions have dissolved the <span class="underline">original</span> <span class="underline">material</span> and replaced it with an <span class="underline">equal</span> <span class="underline">volume</span> of the new <span class="underline">substance</span>. Replacement can be a marvelously <span class="underline">precise</span> <span class="underline">process</span>, so that details of <span class="underline">shell</span> ornamentation, tree rings in wood, and <span class="underline">delicate</span> structures in bone are accurately preserved.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A">
            </span>Another type of <span class="underline">fossilization</span>, known as carbonization, occurs when <span class="underline">soft</span> tissues are preserved as thin films of <span class="underline">carbon</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>Leaves and <span class="underline">tissue</span> of soft-bodied organisms such as <span class="underline">jellyfish</span> or worms may <span class="underline">accumulate</span>, become buried and compressed, and lose their <span class="underline">volatile</span> constituents. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>The <span class="underline">carbon</span> often remains behind as a blackened silhouette. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p>
          <p>Although it is certainly true that the <span class="underline">possession</span> of hard parts enhances the <span class="underline">prospect</span> of <span class="underline">preservation</span>, organisms having <span class="underline">soft</span> tissues and organs are also occasionally preserved. Insects and <span class="underline">even</span> small invertebrates have been found preserved in the hardened resins of conifers and certain other trees. X-ray examination of thin slabs of rock sometimes reveals the ghostly outlines of tentacles, <span class="underline">digestive</span> tracts, and <span class="underline">visual</span> organs of a <span class="underline">variety</span> of <span class="underline">marine</span> creatures. <span class="underline">Soft</span> parts, including skin, hair, and viscera of ice age mammoths, have been preserved in frozen soil or in the oozing tar of oil seeps.</p>
          <p>The probability that actual remains of <span class="underline">soft</span> <span class="underline">tissue</span> will be preserved is improved if the <span class="underline">organism</span> dies in an environment of rapid <span class="underline">deposition</span> and <span class="underline">oxygen</span> deprivation. Under such conditions, the <span class="underline">destructive</span> effects of <span class="underline">bacteria</span> are <span class="underline">diminished</span>. The Middle Eocene Messel <span class="underline">Shale</span> (from about 48 million years ago) of Germany accumulated in such an environment. The <span class="underline">shale</span> was deposited in an oxygen-deficient lake where <span class="underline">lethal</span> gases sometimes bubbled up and killed animals. Their remains accumulated on the floor of the lake and were then covered by <span class="underline">clay</span> and <span class="underline">silt</span>. Among the superbly preserved Messel fossils are insects with iridescent exoskeletons (hard outer coverings), frogs with skin and blood vessels <span class="underline">intact</span>, and <span class="underline">even</span> entire small mammals with preserved <span class="underline">fur</span> and <span class="underline">soft</span> <span class="underline">tissue</span>.</p>
