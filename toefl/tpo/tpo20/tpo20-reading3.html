Attack by scavengers and <span class="highlight">bacteria</span>, chemical <span class="highlight">decay</span>, and <span class="highlight">destruction</span> by <span class="highlight">erosion</span> and other geologic <span class="highlight question1">agencies</span> make the odds against <span class="highlight">preservation</span> very high. However, the chances of escaping complete <span class="highlight">destruction</span> are vastly improved if the <span class="highlight">organism</span> happens to have a mineralized <span class="highlight">skeleton</span> and dies in a place where it can be quickly buried by <span class="highlight">sediment</span>. Both of these conditions are often found on the ocean floors, where shelled invertebrates (organisms without spines) <span class="highlight">flourish</span> and are covered by the <span class="highlight">continuous</span> rain of <span class="highlight">sedimentary</span> particles. Although most fossils are found in <span class="highlight">marine</span><span class="highlight">sedimentary</span> rocks, they also are found in <span class="highlight"><span class="question3">terrestrial</span></span> deposits left by streams and lakes. On occasion, animals and plants have been preserved after becoming immersed in tar or quicksand, trapped in ice or <span class="highlight">lava</span> flows, or engulfed by rapid falls of <span class="highlight">volcanic</span> ash.</p><p>The <span class="highlight">term</span> "fossil" often implies <span class="highlight">petrifaction</span>, <span class="highlight">literally</span> a <span class="highlight">transformation</span> into stone. After the death of an <span class="highlight">organism</span>, the <span class="highlight">soft</span><span class="highlight">tissue</span> is ordinarily consumed by scavengers and <span class="highlight">bacteria</span>. <span class="question4">The empty <span class="highlight">shell</span> of a snail or <span class="highlight">clam</span> may be left behind, and if it is <span class="highlight">sufficiently</span><span class="highlight">durable</span> and <span class="highlight">resistant</span> to dissolution, it may <span class="highlight">remain</span> basically unchanged for a long period of time.</span> Indeed, unaltered shells of <span class="highlight">marine</span> invertebrates are known from deposits over 100 million years old. In many <span class="highlight">marine</span> creatures, however, the <span class="highlight">skeleton</span> is composed of a <span class="highlight">mineral</span><span class="highlight">variety</span> of <span class="highlight">calcium</span><span class="highlight">carbonate</span> called <span class="question5">aragonite</span>. Although aragonite has the same <span class="highlight">composition</span> as the more <span class="highlight">familiar</span><span class="highlight">mineral</span> known as calcite, it has a different <span class="highlight">crystal</span> form, is <span class="highlight">relatively</span> unstable, and in time changes to the more <span class="highlight">stable</span> calcite.</p><p>Many other processes may after the <span class="highlight">shell</span> of a <span class="highlight">clam</span> or snail and <span class="highlight"><span class="question6">enhance</span></span> its chances for <span class="highlight">preservation</span>. Water containing dissolved <span class="highlight">silica</span>, <span class="highlight">calcium</span><span class="highlight">carbonate</span>, or iron may <span class="highlight">circulate</span><span class="highlight">through</span> the enclosing <span class="highlight">sediment</span> and be deposited in cavities such as marrow cavities and canals in bone once occupied by blood vessels and nerves. In such cases, the <span class="highlight">original</span><span class="highlight">composition</span> of the bone or <span class="highlight">shell</span> remains, but the <span class="highlight">fossil</span> is made harder and more <span class="highlight">durable</span>. This <span class="highlight">addition</span> of a chemically precipitated <span class="highlight">substance</span> into <span class="highlight">pore</span> spaces is termed "permineralization."</p><p><span class="highlight">Petrifaction</span> may also <span class="highlight">involve</span> a <span class="highlight">simultaneous</span><span class="highlight">exchange</span> of the <span class="highlight">original</span><span class="highlight">substance</span> of a dead plant or animal with <span class="highlight">mineral</span> matter of a different <span class="highlight">composition</span>. This <span class="highlight">process</span> is termed " replacement" because solutions have dissolved the <span class="highlight">original</span><span class="highlight">material</span> and replaced it with an <span class="highlight">equal</span><span class="highlight">volume</span> of the new <span class="highlight">substance</span>. Replacement can be a marvelously <span class="highlight"><span class="question8">precise</span></span><span class="highlight">process</span>, so that details of <span class="highlight">shell</span> ornamentation, tree rings in wood, and <span class="highlight">delicate</span> structures in bone are accurately preserved.</p><p><span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>Another type of <span class="highlight">fossilization</span>, known as carbonization, occurs when <span class="highlight">soft</span> tissues are preserved as thin films of <span class="highlight">carbon</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>Leaves and <span class="highlight">tissue</span> of soft-bodied organisms such as <span class="highlight">jellyfish</span> or worms may <span class="highlight">accumulate</span>, become buried and compressed, and lose their <span class="highlight">volatile</span> constituents. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>The <span class="highlight">carbon</span> often remains behind as a blackened silhouette. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p><p>Although it is certainly true that the <span class="highlight">possession</span> of hard parts enhances the <span class="highlight"><span class="question10">prospect</span></span> of <span class="highlight">preservation</span>, organisms having <span class="highlight">soft</span> tissues and organs are also occasionally preserved. Insects and <span class="highlight">even</span> small invertebrates have been found preserved in the hardened resins of conifers and certain other trees. X-ray examination of thin slabs of rock sometimes reveals the ghostly outlines of tentacles, <span class="highlight">digestive</span> tracts, and <span class="highlight">visual</span> organs of a <span class="highlight">variety</span> of <span class="highlight">marine</span> creatures. <span class="highlight">Soft</span> parts, including skin, hair, and viscera of ice age mammoths, have been preserved in frozen soil or in the oozing tar of oil seeps.</p><p>The probability that actual remains of <span class="highlight">soft</span><span class="highlight">tissue</span> will be preserved is improved if the <span class="highlight">organism</span> dies in an environment of rapid <span class="highlight">deposition</span> and <span class="highlight">oxygen</span> deprivation. Under such conditions, the <span class="highlight">destructive</span> effects of <span class="highlight">bacteria</span> are <span class="highlight">diminished</span>. The Middle Eocene Messel <span class="highlight">Shale</span> (from about 48 million years ago) of Germany accumulated in such an environment. The <span class="highlight">shale</span> was deposited in an oxygen-deficient lake where <span class="highlight">lethal</span> gases sometimes bubbled up and killed animals. Their remains accumulated on the floor of the lake and were then covered by <span class="highlight">clay</span> and <span class="highlight">silt</span>. Among the superbly preserved Messel fossils are insects with iridescent exoskeletons (hard outer coverings), frogs with skin and blood vessels <span class="highlight">intact</span>, and <span class="highlight">even</span> entire small mammals with preserved <span class="highlight">fur</span> and <span class="highlight">soft</span><span class="highlight">tissue</span>.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">agencies</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. combinations</p><p>B. problems</p><p>C. forces</p><p>D. changes</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C agency: power, agency. A option is a combination; B is a problem; C is a power; D is a change. So the answer is C's force.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>In paragraph 1, what is the author's purpose in providing examples of how organisms are destroyed?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To emphasize how surprising it is that so many fossils exist</p><p>B. To introduce a new geologic theory of fossil preservation</p><p>C. To explain why the fossil record until now has remained incomplete</p><p>D. To compare how fossils form on land and in water</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A rhetorical purpose question, where the rhetorical phrase is an example. In the past, the previous sentence said that the destruction of fossils is just as much as fossil, followed by a lot of destruction methods, so the answer is A, explain why so much destruction There are so many fossils below. Looking back, the next sentence says that if fossils have skeletons, chances of being retained will increase greatly, that is, they are always saying that fossils will survive, so A is the correct answer.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question3">terrestrial</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. land</p><p>B. protected</p><p>C. alternative</p><p>D. similar</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" A"><p>A, <span class="question3">terrestrial</span>: <span class="question3">terrestrial</span>, <span class="question3">terrestrial</span>. A is land; B is protected; C is optional; D is similar. So the correct answer is A.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. When snail or clam shells are left behind, they must be empty in order to remain durable and resist dissolution.</p><p>B. Although snail and clam shells are durable and resist dissolving, over time they slowly begin to change.</p><p>C. Although the soft parts of snails or clams dissolve quickly, their hard shells resist dissolution for a long time.</p><p>D. Empty snail or clam shells that are strong enough not to dissolve may stay in their original state for a long time.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The structure of the D original sentence is parallel and conditional. The parallel parts are: 1.shell/clam will be left; 2) remain unchanged. The conditions in the conditional logic are "have enough persistent resistance to decomposition." So the correct answer is D. A's must be empty did not say; the logical relationship between B and C is wrong, and the original sentence has no turning; D said that the shell will be left. If it is sufficiently corrosion resistant, it can be stored for a while.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the author mention "<span class="highlight">aragonite</span>" in the passage?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To emphasize that some fossils remain unaltered for millions of years</p><p>B. To contrast fossil formation in organisms with soft tissue and in organisms with hard shells</p><p>C. To explain that some marine organisms must undergo chemical changes in order to fossilize</p><p>D. To explain why fossil shells are more likely to survive than are fossil skeletons</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C. A rhetorical question. First look at the sentence where the example is located. Say that many marine organisms have calcite in their bones. There is no answer. Looking ahead, the previous sentence says that sea invertebrate animals can be found in sediments 100 million years ago. Corresponds to the A pair, but the example itself says that the composition of aragonite is not stable, so the example is not used to support the previous sentence, A is not right; the emphasis is on the next sentence of the sentence in which the example is located, and the crystal shape of the arogonite is said Different, relatively less stable, will become a more stable form, so the answer is C. If you want to be stable, you must change again. B and D did not say anything at all.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">enhance</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. control</p><p>B. limit</p><p>C. combine</p><p>D. increase</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D enhance: increase, increase, increase. A is the control; B is the limit; C is the bond; D is the increase, increase. So the correct answer is D's increase.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the following best explains the process of permineralization mentioned in paragraph 3?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Water containing calcium carbonate circulates through a shell and deposits sediment.</p><p>B. Liquid containing chemicals hardens an already existing fossil structure.</p><p>C. Water passes through sediment surrounding a fossil and removes its chemical content.</p><p>D. A chemical substance enters a fossil and changes its shape.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B. Use permineralization as a key word to locate the last sentence. The process of adding a chemically precipitated substance to a precipitate is called permineralization. This refers to the previous article. In the past, the former said that the gaps occupied by blood vessels and nerves are filled with water containing various substances, and the bones and shells are left behind and changed. It is stronger, so the answer is B and it becomes harder. A's inclusion of calcium is not comprehensive, and the original text is not hardened; neither C's removal chemical content nor D's change shape is said.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question8">precise</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. complex</p><p>B. quick</p><p>C. exact</p><p>D. reliable</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" C"><p>C <span class="question8">precise</span>: <span class="question8">precise</span>. A is complex; B is fast; C is accurate; D is reliable. So C's exact is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Paragraph 5 suggests which of the following about the carbonization process?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It is completed soon after an organism dies.</p><p>B. It does not occur in hard-shell organisms.</p><p>C. It sometimes allows soft-tissued organisms to be preserved with all their parts.</p><p>D. It is a more precise process of preservation than is replacement.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B This paragraph is short and it can be completely swept quickly. A mistake, the original saying that life will go through a number of processes after the death of carbonization, so A's suddenly obvious mistake; B correct, the text clearly states that carbonization occurs in the soft tissue, of course, it will not happen in hard shell animals; C's All their parts and D's comparison of the original did not say, are wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question10">prospect</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. completion</p><p>B. variety</p><p>C. possibility</p><p>D. speed</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" C"><p>C <span class="question10">prospect</span>: possibility, hope. Changing the word also has the meaning of the foreground, but the original text is the meaning of possibility. A is done; B is diverse; C is possibility; D is speed. So C's possibility is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 7, how do environments containing oxygen affect fossil preservation?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They increase the probability that soft-tissued organisms will become fossils.</p><p>B. They lead to more bacteria production.</p><p>C. They slow the rate at which clay and silt are deposited.</p><p>D. They reduce the chance that animal remains will be preserved.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D uses oxygen as the key word to locate the first sentence, saying that if the burial is rapid and the probability of fossil preservation increases in an oxygen-deficient environment, that is, the presence of oxygen is not conducive to the preservation of fossils, so the correct answer is D, A. Contrary to D, A is wrong. It also shows that there is a pair of two opposites. C is completely silent. B is wrong. The original text says that lack of oxygen can reduce the destructive effect of bacteria, but it does not mean that aerobic bacteria will change. More, so B did not say.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the passage, all of the following assist in fossil preservation EXCEPT</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. the presence of calcite in an organism's skeleton</p><p>B. the presence of large open areas along an ocean floor</p><p>C. the deposition of a fossil in sticky substances such as sap or tar</p><p>D. the rapid burial of an organism under layers of silt</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B, EXCEPT questions, exclusion, due to the full text, should pay attention to the beginning of each paragraph. A skeleton and calcite keyword positioning to the first sentence of the sixth paragraph, correct, not selected; B of the ocean floor in the original text, although there is no open areas, so B wrong, election; C sap or tar key Word positioning to the last sentence of the sixth paragraph, correct, not selected; D's rapid burial and layer of silt keyword positioning to the first sentence of the seventh paragraph, correct, not selected.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>But the evidence of past organic life is not limited to petrifaction..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A. If you find a noun transition, the petrification is the easiest to find, but unfortunately, there is neither petrification nor synonym replacement in the whole paragraph. The first paragraph of this paragraph has already begun to say carbonization, that is, petrification should be the last paragraph or the next paragraph. Say, that is, A or D is correct, but the sentence to be inserted is not limited to, that is, it has been said before petrification, so A is wrong with D.</p></div></div><div id="question14" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>
The remains of ancient life are amazingly well preserved in the form of fossils.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.Environmental characteristics like those present on ocean floors increase the likelihood that plant and animal fossils will occur.</p><p>B.The shells of organisms can be preserved by processes of chemical precipitation or mineral exchange.</p><p>C.Comparatively few fossils are found in the terrestrial deposits of streams and lakes.</p><p>D.Fossils are more likely to the preserved in shale deposits than in deposits of clay and silt.</p><p>E.Freezing enables the soft parts of organisms to survive longer than the hard parts.</p><p>F.Thin films of carbon may remain as an indication of soft tissue or actual tissue may be preserved if exposure to bacteria is limited</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="ABF"><p>The ABF Environmental option corresponds to the third sentence of the first paragraph of the original text. Correct. The comparison of the Fossils option does not say, do not select. The shells option corresponds to the last sentence of the third paragraph of the original text and the beginning of the fourth paragraph. The correct .Freezing option is in the sixth paragraph of the original text. At the end of the band, I mention it, but I didn't say it. I didn't select it. The Compare option negatively corresponds to the first sentence of the first paragraph of the original text. Do not select. The films option corresponds to the beginning of the fifth and seventh paragraphs of the original text.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
