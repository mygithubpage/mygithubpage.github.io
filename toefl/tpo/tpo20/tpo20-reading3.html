          <h4 class="w3-center">Fossil Preservation</h4>
          <p>When one considers the many ways by which organisms are completely destroyed after death, it is <span class="highlight">remarkable</span> that fossils are as <span class="highlight">common</span> as they are. Attack by scavengers and <span class="highlight">bacteria</span>, chemical <span class="highlight">decay</span>, and <span class="highlight">destruction</span> by <span class="highlight">erosion</span> and other geologic <span class="highlight question1">agencies</span> make the odds against <span class="highlight">preservation</span> very high. However, the chances of escaping complete <span class="highlight">destruction</span> are vastly improved if the <span class="highlight">organism</span> happens to have a mineralized <span class="highlight">skeleton</span> and dies in a place where it can be quickly buried by <span class="highlight">sediment</span>. Both of these conditions are often found on the ocean floors, where shelled invertebrates (organisms without spines) <span class="highlight">flourish</span> and are covered by the <span class="highlight">continuous</span> rain of <span class="highlight">sedimentary</span> particles. Although most fossils are found in <span class="highlight">marine</span> <span class="highlight">sedimentary</span> rocks, they also are found in <span class="highlight"><span class="question3">terrestrial</span></span> deposits left by streams and lakes. On occasion, animals and plants have been preserved after becoming immersed in tar or quicksand, trapped in ice or <span class="highlight">lava</span> flows, or engulfed by rapid falls of <span class="highlight">volcanic</span> ash.</p>
          <p>The <span class="highlight">term</span> "fossil" often implies <span class="highlight">petrifaction</span>, <span class="highlight">literally</span> a <span class="highlight">transformation</span> into stone. After the death of an <span class="highlight">organism</span>, the <span class="highlight">soft</span> <span class="highlight">tissue</span> is ordinarily consumed by scavengers and <span class="highlight">bacteria</span>. <span class="question4">The empty <span class="highlight">shell</span> of a snail or <span class="highlight">clam</span> may be left behind, and if it is <span class="highlight">sufficiently</span> <span class="highlight">durable</span> and <span class="highlight">resistant</span> to dissolution, it may <span class="highlight">remain</span> basically unchanged for a long period of time.</span> Indeed, unaltered shells of <span class="highlight">marine</span> invertebrates are known from deposits over 100 million years old. In many <span class="highlight">marine</span> creatures, however, the <span class="highlight">skeleton</span> is composed of a <span class="highlight">mineral</span> <span class="highlight">variety</span> of <span class="highlight">calcium</span> <span class="highlight">carbonate</span> called <span class="question5">aragonite</span>. Although aragonite has the same <span class="highlight">composition</span> as the more <span class="highlight">familiar</span> <span class="highlight">mineral</span> known as calcite, it has a different <span class="highlight">crystal</span> form, is <span class="highlight">relatively</span> unstable, and in time changes to the more <span class="highlight">stable</span> calcite.</p>
          <p>Many other processes may after the <span class="highlight">shell</span> of a <span class="highlight">clam</span> or snail and <span class="highlight"><span class="question6">enhance</span></span> its chances for <span class="highlight">preservation</span>. Water containing dissolved <span class="highlight">silica</span>, <span class="highlight">calcium</span> <span class="highlight">carbonate</span>, or iron may <span class="highlight">circulate</span> <span class="highlight">through</span> the enclosing <span class="highlight">sediment</span> and be deposited in cavities such as marrow cavities and canals in bone once occupied by blood vessels and nerves. In such cases, the <span class="highlight">original</span> <span class="highlight">composition</span> of the bone or <span class="highlight">shell</span> remains, but the <span class="highlight">fossil</span> is made harder and more <span class="highlight">durable</span>. This <span class="highlight">addition</span> of a chemically precipitated <span class="highlight">substance</span> into <span class="highlight">pore</span> spaces is termed "permineralization."</p>
          <p>
            <span class="highlight">Petrifaction</span> may also <span class="highlight">involve</span> a <span class="highlight">simultaneous</span> <span class="highlight">exchange</span> of the <span class="highlight">original</span> <span class="highlight">substance</span> of a dead plant or animal with <span class="highlight">mineral</span> matter of a different <span class="highlight">composition</span>. This <span class="highlight">process</span> is termed " replacement" because solutions have dissolved the <span class="highlight">original</span> <span class="highlight">material</span> and replaced it with an <span class="highlight">equal</span> <span class="highlight">volume</span> of the new <span class="highlight">substance</span>. Replacement can be a marvelously <span class="highlight"><span class="question8">precise</span></span> <span class="highlight">process</span>, so that details of <span class="highlight">shell</span> ornamentation, tree rings in wood, and <span class="highlight">delicate</span> structures in bone are accurately preserved.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A">
            </span>Another type of <span class="highlight">fossilization</span>, known as carbonization, occurs when <span class="highlight">soft</span> tissues are preserved as thin films of <span class="highlight">carbon</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>Leaves and <span class="highlight">tissue</span> of soft-bodied organisms such as <span class="highlight">jellyfish</span> or worms may <span class="highlight">accumulate</span>, become buried and compressed, and lose their <span class="highlight">volatile</span> constituents. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>The <span class="highlight">carbon</span> often remains behind as a blackened silhouette. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p>
          <p>Although it is certainly true that the <span class="highlight">possession</span> of hard parts enhances the <span class="highlight"><span class="question10">prospect</span></span> of <span class="highlight">preservation</span>, organisms having <span class="highlight">soft</span> tissues and organs are also occasionally preserved. Insects and <span class="highlight">even</span> small invertebrates have been found preserved in the hardened resins of conifers and certain other trees. X-ray examination of thin slabs of rock sometimes reveals the ghostly outlines of tentacles, <span class="highlight">digestive</span> tracts, and <span class="highlight">visual</span> organs of a <span class="highlight">variety</span> of <span class="highlight">marine</span> creatures. <span class="highlight">Soft</span> parts, including skin, hair, and viscera of ice age mammoths, have been preserved in frozen soil or in the oozing tar of oil seeps.</p>
          <p>The probability that actual remains of <span class="highlight">soft</span> <span class="highlight">tissue</span> will be preserved is improved if the <span class="highlight">organism</span> dies in an environment of rapid <span class="highlight">deposition</span> and <span class="highlight">oxygen</span> deprivation. Under such conditions, the <span class="highlight">destructive</span> effects of <span class="highlight">bacteria</span> are <span class="highlight">diminished</span>. The Middle Eocene Messel <span class="highlight">Shale</span> (from about 48 million years ago) of Germany accumulated in such an environment. The <span class="highlight">shale</span> was deposited in an oxygen-deficient lake where <span class="highlight">lethal</span> gases sometimes bubbled up and killed animals. Their remains accumulated on the floor of the lake and were then covered by <span class="highlight">clay</span> and <span class="highlight">silt</span>. Among the superbly preserved Messel fossils are insects with iridescent exoskeletons (hard outer coverings), frogs with skin and blood vessels <span class="highlight">intact</span>, and <span class="highlight">even</span> entire small mammals with preserved <span class="highlight">fur</span> and <span class="highlight">soft</span> <span class="highlight">tissue</span>.</p>

              <p>A rhetorical purpose question, where the rhetorical phrase is an example. In the past, the previous sentence said that the destruction of fossils is just as much as fossil, followed by a lot of destruction methods, so the answer is A, explain why so much destruction There are so many fossils below. Looking back, the next sentence says that if fossils have skeletons, chances of being retained will increase greatly, that is, they are always saying that fossils will survive, so A is the correct answer.</p>

              <p>C. A rhetorical question. First look at the sentence where the example is located. Say that many marine organisms have calcite in their bones. There is no answer. Looking ahead, the previous sentence says that sea invertebrate animals can be found in sediments 100 million years ago. Corresponds to the A pair, but the example itself says that the composition of aragonite is not stable, so the example is not used to support the previous sentence, A is not right; the emphasis is on the next sentence of the sentence in which the example is located, and the crystal shape of the arogonite is said Different, relatively less stable, will become a more stable form, so the answer is C. If you want to be stable, you must change again. B and D did not say anything at all.</p>

              <p>B. Use permineralization as a key word to locate the last sentence. The process of adding a chemically precipitated substance to a precipitate is called permineralization. This refers to the previous article. In the past, the former said that the gaps occupied by blood vessels and nerves are filled with water containing various substances, and the bones and shells are left behind and changed. It is stronger, so the answer is B and it becomes harder. A's inclusion of calcium is not comprehensive, and the original text is not hardened; neither C's removal chemical content nor D's change shape is said.</p>
