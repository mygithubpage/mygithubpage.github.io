          <p>In the United States, it had been common practice since the late 1960s no to suppress natural forest fires. The "let it burn" policy assumed that forest fire would burn themselves out quickly, without causing much damage. However, in the summer of 1988, forest fires in Yellowstone, the most famous national park in the country, burned for more than two months and spread over a huge area, encompassing more than 800,000 acres. Because of the large scale of the damage, many people called for replacing the "let it burn" policy with a policy of extinguishing forest fires as soon as they appeared. Three kinds of damage caused by the "let it burn" policy were emphasized by critics of the policy. First, Yellowstone fires caused tremendous damage to the park's trees and other vegetation. When the fires finally died out, nearly one third of Yellowstone's land had been scorched. Trees were charred and blackened from flames and smoke. Smaller plants were entirely incinerated. What had been a national treasure now seemed like a devastated wasteland. Second, the park wildlife was affected as well. Large animals like deer and elk were seen fleeing the fire. Many smaller species were probably unable to escape. There was also concern that the destruction of habitats and the disruption of food chains would make it impossible for the animals that survived the fire to return. Third, the fires compromised the value of the park as a tourist attraction, which in turn had negative consequences for the local economy. With several thousand acres of the park engulfed in flames, the tourist season was cut short, and a large number of visitors decided to stay away. Of course, local businesses that depended on park visitors suffered as a result. </p>

          <p>Actually fires are natural part of ecological cycle and their role is not just destructive but also creative. That is why the "let it burn" policy is fundamentally a good one, even if it sometimes causes fires of the 1988 Yellowstone fire. Let's look at what happened after 1988 Yellowstone fire.First, vegetation. As you might imagine, scorched areas were in time colonized by new plants. As a matter of fact, the plants in Yellowstone became more diverse because the fire created an opportunity for certain plants that could not grow otherwise. For example, areas where the trees have been destroyed by fire could now be taken over by smaller plants that needed open and shaded space to grow. And another example, seeds of certain plants species won't germinate unless they're exposed to very high levels of heat. So, those plants started appearing after the fire as well. It's a similar story with the animals.Not only did their population recover, but the fire also created new opportunities. For instance, the small plants that replaced trees after the fire created an ideal habitat for certain small animals like rabbits and hares. And when rabbits and hares started thriving, so did some predators that depended on them for food. So, certain food chains actually became stronger after the fire than they were before.And last, fires like 19888 Yellowstone fire would be a problem for tourism if they happened every year. But they don't. It was a very unusual combination of factors that year, low rainfall, unusually strong winds, accumulation of dry undergrowth that caused fire to be so massive. This combination has not occurred since and Yellowstone has not seen such a fire since 1988. Visitors came back to the park next year and each year after that. </p>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>

          <p>The reading passage argues that the "let it burn" policy should be replaced by the policy of extinguishing forest fires as soon as they appeared. However, the professor raises serious counterarguments against the reading paragraph by providing three aspects as listed below:</p>
          <p>First, according to the speaker, the natural forest fires are a cycle of creative even they have a large scale of the damage, and after the fires, new plants which became more diverse than before existed in the Yellowstone. For example, some big plants were replaced by the small ones appeared in the Yellowstone due to the open and shaded lands. Another example is that it was a better place for certain seeds thanks to the high level of the heat. This point directly contradicts what the passage indicates.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Second, the reading passage states that the fire was a destruction of habitats and the disruption of the food chain. The professor, however, stated that the population had already recovered, and created some ideal habitats for the small animals such as rabbits and hares. Moreover, since the rabbits and hares began to live there, the predators who lived on them came to live in the Yellowstone, too. Therefore, certain food chain was stronger than before. This is another point where the listening opposes the reading passage.</p>
          <p>Third, quite different from what had been stated in the reading passage, the lecturer said that the fire in 1988 was quite unusual and it did not happen every year. Moreover, the massive fire was caused by the low rain fall and the strong wind, which would not occur again. Besides, the victors still come back to the Yellowstone next year and each year after that. This point refutes the view stated in the reading passage.</p>
