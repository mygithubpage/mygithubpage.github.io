Typical features of the snowshoe hare that do not result from adaption.</p><p>B. Various strategies used by snowshoe hares to find food during the winter.</p><p>C. Characteristics that snowshoe hares have developed in response to their environment.</p><p>D. Interactions between snowshoe hares and human populations in the state of Maine.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>And in adapting to extreme climates, like Maine in the winter time, animals can evolve in pretty interesting ways. Take, for example, the snowshoe hare.</p><p>Through the whole article can see that this article mainly describes an animal, through the characteristics to adapt to harsh environments.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor, what causes the snowshoe hare's fur to begin turning white?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. A decrease in the hours that the Sun is up each day.</p><p>B. A sudden drop in temperature.</p><p>C. The increasing amount of snow on the ground.</p><p>D. The changing nature of the food supply.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>And it's the amount of daylight that triggers the changing of the hare's coat. As the days get shorter , that is, as the Sun is up for a shorter and shorter time each day, the snowshoe hare starts growing white fur and shedding its brown fur From the above it can be seen that the fur discoloration of the snowshoe hare is related to the length of sunshine in a day.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why might an early snowfall be a particular dangerous time for the snowshoe hare?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Its feet would not yet have grown to resemble snowshoes.</p><p>B. Its babies would not yet be able to keep themselves warms.</p><p>C. Its chances of being seen by a predator are much higher.</p><p>D. It might not be able to locate whether it stored its food supply.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Professor: ... So one of its adaptations is basically camouflage. In other words, its coat, its fur, turns from brown in the summer to white in the winter, which makes it harder for the hare's predators to see it against the white Snow. ... ... So if there's a very early snowfall, it's very likely that the hare's fur would not yet be totally white. And that would have made this a particularly dangerous time for the hare. As early as the hare's hair has not completely turned white, it is very dangerous, and it is easy to be discovered by natural enemies.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The professor implies that the snowshoe hare has an advantage over other animals because of its unusual feet. What is that advantage?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It can reach food in higher locations better than its competitors.</p><p>B. It can stay warm in cold weather longer than its competitors.</p><p>C. It can outrun its predators in deep snow.</p><p>D. It can dig under the snow to hid from its predators.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>I mean, it's paws are wide and they allow the hare to hop and run just at the surface of deep snow. From the explanation it can be seen that due to the characteristics of the snowshoe hare paw, it can make it escape the predator's hunt on the snow-covered ground. .</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The professor explains that the snowshoe hare's supply is available year-round. What does the availability of the food allow the snow shoe hare to do?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Store body fat for the cold months.</p><p>B. Remain lightweight through the winter.</p><p>C. Give birth during the winter.</p><p>D. Grow fur quickly during the first year after birth.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Well, yes. But not because there isn't enough food around. It's because, like I said, food is almost always within reach, and they don't have to store up a lot of food energy for the harsh winters.</p><p>From the presentation, it can be seen that hare can stay lean and light weight, and the B option echoes.</p></div></div><div class="replay" id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the student say this:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

So one of its adaptations is basically camouflage. In other words, its coat, its fur , turns from brown in the summer to white in the winter , which makes it harder for the hare's predators to see it against the white Snow.</p><p>Student: Yeah, but I could swear I remembered seeing rabbits in the snow a couple of times, I means hares, that were brown.</p><p>It can be seen from the original text that students think that their experience is in conflict with the content taught by the professor.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
