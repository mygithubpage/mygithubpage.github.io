            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.57" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in a <span class="underline">biology</span> class. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.41" data-time="5.57">[00:05.57]</span>Professor: Now, James, you said you had been to the <span class="underline">State</span> of Maine, right? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.84" data-time="9.98">[00:09.98]</span>Student: Yeah, actually I lived in western Maine until I was about sixteen. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.34" data-time="13.82">[00:13.82]</span>Professor: Great. So why don't you tell everybody what is like there in the winter? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.21" data-time="18.16">[00:18.16]</span>Student: The winter? Well, it's cold. <span class="time" data-times="3.97" data-time="21.37">[00:21.37]</span>And there's lots of snow, you wouldn't believe how much snow we used to get. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.51" data-time="25.34">[00:25.34]</span>Professor: Actually I would. <span class="time" data-times="2.56" data-time="26.85">[00:26.85]</span>I did <span class="underline">field</span> research up there a <span class="underline">couple</span> of winters. <span class="time" data-times="2.77" data-time="29.41">[00:29.41]</span>And it really is an <span class="underline">incredible</span> environment. <span class="time" data-times="7.68" data-time="32.18">[00:32.18]</span>And to <span class="underline">survive</span> in that <span class="underline">sort</span> of environment, animals have to <span class="underline">adapt</span>, to <span class="underline">evolve</span> in <span class="underline">response</span> to their surroundings. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.5" data-time="39.86">[00:39.86]</span>As you <span class="underline">recall</span>, an <span class="underline">adaptation</span> is any feature, um... <span class="underline">physical</span> or <span class="underline">behavioral</span> feature of a <span class="underline">species</span> that helps it <span class="underline">survive</span> and <span class="underline">reproduce</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.68" data-time="50.36">[00:50.36]</span>And in adapting to <span class="underline">extreme</span> climates, like Maine in the winter time, animals can <span class="underline">evolve</span> in <span class="underline">pretty</span> interesting ways. <span class="time" data-times="3.37" data-time="58.04">[00:58.04]</span>Take, for example, the snowshoe hare. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.06" data-time="61.41">[01:01.41]</span>Ok, the snowshoe hare, and of <span class="underline">course</span>, that's H-A-R-E, like a rabbit. <span class="time" data-times="8.36" data-time="68.47">[01:08.47]</span>Although I probably should <span class="underline">mention</span> that technically a hare is not exactly the same as a rabbit, <span class="underline">even</span> though it is very <span class="underline">similar</span>. <span class="time" data-times="10" data-time="76.83">[01:16.83]</span>The <span class="underline">primary</span> <span class="underline">difference</span> is that a rabbit's young are born <span class="underline">blind</span> and without <span class="underline">fur</span>, while a hare's babies are born with a full coat and able to see. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.13" data-time="86.83">[01:26.83]</span>Now, the snowshoe hare, tell me, what <span class="underline">sort</span> of adaptations do you think it has developed that help it <span class="underline">survive</span> the Maine winters? <span class="time" data-times="1.44" data-time="96.96">[01:36.96]</span>I'll give you a <span class="underline">hint</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.25" data-time="98.4">[01:38.40]</span>Food isn't an <span class="underline">issue</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.87" data-time="100.65">[01:40.65]</span>The hare actually has <span class="underline">abundant</span> food in the small twigs it finds. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.43" data-time="104.52">[01:44.52]</span>Student: Well, I don't know. <span class="time" data-times="8.1" data-time="105.95">[01:45.95]</span>I mean, I know we used to try to look for these rabbits, eh... hares, when we went hiking in the winter, but it was often hard to find them in the snow. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.25" data-time="114.05">[01:54.05]</span>Professor: Yes. That's exactly right. <span class="time" data-times="4.31" data-time="116.3">[01:56.30]</span>The <span class="underline">major</span> <span class="underline">concern</span> of the snowshoe hare in the winter is predators. <span class="time" data-times="2.35" data-time="120.61">[02:00.61]</span>And now that includes humans. <span class="time" data-times="3.97" data-time="122.96">[02:02.96]</span>So one of its adaptations is basically <span class="underline">camouflage</span>. <span class="time" data-times="11.6" data-time="126.93">[02:06.93]</span>In other words, its coat, its <span class="underline">fur</span>, turns from brown in the summer to white in the winter, which makes it harder for the hare's predators to see it against the white snow.  </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.51" data-time="138.53">[02:18.53]</span>Student: Yeah, but I could <span class="underline">swear</span> I remembered seeing rabbits in the snow a <span class="underline">couple</span> of times, I means hares, that were brown. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.03" data-time="145.04">[02:25.04]</span>Professor: Well, you may very well have. <span class="time" data-times="5.64" data-time="147.07">[02:27.07]</span>Timing is really important, but the snowshoe hare doesn't always get it exactly right. <span class="time" data-times="5.1" data-time="152.71">[02:32.71]</span>Its chances for <span class="underline">survival</span> are best if it turns white about the time of the first snowfall. <span class="time" data-times="4.85" data-time="157.81">[02:37.81]</span>And it's the <span class="underline">amount</span> of <span class="underline">daylight</span> that triggers the changing of the hare's coat. <span class="time" data-times="10.61" data-time="162.66">[02:42.66]</span>As the days get shorter, that is, as the Sun is up for a shorter and shorter time each day, the snowshoe hare starts growing white <span class="underline">fur</span> and shedding its brown <span class="underline">fur</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.59" data-time="173.27">[02:53.27]</span>The hare does a <span class="underline">pretty</span> good job with its timing, but sometimes when there's a really early or late snow, it stands out. <span class="time" data-times="5.18" data-time="181.86">[03:01.86]</span>Plus, it takes about a month for the snowshoe hare's coat to completely change color. <span class="time" data-times="6.71" data-time="187.04">[03:07.04]</span>So if there's a particularly early snowfall, it's very likely that the hare's <span class="underline">fur</span> would not yet be totally white. <span class="time" data-times="4.1" data-time="193.75">[03:13.75]</span>And that would make this a particularly dangerous time for the hare. <span class="time" data-times="5.49" data-time="197.85">[03:17.85]</span>OK. What else? Other adaptations? Susan? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.53" data-time="203.34">[03:23.34]</span>Student: Well, it's called the snowshoe hare, so are its feet somehow protect it from the cold? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.8" data-time="209.87">[03:29.87]</span>Professor: Well, this animal's name does have to do with an <span class="underline">adaptation</span> of its feet. <span class="time" data-times="5.44" data-time="214.67">[03:34.67]</span>Uh... though, not like it has warm <span class="underline">furry</span> boots or something to keep its feet from getting cold. <span class="time" data-times="3.3" data-time="220.11">[03:40.11]</span>You've probably never needed to <span class="underline">wear</span> snowshoes. <span class="time" data-times="9.34" data-time="223.41">[03:43.41]</span>But, well, snowshoes are not like thick <span class="underline">furry</span> shoes designed to keep the feet warm, they are actually quite thin, but very wide. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.38" data-time="232.75">[03:52.75]</span>What they do is <span class="underline">spread</span> out the weight of the foot coming down on the snow. <span class="time" data-times="4.7" data-time="237.13">[03:57.13]</span>See, the problem with walking on snow is that you sink in with every step.<span class="time" data-times="4.66" data-time="241.83">[04:01.83]</span>But with snowshoes, you don't sink in, you walk on top of the snow. <span class="time" data-times="3.91" data-time="246.49">[04:06.49]</span>It makes walking <span class="underline">through</span> the Maine countryside in the winter much easier. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.03" data-time="250.4">[04:10.40]</span>Anyway, the snowshoe hare has an <span class="underline">adaptation</span> that plays on the same idea. <span class="time" data-times="3.16" data-time="255.43">[04:15.43]</span>It has <span class="underline">hind</span> feet that act like snowshoes. <span class="time" data-times="6.42" data-time="258.59">[04:18.59]</span>I mean, its paws are wide and they allow the hare to hop and run just at the surface of deep snow. <span class="time" data-times="8.77" data-time="265.01">[04:25.01]</span>And this is a huge <span class="underline">advantage</span> for the snowshoe hare since by <span class="underline">contrast</span>, the feet of its predators usually sink right down into the snow. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.88" data-time="273.78">[04:33.78]</span>Now, another <span class="underline">advantage</span> related to this is that unlike many animals in winter, snowshoe hares can stay lean and light weight. <span class="time" data-times="3.03" data-time="283.66">[04:43.66]</span>They <span class="underline">accumulate</span> <span class="underline">essentially</span> no body fat. <span class="time" data-times="2.23" data-time="286.69">[04:46.69]</span>Can anyone guess why this is so? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.56" data-time="288.92">[04:48.92]</span>Student: They don't eat very much? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.89" data-time="290.48">[04:50.48]</span>Professor: Well, yes. But not because there isn't enough food around. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="294.37">[04:54.37]</span>It's because, like I said, food is almost always <span class="underline">within</span> <span class="underline">reach</span>, and they don't have to store up a lot of food energy for the <span class="underline">harsh</span> winters. </p>
