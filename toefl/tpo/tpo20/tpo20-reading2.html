            <b>Early Settlements in the Southwest Asia</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>The universal global warming at the end of the Ice Age had <span class="highlight">dramatic</span> effects on <span class="highlight">temperate</span> regions of Asia, Europe, and North America. Ice sheets retreated and sea levels rose.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>The <span class="highlight">climatic</span> changes in southwestern Asia were more <span class="highlight">subtle</span>, in that they involved shifts in mountain snow lines, <span class="highlight">rainfall</span> patterns, and <span class="highlight">vegetation</span> cover.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>However, these same cycles of change had <span class="question1">momentous</span> impacts on the <span class="highlight">sparse</span> human populations of the <span class="highlight">region</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>At the end of the Ice Age, no more than a few thousand foragers lived <span class="highlight">along</span> the eastern <span class="highlight">Mediterranean</span> <span class="highlight">coast</span>,
in the Jordan and <span class="highlight">Euphrates</span> valleys. <span class="highlight">Within</span> 2,000 years, the human <span class="highlight">population</span> of the <span class="highlight">region</span> numbered in the tens of thousands, all as a result of village life and farming. 
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>Thanks to new <span class="highlight">environmental</span> and <span class="highlight">archaeological</span> discoveries, we now know something about <span class="question3">this <span class="highlight">remarkable</span> change </span>in <span class="highlight">local</span> life.</p>
          <p>Pollen samples from freshwater lakes in Syria and elsewhere tell us forest cover expanded rapidly at the end of the Ice Age, for the southwestern Asian <span class="highlight">climate</span> was still cooler and <span class="highlight">considerably</span> wetter than today. Many areas were richer in animal and plant <span class="highlight">species</span> than they are now, making them highly <span class="highlight">favorable</span> for human occupation. About 9000 B.C., most human settlements <span class="highlight">lay</span> in the area <span class="highlight">along</span> the <span class="highlight">Mediterranean</span> <span class="highlight">coast</span> and in the Zagros Mountains of Iran and their foothills. Some <span class="highlight">local</span> areas, like the Jordan River <span class="highlight">valley</span>, the middle <span class="highlight">Euphrates</span> <span class="highlight">valley</span>, and some Zagros valleys, were more densely populated than elsewhere. Here more <span class="highlight">sedentary</span> and more <span class="highlight">complex</span> societies flourished. These people <span class="question4">exploited</span> the <span class="highlight">landscape</span> intensively, foraging on hill slopes for wild <span class="highlight">cereal</span> grasses and nuts, while hunting  <span class="highlight">gazelle</span> and other game on grassy lowlands and in river valleys. Their settlements <span class="highlight">contain</span> <span class="highlight">exotic</span> objects such as <span class="question5">seashells, stone bowls, and artifacts made of <span class="highlight">obsidian</span> (<span class="highlight"></span>volcanic</span> glass), all traded from afar. This <span class="highlight">considerable</span> <span class="highlight">volume</span> of intercommunity <span class="highlight">exchange</span> brought a <span class="highlight">degree</span> of social <span class="highlight">complexity</span> in its wake.</p>
          <p>Thanks to extremely <span class="highlight">fine-grained</span> <span class="highlight">excavation</span> and <span class="highlight">extensive</span> use of <span class="highlight">flotation</span> methods (<span class="highlight">through</span> which seeds are recovered from soil samples), we know a great <span class="highlight">deal</span> about the foraging practices of the inhabitants of Abu Hureyra in Syria's <span class="highlight">Euphrates</span> <span class="highlight">valley</span>. Abu Hureyra was founded about 9500B.C, a small village <span class="highlight">settlement</span> of <span class="highlight">cramped</span> <span class="highlight">pit</span> dwellings (houses dug <span class="highlight">partially</span> in the soil) with reed roofs supported by wooden uprights. For the next 1,500 years, its inhabitants enjoyed a <span class="highlight">somewhat</span> warmer and damper <span class="highlight">climate</span> than today, living in a well-wooded <span class="highlight">steppe</span> area where wild <span class="highlight">cereal</span> grasses were <span class="highlight">abundant</span>. They subsisted off <span class="highlight">spring</span> migrations of Persian gazelles from the south. With such a <span class="highlight">favorable</span> location, about 300 to 400 people lived in a sizable, <span class="highlight">permanent</span> <span class="highlight">settlement</span>. They were no longer a <span class="highlight">series</span> of small bands but lived in a large <span class="highlight">community</span> with more <span class="highlight">elaborate</span> social <span class="highlight">organization</span>, probably grouped into clans of people of <span class="highlight">common</span> <span class="highlight">descent</span>.</p>
          <p>The <span class="highlight">flotation</span> samples from the excavations allowed botanists to study <span class="question8">shifts</span> in plant-collecting habits as if they were looking <span class="highlight">through</span> a <span class="highlight">telescope</span> at a changing <span class="highlight">landscape</span>. Hundreds of tiny plant remains show how the inhabitants exploited nut harvests in nearby pistachio and <span class="highlight">oak</span> forests. However, as the <span class="highlight">climate</span> dried up, the forests retreated from the <span class="highlight">vicinity</span> of the <span class="highlight">settlement</span>. The inhabitants turned to wild <span class="highlight">cereal</span> grasses <span class="highlight">instead</span>, collecting them by the thousands, while the percentage of nuts in the <span class="highlight">diet</span> fell. By 8200B.C., <span class="highlight">drought</span> conditions were so <span class="highlight">severe</span> that the people abandoned their long-established <span class="highlight">settlement</span>, perhaps dispersing into smaller camps.</p>
          <p>Five centuries later, about 7700B.C., a new village rose on the <span class="highlight">mound</span>. At first the inhabitants still hunted <span class="highlight">gazelle</span> intensively. Then, about 7000 B.C., <span class="highlight">within</span> the <span class="highlight">space</span> of a few generations, they switched <span class="highlight"><span class="question11">abruptly</span> </span>to herding <span class="highlight">domesticated</span> goats and sheep and to growing einkorn, pulses, and other <span class="highlight">cereal</span> grasses. Abu Hureyra grew rapidly until it covered nearly 30 acres. It was a <span class="highlight">close-knit</span> <span class="highlight">community</span> of <span class="highlight">rectangular</span>, one-story mud-brick houses, joined by narrow lanes and courtyards, finally abandoned about 5000 B.C.. <span class="question12">Many <span class="highlight">complex</span> factors led to the <span class="highlight">adoption</span> of the new economies, not only at Abu Hureyra, but at many other locations such as 'Ain Ghazal, also in Syria, where goat toe bones showing the telltale marks of <span class="highlight">abrasion</span> caused by foot tethering (binding) testify to early herding of <span class="highlight">domestic</span> <span class="highlight">stock</span>.</span></p>
