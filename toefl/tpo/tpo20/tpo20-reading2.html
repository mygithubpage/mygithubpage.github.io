Ice sheets retreated and sea levels rose.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>The <span class="highlight">climatic</span> changes in southwestern Asia were more <span class="highlight">subtle</span>, in that they involved shifts in mountain snow lines, <span class="highlight">rainfall</span> patterns, and <span class="highlight">vegetation</span> cover.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>However, these same cycles of change had <span class="highlight question1">momentous</span> impacts on the <span class="highlight">sparse</span> human populations of the <span class="highlight">region</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>At the end of the Ice Age, no more than a few thousand foragers lived <span class="highlight">along</span> the eastern <span class="highlight">Mediterranean</span><span class="highlight">coast</span>,
in the Jordan and <span class="highlight">Euphrates</span> valleys. <span class="highlight">Within</span> 2,000 years, the human <span class="highlight">population</span> of the <span class="highlight">region</span> numbered in the tens of thousands, all as a result of village life and farming. 
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>Thanks to new <span class="highlight">environmental</span> and <span class="highlight">archaeological</span> discoveries, we now know something about <span class="question3">this <span class="highlight">remarkable</span> change</span> in <span class="highlight">local</span> life.</p><p>Pollen samples from freshwater lakes in Syria and elsewhere tell us forest cover expanded rapidly at the end of the Ice Age, for the southwestern Asian <span class="highlight">climate</span> was still cooler and <span class="highlight">considerably</span> wetter than today. Many areas were richer in animal and plant <span class="highlight">species</span> than they are now, making them highly <span class="highlight">favorable</span> for human occupation. About 9000 B.C., most human settlements <span class="highlight">lay</span> in the area <span class="highlight">along</span> the <span class="highlight">Mediterranean</span><span class="highlight">coast</span> and in the Zagros Mountains of Iran and their foothills. Some <span class="highlight">local</span> areas, like the Jordan River <span class="highlight">valley</span>, the middle <span class="highlight">Euphrates</span><span class="highlight">valley</span>, and some Zagros valleys, were more densely populated than elsewhere. Here more <span class="highlight">sedentary</span> and more <span class="highlight">complex</span> societies flourished. These people <span class="question4">exploited</span> the <span class="highlight">landscape</span> intensively, foraging on hill slopes for wild <span class="highlight">cereal</span> grasses and nuts, while hunting  <span class="highlight">gazelle</span> and other game on grassy lowlands and in river valleys. Their settlements <span class="highlight">contain</span><span class="highlight">exotic</span> objects such as <span class="question5">seashells, stone bowls, and artifacts made of <span class="highlight">obsidian</span></span> (<span class="highlight">volcanic</span> glass), all traded from afar. This <span class="highlight">considerable</span><span class="highlight">volume</span> of intercommunity <span class="highlight">exchange</span> brought a <span class="highlight">degree</span> of social <span class="highlight">complexity</span> in its wake.</p><p>Thanks to extremely <span class="highlight">fine-grained</span><span class="highlight">excavation</span> and <span class="highlight">extensive</span> use of <span class="highlight">flotation</span> methods (<span class="highlight">through</span> which seeds are recovered from soil samples), we know a great <span class="highlight">deal</span> about the foraging practices of the inhabitants of Abu Hureyra in Syria's <span class="highlight">Euphrates</span><span class="highlight">valley</span>. Abu Hureyra was founded about 9500B.C, a small village <span class="highlight">settlement</span> of <span class="highlight"><span class="question6">cramped</span></span><span class="highlight">pit</span> dwellings (houses dug <span class="highlight">partially</span> in the soil) with reed roofs supported by wooden uprights. For the next 1,500 years, its inhabitants enjoyed a <span class="highlight">somewhat</span> warmer and damper <span class="highlight">climate</span> than today, living in a well-wooded <span class="highlight">steppe</span> area where wild <span class="highlight">cereal</span> grasses were <span class="highlight">abundant</span>. They subsisted off <span class="highlight">spring</span> migrations of Persian gazelles from the south. With such a <span class="highlight">favorable</span> location, about 300 to 400 people lived in a sizable, <span class="highlight">permanent</span><span class="highlight">settlement</span>. They were no longer a <span class="highlight">series</span> of small bands but lived in a large <span class="highlight">community</span> with more <span class="highlight">elaborate</span> social <span class="highlight">organization</span>, probably grouped into clans of people of <span class="highlight">common</span><span class="highlight">descent</span>.</p><p>The <span class="highlight">flotation</span> samples from the excavations allowed botanists to study <span class="question8">shifts</span> in plant-collecting habits as if they were looking <span class="highlight">through</span> a <span class="highlight">telescope</span> at a changing <span class="highlight">landscape</span>. Hundreds of tiny plant remains show how the inhabitants exploited nut harvests in nearby pistachio and <span class="highlight">oak</span> forests. However, as the <span class="highlight">climate</span> dried up, the forests retreated from the <span class="highlight">vicinity</span> of the <span class="highlight">settlement</span>. The inhabitants turned to wild <span class="highlight">cereal</span> grasses <span class="highlight">instead</span>, collecting them by the thousands, while the percentage of nuts in the <span class="highlight">diet</span> fell. By 8200B.C., <span class="highlight">drought</span> conditions were so <span class="highlight">severe</span> that the people abandoned their long-established <span class="highlight">settlement</span>, perhaps dispersing into smaller camps.</p><p>Five centuries later, about 7700B.C., a new village rose on the <span class="highlight">mound</span>. At first the inhabitants still hunted <span class="highlight">gazelle</span> intensively. Then, about 7000 B.C., <span class="highlight">within</span> the <span class="highlight">space</span> of a few generations, they switched <span class="highlight"><span class="question11">abruptly</span></span> to herding <span class="highlight">domesticated</span> goats and sheep and to growing einkorn, pulses, and other <span class="highlight">cereal</span> grasses. Abu Hureyra grew rapidly until it covered nearly 30 acres. It was a <span class="highlight">close-knit</span><span class="highlight">community</span> of <span class="highlight">rectangular</span>, one-story mud-brick houses, joined by narrow lanes and courtyards, finally abandoned about 5000 B.C.. <span class="question12">Many <span class="highlight">complex</span> factors led to the <span class="highlight">adoption</span> of the new economies, not only at Abu Hureyra, but at many other locations such as 'Ain Ghazal, also in Syria, where goat toe bones showing the telltale marks of <span class="highlight">abrasion</span> caused by foot tethering (binding) testify to early herding of <span class="highlight">domestic</span><span class="highlight">stock</span>.</span></p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">momentous</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. numerous</p><p>B. regular</p><p>C. very important</p><p>D. very positive</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C momentous: Important, significant. A is many; B is regular; C is very important; D is very positive and positive. So C's very important.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Major climatic changes occurred by the end of the Ice Age in all of the following geographic areas EXCEPT</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. temperate regions of Asia</p><p>B. southwestern Asia</p><p>C. North America</p><p>D. Europe</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B, EXCEPT questions, exclusion. A/C/D is focused on the first sentence.

Referring to, looking ahead, the previous sentence says that due to the development of agriculture and townships, there are tens of thousands of people, followed by this change. It is said that this change refers to population growth, so the answer is D.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">exploited</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. explored</p><p>B. utilized</p><p>C. inhabited</p><p>D. improved</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B exploit: exploitation, exploitation, exploitation, utilization. It is used in the original text. A is development, exploration; B is utilization; C is residence; D is improvement. So B's utilize is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the author mention "<span class="highlight">seashells, stone bowls, and artifacts made of obsidian</span>"?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

With the keyword aborned long established settlement, positioning to the last sentence, saying that the drought was so serious that they gave up the original residence, so the reason for giving up was because of the lack of rain, the correct answer was D, and the others were not the cause.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 5, after 7000 B.C. the settlement of Abu Hureyra differed from earlier settlements at that location in all of the following EXCEPT</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. the domestication of animals</p><p>B. the intensive hunting of gazelle</p><p>C. the size of the settlement</p><p>D. the design of the dwellings</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B EXCEPT questions, exclusion method. A's dominationication is targeted to the second sentence, saying that domesticated animals are different, so A is correct and not selected; B's gazelle is targeted to the second sentence. This is only a matter of 7700 BC, not a difference or change. , so B is wrong, choose; C's size is targeted to the third sentence of 30 acre, so C is right, not selected; D's design and dwelling do keyword positioning to the penultimate sentence, correct, not selected</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question11">abruptly</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. informally</p><p>B. briefly</p><p>C. suddenly</p><p>D. surprisingly</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" C"><p>C <span class="question11">abruptly</span>: Suddenly, <span class="question11">abruptly</span>.
