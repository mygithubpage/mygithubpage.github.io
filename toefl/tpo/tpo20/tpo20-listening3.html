              <span class="time" data-times="7.32" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in an <span class="underline">environmental</span> science class. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.35" data-time="7.32">[00:07.32]</span>Professor: I'd like to take you back about 11 thousand years ago when Earth entered the latest <span class="underline">interglacial</span> period. <span class="time" data-times="12.5" data-time="13.67">[00:13.67]</span> <span class="underline">Interglacial</span> periods are, typically periods of time between Ice Ages, when the <span class="underline">climate</span> warms, and the <span class="underline">glacial</span> ice retreats for a time, before things cool off again and another Ice Age begins. <span class="time" data-times="17.22" data-time="26.17">[00:26.17]</span>And for over the past several million years, Earth's <span class="underline">sort</span> of default <span class="underline">climate</span> has actually been Ice Age, but we have experienced <span class="underline">periodic</span> <span class="underline">regular</span> thaws, and the last one, the one we are in now, started about 11 thousand years ago. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="23.04" data-time="43.39">[00:43.39]</span>Now, the <span class="underline">typical</span> <span class="underline">pattern</span> for an <span class="underline">interglacial</span> period, and we have studied several, is that the <span class="underline">concentration</span> of <span class="underline">carbon</span> <span class="underline">dioxide</span> and <span class="underline">methane</span> gas actually reaches it... its <span class="underline">peak</span>, that is, there is the most <span class="underline">carbon</span> <span class="underline">dioxide</span> and <span class="underline">methane</span> gas, uh, greenhouse gases in the <span class="underline">atmosphere</span> just after the beginning of the <span class="underline">interglacial</span> period. <span class="time" data-times="8.49" data-time="66.43">[01:06.43]</span>And then, for reasons which are not <span class="underline">entirely</span> <span class="underline">clear</span>, the <span class="underline">concentration</span> of greenhouse gases <span class="underline">gradually</span> goes down. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.69" data-time="74.92">[01:14.92]</span>Now, the <span class="underline">climate</span> continues to warm for a while because there is a lag effect. <span class="time" data-times="10.5" data-time="80.61">[01:20.61]</span>But uh, <span class="underline">gradually</span> as the <span class="underline">concentration</span> of greenhouse gases goes down, Earth starts to cool again, and <span class="underline">eventually</span> you <span class="underline">slip</span> back into an Ice Age. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="20.17" data-time="91.11">[01:31.11]</span>Um, however, for the latest <span class="underline">interglacial</span> period, the one we are in now, this <span class="underline">pattern</span> did not hold, that is, the <span class="underline">concentration</span> of <span class="underline">carbon</span> <span class="underline">dioxide</span> and <span class="underline">methane</span> dipped a little bit after, uh, uh, after peaking at the beginning, near the beginning of the <span class="underline">interglacial</span> period, but then it began to rise again. <span class="time" data-times="5.75" data-time="111.28">[01:51.28]</span>Um ... What was different about this <span class="underline">interglacial</span> period than the other ones? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.15" data-time="117.03">[01:57.03]</span>Well, one of the big differences is human <span class="underline">activity</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.7" data-time="121.18">[02:01.18]</span>People began to <span class="underline">raise</span> crops and animals for food <span class="underline">instead</span> of hunting for them. <span class="time" data-times="3.13" data-time="126.88">[02:06.88]</span>This is the agricultural <span class="underline">revolution</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.48" data-time="130.01">[02:10.01]</span>And it began to happen in the earliest stages about 11 thousand years ago. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="12.65" data-time="135.49">[02:15.49]</span>Now, scientists have tended to regard ... the ... uh ... agricultural <span class="underline">revolution</span> as a beneficiary of the ... uh ... <span class="underline">fortuitous</span> <span class="underline">shift</span> in <span class="underline">climate</span>. <span class="time" data-times="14.06" data-time="148.14">[02:28.14]</span>However, some new theories of <span class="underline">climate</span>, new theorists of <span class="underline">climate</span> have proposed that perhaps <span class="underline">humanity</span> was having an effect on the <span class="underline">climate</span> as far back as the beginnings of the agricultural <span class="underline">revolution</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.7" data-time="162.2">[02:42.20]</span>When you grow crops and uh, <span class="underline">pasture</span> your animals, one of the things you do is you cut down the forests.<span class="time" data-times="15.79" data-time="169.9">[02:49.90]</span>If you cut down the forests, when you burn the trees for <span class="underline">fuel</span> and don't <span class="underline">replace</span> them with other trees, or when you just leave them to rot and don't allow other trees to grow, you end up with a lot more <span class="underline">carbon</span> in the form of <span class="underline">carbon</span> <span class="underline">dioxide</span> getting into the <span class="underline">atmosphere</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.36" data-time="185.69">[03:05.69]</span>Um ... another gas <span class="underline">associated</span> with the <span class="underline">spread</span> of <span class="underline">agriculture</span> is <span class="underline">methane</span>.<span class="time" data-times="19.62" data-time="192.05">[03:12.05]</span> <span class="underline">Methane</span> forms in large <span class="underline">concentration</span> above wetlands, and as it turns out, the <span class="underline">cultivation</span> of certain grains creates <span class="underline">vast</span> areas of <span class="underline">artificial</span> wetlands, and probably <span class="underline">drastically</span> increases the <span class="underline">amount</span> of <span class="underline">methane</span> getting into the <span class="underline">atmosphere</span>, over and above what would be there. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="12.23" data-time="211.67">[03:31.67]</span>So, um... <span class="underline">agriculture</span>, the ... the <span class="underline">spread</span> of <span class="underline">agriculture</span>, you know we are talking over thousands of years, um... but this could very well had a <span class="underline">profound</span> effect on the <span class="underline">composition</span> of Earth's <span class="underline">atmosphere</span>.<span class="time" data-times="7.34" data-time="223.9">[03:43.90]</span>It's kind of <span class="underline">ironic</span> to think that absent that effect, it maybe that we would be <span class="underline">heading</span> into an Ice Age again.<span class="time" data-times="10.98" data-time="231.24">[03:51.24]</span>In fact, back in the 1970s, a lot of theorists were predicting that, you know, the <span class="underline">climate</span> would start to cool and we'd slowly enter into the new Ice Age.<span class="time" data-times="3.85" data-time="242.22">[04:02.22]</span>And then they were puzzled as to why it didn't <span class="underline">seem</span> to be happening. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.5" data-time="246.07">[04:06.07]</span>Umm... now, what are the implications for the future? <span class="time" data-times="2.29" data-time="249.57">[04:09.57]</span>Well, um... it is a little tricky. <span class="time" data-times="13.8" data-time="251.86">[04:11.86]</span>I mean, you could say, well, here is an example of ... um ... human <span class="underline">activity</span>, the agricultural <span class="underline">revolution</span> which actually was <span class="underline">beneficial</span>, we altered the <span class="underline">climate</span> for the better, perhaps, by preventing an Ice Age. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="14.48" data-time="265.66">[04:25.66]</span>But then <span class="underline">industrialization</span>, of <span class="underline">course</span>, has <span class="underline">drastically</span> increased the <span class="underline">amount</span> of <span class="underline">carbon</span> <span class="underline">dioxide</span> that humans are putting into the <span class="underline">atmosphere</span>, the burning of <span class="underline">fossil</span> fuels tends to put a lot of CO2 into the <span class="underline">atmosphere</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="280.14">[04:40.14]</span>Um... so we are entering into uncharted <span class="underline">territory</span> now, in terms of the <span class="underline">amount</span> of <span class="underline">carbon</span> <span class="underline">dioxide</span>, the concentrations of <span class="underline">carbon</span> <span class="underline">dioxide</span> that are now being put into the <span class="underline">atmosphere</span> as a result of <span class="underline">industrialization</span> and the use of <span class="underline">fossil</span> fuels. </p>
