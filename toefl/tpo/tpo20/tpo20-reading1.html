After 1815 improved <span class="highlight">transportation</span> enabled more and more western farmers to <span class="highlight">escape</span> a <span class="highlight">self-sufficient</span> way of life and enter a national <span class="highlight">market</span><span class="highlight">economy</span>. During periods when <span class="highlight">commodity</span> prices were high, the <span class="highlight">rate</span> of westward <span class="highlight">migration</span> increased spectacularly. "Old America seemed to be breaking up and moving westward," observed an English visitor in 1817,during the first great wave of <span class="highlight">migration</span>. Emigration to the West reached a <span class="highlight">peak</span> in the 1830's. <span class="question2">Whereas in 1810 only a seventh of the American people lived west of the Appalachian Mountains, by 1840 more than a third lived there.</span></p><p>Why were these hundreds of thousands of settlers-most of them farmers, some of them artisans-drawn away from the cleared fields and established cities and villages of the East? Certain characteristics of American society help to explain this <span class="highlight">remarkable</span><span class="highlight">migration</span>. The European ancestors of some Americans had for centuries lived rooted to the same village or piece of land until some <span class="highlight">religious</span>, <span class="highlight">political</span>, or <span class="highlight">economic</span> crisis uprooted them and drove them <span class="highlight">across</span> the Atlantic. Many of those who experienced this sharp <span class="highlight">break</span> thereafter lacked the ties that had <span class="highlight">bound</span> them and their ancestors to a single place. Moreover, European society was <span class="highlight">relatively</span> stratified; occupation and social <span class="highlight">status</span> were <span class="highlight">inherited</span>. In American society, however, the class structure was less <span class="highlight">rigid</span>; some people changed occupations easily and believed it was their duty to <span class="highlight">improve</span> their social and <span class="highlight">economic</span><span class="highlight">position</span>. As a result, many Americans were an inveterately restless, rootless, and <span class="highlight">ambitious</span> people. <span class="highlight">Therefore</span>, these social traits helped to produce the <span class="highlight">nomadic</span> and <span class="highlight">daring</span> settlers who kept pushing westward beyond the <span class="question3">fringes</span> of <span class="highlight">settlement</span>. In <span class="highlight">addition</span>, there were other immigrants who migrated west in search of new homes, <span class="highlight">material</span> success, and better lives.</p><p><span class="question5">The West had plenty of attractions: the <span class="highlight">alluvial</span> river bottoms, the fecund soils of the rolling forest lands, the black loams of the prairies were tempting to New England farmers working their <span class="highlight">rocky</span>, <span class="highlight">sterile</span> land and to southeastern farmers plagued with soil depletion and <span class="highlight">erosion</span>.</span> In 1820 under a new land law, a farm could be bought for $100. The continued <span class="highlight"><span class="question7">proliferation</span></span> of banks made it easier for those without cash to negotiate loans in paper money. Western Farmers borrowed with the confident expectation that the expanding <span class="highlight">economy</span> would keep farm prices high, thus making it easy to repay loans when they fell <span class="highlight">due</span>.</p><p><span class="highlight">Transportation</span> was becoming less of a problem for those who wished to move west and for those who had farm surpluses to send to <span class="highlight">market</span>.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span><span class="highlight">Prior</span> to 1815, western farmers who did not live on navigable waterways were connected to them only by dirt roads and mountain trails. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span><span class="highlight">Livestock</span> could be driven <span class="highlight">across</span> the mountains, but the <span class="highlight">cost</span> of transporting <span class="highlight">bulky</span> grains in this <span class="highlight">fashion</span> was several times greater than their value in eastern markets.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>The first step toward an improvement of western <span class="highlight">transportation</span> was the <span class="highlight">construction</span> of turnpikes. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>These roads made possible a <span class="highlight">reduction</span> in <span class="highlight">transportation</span> costs and thus <span class="highlight">stimulated</span> the 
<span class="highlight">commercialization</span> of <span class="highlight">agriculture</span><span class="highlight">along</span> their routes.</p><p>Two other developments presaged the end of the <span class="highlight">era</span> of turnpikes and started a <span class="highlight">transportation</span><span class="highlight">revolution</span> that resulted in increased regional <span class="highlight">specialization</span> and the growth of a national <span class="highlight">market</span><span class="highlight">economy</span>. First came the <span class="highlight">steamboat</span>; although flatboats and keelboats continued to be important until the 1850's steamboats <span class="highlight">eventually</span><span class="question9">superseded</span> all other <span class="highlight">craft</span> in the carrying of passengers and <span class="highlight">freight</span>. Steamboats were not only faster but also transported upriver <span class="highlight">freight</span> for about one tenth of what it had <span class="highlight">previously</span><span class="highlight">cost</span> on hand-propelled keelboats. Next came the Erie <span class="highlight">Canal</span>, an <span class="highlight">enormous</span><span class="highlight">project</span> in its day, spanning about 350 miles. After the <span class="highlight">canal</span> went into operation, the <span class="highlight">cost</span> per mile of transporting a ton of <span class="highlight">freight</span> from <span class="highlight">Buffalo</span> to New York City declined from nearly 20 cents to less than 1 cent. <span class="highlight">Eventually</span>, the western states <span class="question10">diverted</span> much of their produce from the rivers to the Erie <span class="highlight">Canal</span>, a shorter <span class="highlight">route</span> to eastern markets.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What can be inferred from paragraph 1 about western farmers prior to 1815?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They had limited their crop production to wheat, corn, tobacco, and cotton.</p><p>B. They were able to sell their produce at high prices.</p><p>C. They had not been successful in raising cattle.</p><p>D. They did not operate in a national market economy.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D Positioning to the second sentence with 1815 as the key word, saying that after 1815, the improvement of traffic made more farmers no longer self-sufficient, and entered the national market economy, that is, before 1815, it was self-sufficient and did not participate in the market economy. , so the answer is D. Other options are irrelevant</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the purpose of the statement, "<span class="highlight">Whereas in 1810 only a seventh of the American people lived west of the Appalachian Mountains, by 1840 more than a third lived there</span>"?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To illustrate that generally population shifts occur rapidly</p><p>B. To correct a mistaken impression of American agriculture from 1810 to 1840</p><p>C. To emphasize the range and speed with which the westward migration occurred</p><p>D. O To demonstrated how attractive the Appalachian Mountains were to Americans</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="Whereas in 1810 only a seventh of the American people lived west of the Appalachian Mountains, by 1840 more than a third lived there C"><p>C. The topic of rhetoric, first reading the sentence where the example is located, said that the wave of immigration to the west reached its peak in the 1930s, and then gave a specific figure to explain it. So it is to explain that the number and scope of immigration is very wide. The scope is Because the example mentions the west of the Appalachian Mountains, the answer is C. A said only speed, not comprehensive; B did not have a mistaken view; D said Appalachian attraction is purely nonsense.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question3">fringes</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. borders</p><p>B. groups</p><p>C. types</p><p>D. directions</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" A"><p>A, fringe: marginal, secondary, extra subsidy. A is the edge; B is the ethnic group; C is the species; D is the direction. So the correct answer is A's border.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 2, all of the following are reasons why Americans migrated westward EXCEPT</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. the desire to move from one place to the next</p><p>B. the hope of improving their socioeconomic status</p><p>C. the opportunity to change jobs</p><p>D. the need to escape religious or political crises</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D EXCEPT questions, but this question is better with positive selection. Use keywords to locate keywords to the explaination of the second sentence. If you do not locate the word, look at the first sentence. You can see it by looking down. The first reason is that Europeans have been living in one place, while Americans are not, corresponding to answer A; the second reason is that European social hierarchy is not so easy to change jobs, while the United States is just the opposite, corresponding to C and B options. , so D does not correspond, the answer is D.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Because the West had more rivers and forests than the East, its soil was more productive.</p><p>B. The fertile soils of the West drew farmers from regions with barren soils.</p><p>C. Farmers living in western areas of the United States were more affected by soil erosion than farmers living in eastern areas.</p><p>D. The soil in western areas of the United States was richer than soil in eastern areas.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The main point of this sentence is to list the many attractions of the West. The logic is very simple. So the answer is B. The comparison of A/C/D did not say anything.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 3, what was the significance of the land law passed in 1820?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It granted government-supported loans to farmers.</p><p>B. It provided farmland at an affordable price.</p><p>C. It required banks to offer loans to farmers.</p><p>D. It enabled farmers to sell their land for a profit.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B Positioned to the second sentence with the key words of 1820. He said that the new bill passed in 1820 allowed farmers to buy land for 100 USD. However, there is no significant explanation left. Later, it was said that the prosperity of the banking industry made it possible for those who did not have the money to get bank loan loans, so farmers could afford to buy land. The correct answer was B. A's government-support, C's require, and D's sell did not say anything.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question7">proliferation</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. growth</p><p>B. cooperation</p><p>C. importance</p><p>D. success</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" A"><p>A <span class="question7">proliferation</span>: expansion, <span class="question7">proliferation</span>, <span class="question7">proliferation</span>. A is growth; B is cooperation; C is importance; D is success. So the answer is growth.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Paragraph 4 suggests that turnpikes affected farmers by</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. making the price of grain uniform for both eastern and western farmers</p><p>B. making western farm products more profitable than eastern farm products</p><p>C. allowing farmers to drive their livestock across mountain trails</p><p>D. allowing a greater number of farmers to sell their farm products in a commercial market</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D. Use the word turnpike to locate the next two sentences. The first step in improving the transport situation is to build roads, which will reduce the cost of transportation and agriculture. So the answer is to encourage people to sell things. A thing is equal in price, B's comparison and C's mountain trail are not mentioned at all.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question9">superseded</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. replaced</p><p>B. reformed</p><p>C. equaled</p><p>D. increased</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" A"><p>A supersede: instead. A is a replacement; B is a reform; C is equal to ... and D is an increase. So A's replacement is the answer.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question10">diverted</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. collected</p><p>B. shifted</p><p>C. transported</p><p>D. sold</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>B divert: Diversion, entertainment, distraction. A is a collection; B is a transfer; C is a transport; D is a sale. So B's shift is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the following can be inferred from paragraph 5 about flatboats and keelboats?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They ceased to be used as soon as the first turnpikes were built.</p><p>B. They were slower and more expensive to operate than steamboats.</p><p>C. They were used for long-distance but not for regional transportation.</p><p>D. They were used primarily on the Erie Canal.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B. Positioned to the second sentence with two kinds of ships as the key words, saying that the final steamship replaced the original two kinds of boats. There is no answer. Look down and say that the steamships are not only fast but also cheap, that is, the two slow ones. And it's not cheap, so the answer is B, A says, C and D have no clues.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Paragraph 5 mentions that the Erie Canal led to a reduction in all of the following EXCEPT</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. the length of the route that goods from the West traveled across to reach eastern markets</p><p>B. the cost of transporting freight</p><p>C. the price of produce from western states</p><p>D. the amount of produce from western states that was shipped on rivers</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C, EXCEPT questions, exclusion. A's length of the route is targeted to the last sentence, a shorter route, correct, not selected; at the same time see part of the transport is assigned to the EC, so the transport of the river is less, so the shipped on river D Drop, D is correct, not selected; B's cost and Freight do keyword positioning to the penultimate sentence, saying that from 20 down to 1, so also dropped, not selected; C's price does not correspond to the original, so C is wrong, Choose, don't think for yourself that the cost of transportation will drop if the price drops</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>In fact, goods could be shipped more cheaply across the much greater distance of the Atlantic Ocean than they could from western New York to coastal cities..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C Three transition points, noun goods, adverbs cheaply and in fact. According to the surpluses of the goods and the first sentence may agree to reproduce, A may be right, according to the possible synonymous with goods and livestock to reproduce the judgment of B or C may be; the combination of cheaply and in fact to determine the first sentence must be related to the price, so B or C is right, but in fact does not match the sentence in front of B, so C is the answer.</p></div></div><div id="question14" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>
The westward movement of population across the United States led to expanded agricultural production.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.The desire to improve their livelihood often inspired people to move west.</p><p>B.The fertility of western farmland as well as favorable government policies supported agricultural gains.</p><p>C.Commercial farming in the West was greatly enhanced by improvements in land and water transportation.</p><p>D.Among the people who moved to the western United States were a number of artisans.</p><p>E.Steamboats were originally used to transport passengers rather than freight.</p><p>F.The transportation revolution resulted in regional economies that operated independently of a national market economy.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="ABC"><p>The ABC The desire option corresponds to the third sentence of the second paragraph of the original text.
