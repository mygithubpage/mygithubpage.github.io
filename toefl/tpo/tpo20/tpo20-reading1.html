          <h4 class="w3-center">Westward Migration</h4>
          <p>The story of the westward movement of <span class="highlight">population</span> in the United States is, in the main, the story of the <span class="highlight">expansion</span> of American <span class="highlight">agriculture</span>-of the <span class="highlight">development</span> of new areas for the raising of <span class="highlight">livestock</span> and the <span class="highlight">cultivation</span> of wheat, corn, tobacco, and cotton. After 1815 improved <span class="highlight">transportation</span> enabled more and more western farmers to <span class="highlight">escape</span> a <span class="highlight">self-sufficient</span> way of life and enter a national <span class="highlight">market</span> <span class="highlight">economy</span>. During periods when <span class="highlight">commodity</span> prices were high, the <span class="highlight">rate</span> of westward <span class="highlight">migration</span> increased spectacularly. "Old America seemed to be breaking up and moving westward," observed an English visitor in 1817,during the first great wave of <span class="highlight">migration</span>. Emigration to the West reached a <span class="highlight">peak</span> in the 1830's. <span class="question2">Whereas in 1810 only a seventh of the American people lived west of the Appalachian Mountains, by 1840 more than a third lived there.</span></p>
          <p>Why were these hundreds of thousands of settlers-most of them farmers, some of them artisans-drawn away from the cleared fields and established cities and villages of the East? Certain characteristics of American society help to explain this <span class="highlight">remarkable</span> <span class="highlight">migration</span>. The European ancestors of some Americans had for centuries lived rooted to the same village or piece of land until some <span class="highlight">religious</span>, <span class="highlight">political</span>, or <span class="highlight">economic</span> crisis uprooted them and drove them <span class="highlight">across</span> the Atlantic. Many of those who experienced this sharp <span class="highlight">break</span> thereafter lacked the ties that had <span class="highlight">bound</span> them and their ancestors to a single place. Moreover, European society was <span class="highlight">relatively</span> stratified; occupation and social <span class="highlight">status</span> were <span class="highlight">inherited</span>. In American society, however, the class structure was less <span class="highlight">rigid</span>; some people changed occupations easily and believed it was their duty to <span class="highlight">improve</span> their social and <span class="highlight">economic</span> <span class="highlight">position</span>. As a result, many Americans were an inveterately restless, rootless, and <span class="highlight">ambitious</span> people. <span class="highlight">Therefore</span>, these social traits helped to produce the <span class="highlight">nomadic</span> and <span class="highlight">daring</span> settlers who kept pushing westward beyond the <span class="question3">fringes</span> of <span class="highlight">settlement</span>. In <span class="highlight">addition</span>, there were other immigrants who migrated west in search of new homes, <span class="highlight">material</span> success, and better lives.</p>
          <p><span class="question5">The West had plenty of attractions: the <span class="highlight">alluvial</span> river bottoms, the fecund soils of the rolling forest lands, the black loams of the prairies were tempting to New England farmers working their <span class="highlight">rocky</span>, <span class="highlight">sterile</span> land and to southeastern farmers plagued with soil depletion and <span class="highlight">erosion</span>.</span> In 1820 under a new land law, a farm could be bought for $100. The continued <span class="highlight"><span class="question7">proliferation</span></span> of banks made it easier for those without cash to negotiate loans in paper money. Western Farmers borrowed with the confident expectation that the expanding <span class="highlight">economy</span> would keep farm prices high, thus making it easy to repay loans when they fell <span class="highlight">due</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="highlight">Transportation</span> was becoming less of a problem for those who wished to move west and for those who had farm surpluses to send to <span class="highlight">market</span>.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> <span class="highlight">Prior</span> to 1815, western farmers who did not live on navigable waterways were connected to them only by dirt roads and mountain trails. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> <span class="highlight">Livestock</span> could be driven <span class="highlight">across</span> the mountains, but the <span class="highlight">cost</span> of transporting <span class="highlight">bulky</span> grains in this <span class="highlight">fashion</span> was several times greater than their value in eastern markets.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>The first step toward an improvement of western <span class="highlight">transportation</span> was the <span class="highlight">construction</span> of turnpikes. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>These roads made possible a <span class="highlight">reduction</span> in <span class="highlight">transportation</span> costs and thus <span class="highlight">stimulated</span> the 
<span class="highlight">commercialization</span> of <span class="highlight">agriculture</span> <span class="highlight">along</span> their routes.</p>
          <p>Two other developments presaged the end of the <span class="highlight">era</span> of turnpikes and started a <span class="highlight">transportation</span> <span class="highlight">revolution</span> that resulted in increased regional <span class="highlight">specialization</span> and the growth of a national <span class="highlight">market</span> <span class="highlight">economy</span>. First came the <span class="highlight">steamboat</span>; although flatboats and keelboats continued to be important until the 1850's steamboats <span class="highlight">eventually</span> <span class="question9">superseded</span> all other <span class="highlight">craft</span> in the carrying of passengers and <span class="highlight">freight</span>. Steamboats were not only faster but also transported upriver <span class="highlight">freight</span> for about one tenth of what it had <span class="highlight">previously</span> <span class="highlight">cost</span> on hand-propelled keelboats. Next came the Erie <span class="highlight">Canal</span>, an <span class="highlight">enormous</span> <span class="highlight">project</span> in its day, spanning about 350 miles. After the <span class="highlight">canal</span> went into operation, the <span class="highlight">cost</span> per mile of transporting a ton of <span class="highlight">freight</span> from <span class="highlight">Buffalo</span> to New York City declined from nearly 20 cents to less than 1 cent. <span class="highlight">Eventually</span>, the western states <span class="question10">diverted</span> much of their produce from the rivers to the Erie <span class="highlight">Canal</span>, a shorter <span class="highlight">route</span> to eastern markets.</p>

The topic of rhetoric, first reading the sentence where the example is located, said that the wave of immigration to the west reached its peak in the 1930s, and then gave a specific figure to explain it. So it is to explain that the number and scope of immigration is very wide. The scope is Because the example mentions the west of the Appalachian Mountains, the answer is C. A said only speed, not comprehensive; B did not have a mistaken view; D said Appalachian attraction is purely nonsense.</p>
