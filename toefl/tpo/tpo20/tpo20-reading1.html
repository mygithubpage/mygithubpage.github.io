After 1815 improved <span class="highlight">transportation</span> enabled more and more western farmers to <span class="highlight">escape</span> a <span class="highlight">self-sufficient</span> way of life and enter a national <span class="highlight">market</span><span class="highlight">economy</span>. During periods when <span class="highlight">commodity</span> prices were high, the <span class="highlight">rate</span> of westward <span class="highlight">migration</span> increased spectacularly. "Old America seemed to be breaking up and moving westward," observed an English visitor in 1817,during the first great wave of <span class="highlight">migration</span>. Emigration to the West reached a <span class="highlight">peak</span> in the 1830's. <span class="question2">Whereas in 1810 only a seventh of the American people lived west of the Appalachian Mountains, by 1840 more than a third lived there.</span></p><p>Why were these hundreds of thousands of settlers-most of them farmers, some of them artisans-drawn away from the cleared fields and established cities and villages of the East? Certain characteristics of American society help to explain this <span class="highlight">remarkable</span><span class="highlight">migration</span>. The European ancestors of some Americans had for centuries lived rooted to the same village or piece of land until some <span class="highlight">religious</span>, <span class="highlight">political</span>, or <span class="highlight">economic</span> crisis uprooted them and drove them <span class="highlight">across</span> the Atlantic. Many of those who experienced this sharp <span class="highlight">break</span> thereafter lacked the ties that had <span class="highlight">bound</span> them and their ancestors to a single place. Moreover, European society was <span class="highlight">relatively</span> stratified; occupation and social <span class="highlight">status</span> were <span class="highlight">inherited</span>. In American society, however, the class structure was less <span class="highlight">rigid</span>; some people changed occupations easily and believed it was their duty to <span class="highlight">improve</span> their social and <span class="highlight">economic</span><span class="highlight">position</span>. As a result, many Americans were an inveterately restless, rootless, and <span class="highlight">ambitious</span> people. <span class="highlight">Therefore</span>, these social traits helped to produce the <span class="highlight">nomadic</span> and <span class="highlight">daring</span> settlers who kept pushing westward beyond the <span class="question3">fringes </span>of <span class="highlight">settlement</span>. In <span class="highlight">addition</span>, there were other immigrants who migrated west in search of new homes, <span class="highlight">material</span> success, and better lives.</p><p><span class="question5">The West had plenty of attractions: the <span class="highlight">alluvial</span> river bottoms, the fecund soils of the rolling forest lands, the black loams of the prairies were tempting to New England farmers working their <span class="highlight">rocky</span>, <span class="highlight">sterile</span> land and to southeastern farmers plagued with soil depletion and <span class="highlight">erosion</span>. </span>In 1820 under a new land law, a farm could be bought for $100. The continued <span class="highlight"><span class="question7">proliferation</span></span>of banks made it easier for those without cash to negotiate loans in paper money. Western Farmers borrowed with the confident expectation that the expanding <span class="highlight">economy</span> would keep farm prices high, thus making it easy to repay loans when they fell <span class="highlight">due</span>.</p><p><span class="highlight">Transportation</span> was becoming less of a problem for those who wished to move west and for those who had farm surpluses to send to <span class="highlight">market</span>.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span><span class="highlight">Prior</span> to 1815, western farmers who did not live on navigable waterways were connected to them only by dirt roads and mountain trails. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span><span class="highlight">Livestock</span> could be driven <span class="highlight">across</span> the mountains, but the <span class="highlight">cost</span> of transporting <span class="highlight">bulky</span> grains in this <span class="highlight">fashion</span> was several times greater than their value in eastern markets.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>The first step toward an improvement of western <span class="highlight">transportation</span> was the <span class="highlight">construction</span> of turnpikes. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>These roads made possible a <span class="highlight">reduction</span> in <span class="highlight">transportation</span> costs and thus <span class="highlight">stimulated</span> the 
<span class="highlight">commercialization</span> of <span class="highlight">agriculture</span><span class="highlight">along</span> their routes.</p><p>Two other developments presaged the end of the <span class="highlight">era</span> of turnpikes and started a <span class="highlight">transportation</span><span class="highlight">revolution</span> that resulted in increased regional <span class="highlight">specialization</span> and the growth of a national <span class="highlight">market</span><span class="highlight">economy</span>. First came the <span class="highlight">steamboat</span>; although flatboats and keelboats continued to be important until the 1850's steamboats <span class="highlight">eventually</span><span class="question9">superseded </span>all other <span class="highlight">craft</span> in the carrying of passengers and <span class="highlight">freight</span>. Steamboats were not only faster but also transported upriver <span class="highlight">freight</span> for about one tenth of what it had <span class="highlight">previously</span><span class="highlight">cost</span> on hand-propelled keelboats. Next came the Erie <span class="highlight">Canal</span>, an <span class="highlight">enormous</span><span class="highlight">project</span> in its day, spanning about 350 miles. After the <span class="highlight">canal</span> went into operation, the <span class="highlight">cost</span> per mile of transporting a ton of <span class="highlight">freight</span> from <span class="highlight">Buffalo</span> to New York City declined from nearly 20 cents to less than 1 cent. <span class="highlight">Eventually</span>, the western states <span class="question10">diverted </span>much of their produce from the rivers to the Erie <span class="highlight">Canal</span>, a shorter <span class="highlight">route</span> to eastern markets.</p></article></div><div id="question"><div id="question1"><p>What can be inferred from paragraph 1 about western farmers prior to 1815?</p><label class="my-label"><span>A.
