          <p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.05" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in a <span class="underline">literature</span> class.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.12" data-time="8.05">[00:08.05]</span>Professor: All right, so now we've talked about folk legends and seen that their ... one of their key features is there's usually some real <span class="underline">history</span> behind them. <span class="time" data-times="6.28" data-time="18.17">[00:18.17]</span>They are often about real people, so you can <span class="underline">identify</span> with the characters, and that's what engages us in them.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.75" data-time="24.45">[00:24.45]</span>The <span class="underline">particular</span> stories might not be true and some of the characters or events might be made up. <span class="time" data-times="4.45" data-time="30.2">[00:30.20]</span>But there's still a <span class="underline">sense</span> that the story could have been true since it is about a real person. <span class="time" data-times="6.35" data-time="34.65">[00:34.65]</span>That's <span class="underline">distinct</span> <span class="underline">contrast</span> from the other main <span class="underline">branch</span> of <span class="underline">popular</span> storytelling, which is folk tales.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="12.08" data-time="41">[00:41.00]</span>Folk tales are imaginative stories that ... um ... like folk legends, they have been passed down orally, from storyteller to storyteller for ... since <span class="underline">ancient</span> times. <span class="time" data-times="4.65" data-time="53.08">[00:53.08]</span>But with folk tales you don't ever really get the <span class="underline">sense</span> that the story might have been true. <span class="time" data-times="10.29" data-time="57.73">[00:57.73]</span>They are purely imaginative and so quite revealing, I think anyway, about the <span class="underline">culture</span> and the connection between folk tales and <span class="underline">culture</span>, which we'll talk about.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.68" data-time="68.02">[01:08.02]</span>But first let's go over the various types of folk tale and <span class="underline">focus</span> <span class="underline">specifically</span> on Norwegian folk tales since they <span class="underline">illustrate</span> the <span class="underline">variety</span> <span class="underline">pretty</span> well. <span class="time" data-times="5.55" data-time="77.7">[01:17.70]</span>There are in general three main types of Norwegian folk tales.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.57" data-time="83.25">[01:23.25]</span>One is animal stories, where animals are the main characters. <span class="time" data-times="10.86" data-time="87.82">[01:27.82]</span>They can be wild animals or <span class="underline">domestic</span>, and a lot of times they can talk and <span class="underline">behave</span> like humans, but at the same time, they <span class="underline">retain</span> their animal characteristics too. <span class="time" data-times="4.22" data-time="98.68">[01:38.68]</span>They <span class="underline">tend</span> to <span class="underline">involve</span> animals like bears, wolves and foxes.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.06" data-time="102.9">[01:42.90]</span>The point of these stories, their, their <span class="underline">internal</span> objectives, so the speak, is usually to explain some feature of the animal, how it arose. <span class="time" data-times="5.1" data-time="111.96">[01:51.96]</span>So there's one about a fox who fools a <span class="underline">bear</span> into going ice fishing with his tail. <span class="time" data-times="9.14" data-time="117.06">[01:57.06]</span>When the <span class="underline">bear</span> puts his tail into the water <span class="underline">through</span> a hole in the ice, to try and catch a fish, the ice freezes around it, and he ends up pulling his tail off. <span class="time" data-times="3.94" data-time="126.2">[02:06.20]</span>So that's why bears to this day have such short tails.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.6" data-time="130.14">[02:10.14]</span>The <span class="underline">second</span> <span class="underline">category</span> of Norwegian folk tale is the supernatural. <span class="time" data-times="8.85" data-time="134.74">[02:14.74]</span>Eh ... stories about giants and dragons and trolls, and humans with supernatural powers or gifts, like invisibility cloaks. <span class="time" data-times="7.47" data-time="143.59">[02:23.59]</span>Or where people are turned into animals and back again into a person, those are called <span class="underline">transformation</span> stories.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.74" data-time="151.06">[02:31.06]</span>There's a well-known Norwegian supernatural folk tale, a <span class="underline">transformation</span> story called East of the Sun and West of the Moon, which we'll read. <span class="time" data-times="6.08" data-time="158.8">[02:38.80]</span>It involves a prince who is a white <span class="underline">bear</span> by night and a human by day. <span class="time" data-times="6.93" data-time="164.88">[02:44.88]</span>And he lives in the castle that's east of the Sun and west of the Moon, which the heroine in the story has to try to find.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.25" data-time="171.81">[02:51.81]</span>
              <span class="underline">Besides</span> being a good example of a <span class="underline">transformation</span> story, this one also has a lot of the <span class="underline">common</span> things that <span class="underline">tend</span> to show up in folk tales.<span class="time" data-times="3.3" data-time="180.06">[03:00.06]</span>You will find the <span class="underline">standard</span> opening, 'once upon a time ... ' . <span class="time" data-times="6.52" data-time="183.36">[03:03.36]</span>And it has <span class="underline">stock</span> characters like a prince, and a poor but beautiful peasant girl, she is the heroine I mentioned. <span class="time" data-times="3.98" data-time="189.88">[03:09.88]</span>And ... um ... it has a very <span class="underline">conventional</span> form. <span class="time" data-times="3.76" data-time="193.86">[03:13.86]</span>So no more than two characters are involved in any one <span class="underline">scene</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.54" data-time="197.62">[03:17.62]</span>And it has a happy ending.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.4" data-time="200.16">[03:20.16]</span>And it's ... the story is presented as though ... well, <span class="underline">even</span> though a lot of the actions that occurred are <span class="underline">pretty</span> <span class="underline">fantastic</span>, so you'd never think of it as <span class="underline">realistic</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.79" data-time="210.56">[03:30.56]</span>The characters still act like ... they <span class="underline">resemble</span> real people. <span class="time" data-times="3.85" data-time="214.35">[03:34.35]</span>They are not real or <span class="underline">even</span> based on historical figures. <span class="time" data-times="7.02" data-time="218.2">[03:38.20]</span>But you might have a supernatural story involving a king, and he'd act like you'd <span class="underline">expect</span> a Norwegian king to act.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.32" data-time="225.22">[03:45.22]</span>OK. The third main kind of folk tale is the comical story. <span class="time" data-times="12.21" data-time="230.54">[03:50.54]</span>We'll say more later about these, but for now, just be <span class="underline">aware</span> of the <span class="underline">category</span> and that they can <span class="underline">contain</span> supernatural aspects, but they are usually more playful and amusing <span class="underline">overall</span> than supernatural stories.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.77" data-time="242.75">[04:02.75]</span>Now, as I said, traditionally, folk tales were just passed down orally. <span class="time" data-times="3.73" data-time="248.52">[04:08.52]</span>Each <span class="underline">generation</span> of storytellers had their own style of telling a story. <span class="time" data-times="7.49" data-time="252.25">[04:12.25]</span>But ... um ... in Norway, before the 19th <span class="underline">century</span>, folk tales were just for kids. <span class="time" data-times="3.3" data-time="259.74">[04:19.74]</span>They weren't seen as worthy of <span class="underline">analysis</span> or <span class="underline">academic</span> <span class="underline">attention</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.9" data-time="263.04">[04:23.04]</span>But this changed when the <span class="underline">Romantic</span> Movement <span class="underline">spread</span> <span class="underline">throughout</span> Europe in the mid-19th <span class="underline">century</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.11" data-time="268.94">[04:28.94]</span>Romantics looked at folk tales as <span class="underline">sort</span> of a <span class="underline">reflection</span> of the soul of the people. <span class="time" data-times="4.29" data-time="274.05">[04:34.05]</span>So there was something distinctly Norwegian in folk tales from Norway. <span class="time" data-times="4.8" data-time="278.34">[04:38.34]</span>And there was <span class="underline">renewed</span> pride in the <span class="underline">literature</span> and art forms of <span class="underline">individual</span> countries. <span class="time" data-times="5.64" data-time="283.14">[04:43.14]</span>As a result, the first collection of Norwegian folk tales is published in 1852. <span class="time" data-times="3.53" data-time="288.78">[04:48.78]</span>And there have been many new editions published since then. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="292.31">[04:52.31]</span>For the people of Norway, these stories are now an important part of what it means to be Norwegian.</p>
