          <h4 class="w3-center">Energy costs reach sky-high levels</h4>
          <p>Heating prices, and the university's heating bills, reached record-high levels this year. In an effort to reduce heating costs, the university plans to lower the temperature in all classroom buildings on weekends and on weekdays after five P.M., when the day's classes have officially ended. Because classes will not be in session at these times, the reduced heat should have no negative impact on students and their studies. The university considers it essential that the cost-saving measures not interfere with student activities.</p>

        <article>
          <p>Now listen to two students discussing the article.</p>
          <p>(woman) What on earth is the university thinking?</p>
          <p>(man) Huh? What do you mean?</p>
          <p>(woman) Well, those buildings aren't just used for classes. That's where my evening study group usually meets.</p>
          <p>(man) Oh, of course, that's true. But you could go to the library instead. (woman) Yeah, but the library only has a few rooms that people can use for group meetings which is why classrooms are so convenient. But now, if it's winter and cold, where can we go?</p>
          <p>(man) Right! In the middle of winter, forget it! Or even it's just kind of cold out. (woman) It'd be pretty unpleasant.</p>
          <p>(man) Oh, but still, they obviously have to do something about the situation. (woman) Oh, I agree. They have to do something but they should find a solution that isn't so disruptive, to academics no less.</p>
          <p>(man) Such as?</p>
          <p>(woman) Well, for one, if they replaced all those old windows, they are so drafty. They let the cold in. And if they insulated the buildings better, these are really old buildings. Charming, but,</p>
          <p>(man) But not at all energy-efficient, yeah, you're probably right.</p>
          <p>(woman) There're some really basic improvements they can make that'll make a huge difference in the long term that can solve the problem and still leave us somewhere to study.</p>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>Well, the woman disagrees with the article for two main reasons. First of all, she that the classroom buildings are not only just for classes, but also a convenient place for her evening study group to meet. She thinks her study group couldn't go to the library because there are only a few rooms there for group meeting. If it is winter and cold, her study group would have nowhere to go. Secondly, she thinks that the university could do something else to reduce its energy cost. For example, they could replace the old drafty windows to get the building more energy-efficient. She believes that there are basic improvements that the university can do to make a huge difference in the long term, but the university should leave convenient places for the students to study. So the woman disagrees with the plan for the reasons stated above. (147 words)</p>
