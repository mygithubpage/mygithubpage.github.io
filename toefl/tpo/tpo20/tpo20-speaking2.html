Others prefer to read about current events in newspapers or on the Internet. Which do you think is better: watching the news or reading the news? Explain why.</p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>I prefer watching the news to reading the new because watching the news can provide me with more details about what had happened. Usually in the video, I can see the scene, see the people and even hear their words. It seems as if I am in the scene. Besides, watching the news can get more objective information. Since the news articles in the newspaper should be edited or censored, some important information may be omitted. However, videos news bring me to the scene and make me one of the witnesses. Even though, some might say videos can be clipped, I believe at the same censoring level, video is more objective than words.</p></article></div></main></body></html>
