I've got a few more observations and experiments to do. It's another three month of work and I'll start writing my paper.</p><p>(man) Wow! Sounds like it'll be a great paper.</p><p>(woman) Thanks, I hope so. There's a problem, though.</p><p>(man) What?</p><p>(woman) Professor Green has been invited to teach at a university in France for a semester. And obviously, I still need a lot of help with the project.</p><p>(man) Hum, what are you gonna do?</p><p>(woman) Well, Professor Green suggested Professor Baker that I can work with another.</p><p>(man) Oh, I've heard of her. Professor Baker is quite famous.</p><p>(woman) Yeah, but I don't know her at all. And my research isn't in her area of expertise. She works with fish, my works on mice, not exactly the best match.</p><p>(man) Well, you'll get to know her eventually. And she's a great biologist. So she'll still be able to help you even if your topic isn't exactly her specialty. She may give you some new perspective on your work.</p><p>(woman) I know, I'm considering it, but still, I'm thinking about asking Professor Green if he could advise me long-distance.</p><p>(man) That's a thou ght! You think he'd do it?</p><p>(woman) He probably would. But I don't know if it's a good idea. I mean, he could always look at my data and read my write-ups through email. But the thing is, he wouldn't be here to supervise my experiments.</p><p>(man) Yeah, well, I'm sure you'll figure out the best thing to do.</p></article><section id="question"><h4>Question</h4><p>Briefly summarize the woman's problem, then state which solution you would recommend. Explain the reasons for your recommendation. </p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>Well the woman's problem is that she's been working on a project and she needs a lot of help from her professor but her professor will be away for a semester. There are two solutions for the woman's situation: first she could change a professor to work with or she could still work with her professor and receive long-distance advice. I guess the second solution is a better one for some reasons. First of all, it is unwise to change a professor when in the middle of the project, no matter how famous the new professor is. It could always take a whole lot of time for the new professor to get familiar with the woman's project, so it'll be definitely a pretty waste of time The second reason is that, receiving long-distance help from the professor wouldn't make any difference with the convenience of Internet communication tool such as e-mails, Snapchat and stuff like that. And I bet it could even improve the efficiency of her project as long as the woman could handle the time lag well. So I think the second solution would be better.
