        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>I will recommend golden retrievers to my friend. First, golden retrievers are very clever. They can be trained to fetch shoes or to shake hands with people. They can also give response when people call their names. The second reason is golden retrievers are faithful to their master. They will bravely protect your home when someone break into your house. If you have a little baby, your dog will take care of him during short leaves of the grown-ups. Golden retrievers are good companies and loyal guardians. This makes them the first choice when people consider which kind of pet to have. </p>
