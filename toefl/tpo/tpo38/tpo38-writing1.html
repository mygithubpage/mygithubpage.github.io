The development of an international fund to help developing countries implement useful conservation techniques in forest protection is the best way to protect the world's forests and hopefully reverse negative trends that imperil our forests.</p><p>Using the internationally established forest protection fund to protect forest agriculture is perhaps the most important initiative. Dispersing these funds to governments, land owners, and farmers will allow them to resist intrusions by the logging industry, oil companies, and property developers who are after their land. This is a very specific initiative that will help agricultural areas from being developed into environmentally damaging industries and ensure that agricultural farm use is uninterrupted.</p><p>A second use of this protection fund could be used to develop the economies of villages and tribal communities located in forest areas. By parceling out funds to provide villagers and tribal residents of forests with a stipend will help these people continue their way of life and resist pressure to convert their forest land to the above mentioned industries. Providing living stipends and other financial aid to forest residents will help people afford education, health services, and nutritional aid so that they are less tempted to resort to destructive or exploitative forest practices to make a living.</p><p>Much of the global concern with deforestation focuses on the alarming loss of biodiversity. Humans use thousands of species of plants and animals on a daily basis for food, shelter, clothing and medicinal needs. Deforestation threatens species that humans rely on for these essential services. Using the international fund to help governments and people establish protected forest areas is the best way to maintain valuable forest biodiversity and protect species from exploitation, endangerment and extinction. </p></article><div><audio src="tpo38-writing1.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></div><article id="listening-passage" class="passage"><h3>Listening Text</h3><p>The world's forests are indeed under tremendous pressure from industries and practices that deforest these important ecosystems. However, the suggestion put forth in the reading passage, that the creation of an international protection fund will help protect these areas, is flawed for several reasons.</p><p>Firstly, agriculture is itself a destructive force upon the forest ecosystem. With the rising populations, farmers are under constant pressure to increase harvest yields by using modern agricultural technology and practices. These include harmful practices such as fertilizer and pesticide use which have been proven to be detrimental to the surrounding environments because they create runoff waste and water pollution. This in turn leads to deforestation at a rate much worse than that of logging. Continued promotion of agriculture as a solution to deforestation is not a good idea.</p><p>Secondly, paying villagers and tribal communities a stipend is an inadequate solution to the deforestation problem. Disbursement of money from the international protection fund would mean that money would go to forest owners. More often than not these owners are in fact governments, not residents. Therefore, a payout of this sort would not end up in the hands of these forest dwellers. Additionally, there is no guarantee that if governments received money that it would be appropriately used to protect the forest.</p><p>Finally, if money is spent promoting biodiversity by encouraging the planting of new forest, there is no doubt that people will plant trees which have commercial purposes. If people merely plant plantation forests, this will do nothing in the way of promoting the goal of forest biodiversity. As you can see, the development of an international monetary fund to protect developing countries' forests is rather inadequate.</p></article><section id="question"><h4>Question</h4><p>Summarize the points made in the lecture you just heard, explaining how they cast doubt on the specific theories discussed in the reading passage. </p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>Integrated Writing The passage concentrates on forest protection and lists three means that he thinks practical. However, the speaker retorts all the three ideas one by one.</p><p>First, the writer reckons that international fund can be raised to protect mere agricultural use of the forest. But the lecturer points out that agricultural damage is a strong destructive force. In order to get harvest, farmers will use pesticide and fertile to help crops grow better. This will produce run-off waste and water pollution which was detrimental to forest condition. Therefore, the first approach of the passage is proved unconvincing.</p><p>Second, the passage says government should help to develop the economics of nearby villages and tribal communities so they will not make money through damaging the forest. Nevertheless, the speaker regards this as an inadequate solution. He emphasizes that money given to landowners – the government will not be used for forest developers. It will not be properly used so the writer's second idea is rebutted.</p><p>Third, the author indicates that we should be cautious about the loss of biodiversity caused by forest destruction. Therefore, he argues that new trees should be planted to maintain biodiversity. But the speaker says that if people are encouraged to plant new trees, they will first choose certain kinds of trees which can bring them commercial benefits. Recovering forest biodiversity needs various kinds of trees. So merely planting money-making trees in fact will harm biodiversity. Thus reliably retorted the last argument in the essay.
