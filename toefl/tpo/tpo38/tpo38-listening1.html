        <h3>Listening Text</h3>
        <article>
          <p>Narrator: Listen to a conversation between a student and an employee in the university housing office.</p>
          <p>:Employee: Hi. Can I help you?</p>
          <p>:Student: I hope so. I am taking a class this summer and I need to see about getting campus housing.</p>
          <p>:Employee: Oh, sorry. I am afraid the deadline to apply for summer housing in the dormitories has already passed. I could help you look for something off campus.</p>
          <p>:Student: Well, see, I only found out yesterday I need to take this course. It wasn't really my idea. I mean I was gonna take it in the fall. It is a course I need for my major in cognitive science, Professor Wilson was supposed to teach it but now...</p>
          <p>:Employee: Oh, right. I heard he is taking a last-minute leave of absence next year. I hope everything is okay.</p>
          <p>:Student: Oh yeah. He'll be in Botswana helping develop the new cognitive science program at our sister university there. Anyway I have to take the course this summer if I want to graduate on time. I've got a note from the dean approving the whole situation.</p>
          <p>:Employee: Oh, well, in that case I guess we'd better make an exception for you. Only problem is most of the bedrooms are gone already. Was there any particular dorm you were interested in?</p>
          <p>:Student: Well, I'm in Randolph Hall right now, but my roommate's graduating in May so I have signed up for a single in Murphy for the fall, room 206. I was hoping I might be able to just move in there now.</p>
          <p>:Employee: Well, let's see what the computer says. Sorry, that room's scheduled for repainting and maintenance over the summer. So I can't give it to you.</p>
          <p>:Student: I don't really care if it's repainted. I'll be covering most of the walls with posters anyway. Couldn't I just take it as is?</p>
          <p>:Employee: Sorry, no. It is actually a city ordinance. All rental rooms including dorm rooms have to be painted at least once every five years.</p>
          <p>:Student: Oh, well, how about if I stay where I'm for the summer? I'm pretty sure they just painted it a couple years ago.</p>
          <p>:Employee: Hang on, let me check. You said Randolph, right?</p>
          <p>:Student: Room 122.</p>
          <p>:Employee: Oops. Afraid not. The entire floor is taken.</p>
          <p>:Student: Oh, well. Guess I'll just have to move twice.</p>
          <p>:Employee: One sec. I have got one more idea. Here we go. There is a room open in Murphy just down the hall from your new one. That way come fall, you'd only have to carry your things a few doors down.</p>
          <p>:Student: Okay, works for me.</p>
          <p>:Employee: Now, that room is a double. Right now you have got it to yourself but there's a chance someone else might sign up at the last minute, not likely. But you could end up with a roommate for the summer. Would that be okay?</p>
          <p>:Student: Oh, sure. I can get along with anyone for a couple of months.</p>
          <p>:Employee: Okay, then, I will get the forms printed up. They should be ready for you by tomorrow afternoon. You can stop by and sign them then.</p>
          <p>:Student: Excellent, thanks. </p>
