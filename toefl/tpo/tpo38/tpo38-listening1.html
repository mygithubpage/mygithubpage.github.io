The university's rules for keeping dorm rooms well maintained.</p><p>D. The student's best options for housing over the summer.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The title of this question is:</p><p>Student:</p><p>I hope so. I am taking a class this summer and I need to see about getting campus housing.</p><p>Employee:</p><p>Oh, sorry. I am afraid the deadline to apply for summer housing in the dormitories has already passed. I could help you look for something off campus.</p><p>The beginning students indicated that they needed to find accommodation for the summer vacation. The teacher said that the application has now expired, so it can only be found outside the school. Option D is in accordance with the original meaning. The remaining three options are not well summarized. Select D.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What can be inferred about Professor Wilson?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. He is currently in Botswana.</p><p>B. He will not teach at the student's university in the fall.</p><p>C. He does not generally teach courses over the summer.</p><p>D. He is the professor who suggested that the student find housing off campus.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The title of this question is:</p><p>Student:</p><p>Well, see, I only found out yesterday I need to take this course. It wasn't really my idea. I mean I was gonna take it in the fall. It is a course I need for my major in cognitive science, Professor Wilson Was asked to teach it but now...</p><p>Employee:</p><p>Oh, right. I heard he is taking a last-minute leave of absence. next year. I hope everything is okay.</p><p>The students said here that they did not intend to live in summer, but because the teacher taught him cognitive science majors in the fall, he suddenly had to leave school, so the fall class was advanced. Option B meets the student's meaning. The other three options do not meet. Select B.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why is the woman willing to make an exception for the student?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. He has received special permission from the dean.</p><p>B. His professor has discussed the situation with the woman.</p><p>C. He is willing to live in off-campus housing.</p><p>D. Several dormitory rooms have recently become available.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The title of this question is:</p><p>Student:</p><p>I've got a note from the dean approving the whole situation.</p><p>Employee:</p><p>Oh, well, in that case I guess we'd better make an exception for you.</p><p>The students here said that they had found a title for the dean. The teacher said that he could help him with special cases. Option A meets the meaning of these two sentences. The other three do not meet.

I was hoping I might be able to just move in there now.</p><p>Student:</p><p>Oh, well. Guess I just have to move twice.</p><p>The students here said that they are now in Randolph Hall, but because the housemates graduated in May, he needs to apply for a Murphy single room in the fall. So he wants to stay in Murphy in the summer, so that when the summer turns to the end of the fall, he won't need to change his dormitory again. Students want to avoid changing hostels in the summer and changing them again in the fall. Option B is consistent with the question. The other three options do not match. Select B.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>At the end of the conversation, what has not yet been determined about the student's living situation over the summer?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

Whether the room he is assigned still needs to be painted.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The title of this question is:</p><p>Employee:</p><p>Now, that room is a double. Right now you have got it to yourself but there's a chance someone else might possibly sign up at the last minute, not likely. But you could end up with a roommate for the summer. Would that be okay?</p><p>The only thing that the teacher and the student did not confirm is that the student is living in a double room in the summer, so I am not sure if I will add more people. Option C is consistent with the question. The other three options do not match. Select C.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
