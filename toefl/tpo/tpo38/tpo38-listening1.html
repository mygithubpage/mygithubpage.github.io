              <p>Now, that room is a double. Right now you have got it to yourself but there's a chance someone else might possibly sign up at the last minute, not likely. But you could end up with a roommate for the summer. Would that be okay?</p>
              <p>The only thing that the teacher and the student did not confirm is that the student is living in a double room in the summer, so I am not sure if I will add more people. Option C is consistent with the question. The other three options do not match. Select C.</p>
