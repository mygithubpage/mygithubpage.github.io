            <b>Microscopes</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>Before microscopes were
first used in the seventeenth <span class="underline">century</span>, no one knew that living organisms were
composed of cells. The first microscopes were light microscopes, which work by passing
<span class="underline">visible</span> light <span class="underline">through</span> a <span class="underline">specimen</span>. Glass lenses in the <span class="underline">microscope</span> bend the light
to <span class="underline">magnify</span> the <span class="underline">image</span> of the <span class="underline">specimen</span> and <span class="underline">project</span> the <span class="underline">image</span> into the viewer's
eye or onto <span class="underline">photographic</span> <span class="underline">film</span>. Light microscopes can <span class="underline">magnify</span> objects up to
1,000 times without causing blurriness.</p>
          <p>Magnification, the increase in the <span class="underline">apparent</span> size of an object, is one important <span class="underline">factor</span> in microscopy. Also important is resolving power, a <span class="underline">measure</span> of the clarity of an <span class="underline">image</span>. Resolving power is the <span class="underline">ability</span> of an <span class="underline">optical</span> <span class="underline">instrument</span> to show two objects as <span class="underline">separate</span>. For example, what looks to the <span class="underline">unaided</span> eye like a single star in the sky may be resolved as two stars with the help of a <span class="underline">telescope</span>. Any <span class="underline">optical</span> <span class="underline">device</span> is limited by its resolving power. The light <span class="underline">microscope</span> cannot <span class="underline">resolve</span> <span class="underline">detail</span> finer than 0.2 micrometers, about the size of the smallest bacterium; <span class="underline">consequently</span>, no matter how many times its <span class="underline">image</span> of such a bacterium is magnified, the light <span class="underline">microscope</span> cannot show the details of the <span class="underline">cell</span>'s <span class="underline">internal</span> structure.</p>
          <p>From the year 1665, when
English microscopist Robert Hooke discovered cells, until the middle of the
twentieth <span class="underline">century</span>, biologists had only light microscopes for viewing cells. But
they discovered a great <span class="underline">deal</span>, including the cells composing animal and plant
tissues, <span class="underline">microscopic</span> organisms, and some of the structures <span class="underline">within</span> cells. By the
mid-1800s, these discoveries led to the <span class="underline">cell</span> <span class="underline">theory</span>, which states that all
living things are composed of cells and that all cells come from other cells.</p>
          <p>Our knowledge of <span class="underline">cell</span> structure took a <span class="underline">giant</span> <span class="underline">leap</span> <span class="underline">forward</span> as biologists began using the <span class="underline">electron</span> <span class="underline">microscope</span> in the 1950s. <span class="underline">Instead</span> of light, the <span class="underline">electron</span> <span class="underline">microscope</span> uses a <span class="underline">beam</span> of electrons and has a much higher resolving power than the light <span class="underline">microscope</span>. In fact, the most powerful modern <span class="underline">electron</span> microscopes can <span class="underline">distinguish</span> objects as small as 0.2 nanometers, a thousandfold improvement over the light <span class="underline">microscope</span>. The period at the end of this sentence is about a million times bigger than an object 0.2 nanometers in <span class="underline">diameter</span>, which is the size of a large <span class="underline">atom</span>. Only under <span class="underline">special</span> conditions can <span class="underline">electron</span> microscopes <span class="underline">detect</span> <span class="underline">individual</span> atoms. However, cells, cellular organelles, and <span class="underline">even</span> molecules like DNA and <span class="underline">protein</span> are much larger than single atoms.</p>
          <p>Biologists use the scanning <span class="underline">electron</span> <span class="underline">microscope</span> to study the detailed <span class="underline">architecture</span> of <span class="underline">cell</span> surfaces. It uses an <span class="underline">electron</span> <span class="underline">beam</span> to <span class="underline">scan</span> the surface of a <span class="underline">cell</span> or group of cells that have been coated with metal. The metal stops the <span class="underline">beam</span> from going <span class="underline">through</span> the cells. When the metal is hit by the <span class="underline">beam</span>, it emits electrons. The electrons are focused to form an <span class="underline">image</span> of the outside of the cells. The scanning <span class="underline">electron</span> <span class="underline">microscope</span> produces images that look three-dimensional.</p>
          <p>The transmission <span class="underline">electron</span> <span class="underline">microscope</span>, on the other hands, is used to study the details of <span class="underline">internal</span> <span class="underline">cell</span> structure. Specimens are cut into extremely thin sections, and the transmission <span class="underline">electron</span> <span class="underline">microscope</span> aims an <span class="underline">electron</span> <span class="underline">beam</span> <span class="underline">through</span> a <span class="underline">section</span>, just as a light <span class="underline">microscope</span> aims a <span class="underline">beam</span> of light <span class="underline">through</span> a <span class="underline">specimen</span>. However, <span class="underline">instead</span> of lenses made of glass, the transmission <span class="underline">electron</span> <span class="underline">microscope</span> uses electromagnets as lenses, as do all <span class="underline">electron</span> microscopes. The electromagnets bend the <span class="underline">electron</span> <span class="underline">beam</span> to <span class="underline">magnify</span> and <span class="underline">focus</span> an <span class="underline">image</span> onto a viewing <span class="underline">screen</span> or <span class="underline">photographic</span> <span class="underline">film</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="underline">Electron</span> microscopes have truly revolutionized the study of cells and <span class="underline">cell</span> organelles. <span class="underline">Nonetheless</span>, they have not replaced the light <span class="underline">microscope</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> One problem with <span class="underline">electron</span> microscopes is that they cannot be used to study living specimens because the <span class="underline">specimen</span> must be held in a <span class="underline">vacuum</span> <span class="underline">chamber</span>; that is, all the <span class="underline">air</span> and <span class="underline">liquid</span> must be removed. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> For a biologist studying a living <span class="underline">process</span>, such as the whirling movement of a bacterium, a light <span class="underline">microscope</span> equipped with a video camera might be better than either a scanning <span class="underline">electron</span> <span class="underline">microscope</span> or a transmission <span class="underline">electron</span> <span class="underline">microscope</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span> Thus, the light <span class="underline">microscope</span> remains a useful tool, especially for studying living cells. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span> The size of a <span class="underline">cell</span> often determines the type of <span class="underline">microscope</span> a biologist uses to study it.</p>
