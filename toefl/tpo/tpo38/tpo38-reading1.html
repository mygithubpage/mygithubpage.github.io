          <h4 class="w3-center">Microscopes</h4>
          <p>Before microscopes were
first used in the seventeenth <span class="highlight">century</span>, no one knew that living organisms were
composed of cells. The first microscopes were light microscopes, which work by passing
<span class="highlight">visible</span> light <span class="highlight">through</span> a <span class="highlight">specimen</span>. Glass lenses in the <span class="highlight">microscope</span> bend the light
to <span class="highlight">magnify</span> the <span class="highlight">image</span> of the <span class="highlight">specimen</span> and <span class="highlight">project</span> the <span class="highlight">image</span> into the viewer's
eye or onto <span class="highlight">photographic</span> <span class="highlight">film</span>. Light microscopes can <span class="highlight">magnify</span> objects up to
1,000 times without causing blurriness.</p>
          <p>Magnification, the increase in the <span class="highlight">apparent</span> size of an object, is one important <span class="highlight">factor</span> in microscopy. Also important is resolving power, a <span class="highlight">measure</span> of the clarity of an <span class="highlight">image</span>. Resolving power is the <span class="highlight">ability</span> of an <span class="highlight">optical</span> <span class="highlight">instrument</span> to show two objects as <span class="highlight">separate</span>. For example, what looks to the <span class="highlight">unaided</span> eye like a single star in the sky may be resolved as two stars with the help of <span class="question2">a <span class="highlight">telescope</span>.</span> Any <span class="highlight">optical</span> <span class="highlight">device</span> is limited by its resolving power. <span class="question3">The light <span class="highlight">microscope</span> cannot <span class="highlight">resolve</span> <span class="highlight">detail</span> finer than 0.2 micrometers, about the size of the smallest bacterium; <span class="highlight">consequently</span>, no matter how many times its <span class="highlight">image</span> of such a bacterium is magnified, the light <span class="highlight">microscope</span> cannot show the details of the <span class="highlight">cell</span>'s <span class="highlight">internal</span> structure.</span></p>
          <p>From the year 1665, when
English microscopist Robert Hooke discovered cells, until the middle of the
twentieth <span class="highlight">century</span>, biologists had only light microscopes for viewing cells. But
they discovered a great <span class="highlight">deal</span>, including the cells composing animal and plant
tissues, <span class="highlight">microscopic</span> organisms, and some of the structures <span class="highlight">within</span> cells. By the
mid-1800s, these discoveries led to the <span class="highlight">cell</span> <span class="highlight">theory</span>, which states that all
living things are composed of cells and that all cells come from other cells.</p>
          <p>Our knowledge of <span class="highlight">cell</span> structure took a <span class="highlight"><span class="question5">giant</span></span> <span class="highlight">leap</span> <span class="highlight">forward</span> as biologists began using the <span class="highlight">electron</span> <span class="highlight">microscope</span> in the 1950s. <span class="highlight">Instead</span> of light, the <span class="highlight">electron</span> <span class="highlight">microscope</span> uses a <span class="highlight">beam</span> of electrons and has a much higher resolving power than the light <span class="highlight">microscope</span>. In fact, the most powerful modern <span class="highlight">electron</span> microscopes can <span class="highlight">distinguish</span> objects as small as 0.2 nanometers, a thousandfold improvement over the light <span class="highlight">microscope</span>. The period at the end of this sentence is about a million times bigger than an object 0.2 nanometers in <span class="highlight">diameter</span>, which is the size of a large <span class="highlight">atom</span>. Only under <span class="highlight">special</span> conditions can <span class="highlight">electron</span> microscopes <span class="highlight"><span class="question7">detect</span></span> <span class="highlight">individual</span> atoms. However, cells, cellular organelles, and <span class="highlight">even</span> molecules like DNA and <span class="highlight">protein</span> are much larger than single atoms.</p>
          <p>Biologists use the scanning <span class="highlight">electron</span> <span class="highlight">microscope</span> to study the detailed <span class="highlight">architecture</span> of <span class="highlight">cell</span> surfaces. It uses an <span class="highlight">electron</span> <span class="highlight">beam</span> to <span class="highlight">scan</span> the surface of a <span class="highlight">cell</span> or group of cells that have been coated with metal. The metal stops the <span class="highlight">beam</span> from going <span class="highlight">through</span> the cells. When the metal is hit by the <span class="highlight">beam</span>, it <span class="question9">emits</span> electrons. The electrons are focused to form an <span class="highlight">image</span> of the outside of the cells. The scanning <span class="highlight">electron</span> <span class="highlight">microscope</span> produces images that look three-dimensional.</p>
          <p>The transmission <span class="highlight">electron</span> <span class="highlight">microscope</span>, on the other hands, is used to study the details of <span class="highlight">internal</span> <span class="highlight">cell</span> structure. Specimens are cut into extremely thin sections, and the transmission <span class="highlight">electron</span> <span class="highlight">microscope</span> aims an <span class="highlight">electron</span> <span class="highlight">beam</span> <span class="highlight">through</span> a <span class="highlight">section</span>, just as a light <span class="highlight">microscope</span> aims a <span class="highlight">beam</span> of light <span class="highlight">through</span> a <span class="highlight">specimen</span>. However, <span class="highlight">instead</span> of lenses made of glass, the transmission <span class="highlight">electron</span> <span class="highlight">microscope</span> uses electromagnets as lenses, as do all <span class="highlight">electron</span> microscopes. The electromagnets bend the <span class="highlight">electron</span> <span class="highlight">beam</span> to <span class="highlight">magnify</span> and <span class="highlight">focus</span> an <span class="highlight">image</span> onto a viewing <span class="highlight">screen</span> or <span class="highlight">photographic</span> <span class="highlight">film</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="highlight">Electron</span> microscopes have truly revolutionized the study of cells and <span class="highlight">cell</span> organelles. <span class="highlight"><span class="question11">Nonetheless</span></span>, they have not replaced the light <span class="highlight">microscope</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> One problem with <span class="highlight">electron</span> microscopes is that they cannot be used to study living specimens because the <span class="highlight">specimen</span> must be held in a <span class="highlight">vacuum</span> <span class="highlight">chamber</span>; that is, all the <span class="highlight">air</span> and <span class="highlight">liquid</span> must be removed. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> For a biologist studying a living <span class="highlight">process</span>, such as the whirling movement of a bacterium, a light <span class="highlight">microscope</span> equipped with a video camera might be better than either a scanning <span class="highlight">electron</span> <span class="highlight">microscope</span> or a transmission <span class="highlight">electron</span> <span class="highlight">microscope</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span> Thus, the light <span class="highlight">microscope</span> remains a useful tool, especially for studying living cells. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span> The size of a <span class="highlight">cell</span> often determines the type of <span class="highlight">microscope</span> a biologist uses to study it.</p>

              <p>The key words given in this question title are the role of metal and the scanning electron microscope, based on which two phrases are used to locate an electron beam to scan the surface of a cell or group of cells. That has been coated with metal. The metal stops the beam from going through the cells. When the metal is hit by the beam, it <span class="question9">emits</span> electrons. The electrons are focused to form an image of the outside of the cells. The scanning electron microscope The effect of this sentence is: The electron microscope scans the cell surface with a beam of electrons, and the cell surface is surrounded by a layer of metal. This metal surface prevents the electron beam from passing through the cell. This layer of metal can reflect electrons, forming a three-dimensional image of the outer layer of the cell. So the role of this layer of metal is to help electron microscope imaging. Select C. Option A says that it can zoom in. Option B can be used as a protection layer. Option D can reveal details inside the cell. Select C.</p>
