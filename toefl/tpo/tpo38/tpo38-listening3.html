            <span class="time" data-times="2.82" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in a business class.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.02" data-time="2.82">[00:02.82]</span>Professor: Last time we talked about the design and production of advertisements. <span class="time" data-times="5.06" data-time="7.84">[00:07.84]</span>Today we'll be discussing how advertisers decide where to <span class="highlight">display</span> their ads.<span class="time" data-times="10.09" data-time="12.9">[00:12.90]</span> This is <span class="highlight">critical</span> to a successful marketing <span class="highlight">campaign</span> because it builds up the consumer's <span class="highlight">brand</span> <span class="highlight">awareness</span>, their knowledge of a product made by a <span class="highlight">particular</span> <span class="highlight">manufacturer</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.01" data-time="22.99">[00:22.99]</span>And studies show that the more you are <span class="highlight">aware</span> of a product, there's a greater <span class="highlight">chance</span> you'll buy it.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="9.36" data-time="28">[00:28.00]</span>Now, most ads we see in the <span class="highlight">media</span>, like in newspapers, television, or magazines, are placed where the product is matched with a <span class="highlight">medium</span> of a <span class="highlight">similar</span> theme.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.07" data-time="37.36">[00:37.36]</span>Let's take...uh...the <span class="highlight">medium</span> of magazines as an example. <span class="time" data-times="6.63" data-time="41.43">[00:41.43]</span>If you were to flip <span class="highlight">through</span>, say, an automotive magazine, what kind of ads would you <span class="highlight">expect</span> to find? Jack?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.52" data-time="48.06">[00:48.06]</span>Student: Ads for cars, car parts, tires, <span class="highlight">stuff</span> like that.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.48" data-time="52.58">[00:52.58]</span>Professor: Good. When you have an ad for a certain product in <span class="highlight">media</span> with a <span class="highlight">similar</span> theme, we call that congruent <span class="highlight">media</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.92" data-time="59.06">[00:59.06]</span>Congruent <span class="highlight">simply</span> means it fits.<span class="time" data-times="1.62" data-time="62.98">[01:02.98]</span> It's what you would <span class="highlight">expect</span>.<span class="time" data-times="4.55" data-time="64.6">[01:04.60]</span>Congruent <span class="highlight">media</span> placement is the most <span class="highlight">logical</span> choice for marketing a product.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.65" data-time="69.15">[01:09.15]</span>First, it's <span class="highlight">obvious</span> that people reading a car magazine are interested in cars.<span class="time" data-times="4.44" data-time="73.8">[01:13.80]</span> So if you place a car ad there, you know you are reaching the right <span class="highlight">audience</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.3" data-time="78.24">[01:18.24]</span>Also, research shows that when people read an ad in a congruent <span class="highlight">medium</span>, afterwards, they have <span class="highlight">pretty</span> good <span class="highlight">recall</span> of what was advertised.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.44" data-time="86.54">[01:26.54]</span>Now, there's another <span class="highlight">approach</span>, that's placing ads in incongruent <span class="highlight">media</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.51" data-time="91.98">[01:31.98]</span>Incongruent <span class="highlight">media</span> are the magazines, newspapers, TV spots, where the theme doesn't <span class="highlight">match</span> the theme of the product.<span class="time" data-times="5.93" data-time="100.49">[01:40.49]</span> <span class="highlight">Even</span> though it seems counterintuitive, research shows that this also is an <span class="highlight">effective</span> marketing <span class="highlight">strategy</span>.<span class="time" data-times="13.09" data-time="106.42">[01:46.42]</span> One study tested this by placing car advertisements in a magazine that had an incongruent theme and it found that this contributed to consumers' <span class="highlight">positive</span> attitudes toward the ad and the car being advertised.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.82" data-time="119.51">[01:59.51]</span>Student: What kind of magazine was it?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.57" data-time="122.33">[02:02.33]</span>Professor: A cooking magazine.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.28" data-time="123.9">[02:03.90]</span>Student: Wow! That worked?<span class="time" data-times="5.46" data-time="125.18">[02:05.18]</span> I'd have imagined it would be a <span class="highlight">distraction</span> to see something like that, you know, out of place.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.33" data-time="130.64">[02:10.64]</span>Professor: Well, keep in <span class="highlight">mind</span> that <span class="highlight">potential</span> car buyers don't read only car magazines.<span class="time" data-times="1.52" data-time="134.97">[02:14.97]</span> Most have other interests.<span class="time" data-times="9.06" data-time="136.49">[02:16.49]</span> Many of them probably subscribe to other magazines, a news weekly, a <span class="highlight">financial</span> <span class="highlight">publication</span>, something related to a <span class="highlight">special</span> <span class="highlight">interest</span> or hobby.<span class="time" data-times="11.55" data-time="145.55">[02:25.55]</span> So what marketers have to do then is carefully research <span class="highlight">potential</span> customers and look for overlapping interests, which magazine overlaps most with the interests of the car buyer. <span class="time" data-times="5.59" data-time="157.1">[02:37.10]</span> Then when they do choose to place ads in incongruent <span class="highlight">media</span>, they know they'll be <span class="highlight">effective</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.41" data-time="162.69">[02:42.69]</span>Student: Okay.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="8.73" data-time="164.1">[02:44.10]</span>Professor: Now this study suggests that because the people reading a cooking magazine didn't <span class="highlight">expect</span> to see a car ad, they actually paid more <span class="highlight">attention</span>.<span class="time" data-times="9.2" data-time="172.83">[02:52.83]</span> And so for example, when people who like reading about cars see a car ad in a car magazine, they might pass over it quickly, while here...</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.92" data-time="182.03">[03:02.03]</span>Student: They actually took more time to read the ad.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.71" data-time="184.95">[03:04.95]</span>Professor: Right! People paid more <span class="highlight">attention</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.59" data-time="187.66">[03:07.66]</span>They processed the information more carefully when it appears in a <span class="highlight">medium</span> with a different theme.<span class="time" data-times="8.47" data-time="193.25">[03:13.25]</span> This <span class="highlight">ultimately</span> results in stronger <span class="highlight">brand</span> <span class="highlight">awareness</span>, which leads to a more <span class="highlight">favorable</span> <span class="highlight">impression</span> of that product <span class="highlight">overall</span>. Jenny?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="8.62" data-time="201.72">[03:21.72]</span>Student: So according to the study, basically when I see an ad in an unexpected place, it'll make me want to buy the product?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.3" data-time="210.34">[03:30.34]</span> Professor: Well, yes and no. <span class="time" data-times="7.15" data-time="212.64">[03:32.64]</span>The research shows you'll probably remember that ad and you are more likely to feel <span class="highlight">positive</span> about that product. <span class="time" data-times="3.4" data-time="219.79">[03:39.79]</span>Now, whether you'll go out to buy it is a different story.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.77" data-time="223.19">[03:43.19]</span>Of <span class="highlight">course</span>, there are other factors at work here. <span class="time" data-times="3.76" data-time="225.96">[03:45.96]</span>You remember those <span class="highlight">criteria</span> we discussed last week? <span class="time" data-times="7.47" data-time="229.72">[03:49.72]</span>Anyway, this explains why most marketers today <span class="highlight">rely</span> on a mix of congruent and incongruent <span class="highlight">media</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.17" data-time="237.19">[03:57.19]</span>But there are limits to how incongruent the <span class="highlight">media</span> should be.<span class="time" data-times="2.04" data-time="242.36">[04:02.36]</span> You don't want a totally mismatch.<span class="time" data-times="6.95" data-time="244.4">[04:04.40]</span> So in a magazine aimed at new parents, you often see car advertisements since parents buy and <span class="highlight">drive</span> cars. <span class="time" data-times="2.61" data-time="251.35">[04:11.35]</span>But there are different types of cars, right?<span class="time" data-times="9.35" data-time="253.96">[04:13.96]</span> For example, placing an ad here for a big roomie van, which is <span class="highlight">popular</span> with big families would make <span class="highlight">sense</span>, but a snappy sports car with only two seats?<span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="263.31">[04:23.31]</span> Well, that would clearly be too much of a mismatch.</p>
