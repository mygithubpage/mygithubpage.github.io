The advantages of congruent over incongruent media for advertising cars.</p><p>B. The advantages of using magazines over television as an incongruent advertising medium.</p><p>C. How incongruent media can be used for effective advertising.</p><p>D. How advertising using only one type of media can increase brand awareness.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The title of this question is:</p><p>Now, there's another approach, that's places ads in incongruent media.</p><p>The introduction of this article is relatively long. From the very beginning it has been about what the advertising of the media is and what its advantages are. Until this sentence, professors began to talk about the role of advertising on inconsistent media. Option C meets. The other three options do not match. Select C.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor, what is one of the advantages of placing an advertisement in congruent media?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Consumers process the information more carefully than they would if it appeared in other media.</p><p>B. The advertisement is seen by consumers who would be most interested in the product advertised.</p><p>C. Consumers can easily compare the product advertised with its competitors.</p><p>D. Consumers are repeatedly exposed to the advertisement.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The title of this question is:</p><p>First, it's obviously that people reading a car magazine are interested in cars. So if you place a car ad there, you know you are reaching the right audience. Also, research shows that when people read an ad in a congruent medium, afterwards, They have pretty good recall of what was advertised. Here are two advantages of consistent advertising. For example, a person looking at a car magazine is likely to buy a car, so placing a consistent advertisement will allow more potential consumers to see it. The second point is that people who see ads on a consistent medium are more likely to recall advertising content. Option B meets the first advantage. The other three options are not met. Select B.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor mention car buyers who subscribe to more than one magazine?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To emphasize the importance of product design in appealing to readers with different interests.</p><p>B. To emphasize the importance of keeping a marketing strategy up-to-date.</p><p>C. To give an example of how marketing can expand a magazine's readership.</p><p>D. To show why marketers need to research overlapping interests.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The title of this question is:</p><p>Professor:</p><p>Well, keep in mind that potential car buyers don't read only car magazines. Most have other interests. Many of them likely subscribe to other magazines, a news weekly, a financial publication, something related to a special interest or hobby. This is where marketers have to do then is carefully research potential customers and look for overlapping interests, which magazine overlaps most with the interests of the car buyer. We need to know the range of interests they cross-subscribed to find a cross-covered magazine for advertising. Option D meets the meaning. The other three options do not match. Select D.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The professor describes a research study in which advertisements for a car were placed in a cooking magazine. What did the researchers find?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Readers paid attention to the advertisements because the product advertised did not match the magazine's theme.</p><p>B. Readers' attention to the advertisements varied depending on the location of the advertisements in the magazine.</p><p>C. Readers formed a negative attitude toward the car that was advertised.</p><p>D. Readers' responses to the cooking articles were not affected by the presence of car advertisements.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The title of this question is:</p><p>Professor:</p><p>Now this study suggests that because the people reading a cooking magazine didn't expect to see car ad, they actually paid more attention. And so for example, when people who like reading about cars see a car ad in a car magazine, they Might pass over it quickly, while here...</p><p>Student:</p><p>They actually took more time to read the ad.</p><p>Here shows that a researcher who studied reading culinary magazine suddenly saw an advertisement for a car. He would pay more attention to this advertisement because the appearance of this advertisement was outside his presupposition. Because we generally only expect to see culinary ads in cooking magazines instead of ads that are not much related to the car. Suddenly a car advertisement comes out. Everyone will be surprised and impressed. Option A meets the meaning. The other three options do not match. Select A.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor describe two types of car advertisements in a magazine for new parents?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To compare the common features of advertisements in congruent and incongruent media.</p><p>B. To compare the reactions of older and younger readers when they see a particular product.</p><p>C. To point out that a medium that is too incongruent with a product will not reach potential buyers of that product.</p><p>D. To point out that magazines are the most effective type of incongruent medium for placing advertisements.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The title of this question is:</p><p>But there are limits to how incongruent the media should be. You don't want a totally mismatch. So in a magazine aimed at new parents, you often see car advertisements since parents buy and drive cars. But there are different types of cars, Right? For example, placing an ad here for a big roomie van, which is popular with big families would make sense, but a snappy sports car with only two seats? Well, that would clearly be too much of a mismatch. Inconsistent media does not always have a good effect on the marketing of advertising products. For example, for a car that wants to be sold to newly-married couples, it is different to place a large-capacity family van on an advertisement and a small-sports car that can only take two people. Newly-married couples are less likely to buy the latter. Option C meets. The other three options do not meet. Select C.</p></div></div><div class="replay" id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor mean when she says this:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. She does not agree with the conclusions of the study.</p><p>B. Different research studies have led to conflicting conclusions.</p><p>C. The student's conclusion is only partly correct.</p><p>D. The student's conclusion applies to congruent, but not incongruent, media.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The title of this question is:</p><p>Student:</p><p>So according to the study, basically when I see an ad in an unexpected place, it'll make me want to buy the product?</p><p>Professor:</p><p>Well, yes and no.</p><p>The yes and no professors here are answers to student questions. The student asked if he saw the advertisement in any unexpected place. He would want to buy something in the advertisement. The professor said that this statement was not correct. Option C is correct. The remaining three options are misunderstood. Select C.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
