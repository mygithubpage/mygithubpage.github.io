Use specific examples and details to support your opinion.</p></section><section id="sample-response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><article><p>I agree with the statement that it is more enjoyable for students to read fiction than nonfiction. One reason is when students are reading fiction stories, they will form relevant pictures in their mind. For example, when they are reading The Great Gatsby, it is necessary for them to shape the luxury situation of Gatsby's mansion. Second reason is reading fictions can help students to learn some useful narrative techniques. For example students can learn the method of flashbacks and use it in their own creation. This is why I think it is more enjoyable for students to read fiction.</p></article></section></main></body></html>
