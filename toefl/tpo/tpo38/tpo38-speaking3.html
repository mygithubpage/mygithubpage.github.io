          <h4 class="w3-center">Student Play Should Be Free for Everyone</h4>Thanks to our superb theater program here at the university, we are fortunate to be able to see many plays that are put on by student actors. However, while all employees and students at the university may attend these plays for free, anyone who is not directly associated with the university must play a fee to attend. I think student plays should be open to everyone free of charge. That way, people in the local community could benefit from having a free entertainment opinion in town. It would also be good for the student actors, since it would help to ensure larger audiences at the plays.
Sincerely, Marie Jones</article>

        <h3>Listening Text</h3>

          <p>Now listen to two students discussing the letter.</p>
          <p>W: Hey Paul! You're an actor, right? What do you think about this idea?</p>
          <p>M: I think it's great!</p>
          <p>W: Oh yeah?</p>
          <p>M: Absolutely! I mean, for the people in town there's sometimes not a lot going on, not a lot to do. There's not even a movie theater nearby and if you want to see a professional show you have to travel. I think the nearest professional theater's like an hour away.</p>
          <p>W: Yeah, plus those professional plays can be really expensive. I saw one last semester and the ticket cost me like $40.</p>
          <p>M: Right, so it'll be good for people to have another entertainment option; an opportunity to see live shows that won't be so expensive.</p>
          <p>W: Sure!</p>
          <p>M: Plus it would definitely be helpful for us actors.</p>
          <p>W: Yeah?</p>
          <p>M: Yeah, because on some nights there's not a lot of people that go; not a lot of people there to watch us, and that can have a bad effect on the show. It might not be as good.</p>
          <p>W: Yeah. I can imagine it must be a completely different energy for you and the other actors if the seats are half empty.</p>
          <p>M: Exactly. Like if the show was a comedy and it's supposed to be funny, in order for it to really seem funny, there needs to be a lot of people there to laugh at the jokes. Otherwise it just doesn't seem as humorous. Having a crowd there laughing at the jokes really helps the show along; helps it to be good.</p>
          <p>W: That makes sense. So this proposal would help that.</p>
          <p>M: Yeah, help make it more likely that there'd be a full house; a lot of people watching.</p>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>The letter discusses a proposal that students play should be free to everyone especially to the community citizens in town. It gives two reasons: one reason is it can provide the local community a free entertainment option; the other reason is it is also beneficial to the student actors by ensuring large amounts of audiences. The man agrees with this proposal and explains the advantages again. He says that there is no professional theaters or cinemas in town so it can be expensive and inconvenience for local people to get some entertainment. The open of students' theater can deal with this question. Also, he thinks that the crowd of local audience will be good for the students' actors. Because sometimes there are only few people in the theater, it will cast a negative influence on the actors.</p>
