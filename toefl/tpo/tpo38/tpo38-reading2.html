            <b>The Raccoons's Success</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>Following a <span class="underline">decline</span> to a <span class="underline">relatively</span> low <span class="underline">population</span> <span class="underline">level</span> in the 1930s, raccoons began to <span class="underline">prosper</span> following their 1943 <span class="underline">breeding</span> <span class="underline">season</span>. A rapid <span class="underline">population</span> <span class="underline">surge</span> continued <span class="underline">throughout</span> the 1940s, and high numbers have been <span class="underline">sustained</span> ever since. By the late 1980s, the number of raccoons in North America was estimated to be at <span class="underline">least</span> 15 to 20 times the number that existed during the 1930s. By now, their numbers have undoubtedly grown <span class="underline">even</span> more, as they have continued to <span class="underline">expand</span> into new habitats where they were once either <span class="underline">rare</span> or absent, such as sandy prairies, deserts, coastal marshes, and mountains. Their <span class="underline">spread</span> <span class="underline">throughout</span> the Rocky Mountain West is <span class="underline">indicative</span> of the fast pace at which they can <span class="underline">exploit</span> new environments. Despite <span class="underline">significant</span> numbers being harvested and having suffered <span class="underline">occasional</span> declines, typically because of <span class="underline">disease</span>, the raccoon has <span class="underline">consistently</span> maintained high <span class="underline">population</span> levels.</p>
          <p>Several factors explain the raccoon's <span class="underline">dramatic</span> increase in <span class="underline">abundance</span> and <span class="underline">distribution</span>. First, their success has been <span class="underline">partially</span> attributed to the growth of cities, as they often <span class="underline">thrive</span> in suburban and <span class="underline">even</span> <span class="underline">urban</span> settings. Furthermore, they have been <span class="underline">deliberately</span> introduced <span class="underline">throughout</span> the <span class="underline">continent</span>. <span class="underline">Within</span> the United States, they are commonly taken from one area to another, both legally and illegally, to restock hunting areas and, <span class="underline">presumably</span>, because people <span class="underline">simply</span> want them to be part of their <span class="underline">local</span> <span class="underline">fauna</span>. Their <span class="underline">appearance</span> and <span class="underline">subsequent</span> <span class="underline">flourishing</span> in Utah's Great Salt Lake <span class="underline">valley</span> <span class="underline">within</span> the last 40 years appears to be from such an <span class="underline">introduction</span>. As an example of the <span class="underline">ease</span> with which transplanted individuals can succeed, raccoons from Indiana (midwestern United States) have <span class="underline">reportedly</span> been able to <span class="underline">flourish</span> on islands off the <span class="underline">coast</span> of Alaska.</p>
          <p>The raccoon's <span class="underline">expansion</span> in various areas may also be <span class="underline">due</span> to the <span class="underline">spread</span> of <span class="underline">agriculture</span>. Raccoons have been able to <span class="underline">exploit</span> crops, especially corn but also <span class="underline">cereal</span> grains, which have become <span class="underline">dependable</span> food sources for them. The <span class="underline">expansion</span> of <span class="underline">agriculture</span>, however, does not necessarily <span class="underline">lead</span> to rapid increases in their <span class="underline">abundance</span>. Farming in Kansas and eastern Colorado (central and western United States) proceeded rapidly in the 1870s and 1880s, but this was about 50 years before raccoons started to <span class="underline">spread</span> out from their <span class="underline">major</span> <span class="underline">habitat</span>, the wooded river bottomlands. They have also expanded into many areas lacking any <span class="underline">agriculture</span> other than <span class="underline">grazing</span> and into places without forests or <span class="underline">permanent</span> streams.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="underline">Prior</span> to Europeans settling and farming the Great Plains <span class="underline">Region</span>, raccoons probably were just found <span class="underline">along</span> its rivers and streams and in the wooded areas of its southeastern <span class="underline">section</span>. With the possible <span class="underline">exception</span> of the southern part of the province of Manitoba, their <span class="underline">absence</span> was <span class="underline">notable</span> <span class="underline">throughout</span> Canada. They first became more widely distributed in the southern part of Manitoba, and by the 1940s were <span class="underline">abundant</span> <span class="underline">throughout</span> its southeastern <span class="underline">portion</span>. In the 1950s their <span class="underline">population</span> swelled in Canada. The control of coyotes in the <span class="underline">prairie</span> <span class="underline">region</span> in the 1950s may have been a <span class="underline">factor</span> in raccoon <span class="underline">expansion</span>. If their numbers are <span class="underline">sufficient</span> coyotes might be able to <span class="underline">suppress</span> raccoon populations (though little direct <span class="underline">evidence</span> supports this <span class="underline">notion</span>). By the 1960s the raccoon had become a <span class="underline">major</span> <span class="underline">predator</span> of the canvasback ducks nesting in southwestern Manitoba.</p>
          <p>The extermination of the wolf from most of the <span class="underline">contiguous</span> United States may have been a <span class="underline">critical</span> <span class="underline">factor</span> in the raccoon's <span class="underline">expansion</span> and numerical increase. In the eighteenth <span class="underline">century</span>, when the wolfs <span class="underline">range</span> included almost all of North America, raccoons apparently were <span class="underline">abundant</span> only in the <span class="underline">deciduous</span> forests of the East, Gulf <span class="underline">Coast</span>, and Great Lakes regions, though they also extended into the wooded bottomlands of the Midwest's <span class="underline">major</span> rivers. In such areas, their <span class="underline">arboreal</span> habits and the presence of <span class="underline">hollow</span> <span class="underline">den</span> trees should have offered some protection from wolves and other large predators. <span class="underline">Even</span> though raccoons may not have been a <span class="underline">significant</span> part of their <span class="underline">diet</span>, wolves surely would have tried to <span class="underline">prey</span> on those <span class="underline">exposed</span> in <span class="underline">relatively</span> treeless areas.</p>
