A rapid <span class="highlight">population</span><span class="highlight">surge</span> continued <span class="highlight">throughout</span> the 1940s, and high numbers have been <span class="highlight">sustained</span> ever since. By the late 1980s, the number of raccoons in North America was estimated to be at <span class="highlight">least</span> 15 to 20 times the number that existed during the 1930s. <span class="question2">By now, their numbers have undoubtedly grown <span class="highlight">even</span> more, as they have continued to <span class="highlight">expand</span> into new habitats where they were once either <span class="highlight">rare</span> or absent, </span>such as sandy prairies, deserts, coastal marshes, and mountains. Their <span class="highlight">spread</span><span class="highlight">throughout</span> the Rocky Mountain West is <span class="highlight">indicative</span> of the fast pace at which they can <span class="highlight">exploit</span> new environments. Despite <span class="highlight">significant</span> numbers being harvested and having suffered <span class="highlight">occasional</span> declines, typically because of <span class="highlight">disease</span>, the raccoon has <span class="highlight"><span class="question3">consistently</span></span>maintained high <span class="highlight">population</span> levels.</p><p>Several factors explain the raccoon's <span class="highlight">dramatic</span> increase in <span class="highlight">abundance</span> and <span class="highlight">distribution</span>. First, their success has been <span class="highlight">partially</span> attributed to the growth of cities, as they often <span class="highlight">thrive</span> in suburban and <span class="highlight">even</span><span class="highlight">urban</span> settings. Furthermore, they have been <span class="highlight">deliberately</span> introduced <span class="highlight">throughout</span> the <span class="highlight">continent</span>. <span class="highlight">Within</span> the United States, they are commonly taken from one area to another, both legally and illegally, to restock hunting areas and, <span class="highlight"><span class="question7">presumably</span>, </span>because people <span class="highlight">simply</span> want them to be part of their <span class="highlight">local</span><span class="highlight">fauna</span>. Their <span class="highlight">appearance</span> and <span class="highlight">subsequent</span><span class="highlight">flourishing</span> in Utah's Great Salt Lake <span class="highlight">valley</span><span class="highlight">within</span> the last 40 years appears to be from such an <span class="highlight">introduction</span>. As an example of the <span class="highlight">ease</span> with which transplanted individuals can succeed, raccoons from Indiana (midwestern United States) have <span class="highlight">reportedly</span> been able to <span class="highlight">flourish</span> on islands off the <span class="highlight">coast</span> of Alaska.</p><p>The raccoon's <span class="highlight">expansion</span> in various areas may also be <span class="highlight">due</span> to the <span class="highlight">spread</span> of <span class="highlight">agriculture</span>. Raccoons have been able to <span class="highlight">exploit</span> crops, especially corn but also <span class="highlight">cereal</span> grains, which have become <span class="highlight">dependable</span> food sources for them. The <span class="highlight">expansion</span> of <span class="highlight">agriculture</span>, however, does not necessarily <span class="highlight">lead</span> to rapid increases in their <span class="highlight">abundance</span>. Farming in Kansas and eastern Colorado (central and western United States) proceeded rapidly in the 1870s and 1880s, but this was about 50 years before raccoons started to <span class="highlight">spread</span> out from their <span class="highlight">major</span><span class="highlight">habitat</span>, the wooded river bottomlands. They have also expanded into many areas lacking any <span class="highlight">agriculture</span> other than <span class="highlight">grazing</span> and into places without forests or <span class="highlight">permanent</span> streams.</p><p><span class="highlight">Prior</span> to Europeans settling and farming the Great Plains <span class="highlight">Region</span>, raccoons probably were just found <span class="highlight">along</span> its rivers and streams and in the wooded areas of its southeastern <span class="highlight">section</span>. With the possible <span class="highlight">exception</span> of the southern part of the province of Manitoba, their <span class="highlight">absence</span> was <span class="highlight">notable</span><span class="highlight">throughout</span> Canada. They first became more widely distributed in the southern part of Manitoba, and by the 1940s were <span class="highlight">abundant</span><span class="highlight">throughout</span> its southeastern <span class="highlight">portion</span>. In the 1950s their <span class="highlight">population</span> swelled in Canada. The control of coyotes in the <span class="highlight">prairie</span><span class="highlight">region</span> in the 1950s may have been a <span class="highlight">factor</span> in raccoon <span class="highlight">expansion</span>. If their numbers are <span class="highlight">sufficient</span> coyotes might be able to <span class="highlight">suppress</span> raccoon populations (though little direct <span class="highlight">evidence</span> supports this <span class="highlight">notion</span>). By the 1960s the raccoon had become a <span class="highlight">major</span><span class="highlight">predator</span> of the canvasback ducks nesting in southwestern Manitoba.</p><p>The extermination of the wolf from most of the <span class="highlight">contiguous</span> United States may have been a <span class="highlight"><span class="question11">critical</span><span class="highlight"></span>factor</span> in the raccoon's <span class="highlight">expansion</span> and numerical increase. In the eighteenth <span class="highlight">century</span>, when the wolfs <span class="highlight">range</span> included almost all of North America, raccoons apparently were <span class="highlight">abundant</span> only in the <span class="highlight">deciduous</span> forests of the East, Gulf <span class="highlight">Coast</span>, and Great Lakes regions, though they also extended into the wooded bottomlands of the Midwest's <span class="highlight">major</span> rivers. In such areas, their <span class="highlight">arboreal</span> habits and the presence of <span class="highlight">hollow</span><span class="highlight">den</span> trees should have offered some protection from wolves and other large predators. <span class="highlight">Even</span> though raccoons may not have been a <span class="highlight">significant</span> part of their <span class="highlight">diet</span>, wolves surely would have tried to <span class="highlight">prey</span> on those <span class="highlight">exposed</span> in <span class="highlight">relatively</span> treeless areas.</p></article></div><div id="question"><div id="question1"><p>According to paragraph 2, what happened to raccoons in the 1930s?</p><label class="my-label"><span>A.
