A rapid <span class="highlight">population</span><span class="highlight">surge</span> continued <span class="highlight">throughout</span> the 1940s, and high numbers have been <span class="highlight">sustained</span> ever since. By the late 1980s, the number of raccoons in North America was estimated to be at <span class="highlight">least</span> 15 to 20 times the number that existed during the 1930s. <span class="question2">By now, their numbers have undoubtedly grown <span class="highlight">even</span> more, as they have continued to <span class="highlight">expand</span> into new habitats where they were once either <span class="highlight">rare</span> or absent</span>, such as sandy prairies, deserts, coastal marshes, and mountains. Their <span class="highlight">spread</span><span class="highlight">throughout</span> the Rocky Mountain West is <span class="highlight">indicative</span> of the fast pace at which they can <span class="highlight">exploit</span> new environments. Despite <span class="highlight">significant</span> numbers being harvested and having suffered <span class="highlight">occasional</span> declines, typically because of <span class="highlight">disease</span>, the raccoon has <span class="highlight"><span class="question3">consistently</span></span> maintained high <span class="highlight">population</span> levels.</p><p>Several factors explain the raccoon's <span class="highlight">dramatic</span> increase in <span class="highlight">abundance</span> and <span class="highlight">distribution</span>. First, their success has been <span class="highlight">partially</span> attributed to the growth of cities, as they often <span class="highlight">thrive</span> in suburban and <span class="highlight">even</span><span class="highlight">urban</span> settings. Furthermore, they have been <span class="highlight">deliberately</span> introduced <span class="highlight">throughout</span> the <span class="highlight">continent</span>. <span class="highlight">Within</span> the United States, they are commonly taken from one area to another, both legally and illegally, to restock hunting areas and, <span class="highlight"><span class="question7">presumably</span></span>, because people <span class="highlight">simply</span> want them to be part of their <span class="highlight">local</span><span class="highlight">fauna</span>. Their <span class="highlight">appearance</span> and <span class="highlight">subsequent</span><span class="highlight">flourishing</span> in Utah's Great Salt Lake <span class="highlight">valley</span><span class="highlight">within</span> the last 40 years appears to be from such an <span class="highlight">introduction</span>. As an example of the <span class="highlight">ease</span> with which transplanted individuals can succeed, raccoons from Indiana (midwestern United States) have <span class="highlight">reportedly</span> been able to <span class="highlight">flourish</span> on islands off the <span class="highlight">coast</span> of Alaska.</p><p>The raccoon's <span class="highlight">expansion</span> in various areas may also be <span class="highlight">due</span> to the <span class="highlight">spread</span> of <span class="highlight">agriculture</span>. Raccoons have been able to <span class="highlight">exploit</span> crops, especially corn but also <span class="highlight">cereal</span> grains, which have become <span class="highlight">dependable</span> food sources for them. The <span class="highlight">expansion</span> of <span class="highlight">agriculture</span>, however, does not necessarily <span class="highlight">lead</span> to rapid increases in their <span class="highlight">abundance</span>. Farming in Kansas and eastern Colorado (central and western United States) proceeded rapidly in the 1870s and 1880s, but this was about 50 years before raccoons started to <span class="highlight">spread</span> out from their <span class="highlight">major</span><span class="highlight">habitat</span>, the wooded river bottomlands. They have also expanded into many areas lacking any <span class="highlight">agriculture</span> other than <span class="highlight">grazing</span> and into places without forests or <span class="highlight">permanent</span> streams.</p><p><span class="highlight">Prior</span> to Europeans settling and farming the Great Plains <span class="highlight">Region</span>, raccoons probably were just found <span class="highlight">along</span> its rivers and streams and in the wooded areas of its southeastern <span class="highlight">section</span>. With the possible <span class="highlight">exception</span> of the southern part of the province of Manitoba, their <span class="highlight">absence</span> was <span class="highlight">notable</span><span class="highlight">throughout</span> Canada. They first became more widely distributed in the southern part of Manitoba, and by the 1940s were <span class="highlight">abundant</span><span class="highlight">throughout</span> its southeastern <span class="highlight">portion</span>. In the 1950s their <span class="highlight">population</span> swelled in Canada. The control of coyotes in the <span class="highlight">prairie</span><span class="highlight">region</span> in the 1950s may have been a <span class="highlight">factor</span> in raccoon <span class="highlight">expansion</span>. If their numbers are <span class="highlight">sufficient</span> coyotes might be able to <span class="highlight">suppress</span> raccoon populations (though little direct <span class="highlight">evidence</span> supports this <span class="highlight">notion</span>). By the 1960s the raccoon had become a <span class="highlight">major</span><span class="highlight">predator</span> of the canvasback ducks nesting in southwestern Manitoba.</p><p>The extermination of the wolf from most of the <span class="highlight">contiguous</span> United States may have been a <span class="highlight"><span class="question11">critical</span></span><span class="highlight">factor</span> in the raccoon's <span class="highlight">expansion</span> and numerical increase. In the eighteenth <span class="highlight">century</span>, when the wolfs <span class="highlight">range</span> included almost all of North America, raccoons apparently were <span class="highlight">abundant</span> only in the <span class="highlight">deciduous</span> forests of the East, Gulf <span class="highlight">Coast</span>, and Great Lakes regions, though they also extended into the wooded bottomlands of the Midwest's <span class="highlight">major</span> rivers. In such areas, their <span class="highlight">arboreal</span> habits and the presence of <span class="highlight">hollow</span><span class="highlight">den</span> trees should have offered some protection from wolves and other large predators. <span class="highlight">Even</span> though raccoons may not have been a <span class="highlight">significant</span> part of their <span class="highlight">diet</span>, wolves surely would have tried to <span class="highlight">prey</span> on those <span class="highlight">exposed</span> in <span class="highlight">relatively</span> treeless areas.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 2, what happened to raccoons in the 1930s?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They had a series of unusually good breading seasons.</p><p>B. They expanded into the Rocky Mountain West.</p><p>C. Their population levels fell.</p><p>D. They were harvest in significant numbers for the first time.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>This question is based on the keywords raccoon and 1930s that are given to the heading. Here Following a decline to a relatively low population level in the 1930s, the general meaning of this half sentence is after the number has decreased to a relatively low level around 1930. . So we can know that in the 1930s, the number of raccoons dropped. Option C is correct. The other three options are not mentioned.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best express the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Raccoons are growing more numerous even though they must continue to find new habitats.</p><p>B. Raccoons are now undoubtedly present in areas where they once rare or absent.</p><p>C. Raccoons have found parties, deserts, coastal marshes, and mountains to be excellent habitats to expand into.</p><p>D. The number of raccoons must be even greater today because raccoons have continued to expand into new habitats.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>This question first targets the highlighted sentence:By now, their numbers have undoubtedly grown even more, as they have continued to expand into new habitats where they were once again rare or absent, such as sandy prairies, deserts, coastal marshes, and mountains The general idea of this sentence is that the number of raccoons has grown without a doubt. They have continued to expand to areas that have not been visited or visited before, such as desert savannah, deserts, and so on. Option D is a synonym for this sentence. Option A says that raccoon must find new habitats. No, we can later learn that they are artificially stocked, not that they must expand themselves; Option B is too absolute, raccoon is expanding rather than expanded, and it is not Expanded to all places where they did not appear; option C wrong place and Option A, raccoon is not to expand their own, was released.

Positioning in the original sentence: Within the United States, they are commonly taken from one area to another, both legally and illegally, to restock hunting areas and, <span class="question7">presumably</span>, because people simply Want them to be part of their local fauna. The last sentence of the sentence is a question that people simply want raccoon to come to where they live. Option A is correct. The remaining three options have not been mentioned.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>All of the following are mentioned in paragraph 3 as helping to explain the raccoon's dramatic increase in abundance and distribution EXCEPT</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Raccoons thrive in suburban areas.</p><p>B. Hunting raccoons has become illegal in most areas.</p><p>C. People enjoy having raccoons as part of their environment.</p><p>D.

The spread of agriculture destroyed some of the raccoon's natural habitats and reduced their populations in Kansas and eastern Colorado.</p><p>B. Because of the availability of corn and other cereal grains as a result of the spread of agriculture.</p><p>C. The spread of agriculture may have contributed to some raccoon expansion but has not always caused raccoon populations to expand.</p><p>D. The spread of agriculture to Kansas and eastern Colorado brought increased raccoon populations in the 1870s and 1880s.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The expansion of agriculture, however, does not occur lead to rapid increase in the expansion of agriculture, however, the raccoon's expansion in diverse areas, also due to the spread of agriculture. Their abundance. The general meaning of these two sentences is: The expansion of agriculture may also be one of the reasons for the expansion of raccoon, but the expansion of agriculture does not necessarily lead to rapid growth in the number of raccoon. Option C is exactly what this means. The other three options are misinterpretations of the original text.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 5, what was true about raccoons before the arrival of European settlers?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.
