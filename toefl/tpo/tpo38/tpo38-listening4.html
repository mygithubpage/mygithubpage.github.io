              <span class="time" data-times="4.28" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to a <span class="underline">conversation</span> between a student and his <span class="underline">ecology</span> professor.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.25" data-time="4.28">[00:04.28]</span>Professor: How is it going? Tom.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.9" data-time="6.53">[00:06.53]</span>Student: Great! I was, oh. I <span class="underline">wanted</span> to tell you.<span class="time" data-times="4.7" data-time="9.43">[00:09.43]</span> You know the guest speaker you brought into class last week from the wildlife <span class="underline">conservation</span> center.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.55" data-time="14.13">[00:14.13]</span>Professor: Susan Brown. Yes. She is an old friend from graduate school.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.91" data-time="17.68">[00:17.68]</span>Student: Her talk on wildlife <span class="underline">population</span> <span class="underline">modeling</span>, well, it was very <span class="underline">theoretical</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.98" data-time="22.59">[00:22.59]</span>Professor: It was certainly a change of pace from what we usually do.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.66" data-time="26.57">[00:26.57]</span>Student: Yeah, but I think I <span class="underline">pretty</span> much followed <span class="underline">along</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.29" data-time="29.23">[00:29.23]</span>Plus, I like to see people get so passionate about <span class="underline">ecology</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.18" data-time="32.52">[00:32.52]</span>Professor: Oh, right. <span class="underline">Ecology</span> is your <span class="underline">major</span> <span class="underline">field</span> of study, isn't it?<span class="time" data-times="3.16" data-time="36.7">[00:36.70]</span>Yes, Susan Brown's certainly a lively speaker. <span class="time" data-times="2.25" data-time="39.86">[00:39.86]</span>What a <span class="underline">shame</span> she didn't go into teaching.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.56" data-time="42.11">[00:42.11]</span>Student: Uh, anyway, what I, well, a while ago, I saw this blurb in the school paper about an <span class="underline">exchange</span> program that's part of the study <span class="underline">abroad</span> office. <span class="time" data-times="7.24" data-time="51.67">[00:51.67]</span>And today there was booth set up in the student center with a <span class="underline">couple</span> of students answering questions about the university's programs in foreign countries. <span class="time" data-times="2.82" data-time="58.91">[00:58.91]</span>Seeing the booth reminded me about the article in the paper and...</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.43" data-time="61.73">[01:01.73]</span>Professor: Thinking about going <span class="underline">abroad</span> in the coming year?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.24" data-time="64.16">[01:04.16]</span>Student: Actually I just spent last summer studying in Tokyo.<span class="time" data-times="2.45" data-time="67.4">[01:07.40]</span> I think that satisfied my <span class="underline">urge</span> to travel.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.8" data-time="69.85">[01:09.85]</span>Professor: It must've been quite an experience.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.92" data-time="71.65">[01:11.65]</span>Student: Definitely. Taking all those language courses was really challenging.<span class="time" data-times="9.67" data-time="75.57">[01:15.57]</span> But what I <span class="underline">wanted</span> to find out at the booth was: it's...um...a <span class="underline">domestic</span> <span class="underline">exchange</span> program, not studying <span class="underline">abroad</span>, but studying for a year somewhere else here in the United States.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.83" data-time="85.24">[01:25.24]</span>Professor: I don't think I have heard of that.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.14" data-time="87.07">[01:27.07]</span>Student: Well, neither had the guys in the booth.<span class="time" data-times="2.19" data-time="89.21">[01:29.21]</span> They didn't know what I was talking about.<span class="time" data-times="8.99" data-time="91.4">[01:31.40]</span> But when I talked to the supervisor in the study <span class="underline">abroad</span> office, it turns out we are part of a... a group of universities <span class="underline">throughout</span> the US that does a <span class="underline">domestic</span> <span class="underline">exchange</span> program.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.42" data-time="100.39">[01:40.39]</span>Professor: Huh! So you spent...what...a year at another university and your classes <span class="underline">count</span> toward your <span class="underline">degree</span> here?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.6" data-time="106.81">[01:46.81]</span>Student: Yeah, and I paid the same fees, <span class="underline">tuition</span>, room and <span class="underline">board</span>, that I <span class="underline">pay</span> here. <span class="time" data-times="2.01" data-time="111.41">[01:51.41]</span>So it doesn't really <span class="underline">cost</span> any <span class="underline">extra</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.1" data-time="113.42">[01:53.42]</span>Professor: Interesting.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.14" data-time="114.52">[01:54.52]</span>Student: And you know I've lived here in southern Florida my whole life.<span class="time" data-times="2.45" data-time="117.66">[01:57.66]</span> And I've always been interested in Montana. <span class="time" data-times="5.49" data-time="120.11">[02:00.11]</span>The university in Montana, where I want to go, has classes that <span class="underline">deal</span> <span class="underline">specifically</span> with the <span class="underline">ecology</span> there. <span class="time" data-times="3.76" data-time="125.6">[02:05.60]</span>Like I am interested in the greater yellow stone <span class="underline">ecosystem</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.28" data-time="129.36">[02:09.36]</span>It is such an important <span class="underline">ecosystem</span> being the <span class="underline">source</span> of three <span class="underline">major</span> rivers, and I want to learn more about it.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.29" data-time="134.64">[02:14.64]</span>Professor: Wow! This is a <span class="underline">unique</span> idea. <span class="time" data-times="13.88" data-time="136.93">[02:16.93]</span>The <span class="underline">climate</span>, the plants and wildlife, it's really different from here, probably the <span class="underline">culture</span> too in a way, and don't forget about all the outdoor activities you could do there, hiking, skiing, and the national parks.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.07" data-time="150.81">[02:30.81]</span>Student: That's true. <span class="time" data-times="8.38" data-time="151.88">[02:31.88]</span>Anyway I'll have to get my <span class="underline">application</span> together in the next month or so, and I'll need two letters of recommendation, one from a professor in my <span class="underline">major</span> <span class="underline">department</span>.</p>

              <span class="time" data-times="0.86000000000001" data-time="160.26">[02:40.26]</span>Professor: <span class="underline">Consider</span> it done.</p>
            <p>
