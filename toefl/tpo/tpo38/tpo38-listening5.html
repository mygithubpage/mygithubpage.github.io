              <span class="time" data-times="4.23" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in a music <span class="underline">history</span> class.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.34" data-time="4.23">[00:04.23]</span>Professor: So let's continue our discussion of twentieth <span class="underline">century</span> music. <span class="time" data-times="13.53" data-time="8.57">[00:08.57]</span>By the early twentieth <span class="underline">century</span>, some composers in Europe and the United States, composers of what's considered <span class="underline">classical</span> music, were already moving away from <span class="underline">traditional</span> forms and were experimenting with different ways of composing. <span class="time" data-times="4.86" data-time="22.1">[00:22.10]</span>In many cases, moving away from <span class="underline">traditional</span> western scales and tonalities.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7" data-time="26.96">[00:26.96]</span>But as the <span class="underline">century</span> progressed, some composers, composers of what was called avant-garde music, went further. <span class="time" data-times="5.01" data-time="33.96">[00:33.96]</span>Their experiments with <span class="underline">musical</span> <span class="underline">composition</span> were not always well accepted. <span class="time" data-times="6.64" data-time="38.97">[00:38.97]</span>Quite the <span class="underline">contrary</span>, you see, many people felt avant-garde music was too <span class="underline">radical</span> and wasn't <span class="underline">even</span> <span class="underline">legitimate</span> art.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.34" data-time="45.61">[00:45.61]</span>A case in point is the <span class="underline">composer</span> John Cage.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.79" data-time="49.95">[00:49.95]</span>Cage was probably the most famous <span class="underline">composer</span> of twentieth-century avant-garde music. <span class="time" data-times="6.22" data-time="55.74">[00:55.74]</span>He didn't begin his music <span class="underline">radical</span>, but as time went on, his <span class="underline">musical</span> experiments led him there.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.3" data-time="61.96">[01:01.96]</span>What caused the change?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.38" data-time="64.26">[01:04.26]</span>Two experiences in <span class="underline">particular</span> <span class="underline">entirely</span> changed how he thought about music. <span class="time" data-times="5.96" data-time="69.64">[01:09.64]</span>First was his 1951 meeting with the avant-garde painter Robert Rauschenberg.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.48" data-time="75.6">[01:15.60]</span>Now, avant-garde is a <span class="underline">term</span> that applies many different <span class="underline">artistic</span> genres. <span class="time" data-times="8.1" data-time="81.08">[01:21.08]</span>Rauschenberg had created a <span class="underline">series</span> of famous paintings that consisted <span class="underline">simply</span> of white paint of different textures on <span class="underline">canvas</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.09" data-time="89.18">[01:29.18]</span>That's all they were: white.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.61" data-time="91.27">[01:31.27]</span>But the <span class="underline">concept</span> of these paintings actually wasn't so simple.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.98" data-time="94.88">[01:34.88]</span>Rauschenberg was asking, in effect, how much could you leave out of an artwork and still have something?<span class="time" data-times="7.86" data-time="100.86">[01:40.86]</span> Because in fact, <span class="underline">even</span> on a purely white <span class="underline">canvas</span>, there's still plenty to see, shadows, dust, reflections.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.37" data-time="108.72">[01:48.72]</span>For Cage, Rauschenberg's white paintings opened up a whole new way of understanding what art could be.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.12" data-time="115.09">[01:55.09]</span>The <span class="underline">second</span> key experience in Cage's <span class="underline">development</span> came when he stepped in an anechoic <span class="underline">chamber</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.32" data-time="121.21">[02:01.21]</span>An anechoic <span class="underline">chamber</span> is a room with <span class="underline">special</span> walls that <span class="underline">absorb</span> <span class="underline">sound</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.24" data-time="127.53">[02:07.53]</span>Anechoic means without echoes. <span class="time" data-times="5.9" data-time="130.77">[02:10.77]</span>So an anechoic <span class="underline">chamber</span> was a room where, in <span class="underline">theory</span>, you can experience total silence. <span class="time" data-times="5.33" data-time="136.67">[02:16.67]</span>But Cage entered this room and he heard two sounds, one high and one low. <span class="time" data-times="7.26" data-time="142">[02:22.00]</span>The high <span class="underline">sound</span>, he was told, was his nervous system operating, and the low <span class="underline">sound</span> was his blood circulating.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.35" data-time="149.26">[02:29.26]</span>Cage was <span class="underline">profoundly</span> affected.<span class="time" data-times="3.89" data-time="152.61">[02:32.61]</span> He realized that music doesn't need to be created <span class="underline">intentionally</span>. <span class="time" data-times="1.98" data-time="156.5">[02:36.50]</span>We find it all around us.<span class="time" data-times="3.4" data-time="158.48">[02:38.48]</span> This idea came to be called found <span class="underline">sound</span>.<span class="time" data-times="5.12" data-time="161.88">[02:41.88]</span> It's the sounds that are already there, traffic outside your window, or whatever.<span class="time" data-times="4.76" data-time="167">[02:47.00]</span> For Cage, they were just as <span class="underline">musical</span> as sounds made by <span class="underline">musical</span> instruments.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.32" data-time="171.76">[02:51.76]</span> These experiences led Cage to create a <span class="underline">composition</span> that would <span class="underline">convey</span> the idea of found <span class="underline">sound</span>.<span class="time" data-times="7.47" data-time="178.08">[02:58.08]</span> That is, it would provide an <span class="underline">opportunity</span> for the <span class="underline">audience</span> to <span class="underline">identify</span> <span class="underline">random</span> sounds of the environment as music.<span class="time" data-times="7.78" data-time="185.55">[03:05.55]</span> So he composed a piece called 4 minutes 33 seconds, commonly known as the silent <span class="underline">composition</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.85" data-time="193.33">[03:13.33]</span>And this <span class="underline">composition</span> was completely silent, <span class="underline">literally</span>.<span class="time" data-times="11.65" data-time="199.18">[03:19.18]</span> When it was performed the first time, a pianist sat on <span class="underline">stage</span> at the piano and the only thing he did was <span class="underline">raise</span> and <span class="underline">lower</span> the lid of the <span class="underline">keyboard</span> to <span class="underline">indicate</span> the beginning or ending of a movement. <span class="time" data-times="7.01" data-time="210.83">[03:30.83]</span>4 minutes 33 seconds had three movements, but not a note was played in any of them.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.03" data-time="217.84">[03:37.84]</span>Well, the <span class="underline">audience</span> was outraged. <span class="time" data-times="2.71" data-time="220.87">[03:40.87]</span>Music critics called the piece <span class="underline">ridiculous</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.59" data-time="223.58">[03:43.58]</span>But Cage saw no <span class="underline">reason</span> for the outrage. <span class="time" data-times="18.78" data-time="226.17">[03:46.17]</span>The fact that the <span class="underline">audience</span> was scandalized showed that they missed the whole point of his <span class="underline">composition</span>, which was that there's no such thing as silence, no such thing as a complete <span class="underline">absence</span> of <span class="underline">sound</span>, and whilst in fact during that first performance, the <span class="underline">sound</span> of wind and rain and people muttering.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.03" data-time="244.95">[04:04.95]</span>Cage had a different understanding of silence. <span class="time" data-times="3.81" data-time="247.98">[04:07.98]</span>He defined silence as the <span class="underline">absence</span> of intended sounds.<span class="time" data-times="7.63" data-time="251.79">[04:11.79]</span> So to <span class="underline">perceive</span> 4 minutes 33 seconds as music, the <span class="underline">audience</span> needed to tune in to the sounds around them.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.28" data-time="259.42">[04:19.42]</span>This was quite <span class="underline">revolutionary</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.63" data-time="261.7">[04:21.70]</span>So we should probably be <span class="underline">sympathetic</span> to their reactions at the time. <span class="time" data-times="3" data-time="265.33">[04:25.33]</span>I mean, it's confounding people <span class="underline">even</span> today! <span class="time" data-times="8.67" data-time="268.33">[04:28.33]</span>Cage's silent <span class="underline">composition</span> is still performed all over the world, but I'm afraid to say, it's often misinterpreted.<span class="time" data-times="8" data-time="277">[04:37.00]</span> It's been choreographed, in dance performances for <span class="underline">instance</span>, in which case the <span class="underline">sound</span> was the <span class="underline">beat</span> of the dancers' feet against the <span class="underline">stage</span> floor. <span class="time" data-times="6.27" data-time="285">[04:45.00]</span>And it's been performed by people who made noises on purpose to call <span class="underline">attention</span> to the piece's silence.<span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="291.27">[04:51.27]</span> Can you see why we can <span class="underline">consider</span> these performances to be misinterpretations?</p>
