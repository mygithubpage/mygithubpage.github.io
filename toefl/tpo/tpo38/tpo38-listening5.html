lecture in a music <span class="highlight">history</span> class.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.34" data-time="4.23">[00:04.23]</span>Professor: So let's continue our discussion of twentieth <span class="highlight">century</span> music. <span class="time" data-times="13.53" data-time="8.57">[00:08.57]</span>By the early twentieth <span class="highlight">century</span>, some composers in Europe and the United States, composers of what's considered <span class="highlight">classical</span> music, were already moving away from <span class="highlight">traditional</span> forms and were experimenting with different ways of composing. <span class="time" data-times="4.86" data-time="22.1">[00:22.10]</span>In many cases, moving away from <span class="highlight">traditional</span> western scales and tonalities.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="7" data-time="26.96">[00:26.96]</span>But as the <span class="highlight">century</span> progressed, some composers, composers of what was called avant-garde music, went further. <span class="time" data-times="5.01" data-time="33.96">[00:33.96]</span>Their experiments with <span class="highlight">musical</span><span class="highlight">composition</span> were not always well accepted. <span class="time" data-times="6.64" data-time="38.97">[00:38.97]</span>Quite the <span class="highlight">contrary</span>, you see, many people felt avant-garde music was too <span class="highlight">radical</span> and wasn't <span class="highlight">even</span><span class="highlight">legitimate</span> art.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.34" data-time="45.61">[00:45.61]</span>A case in point is the <span class="highlight">composer</span> John Cage.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.79" data-time="49.95">[00:49.95]</span>Cage was probably the most famous <span class="highlight">composer</span> of twentieth-century avant-garde music. <span class="time" data-times="6.22" data-time="55.74">[00:55.74]</span>He didn't begin his music <span class="highlight">radical</span>, but as time went on, his <span class="highlight">musical</span> experiments led him there.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.3" data-time="61.96">[01:01.96]</span>What caused the change?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.38" data-time="64.26">[01:04.26]</span>Two experiences in <span class="highlight">particular</span><span class="highlight">entirely</span> changed how he thought about music. <span class="time" data-times="5.96" data-time="69.64">[01:09.64]</span>First was his 1951 meeting with the avant-garde painter Robert Rauschenberg.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.48" data-time="75.6">[01:15.60]</span>Now, avant-garde is a <span class="highlight">term</span> that applies many different <span class="highlight">artistic</span> genres. <span class="time" data-times="8.1" data-time="81.08">[01:21.08]</span>Rauschenberg had created a <span class="highlight">series</span> of famous paintings that consisted <span class="highlight">simply</span> of white paint of different textures on <span class="highlight">canvas</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.09" data-time="89.18">[01:29.18]</span>That's all they were: white.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.61" data-time="91.27">[01:31.27]</span>But the <span class="highlight">concept</span> of these paintings actually wasn't so simple.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.98" data-time="94.88">[01:34.88]</span>Rauschenberg was asking, in effect, how much could you leave out of an artwork and still have something?<span class="time" data-times="7.86" data-time="100.86">[01:40.86]</span> Because in fact, <span class="highlight">even</span> on a purely white <span class="highlight">canvas</span>, there's still plenty to see, shadows, dust, reflections.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.37" data-time="108.72">[01:48.72]</span>For Cage, Rauschenberg's white paintings opened up a whole new way of understanding what art could be.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.12" data-time="115.09">[01:55.09]</span>The <span class="highlight">second</span> key experience in Cage's <span class="highlight">development</span> came when he stepped in an anechoic <span class="highlight">chamber</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.32" data-time="121.21">[02:01.21]</span>An anechoic <span class="highlight">chamber</span> is a room with <span class="highlight">special</span> walls that <span class="highlight">absorb</span><span class="highlight">sound</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.24" data-time="127.53">[02:07.53]</span>Anechoic means without echoes. <span class="time" data-times="5.9" data-time="130.77">[02:10.77]</span>So an anechoic <span class="highlight">chamber</span> was a room where, in <span class="highlight">theory</span>, you can experience total silence. <span class="time" data-times="5.33" data-time="136.67">[02:16.67]</span>But Cage entered this room and he heard two sounds, one high and one low. <span class="time" data-times="7.26" data-time="142">[02:22.00]</span>The high <span class="highlight">sound</span>, he was told, was his nervous system operating, and the low <span class="highlight">sound</span> was his blood circulating.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.35" data-time="149.26">[02:29.26]</span>Cage was <span class="highlight">profoundly</span> affected.<span class="time" data-times="3.89" data-time="152.61">[02:32.61]</span> He realized that music doesn't need to be created <span class="highlight">intentionally</span>. <span class="time" data-times="1.98" data-time="156.5">[02:36.50]</span>We find it all around us.<span class="time" data-times="3.4" data-time="158.48">[02:38.48]</span> This idea came to be called found <span class="highlight">sound</span>.<span class="time" data-times="5.12" data-time="161.88">[02:41.88]</span> It's the sounds that are already there, traffic outside your window, or whatever.<span class="time" data-times="4.76" data-time="167">[02:47.00]</span> For Cage, they were just as <span class="highlight">musical</span> as sounds made by <span class="highlight">musical</span> instruments.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.32" data-time="171.76">[02:51.76]</span> These experiences led Cage to create a <span class="highlight">composition</span> that would <span class="highlight">convey</span> the idea of found <span class="highlight">sound</span>.<span class="time" data-times="7.47" data-time="178.08">[02:58.08]</span> That is, it would provide an <span class="highlight">opportunity</span> for the <span class="highlight">audience</span> to <span class="highlight">identify</span><span class="highlight">random</span> sounds of the environment as music.<span class="time" data-times="7.78" data-time="185.55">[03:05.55]</span> So he composed a piece called 4 minutes 33 seconds, commonly known as the silent <span class="highlight">composition</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.85" data-time="193.33">[03:13.33]</span>And this <span class="highlight">composition</span> was completely silent, <span class="highlight">literally</span>.<span class="time" data-times="11.65" data-time="199.18">[03:19.18]</span> When it was performed the first time, a pianist sat on <span class="highlight">stage</span> at the piano and the only thing he did was <span class="highlight">raise</span> and <span class="highlight">lower</span> the lid of the <span class="highlight">keyboard</span> to <span class="highlight">indicate</span> the beginning or ending of a movement. <span class="time" data-times="7.01" data-time="210.83">[03:30.83]</span>4 minutes 33 seconds had three movements, but not a note was played in any of them.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.03" data-time="217.84">[03:37.84]</span>Well, the <span class="highlight">audience</span> was outraged. <span class="time" data-times="2.71" data-time="220.87">[03:40.87]</span>Music critics called the piece <span class="highlight">ridiculous</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.59" data-time="223.58">[03:43.58]</span>But Cage saw no <span class="highlight">reason</span> for the outrage. <span class="time" data-times="18.78" data-time="226.17">[03:46.17]</span>The fact that the <span class="highlight">audience</span> was scandalized showed that they missed the whole point of his <span class="highlight">composition</span>, which was that there's no such thing as silence, no such thing as a complete <span class="highlight">absence</span> of <span class="highlight">sound</span>, and whilst in fact during that first performance, the <span class="highlight">sound</span> of wind and rain and people muttering.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.03" data-time="244.95">[04:04.95]</span>Cage had a different understanding of silence. <span class="time" data-times="3.81" data-time="247.98">[04:07.98]</span>He defined silence as the <span class="highlight">absence</span> of intended sounds.<span class="time" data-times="7.63" data-time="251.79">[04:11.79]</span> So to <span class="highlight">perceive</span> 4 minutes 33 seconds as music, the <span class="highlight">audience</span> needed to tune in to the sounds around them.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.28" data-time="259.42">[04:19.42]</span>This was quite <span class="highlight">revolutionary</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.63" data-time="261.7">[04:21.70]</span>So we should probably be <span class="highlight">sympathetic</span> to their reactions at the time. <span class="time" data-times="3" data-time="265.33">[04:25.33]</span>I mean, it's confounding people <span class="highlight">even</span> today! <span class="time" data-times="8.67" data-time="268.33">[04:28.33]</span>Cage's silent <span class="highlight">composition</span> is still performed all over the world, but I'm afraid to say, it's often misinterpreted.<span class="time" data-times="8" data-time="277">[04:37.00]</span> It's been choreographed, in dance performances for <span class="highlight">instance</span>, in which case the <span class="highlight">sound</span> was the <span class="highlight">beat</span> of the dancers' feet against the <span class="highlight">stage</span> floor. <span class="time" data-times="6.27" data-time="285">[04:45.00]</span>And it's been performed by people who made noises on purpose to call <span class="highlight">attention</span> to the piece's silence.<span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="291.27">[04:51.27]</span> Can you see why we can <span class="highlight">consider</span> these performances to be misinterpretations?</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor mainly discuss?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The influence of avant-garde music on twentieth-century painting.</p><p>B. Critical reactions to twentieth-century experimental art forms.</p><p>C. The concepts behind a piece by an avant-garde composer.</p><p>D. The traditional elements in a famous piece of avant-garde music.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The title of this question is:</p><p>Quas the contrary, you see, many people felt avant-garde music was too radical, but as the century progressed, some composers, composers of what was called avant-garde music, went further. And wasn't even legitimate art.</p><p>A case in point is the composer John Cage.</p><p>The main point of this lecture is pointed out here is a group of musicians called avant-garde, one of which is typical of the composer Cage. Combining the following texts, we know that this whole lecture is about this Cage. The song of the recorded sound. Option C is properly summarized. The remaining three options are not properly summarized. Select C.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor, how was John Cage influenced by Rauschenberg's white paintings?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They made him understand that artists should not be concerned with their audience.</p><p>B. They showed him that an artwork with little content could still be rich in meaning.</p><p>C. They demonstrated the importance of collaborating with artists in other fields.</p><p>D. They inspired him to compose music that created visual impressions in listeners.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The title of this question is:</p><p>Two experiences in particular entirely changed how he thought about music. First was his 1951 meeting with the avant-garde painter Robert Rauschenberg.</p><p>Now, avant-garde is a term that applies many different artistic genres. Rauschenberg had created a series of famous paintings that consisted simply of white paint of different textures on canvas. That's all they were: white.</p><p>But the concept of these paintings actually wasn't so simple.</p><p>Here is Cage's visit to Rauschenberg's basic blank painting. The artist Rauschenberg's paintings have very few lines and are basically white, but they are very rich in meaning. This inspired Cage, he realized that in fact, very little content can convey a rich meaning. Option B meets the meaning. The other three options do not match. Select B.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why was his visit to the anechoic chamber a profound experience for Cage?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. He discovered that he could still hear sounds inside the chamber.</p><p>B. He discovered that echoes could be eliminated from a musical piece.</p><p>C. He recognized the possibility of recording his body's natural sounds.</p><p>D. He realized that music did not need to be composed in silence.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The title of this question is:</p><p>The second key experience in Cage's development came when he stepped in an anechoic chamber. An anchochoic chamber is a room with special walls that absorb sound. Anechoic means without echoes. So an anechoic chamber was a room where, in theory, you can experience total Silence. But Cage entered this room and he heard two sounds, one high and one low. The high sound, he was told, was his nervous system operating, and the low sound was his blood circulating.</p><p>Here comes the second thing that inspired Cage, which is an absolutely silent house. Cage heard his own nervous system and blood circulation inside. Option A follows the original meaning. The other three options do not match. Select A.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What was Cage's attitude toward found sound?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. He considered found sound to be a theoretical concept with no practical use.</p><p>B. He believed any noises could be musical if arranged carefully.</p><p>C. He believed that unintentional noises could serve as replacements for musical instruments.</p><p>D. He believed that compositions with random noises could be interpreted in different ways.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The title of this question is:</p><p>Cage was profoundly affected. He realized that music doesn't need to be created intentionally. We find it all around us. This idea came to be called found sound. It's the sounds that are already there, traffic outside your window, or whatever. For Cage, they were just as musical as sounds made by musical instruments.</p><p>Here is what Cage learned: He believes that music does not have to be created intentionally. We have music everywhere. This kind of music is called non-artificial music. For example, the sound of traffic outside the window. Cage thinks that the sound is the same as the sound of the instrument. It is music. Option C meets the meaning. The other three options do not match. Select C.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor imply when he discusses the audience at the first performance of 4'33"?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. He believes that outside noise might have distracted the audience.</p><p>B. He thinks that music critics appreciated the piece more than the general audience did.</p><p>C. He suspects that the audience did not want to offend the composer.</p><p>D. He thinks that the audience's response to the piece was understandable.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The title of this question is:</p><p>Well, the audience was outraged. Music critics called the piece ridiculous. But Cage saw no reason for the outrage.</p><p>The meaning of these three sentences is that Cage's audience is very angry and music critics think this piece is ridiculous, but Cage himself feels no need to anger. Option D is in accordance with the original meaning. The remaining three options are misunderstood. Select D.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor consider many of today's performance of 4'33" to be misinterpretations?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They take place outdoors</p><p>B. They contain sounds that are intentional.</p><p>C. The last longer than 4 minutes and 33 seconds.</p><p>D. They do not include an actual piano.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The title of this question is:</p><p>It is still choreographed, in dance performances for instance, in which case the sound was the beat. Of the dancers' feet against the stage floor, the professor mentioned here that this non-articulation of Cage is still being applied by musicians, but it is a wrong application. People began to artificially make seemingly non-human music, such as the sound of dancers' shoes hitting the floor at a dance party. Therefore, these nominally non-artificial voices are actually man-made. Option B meets the meaning. The remaining three options are misunderstood. Select B.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
