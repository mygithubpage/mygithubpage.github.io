            <b>Transgenic Plants</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>Genes from <span class="highlight">virtually</span> any
<span class="highlight">organism</span>, from viruses to humans, can now be inserted into plants, creating
what are known as transgenic plants. Now used in <span class="highlight">agriculture</span>, there are
<span class="highlight">approximately</span> 109 million acres of transgenic crops grown worldwide, 68 percent
of which are in the United States. The most <span class="highlight">common</span> transgenic crops are
soybeans, corn, cotton, and canola. Most often, these plants either <span class="highlight">contain</span> a
<span class="highlight">gene</span> making them <span class="highlight">resistant</span> to the <span class="highlight">herbicide</span> <span class="highlight">glyphosate</span> or they <span class="highlight">contain</span> an insect-resistant
<span class="highlight">gene</span> that produces a <span class="highlight">protein</span> called Bt toxin.</p>
          <p>On the <span class="highlight">positive</span> side, proponents of transgenic crops <span class="highlight">argue</span> that these crops are environmentally friendly because they allow farmers to use fewer and less <span class="highlight">noxious</span> chemicals for crop production. For example, a 21 percent <span class="highlight">reduction</span> in the use of insecticide has been reported on Bt cotton (transgenic cotton that produces Bt toxin). In <span class="highlight">addition</span>, when <span class="highlight">glyphosate</span> is used to control weeds, other more <span class="highlight"><span class="question3">persistent</span> </span>herbicides do not need to be applied.</p>
          <p>On the <span class="highlight">negative</span> side, opponents of transgenic crops suggest that there are many questions that need to be answered before transgenic crops are grown on a large <span class="highlight">scale</span>. One question deals with the effects that Bt plants have on nontarget organisms such as <span class="highlight">beneficial</span> insects, worms, and birds that <span class="highlight">consume</span> the <span class="highlight">genetically</span> engineered crop. For example, <span class="highlight">monarch</span> caterpillars feeding on milkweed plants near Bt cornfields will eat some corn <span class="highlight">pollen</span> that has fallen on the milkweed leaves. <span class="highlight">Laboratory</span> studies <span class="highlight">indicate</span> that caterpillars can die from eating Bt <span class="highlight">pollen</span>. However, <span class="highlight">field</span> tests <span class="highlight">indicate</span> that Bt corn is not likely to harm monarchs. Furthermore, the <span class="highlight">application</span> of pesticides (the <span class="highlight">alternative</span> to growing Bt plants) has been demonstrated to cause <span class="highlight">widespread</span> harm to nontarget insects.</p>
          <p>Another unanswered question is whether herbicide-resistant genes will move into the populations of weeds. Crop plants are sometimes grown in areas where weedy relatives also live. If the crop plants hybridize and <span class="highlight">reproduce</span> with weedy relatives, then this herbicide-resistant <span class="highlight">gene</span> will be <span class="question6">perpetuated </span>in the <span class="highlight">offspring</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> In this way, the <span class="highlight">resistant</span> <span class="highlight">gene</span> can make its way into the <span class="highlight">weed</span> <span class="highlight">population</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> If this happens, a farmer can no longer use <span class="highlight">glyphosate</span>, for example, to kill those weeds. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span> This <span class="highlight"><span class="question7">scenario</span> </span>is not likely to <span class="highlight">occur</span> in many instances because there are no weedy relatives growing near the crop plant. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span> However, in some cases, it may become a serious problem. For example, canola <span class="highlight">readily</span> hybridizes with mustard <span class="highlight">weed</span> <span class="highlight">species</span> and could <span class="highlight">transfer</span> its herbicide-resistant genes to those weeds.</p>
          <p>We know that <span class="highlight">evolution</span> will <span class="highlight">occur</span> when transgenic plants grown on a large <span class="highlight">scale</span> over a period of time. Of <span class="highlight">special</span> <span class="highlight">concern</span> is the <span class="highlight">development</span> of <span class="highlight">insect</span> populations <span class="highlight">resistant</span> to the Bt toxin. This <span class="highlight">pesticide</span> has been applied to plants for decades without the <span class="highlight">development</span> of insect-resistant populations. However, transgenic Bt plants express the toxin in all tissues <span class="highlight">throughout</span> growing <span class="highlight">season</span>. <span class="highlight">Therefore</span>, all insects carrying genes that make them <span class="highlight">susceptible</span> to the toxin will die. That leaves only the <span class="highlight">genetically</span> <span class="highlight">resistant</span> insects alive to <span class="highlight">perpetuate</span> the <span class="highlight">population</span>. When these <span class="highlight">resistant</span> insects <span class="highlight">mate</span>, they will produce a high <span class="highlight">proportion</span> of <span class="highlight">offspring</span> <span class="highlight">capable</span> of surviving in the presence of the Bt toxin. Farmers are attempting to slow the <span class="highlight">development</span> of <span class="highlight">insect</span> <span class="highlight">resistance</span> in Bt crops by, for example, planting nontransgenic <span class="highlight">border</span> rows to provide a refuge for <span class="highlight">susceptible</span> insects. These insects may allow Bt <span class="highlight">susceptibility</span> to <span class="highlight">remain</span> in the <span class="highlight">population</span>.</p>
          <p><span class="question10">Perhaps the most serious <span class="highlight">concern</span> about the transgenic crop plants currently in use is that they <span class="highlight">encourage</span> farmers to move farther away from sustainable agricultural farming practices, meaning ones that allow natural resources to continually <span class="highlight">regenerate</span> over the long run. </span>Transgenics, at <span class="highlight">least</span> <span class="highlight"><span class="question12">superficially</span>, <span class="highlight"></span>simplify</span> farming by reducing the choices made by the manager. Planting a glyphosate-resistant crop commits a farmer to using that <span class="highlight">herbicide</span> for the <span class="highlight">reason</span>, probably to the exclusion of all other herbicides and other weed-control practices. Farmers who use Bt transgenics may not feel that they need to follow <span class="highlight">through</span> with integrated pest-management practices that use <span class="highlight">beneficial</span> insects and timely applications of pesticides to control <span class="highlight">insect</span> pests. A more sustainable <span class="highlight">approach</span> would be to plant nontransgenic corn, <span class="highlight">monitor</span> the fields <span class="highlight">throughout</span> the growing <span class="highlight">season</span>, and then <span class="highlight">apply</span> a <span class="highlight">pesticide</span> only if and when needed.</p>
