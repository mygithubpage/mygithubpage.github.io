<span class="highlight">organism</span>, from viruses to humans, can now be inserted into plants, creating
what are known as transgenic plants. Now used in <span class="highlight">agriculture</span>, there are
<span class="highlight">approximately</span> 109 million acres of transgenic crops grown worldwide, 68 percent
of which are in the United States. The most <span class="highlight">common</span> transgenic crops are
soybeans, corn, cotton, and canola. Most often, these plants either <span class="highlight">contain</span> a
<span class="highlight">gene</span> making them <span class="highlight">resistant</span> to the <span class="highlight">herbicide</span><span class="highlight">glyphosate</span> or they <span class="highlight">contain</span> an insect-resistant
<span class="highlight">gene</span> that produces a <span class="highlight">protein</span> called Bt toxin.</p><p>On the <span class="highlight">positive</span> side, proponents of transgenic crops <span class="highlight">argue</span> that these crops are environmentally friendly because they allow farmers to use fewer and less <span class="highlight">noxious</span> chemicals for crop production. For example, a 21 percent <span class="highlight">reduction</span> in the use of insecticide has been reported on Bt cotton (transgenic cotton that produces Bt toxin). In <span class="highlight">addition</span>, when <span class="highlight">glyphosate</span> is used to control weeds, other more <span class="highlight"><span class="question3">persistent</span></span> herbicides do not need to be applied.</p><p>On the <span class="highlight">negative</span> side, opponents of transgenic crops suggest that there are many questions that need to be answered before transgenic crops are grown on a large <span class="highlight">scale</span>. One question deals with the effects that Bt plants have on nontarget organisms such as <span class="highlight">beneficial</span> insects, worms, and birds that <span class="highlight">consume</span> the <span class="highlight">genetically</span> engineered crop. For example, <span class="highlight">monarch</span> caterpillars feeding on milkweed plants near Bt cornfields will eat some corn <span class="highlight">pollen</span> that has fallen on the milkweed leaves. <span class="highlight">Laboratory</span> studies <span class="highlight">indicate</span> that caterpillars can die from eating Bt <span class="highlight">pollen</span>. However, <span class="highlight">field</span> tests <span class="highlight">indicate</span> that Bt corn is not likely to harm monarchs. Furthermore, the <span class="highlight">application</span> of pesticides (the <span class="highlight">alternative</span> to growing Bt plants) has been demonstrated to cause <span class="highlight">widespread</span> harm to nontarget insects.</p><p>Another unanswered question is whether herbicide-resistant genes will move into the populations of weeds. Crop plants are sometimes grown in areas where weedy relatives also live. If the crop plants hybridize and <span class="highlight">reproduce</span> with weedy relatives, then this herbicide-resistant <span class="highlight">gene</span> will be <span class="question6">perpetuated</span> in the <span class="highlight">offspring</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> In this way, the <span class="highlight">resistant</span><span class="highlight">gene</span> can make its way into the <span class="highlight">weed</span><span class="highlight">population</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> If this happens, a farmer can no longer use <span class="highlight">glyphosate</span>, for example, to kill those weeds. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span> This <span class="highlight"><span class="question7">scenario</span></span> is not likely to <span class="highlight">occur</span> in many instances because there are no weedy relatives growing near the crop plant. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span> However, in some cases, it may become a serious problem. For example, canola <span class="highlight">readily</span> hybridizes with <span class="question8">mustard <span class="highlight">weed</span><span class="highlight">species</span></span> and could <span class="highlight">transfer</span> its herbicide-resistant genes to those weeds.</p><p>We know that <span class="highlight">evolution</span> will <span class="highlight">occur</span> when transgenic plants grown on a large <span class="highlight">scale</span> over a period of time. Of <span class="highlight">special</span><span class="highlight">concern</span> is the <span class="highlight">development</span> of <span class="highlight">insect</span> populations <span class="highlight">resistant</span> to the Bt toxin. This <span class="highlight">pesticide</span> has been applied to plants for decades without the <span class="highlight">development</span> of insect-resistant populations. However, transgenic Bt plants express the toxin in all tissues <span class="highlight">throughout</span> growing <span class="highlight">season</span>. <span class="highlight">Therefore</span>, all insects carrying genes that make them <span class="highlight">susceptible</span> to the toxin will die. That leaves only the <span class="highlight">genetically</span><span class="highlight">resistant</span> insects alive to <span class="highlight">perpetuate</span> the <span class="highlight">population</span>. When these <span class="highlight">resistant</span> insects <span class="highlight">mate</span>, they will produce a high <span class="highlight">proportion</span> of <span class="highlight">offspring</span><span class="highlight">capable</span> of surviving in the presence of the Bt toxin. Farmers are attempting to slow the <span class="highlight">development</span> of <span class="highlight">insect</span><span class="highlight">resistance</span> in Bt crops by, for example, planting nontransgenic <span class="highlight">border</span> rows to provide a refuge for <span class="highlight">susceptible</span> insects. These insects may allow Bt <span class="highlight">susceptibility</span> to <span class="highlight">remain</span> in the <span class="highlight">population</span>.</p><p><span class="question10">Perhaps the most serious <span class="highlight">concern</span> about the transgenic crop plants currently in use is that they <span class="highlight">encourage</span> farmers to move farther away from sustainable agricultural farming practices, meaning ones that allow natural resources to continually <span class="highlight">regenerate</span> over the long run.</span> Transgenics, at <span class="highlight">least</span><span class="highlight"><span class="question12">superficially</span></span>, <span class="highlight">simplify</span> farming by reducing the choices made by the manager. Planting a glyphosate-resistant crop commits a farmer to using that <span class="highlight">herbicide</span> for the <span class="highlight">reason</span>, probably to the exclusion of all other herbicides and other weed-control practices. Farmers who use Bt transgenics may not feel that they need to follow <span class="highlight">through</span> with integrated pest-management practices that use <span class="highlight">beneficial</span> insects and timely applications of pesticides to control <span class="highlight">insect</span> pests. A more sustainable <span class="highlight">approach</span> would be to plant nontransgenic corn, <span class="highlight">monitor</span> the fields <span class="highlight">throughout</span> the growing <span class="highlight">season</span>, and then <span class="highlight">apply</span> a <span class="highlight">pesticide</span> only if and when needed.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 1, which of the following is true of transgenic plants that produce the protein Bt?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

They often cause damage to corn crops.</p><p>B. They are the only species that is immune to Bt toxin.</p><p>C. They are considered beneficial insects.</p><p>D. Their reactions to Bt pollen have not yet been studied.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>This question is based on the keywords given by the monarch caterpillar. Find the original sentence: For example, monarch caterpillars feeding on milkweed plants near Bt cornfields will eat some com pollen that has fallen on the milkweed leaves. For example, tell us about monarch caterpillar. It is used as an example to confirm that the Bt plants have on nontarget organisms such as beneficial insects, worms, and birds that consume the genetically engineered crop. So the monarch caterpillar is here as a useful insect, option C meets. The other three options are not mentioned in the original text.

Bt toxins do not affect nontarget organisms because the toxins only harm pests that eat the leaves, stems, or fruit of the plants.</p><p>B. Bt plants have been shown in field studies to cause great harm to nontarget organisms.</p><p>C. Bt plants do not cause as much harm to nontarget species as the use of conventional pesticides.</p><p>D. Even if Bt toxins do not affect the insects that feed on the plants, they have harmful effects on birds that eat these insects.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The problem is in the last sentence of the fifth paragraph: How to, field tests indicate that Bt corn is not likely to harm monarchs., the application of pesticides (the alternative to growing Bt plants) has been demonstrated to cause widespread harm to Non-target insects. These two comparisons show that Bt crops do not harm caterpillars, but the use of pesticides can harm them as a non-targeted species. Option C says that Bt plants are less harmful to insecticides than non-targeted species. Option A says that Bt substances will not harm non-targeted species. It is wrong, but the damage is less than insecticides. Option B says that Bt substances are very large and wrong, but they are not large; Option D says that even if Bt does not harm, This kind of crop is an insect that eats, but it will hurt birds and it will be wrong.
