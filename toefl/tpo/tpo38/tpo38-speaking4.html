          <h4 class="w3-center">Phoresy</h4>
          <p>Animals often have to move from place to place to obtain resources. Most animals do so using their own physical effort, but animals of certain species may not be able to transport themselves efficiently in order to access the resources they need. These animals may make use of another animal species to transport them, without causing any injury to the other species. This relationship is known as phoresy. Phoresy, which is a temporary relationship, benefits the passenger species and causes little or no harm to the species doing the transporting.</p>

          <p>Now listen to part of a lecture on this topic in a biology class. </p>
          <p>So here's a good example of this mites are very small insect like creatures. Might slip in tropical climates and feed on nectar and pollen flowers but these tropical flowers don't last long they will often fall off quickly sodomites need to find new flowers in order to get more nectar and pollen to eat. But the mites can't fly and they are so small that it'd take them awhile and a lot of effort to climb down one flat or crawl to another one and climb all the way up again. So how do they get to the next flower well there's a bird the hummingbird. I'm angered the connector from the same flowers as the mites. So when a humming bird comes around and sticks it speak into the flowers to get the nectar out. The mites quickly climb onto the hummingbird well as I mentioned mites are pretty tiny so the hummingbird isn't harmed in any way. And all they do is stick to the hummingbird. Since the hummingbird also goes from flower to flower for nectar it takes the mites along. Once the humming bird gets to the next flower the mice climb off and eat some Polland nectar there on the new flower. Without the hummingbird carrying them from one flower to another the mites would find it much more difficult getting food.</p>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>This passage talks about a concept named phoresy. Phoresy refers to a temporary relationship in which one animal which is unable to move from one place to another depends on another animal to transport itself in order to get enough resources without causing any injury. In the lecture, the man takes mites as an example. He mentions that mites feed themselves on the nectar and pollen of certain kind of flower. However, they are too small to move from one flower to another. Luckily, there is also a kind of bird which also eat the same kind of flower. So the mite just need to stick to the bird and the bird can take it to a new flower. Also mites are tiny enough so they won't cause any injury to the birds.</p>
