Let's move on, to <span class="highlight">bacteria</span> and viruses that can infect plants.<span class="time" data-times="7.21" data-time="10.45">[00:10.45]</span> And let's start out with a <span class="highlight">virus</span> that's rather <span class="highlight">common</span> in various plants but first became known in connection with tulips. <span class="time" data-times="7.68" data-time="17.66">[00:17.66]</span>This <span class="highlight">virus</span> can cause a change in <span class="highlight">pigmentation</span> that <span class="highlight">dramatically</span> affects the color of the plant's leaves or flower petals. <span class="time" data-times="6.48" data-time="25.34">[00:25.34]</span>But since not all cells of the plant <span class="highlight">tissue</span> are infected, the result tends to be color <span class="highlight">variation</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.45" data-time="31.82">[00:31.82]</span>With color intensified in one part of the flower petal and faded in another, this is called color breaking. <span class="time" data-times="5.5" data-time="39.27">[00:39.27]</span>And the <span class="highlight">virus</span> that causes this in <span class="highlight">tulip</span> is called the tulip-breaking <span class="highlight">virus</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.41" data-time="44.77">[00:44.77]</span>The tulip-breaking <span class="highlight">virus</span> is now known to have <span class="highlight">detrimental</span> effects on plants. <span class="time" data-times="3.31" data-time="50.18">[00:50.18]</span>They're weaker and sometimes reduced in size.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.46" data-time="53.49">[00:53.49]</span>But for centuries people didn't have a <span class="highlight">clue</span> about this <span class="highlight">virus</span>. <span class="time" data-times="12.33" data-time="56.95">[00:56.95]</span>Not until the early 1900s was it known what caused the color breaking in tulips, what made the <span class="highlight">tulip</span> plant produce flower petals so <span class="highlight">radically</span> different in color or in <span class="highlight">pattern</span> from what you would have expected.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="17.05" data-time="69.28">[01:09.28]</span><span class="highlight">Tulip</span> flowers with stripes or streaks or <span class="highlight">feather</span> or <span class="highlight">flame</span> patterns on their petals, there is no <span class="highlight">doubt</span> in my <span class="highlight">mind</span> that these symptoms of this breaking <span class="highlight">virus</span> affected human <span class="highlight">behavior</span> too indirectly, that they set off the famous <span class="highlight">tulip</span> craze in the Netherlands.<span class="time" data-times="1.21" data-time="86.33">[01:26.33]</span>Let me explain.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="14.72" data-time="87.54">[01:27.54]</span>In the 17th <span class="highlight">century</span>, the Netherlands was among the most important trading centers in all of Europe with lots of rich merchants who <span class="highlight">wanted</span> to showcase their wealth, for example, by displaying <span class="highlight">exotic</span> tulips in their private gardens.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.8" data-time="102.26">[01:42.26]</span>Now, tulips are not native to the Netherlands. <span class="time" data-times="10.18" data-time="106.06">[01:46.06]</span>They originated in the mountains of Central Asia and <span class="highlight">spread</span> from <span class="highlight">Persia</span>, present-day Iran, to the Turkish Ottoman <span class="highlight">Empire</span> and from there <span class="highlight">eventually</span> reached Europe.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.96" data-time="116.24">[01:56.24]</span>There's an explanation for the <span class="highlight">origin</span> of the name "tulip" that kind of reflects this. <span class="time" data-times="5.91" data-time="121.2">[02:01.20]</span>Apparently, it came from a Persian word for "turban", you know, a cloth wound round the head. <span class="time" data-times="4" data-time="127.11">[02:07.11]</span>Um, a style of headgear worn by men in that part of the world.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.72" data-time="131.11">[02:11.11]</span>Well, the Ottomans used a <span class="highlight">similar</span> name for tulips after they acquired them from <span class="highlight">Persia</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9.2" data-time="135.83">[02:15.83]</span>And then, in the late 16th <span class="highlight">century</span>, a <span class="highlight">variation</span> on that name found its way from what is now <span class="highlight">Turkey</span> to the Netherlands <span class="highlight">along</span> with the plant itself.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="0.84" data-time="145.03">[02:25.03]</span>Okay.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.28" data-time="145.87">[02:25.87]</span>A <span class="highlight">tulip</span>, of <span class="highlight">course</span>, is typically grown from an <span class="highlight">underground</span><span class="highlight">bulb</span>. <span class="time" data-times="15.06" data-time="150.15">[02:30.15]</span>And although as it flowers the old <span class="highlight">bulb</span> shrivels to almost nothing, the plant produces another large <span class="highlight">bulb</span> and maybe two, three, four smaller ones to take its place, and while tulips take up to seven years to <span class="highlight">bloom</span> if you start from seeds.<span class="time" data-times="3.36" data-time="165.21">[02:45.21]</span>A large <span class="highlight">bulb</span> can produce a flower the very next year. <span class="time" data-times="2.84" data-time="168.57">[02:48.57]</span>With the smaller bulbs it takes maybe a <span class="highlight">couple</span> of years. <span class="time" data-times="12.73" data-time="171.41">[02:51.41]</span>And since these bulbs <span class="highlight">remain</span><span class="highlight">viable</span> for quite a long time, <span class="highlight">even</span> out of the ground, they can be stored or transported long distances without much of a problem, which helps explain the <span class="highlight">spread</span> of <span class="highlight">tulip</span><span class="highlight">cultivation</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.65" data-time="184.14">[03:04.14]</span>At first, tulips were <span class="highlight">rare</span> in the Netherlands and only for the wealthy. <span class="time" data-times="6.19" data-time="188.79">[03:08.79]</span>But in the early 17th <span class="highlight">century</span>, as more bulbs were produced there, you'd think the prices would come down. <span class="time" data-times="4.7" data-time="194.98">[03:14.98]</span>In fact, though, the popularity of some tulips increased tremendously. <span class="time" data-times="4.68" data-time="199.68">[03:19.68]</span>So demands soon far exceeded <span class="highlight">supply</span> and their prices skyrocketed.<span class="time" data-times="7.26" data-time="204.36">[03:24.36]</span> And the tulips most prized for their uniqueness and beauty were apparently the ones inflected by this <span class="highlight">mysterious</span><span class="highlight">virus</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.39" data-time="211.62">[03:31.62]</span>At that time, nobody was really able to <span class="highlight">breed</span> tulips like these. <span class="time" data-times="6.16" data-time="216.01">[03:36.01]</span>Color breaking happened in just two or three out of a hundred bulbs and seemingly just by <span class="highlight">chance</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="10.45" data-time="222.17">[03:42.17]</span>And since you didn't really know when you bought a <span class="highlight">bulb</span> if the colors would <span class="highlight">break</span>, well, Dutch speculators invested hand over fist and drove prices sky high. <span class="time" data-times="6.61" data-time="232.62">[03:52.62]</span>Some bulbs, <span class="highlight">even</span> while still in the ground, were sold for as much as you would <span class="highlight">pay</span> for a house at the time. <span class="time" data-times="5.46" data-time="239.23">[03:59.23]</span>But the huge speculative <span class="highlight">bubble</span> created by this <span class="highlight">tulip</span> craze <span class="highlight">eventually</span> collapsed. <span class="time" data-times="4.96" data-time="244.69">[04:04.69]</span>And when the prices fell, that wiped out a lot of fortunes almost <span class="highlight">overnight</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="249.65">[04:09.65]</span>Later on, <span class="highlight">tulip</span> breeders learned to duplicate color breaking in healthy, uninfected plants, so the spectacular-looking tulips so <span class="highlight">common</span> today are the result not of <span class="highlight">chance</span><span class="highlight">viral</span> infections, but of carefully controlled <span class="highlight">breeding</span>.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div
