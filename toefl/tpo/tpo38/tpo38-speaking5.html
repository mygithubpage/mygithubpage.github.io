        <h3>Listening Text</h3>
        <article>
          <p>Man: Listen to a conversation between two students.</p>
          <p>Woman: Hey Jeff how's it going.</p>
          <p>Man: Not too good you know who I work as a lab assistant in one of the science labs.</p>
          <p>Woman: Yeah.</p>
          <p>Man: Well I was in there this afternoon and I had some text books with me and I accidentally left one of my psychology books in there.</p>
          <p>Man: It's a special book our teacher loaned each student the class so I can't get it anywhere else and now the labs locked up for the night.</p>
          <p>Woman: There's no way you can get back into the lab to get it.</p>
          <p>Man: No and I have a psychology test tomorrow morning and I really need the book to study.</p>
          <p>Woman: So what are you gonna do.</p>
          <p>Man: Well I could just study from my notes tonight then go to the site's building and get my book early tomorrow morning the lab opens at six AM and my tests at eight.</p>
          <p>Woman: Six AM is pretty early.</p>
          <p>Man: Yeah I mean I could do it but I have to get up at like five o'clock and I wouldn't have much time to study the stuff in the book before the test.</p>
          <p>Woman: Whom.</p>
          <p>Man: My other option would be to study with another student from that class.</p>
          <p>Woman: Do you know someone you could study with.</p>
          <p>Man: Yeah but there's a guy who sits next to me in class and he actually asked me if I'd be interested in studying for the exam with him tonight.</p>
          <p>Woman: And he has the book.</p>
          <p>Man: Yeah.</p>
          <p>Woman: Well why not do that then you have more time to study the stuff in the book.</p>
          <p>Man: Well he's not a very good student.</p>
          <p>Man: He's missed a lot of classes and he doesn't take good notes during the lectures.</p>
          <p>Woman: So you might spend a lot of time tutoring him instead of studying the stuff you need to study.</p>
          <p>Man: Exactly.</p>
          <p>Man: But he does have the book.</p>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>In this conversation, the man lost his psychology textbook in a locked classroom. Unfortunately he has an exam tomorrow at eight o'clock and he needs this book. He has two solutions now. One solution is he could use his notes to study tonight and fetch the textbook at six o'clock tomorrow morning. But if so, there won't be enough time for him to read his book. The second solution is he could study with one of his classmate who has a textbook. However, if he studies with his classmate, he probably will spend lots of time tutoring his classmate instead of reviewing the content he wants to study. I suppose the first solution is better. Because the man indicates that he takes his notes carefully so it is probably detailed enough for him to review. And two hours can be enough for him to review his textbook next morning.</p>
