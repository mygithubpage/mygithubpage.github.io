              <span class="time" data-times="7.99" data-time="4.18">[00:04.18]</span>Professor: Last week we discussed the <span class="highlight">formation</span> of Earth and the other <span class="highlight">rocky</span> planets, of planets in the <span class="highlight">inner</span> <span class="highlight">solar</span> system. <span class="time" data-times="3.48" data-time="12.17">[00:12.17]</span>Uh, so, what about the gas giants? <span class="time" data-times="3.08" data-time="15.65">[00:15.65]</span> <span class="highlight">Jupiter</span>, <span class="highlight">Saturn</span>, Uranus, and Neptune.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.14" data-time="18.73">[00:18.73]</span>Well, there's two theories. <span class="time" data-times="2.14" data-time="20.87">[00:20.87]</span>But first, let's recap.<span class="time" data-times="9.2" data-time="23.01">[00:23.01]</span> We believe our <span class="highlight">solar</span> system began as a huge <span class="highlight">spinning</span> cloud of dust and gas, which flattened and <span class="highlight">eventually</span> collapsed in on itself. <span class="time" data-times="6.84" data-time="32.21">[00:32.21]</span>The matter it's centered condensed into a ball of hot gas and dust, <span class="highlight">eventually</span> becoming our sun.<span class="time" data-times="2.9" data-time="39.05">[00:39.05]</span> And what happened to the <span class="highlight">remaining</span> cloud?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.71" data-time="41.95">[00:41.95]</span>To the disk encircling the sun when it was a young star?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.51" data-time="45.66">[00:45.66]</span>Student: The <span class="highlight">rocky</span> planets were born. <span class="time" data-times="13.37" data-time="48.17">[00:48.17]</span>Um, dust, little grains of rock and metal <span class="highlight">within</span> the disk collided with each other and <span class="highlight">stuck</span> together, and this <span class="highlight">process</span> <span class="highlight">sort</span> of snowballed over millions of years until the chunks grew into mini-planets, proto-planets.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.56" data-time="61.54">[01:01.54]</span>Professor: Yeah. This <span class="highlight">process</span> is called <span class="highlight">accretion</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.55" data-time="65.1">[01:05.10]</span>And we call the disk an <span class="highlight">accretion</span> disk.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.2" data-time="68.65">[01:08.65]</span>Now, think of it as two parts: an <span class="highlight">inner</span> <span class="highlight">accretion</span> disk, and an outer <span class="highlight">accretion</span> disk. <span class="time" data-times="9.62" data-time="76.85">[01:16.85]</span>In the <span class="highlight">inner</span> part, once an object gets large enough, that object's <span class="highlight">gravitational</span> <span class="highlight">field</span> gets stronger, which speeds up the <span class="highlight">accretion</span> <span class="highlight">process</span>.<span class="time" data-times="4.59" data-time="86.47">[01:26.47]</span> You know, larger objects <span class="highlight">attract</span> smaller ones and <span class="highlight">sort</span> of gobble them up.<span class="time" data-times="4.23" data-time="91.06">[01:31.06]</span> And <span class="highlight">eventually</span>, you get a full-sized <span class="highlight">planet</span> in its own <span class="highlight">orbit</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.59" data-time="95.29">[01:35.29]</span>Okay. That's how the <span class="highlight">inner</span> <span class="highlight">rocky</span> planets probably formed by <span class="highlight">accretion</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.59" data-time="100.88">[01:40.88]</span>But what about those gas planets in the outer <span class="highlight">solar</span> system, in the outer <span class="highlight">accretion</span> disk?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.03" data-time="107.47">[01:47.47]</span>Well, the first <span class="highlight">theory</span> says the <span class="highlight">accretion</span> <span class="highlight">process</span> was <span class="highlight">similar</span> to the one that formed the <span class="highlight">rocky</span> planets, with some key differences.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.43" data-time="117.5">[01:57.50]</span>Remember, the gas giants are farther from the sun, where temperatures are much colder. <span class="time" data-times="6.79" data-time="122.93">[02:02.93]</span>So, in the outer <span class="highlight">accretion</span> disk, compounds like water and <span class="highlight">ammonia</span> exist in frozen form.<span class="time" data-times="4.65" data-time="129.72">[02:09.72]</span> Closer to the sun, they're more likely to be vaporized by <span class="highlight">solar</span> <span class="highlight">radiation</span>.<span class="time" data-times="9.93" data-time="134.37">[02:14.37]</span> What this means is that in <span class="highlight">addition</span> to <span class="highlight">rocky</span> and <span class="highlight">metallic</span> particles there would be other solids like frozen water and frozen <span class="highlight">ammonia</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.64" data-time="144.3">[02:24.30]</span>Student: So more <span class="highlight">solid</span> substances are <span class="highlight">available</span> to <span class="highlight">clump</span> into protoplanets, right?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.26" data-time="149.94">[02:29.94]</span>Professor: Precisely! So the <span class="highlight">solid</span> cores of the gas giants could <span class="highlight">conceivably</span> have formed by <span class="highlight">accretion</span>.<span class="time" data-times="7.16" data-time="157.2">[02:37.20]</span> And once their <span class="highlight">mass</span> reaches a certain point, around about 5 to 10 Earths, what would happen?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.42" data-time="164.36">[02:44.36]</span>Student: 5 to 10 Earths...uh, with a <span class="highlight">mass</span> that big, I guess <span class="highlight">gravity</span> would start to pull in more and more <span class="highlight">material</span> faster, right?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.14" data-time="171.78">[02:51.78]</span>Professor: <span class="highlight">Material</span>, meaning gas. <span class="time" data-times="11.65" data-time="173.92">[02:53.92]</span> It would rapidly pull in more and more gas from the <span class="highlight">accretion</span> disk, so you end up with a <span class="highlight">solid</span> <span class="highlight">core</span> of rock, metal and ice surrounded by <span class="highlight">massive</span> amounts of gas. <span class="time" data-times="2.98" data-time="185.57">[03:05.57]</span>That's the <span class="highlight">core</span> <span class="highlight">accretion</span> <span class="highlight">theory</span>.<span class="time" data-times="4.44" data-time="188.55">[03:08.55]</span>Now, the other <span class="highlight">theory</span> is called the disk <span class="highlight">instability</span> <span class="highlight">theory</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.62" data-time="192.99">[03:12.99]</span>The disk <span class="highlight">instability</span> <span class="highlight">theory</span> holds that gas begins the planet-making <span class="highlight">process</span>, without a <span class="highlight">solid</span> <span class="highlight">core</span>.<span class="time" data-times="4.29" data-time="201.61">[03:21.61]</span> You see, most of the outer <span class="highlight">accretion</span> disk would have been gas. <span class="time" data-times="5.95" data-time="205.9">[03:25.90]</span>We believe <span class="highlight">solid</span> particles probably made up just one percent of the outer <span class="highlight">accretion</span> disk.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="11.45" data-time="211.85">[03:31.85]</span>So this <span class="highlight">theory</span> suggests that large planets, the gas giants, uh, they develop from large clumps of mostly gas and some dust in an <span class="highlight">accretion</span> disk. <span class="time" data-times="13.42" data-time="223.3">[03:43.30]</span>Outer regions of an <span class="highlight">accretion</span> disk can be unstable, gravitationally unstable, which is what causes these clumps to form, and in some cases, grow in to proto- planets.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.03" data-time="236.72">[03:56.72]</span>Over time, dust particles <span class="highlight">within</span> a gas <span class="highlight">clump</span> <span class="highlight">coalesce</span>, <span class="highlight">bond</span> together, and <span class="highlight">eventually</span> fall toward the center, creating a <span class="highlight">core</span>.<span class="time" data-times="8.41" data-time="246.75">[04:06.75]</span> Once this happens, the gas <span class="highlight">clump</span> grows <span class="highlight">relatively</span> quickly as its <span class="highlight">gravity</span> pulls in more and more gas and dust particles.<span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="255.16">[04:15.16]</span> And this whole <span class="highlight">process</span> can <span class="highlight">theoretically</span> happen <span class="highlight">within</span> one hundred thousand years.</p>
