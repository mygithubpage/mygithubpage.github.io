To compare the composition of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.</p><p>D. To explain why young stars are often surrounded by disks of gas and dust.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The problem of this question is:</p><p>Professor:</p><p>Last week we discussed the formation of Earth and the other rocky planets, of planets in the inner solar system. Uh, so, what about the gas giants? Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.</p><p>Well, there's two theories. Here is a clear explanation of the two theories that will be followed regarding the formation of gas giants. Option B is consistent with the question. The remaining three options are not well summarized. Select B.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor review the formation of rocky planets?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To contrast it with the formation of the Sun.</p><p>B. To correct a common misunderstanding about accretion.</p><p>C. To use the information as the basis for another topic of discussion.</p><p>D. To introduce recent discoveries about rocky planets in other solar systems.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The problem of this question is:</p><p>Professor:</p><p>We believe our solar system began as a huge spinning cloud of dust and gas, which flattened and ended collapsed on on itself. The matter it's centered condensed into a ball of hot gas and dust, succeed is our sun. And what happened to the remaining Cloud?</p><p>To the disk encircling the sun when it was a young star?</p><p>Student:</p><p>The rocky planets were born.</p><p>Here is how professors led the students to review how rock planets formed. But this lesson is about how the gas giants are formed, so the previous rock planets are just a primer, in order to elicit a real theme. Option C meets the author's intention. The other three options do not match. Select C.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What point does the professor emphasize when he mentions water and ammonia?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Solid forms of water and ammonia may have contributed to the formation of the gas giants.</p><p>B. Water and ammonia were not common substances in the outer accretion disk.</p><p>C. Water and ammonia are pulled in by the gravity of protoplanets more readily than other substances are.</p><p>D. Most substances found in the core of rocky planets are also found in the core of gas planets.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The problem of this question is:</p><p>Remember, the gas giants are farther from the sun, where temperatures are much colder. So, in the outer accretion disks, compounds like water and ammonia exist in frozen form. Closer to the sun, they're more likely to be vaporized by solar Radiation. What this means is that in addition to rocky and metallic particles there would be other solids like frozen water and frozen ammonia.</p><p>Water and ammonia appeared here. The professor said that this gaseous planet is very far from the sun, so the temperature is very low. Water and ammonia are stored in the frozen state. The closer to the sun, the easier it is to vaporize. This means that in addition to rock and metal particles, the solids of water and ammonia can be regarded as another solid. Option A meets the meaning of this paragraph. The other three options do not match. Select A.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor, what could have occurred when a protoplanet in the outer accretion disk reached a mass of five to ten Earths?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It started to shed grains of rock and metal into the solar system.</p><p>B. Its gravity began to pull in huge amounts of the surrounding gas.</p><p>C. Its gravity caused clumps to form in the surrounding gas.</p><p>D. It collided with smaller protoplanets.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The problem of this question is:</p><p>Professor:</p><p>And once their mass reaches a certain point, around about 5 to 10 Earths, what would happen?</p><p>Student:</p><p>5 to 10 Earths...uh, with a mass that big, I guess gravity would start to pull in more and more material faster, right?</p><p>Professor:</p><p>Material, meaning gas. It would rapidly pull in more and more gas from the accretion disk, so you end up with a solid core of rock, metal and ice surrounded by massive amounts of gas.</p><p>Here, when the quality of this gaseous planet is getting bigger and bigger and it is still five to ten times that of Earth, gravity attracts more and more things to the planet and finally gets a rock metal and ice. The block is nuclear, and the outer periphery is a massive gas planet. Option B meets. The other three options do not meet. Select B.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor, what are two claims of the disk-instability theory?

Gas planet formation can occur anywhere in the accretion disk.</p><p>D. Gas planets form over a relatively short time.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="AD"><p>The problem of this question is:</p><p>Now, the other theory is called the disk instability theory.</p><p>The disk instability theory holds that gas begins the planet-making process, without a solid core. You see, most of the outer accretion disks would have gas. We believe that solid particles probably made up just just one percent of the outer accretion disk.</p><p>Over time, dust particles within a gas clump coalesce, bond together, and finally fall toward the center, creating a core. Once this happens, the gas clump grows relatively quickly as its gravity pulls in more and more gas and dust particles. And this The whole process can happenly within within one hundred thousand years.</p><p>These two paragraphs have two points about the characteristics of the disk instability theory: One is that this forming theory holds that there is no solid core when forming a planet; and the formation of this gas accumulation is very rapid and can be completed in 100,000 years. . These two points correspond to Option A and Option D, respectively. The other two options have no basis. Double-select AD.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which is right about the professor's opinion about the disk-instability theory?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It differs from the core-accretion theory in relatively insignificant ways.</p><p>B. It does not take into account the amount of time needed for gas planets to form.</p><p>C. It is more applicable to star formation than the core-accretion theory is.</p><p>D. Solid particles are believed to own a small proportion of the outer accretion disk.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>This option A is not found in the original text, not selected; Option C is star formation, the formation of stars, and the content of this article is also irrelevant; Option B relates to Once this happens, the gas clump grows relatively quickly as its gravity pulls in more and More gas and dust particles. And this whole process can theoretically happen within a hundred thousand years. Here it mentions time and error. The problem D of option D is: You see, most of the outer accretion disks would have been gas. We believe So the solid particles have made only just one percent of the outer accretion disk. So the outer accretion disk has very few solid particles. Select D.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
