Changes would include an expansion of the station's broadcasting range, which would allow the radio's programming to reach nearby towns. One goal of the plan is to attract more students to apply its communications program. Another goal is to provide the university with an extra source of revenue. University officials expect the enhanced radio station to significantly increase the number of listeners, which will in turn encourage businesses to place commercials on the radio.</p></article><div><audio src="tpo12-speaking3.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></div><article id="listening-passage" class="passage"><h3>Listening Text</h3><p>Now, listen to two students discussing the article.</p><p>(man) What do you think of the proposal?</p><p>(woman) I think it'll work. I mean, the range of the station now is basically limited to the campus. So it's basically just a few programs mainly for students.</p><p>(man) Yeah?</p><p>(woman) Well, if this proposal goes through there will be more programs and it'll give the students more professional experience as they expand the programming for a much larger, you know, real-life audience. And stuff like that will give them a better shot at getting a job after they graduate.</p><p>(man) Of course.</p><p>(woman) Besides, the whole university will benefit from it.</p><p>(man) What do you mean?</p><p>(woman) Well, you know my friend Tony, right? He told me that the radio station at his university did something like this about five years ago.</p><p>(man) And?</p><p>(woman) Well, it's a success! They are making a lot of money out of commercials and they are using it to offer more scholarships and to help fund projects to renovate the facilities of other programs.</p><p>(man) That sounds really good."</p></article><section id="question"><h4>Question</h4><p>The woman supports the proposal described in the article. Explain why she thinks it will achieve the university's goals. </p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>The woman agrees with the proposal and believes that it will achieve the university's goals for two main reasons. First of all, she believes that there will be more programs than there used to be, and it'll offer students more professional experience since the programming will be directed to larger and real-life audience, which will give students better chance for job-hunting after graduation. The second reason form the woman is that the whole university will benefit from the proposal too. She quotes her friend's university that did the same thing like five years ago and points out that it turned out to be a success since such a change actually made a lot of money, and her friend's university put the money into the field of scholarships and renovation of the facilities of other programs as well. So based on the reasons stated above, the woman agrees that such a proposal will help the university meeting its goals. (158 words)</p></article></div></main></body></html>
