It only takes me three hours to fly from Beijing to Chongqing. This saves me a lot of time. I can go to Chongqing in the morning and come back to Beijing in the evening. However, if I take train or bus, it'll take me at least 20 hours. So it's very fast to take planes. Also, every time I am on the plane, the flight attendant serves me delicious food and drink, all free of charge. But in a train, the attendants aren't very hospitable and you have to pay for all the food and beverage even though they aren't of high quality. So that's why I think taking plane is comfortable.</p></article></section></main></body></html>
