How genes control human development.</p><p>B. Why various types of human cells divide at different rates.</p><p>C. How human chromosomes differ from one another.</p><p>D. Why most human cells cannot keep dividing successfully.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>We can explain a very important observation that leads to the topic that the number of cell divisions is limited and therefore cannot always be divided. There is interference in B, but this professor did not explain it, so this item is not optional.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The professor discusses research about the percentage of a chromosome's DNA that contains genetic information.How did she feel about this research?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. She doubted its accuracy.</p><p>B. She was surprised by its conclusion.</p><p>C. She was concerned about its implications.</p><p>D. She thought it was unnecessary.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>They were amazed, we all were, this sentence is the key sentence. Everyone was surprised at the result that "only 20%-30% of the DNA is genetically significant."</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor say about the DNA in a telomere?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It causes a cell to begin dividing.</p><p>B. It separates one gene from another.</p><p>C. It is genetically meaningless.</p><p>D. It has no function.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The professor stated in the following sentence of the definition of telomere (n. telomere): "Now a telomere is a highly repetitious and genetically impliesless sequence of DNA, what we were calling JUNK DNA." The remaining options are almost irrelevant.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor mention shoelaces?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To point out that chromosomes are arranged in pairs.</p><p>B. To describe the coiled shape of a chromosome.</p><p>C. To illustrate how chromosomes are protected from damage.</p><p>D. To explain how chromosomes are joined before dividing.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The professor exemplifies the plastic part at the end of the shoelace to explain the role of telomere. "protect the genes the genetically functional parts of the Chromosome from being damaged." Both things serve the same purpose, protecting the laces (chromosomes)</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor imply about the length of the telomeres on a cell's chromosomes?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Longer telomeres allow the cell to divide more times.</p><p>B. Longer telomeres contain more genetic information.</p><p>C. Shorter telomeres are wound into tighter coils.</p><p>D. Shorter telomeres are less likely to break.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The professor pointed out that telomeres will become shorter and shorter as the chromosomes divide, "So after each division, the telomere gets shorter." Therefore, the longer the telomeres, the more divisions are allowed. BC is irrelevant, and the D option is reversed.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor, how is the chemical telomerase related to the telomere?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It resembles the telomere in structure.</p><p>B. It helps repair broken telomeres.</p><p>C. It is produced at the end of telomere.</p><p>D. It prevents telomeres from becoming too long.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Professor introduced an enzyme present in telomeres: telomerase, telomerase, and ribosomal protease. "This chemical, this telomerase can rebuild it, can help reassemble the protected DNA," Telomerase can repair telomeres, and the B option fits the question. CD has nothing to do. The A option interferes with speech, not resemble. It should be reassemble. The A option means: Telomeres and telomerase are structurally similar.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
