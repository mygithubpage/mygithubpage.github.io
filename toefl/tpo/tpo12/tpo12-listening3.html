            <span class="time" data-times="4.12" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in a Business Class.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="13.62" data-time="4.12">[00:04.12]</span>Professor: OK, as we've talked about a key <span class="highlight">aspect</span> of running a successful business is knowing, um, getting a good <span class="highlight">sense</span> of what the customer actually wants, and how they <span class="highlight">perceive</span> your product. <span class="time" data-times="8.87" data-time="17.74">[00:17.74]</span>So with that in <span class="highlight">mind</span>, I want to <span class="highlight">describe</span> a very simple <span class="highlight">method</span> of researching customer <span class="highlight">preference</span> and it's becoming increasingly <span class="highlight">common</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.57" data-time="26.61">[00:26.61]</span>It's called MBWA, which stands for Managing by Wandering Around.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="10.2" data-time="34.18">[00:34.18]</span>Now, MBWA, that's not the most <span class="highlight">technical</span> sounding name you have ever heard, but it describes the <span class="highlight">process</span> <span class="highlight">pretty</span> accurately. <span class="time" data-times="2.04" data-time="44.38">[00:44.38]</span>Here's how it works.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="19.85" data-time="46.42">[00:46.42]</span>Basically, um, the idea is that business owners or business managers just go out and actually talk to their customers and, uh, learn more about how well the business is serving their needs, and try to see what the customer experiences, <span class="time" data-times="7.34" data-time="66.27">[01:06.27]</span>'cause that's a great way to discover for yourself how your product is perceived, what its strengths and weaknesses are. <span class="time" data-times="3.27" data-time="73.61">[01:13.61]</span>You know, how you can <span class="highlight">improve</span> it, that <span class="highlight">sort</span> of thing.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.77" data-time="76.88">[01:16.88]</span>You know Daltons? <span class="time" data-times="2.93" data-time="78.65">[01:18.65]</span>They make soup and canned vegetables and such. <span class="time" data-times="9.36" data-time="81.58">[01:21.58]</span>Well, the head of the <span class="highlight">company</span> had Daltons' top executives walk around supermarkets, um, asking shoppers what they thought of Daltons' soups. <span class="time" data-times="3.81" data-time="90.94">[01:30.94]</span>And he used that <span class="highlight">data</span> to make changes to the <span class="highlight">company</span>'s products. <span class="time" data-times="12.64" data-time="94.75">[01:34.75]</span>I mean, when Daltons, of all companies, embraces something as <span class="highlight">radical</span> as MBWA, it really shows you how <span class="highlight">popular</span> the <span class="highlight">theory</span> has become. Yes, Lisa?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.17" data-time="107.39">[01:47.39]</span>Student A: But isn't it dangerous to <span class="highlight">base</span> decisions from information from a small <span class="highlight">sample</span> of people? <span class="time" data-times="4.96" data-time="112.56">[01:52.56]</span>Isn't large-scale <span class="highlight">market</span> research safer, getting <span class="highlight">data</span> on a lot of people?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.83" data-time="117.52">[01:57.52]</span>Professor: That's a good question. <span class="time" data-times="9.99" data-time="119.35">[01:59.35]</span>And, uh, well, I don't want to pretend that MBWA is some <span class="highlight">sort</span> of, uh, replacement for other methods of customer research. <span class="time" data-times="17.6" data-time="129.34">[02:09.34]</span>Now <span class="highlight">market</span> research <span class="highlight">data</span> <span class="highlight">definitely</span> can give you a good idea of the big picture, but MBWA is really useful, it kind of filling in the blanks, you know, getting a good on-the-ground <span class="highlight">sense</span> of how your products are used and how people need to <span class="highlight">respond</span> to them.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.85" data-time="146.94">[02:26.94]</span>And, yes, the numbers of opinions you get is small, so you do need to be careful. <span class="time" data-times="14.9" data-time="152.79">[02:32.79]</span>But, good business managers will tell you that the biggest fear they have and one of the most frequent problems they come <span class="highlight">across</span> is, well, becoming out of touch with what their customers really want and need. <span class="time" data-times="10.28" data-time="167.69">[02:47.69]</span>You know, surveys and <span class="highlight">market</span> research, <span class="highlight">stuff</span> like that, they can only tell you so much about what the customers actually want in their day to day lives. <span class="time" data-times="7.26" data-time="177.97">[02:57.97]</span>Managing by wandering around, on the other hand, well, that gets you in there and gives you a good <span class="highlight">sense</span> of what customers' need. <span class="time" data-times="9.2" data-time="185.23">[03:05.23]</span>So, when used in <span class="highlight">combination</span>, then, MBWA and <span class="highlight">market</span> research, well, they are powerful tools.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.87" data-time="194.43">[03:14.43]</span>Oh, here's another example for you. <span class="time" data-times="7.69" data-time="197.3">[03:17.30]</span>Uh, <span class="highlight">senior</span> executives for a clothing <span class="highlight">manufacture</span>, it was, um, Elkin, Elkin <span class="highlight">jeans</span>, you know? <span class="time" data-times="5.43" data-time="204.99">[03:24.99]</span>They went and worked in the store for a few days, selling Elkin's clothes. <span class="time" data-times="3.37" data-time="210.42">[03:30.42]</span>Now that gave them a very different idea about their product. <span class="time" data-times="2.56" data-time="213.79">[03:33.79]</span>They saw how people responded to it. <span class="time" data-times="3.86" data-time="216.35">[03:36.35]</span>They could go up to customers in the store and asked them questions about it. <span class="time" data-times="1.35" data-time="220.21">[03:40.21]</span>Uh, yes, Mike?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="12.03" data-time="221.56">[03:41.56]</span>Student B: Well, I would think that a lot of customers would be bothered by, you know, if I'm shopping, I don't know if I want some business <span class="highlight">representative</span> coming up to me and asking me questions. <span class="time" data-times="3.71" data-time="233.59">[03:53.59]</span>It's like when I get phone calls at home from <span class="highlight">market</span> researchers. <span class="time" data-times="1.48" data-time="237.3">[03:57.30]</span>I just hang up on them.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="7.68" data-time="238.78">[03:58.78]</span>Professor: Well, it's certainly true that, well, no one likes getting calls at home from <span class="highlight">market</span> researchers or people like that. <span class="time" data-times="1.31" data-time="246.46">[04:06.46]</span>But I'll tell you something. <span class="time" data-times="5.93" data-time="247.77">[04:07.77]</span>Most customers have the <span class="highlight">exact</span> <span class="highlight">opposite</span> <span class="highlight">reaction</span> when it comes to MBWA. <span class="time" data-times="4.7" data-time="253.7">[04:13.70]</span>Now, don't ask me why because I really have no idea. <span class="time" data-times="8.26" data-time="258.4">[04:18.40]</span>But the fact is, that customers <span class="highlight">tend</span> to <span class="highlight">respond</span> really well to MBWA, which is the key <span class="highlight">reason</span> for its success.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.47" data-time="266.66">[04:26.66]</span>In fact, the techniques of MBWA work so well. <span class="time" data-times="6.63" data-time="271.13">[04:31.13]</span>They've actually been extended to all kinds of different contexts like <span class="highlight">politics</span>, for <span class="highlight">instance</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.1" data-time="277.76">[04:37.76]</span>Uh, a few years back, the mayor of Baltimore, uh, I think his name was Shaffer, or something like that. <span class="time" data-times="11.18" data-time="285.86">[04:45.86]</span>Anyway, he decided that the best way to serve the people of the city, of his city, was to actually get out there in it and experience the things that they experienced.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="7.65" data-time="297.04">[04:57.04]</span>So, he'd ride around the city and, well you know, in all parts of it, and he'd see all the pot holes. <span class="time" data-times="5.28" data-time="304.69">[05:04.69]</span>He'd see how the <span class="highlight">trash</span> was sometimes, uh, not picked up off the side of the street. <span class="time" data-times="9.46" data-time="309.97">[05:09.97]</span>And then he'd go back to his office and he'd write these memos, now, they were memos to his <span class="highlight">staff</span> about the problems he'd seen and how they needed to be fixed. <span class="time" data-times="1.2" data-time="319.43">[05:19.43]</span>You know, that <span class="highlight">sort</span> of thing.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="9.82" data-time="320.63">[05:20.63]</span>But, the thing is, he got all these information just by going around and seeing the different Baltimore neighborhoods and talking to the people in them. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="330.45">[05:30.45]</span>Now, he called this smart <span class="highlight">politics</span>; we'd call it MBWA, or just playing good customer service.</p>
