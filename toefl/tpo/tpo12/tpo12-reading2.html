            <b>Transition to Sound in Film</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>The <span class="highlight">shift</span> from silent to <span class="highlight">sound</span> <span class="highlight">film</span> at the end of the 1920s marks, so far, the most important <span class="highlight">transformation</span> in <span class="highlight">motion</span> picture <span class="highlight">history</span>. Despite all the highly <span class="highlight">visible</span> <span class="highlight">technological</span> developments in theatrical and home delivery of the moving <span class="highlight">image</span> that have occurred over the decades since then, no single <span class="highlight">innovation</span> has come close to being <span class="question1">regarded</span> as a <span class="highlight">similar</span> kind of watershed. In nearly every language, however the words are phrased, the most <span class="highlight">basic</span> <span class="highlight">division</span> in cinema <span class="highlight">history</span> lies between films that are mute and films that speak.</p>
          <p>Yet this most <span class="highlight">fundamental</span> <span class="highlight">standard</span> of historical periodization conceals a <span class="highlight">host</span> of <span class="question3">paradoxes. </span>Nearly every movie theater, however <span class="highlight">modest</span>, had a piano or organ to provide <span class="highlight">musical</span> accompaniment to silent pictures. In many instances, spectators in the <span class="highlight">era</span> before recorded <span class="highlight">sound</span> experienced <span class="highlight">elaborate</span> <span class="highlight">aural</span> presentations alongside movies' <span class="highlight">visual</span> images, from the Japanese benshi (narrators) crafting multivoiced dialogue narratives to <span class="highlight">original</span> <span class="highlight">musical</span> compositions performed by symphony-size orchestras in Europe and the United States. In Berlin, for the premiere performance outside the Soviet Union of The Battleship Potemkin, <span class="highlight">film</span> <span class="highlight">director</span> Sergei Eisenstein worked with Austrian <span class="highlight">composer</span> Edmund Meisel (1874-1930) on a <span class="highlight">musical</span> <span class="highlight">score</span> matching <span class="highlight">sound</span> to <span class="highlight">image</span>; the Berlin screenings with live music helped to bring the <span class="highlight">film</span> its wide international fame.</p>
          <p>Beyond that, the <span class="highlight">triumph</span> of recorded <span class="highlight">sound</span> has <span class="question6">overshadowed </span>the rich <span class="highlight">diversity</span> of <span class="highlight">technological</span> and <span class="highlight">aesthetic</span> experiments with the <span class="highlight">visual</span> <span class="highlight">image</span> that were going <span class="highlight">forward</span> simultaneously in the 1920s. New color processes, larger or differently shaped <span class="highlight">screen</span> sizes, multiple-screen projections, <span class="highlight">even</span> television, were among the developments invented or tried out during the period, sometimes with <span class="highlight">startling</span> success. The high costs of converting to <span class="highlight">sound</span> and the early limitations of <span class="highlight">sound</span> technology were among the factors that suppressed innovations or retarded advancement in these other areas. The <span class="highlight">introduction</span> of new <span class="highlight">screen</span> formats was put off for a quarter <span class="highlight">century</span>, and color, though utilized over the next two decades for <span class="highlight">special</span> productions, also did not become a norm until the 1950s.</p>
          <p><span class="question8">Though it may be difficult to imagine from a later <span class="highlight">perspective</span>, a <span class="highlight">strain</span> of <span class="highlight">critical</span> opinion in the 1920s predicted that <span class="highlight">sound</span> <span class="highlight">film</span> would be a <span class="highlight">technical</span> <span class="highlight">novelty</span> that would soon <span class="highlight">fade</span> from sight, just as had many <span class="highlight">previous</span> attempts, dating well back before the First World War, to link images with recorded <span class="highlight">sound</span>. </span>These critics were making a <span class="highlight">common</span> <span class="highlight">assumption</span>-that the <span class="highlight">technological</span> inadequacies of earlier efforts (poor <span class="highlight">synchronization</span>, weak <span class="highlight">sound</span> amplification, <span class="highlight">fragile</span> <span class="highlight">sound</span> recordings) would <span class="highlight">invariably</span> <span class="highlight">occur</span> again. To be sure, their evaluation of the <span class="highlight">technical</span> flaws in 1920s <span class="highlight">sound</span> experiments was not so far off the mark, yet they <span class="question9">neglected </span>to take into <span class="highlight">account</span> important new forces in the <span class="highlight">motion</span> picture <span class="highlight">field</span> that, in a <span class="highlight">sense</span>, would not take no for an answer.</p>
          <p>These forces were the rapidly expanding electronics and telecommunications companies that were developing and linking telephone and wireless technologies in the 1920s.
In the United States, they included such firms as American Telephone and <span class="highlight">Telegraph</span>, General Electric, and Westinghouse. They were interested in all forms of <span class="highlight">sound</span> technology and all <span class="highlight">potential</span> avenues for <span class="highlight">commercial</span> <span class="highlight">exploitation</span>. Their competition and collaboration were creating the broadcasting <span class="highlight">industry</span> in the United States, beginning with the <span class="highlight">introduction</span> of <span class="highlight">commercial</span> radio programming in the early 1920s.  <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>With <span class="highlight">financial</span> assets <span class="highlight">considerably</span> greater than those in the <span class="highlight">motion</span> picture <span class="highlight">industry</span>, and perhaps a wider <span class="highlight">vision</span> of the relationships among 
entertainment and communications <span class="highlight">media</span>, they revitalized research into recording <span class="highlight">sound</span> for <span class="highlight">motion</span> pictures.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B">
            </span>In 1929 the United States <span class="highlight">motion</span> picture <span class="highlight">industry</span> released more than 300 <span class="highlight">sound</span> films-a <span class="highlight">rough</span> <span class="highlight">figure</span>, 
 since a number were silent films with music tracks, or films prepared in dual versions, to take <span class="highlight">account</span> of the many cinemas not yet wired for <span class="highlight">sound</span>.
  <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>At the production <span class="highlight">level</span>, in the United States the <span class="highlight">conversion</span> was <span class="highlight">virtually</span> complete by 1930.  <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>In Europe it took a little longer, mainly because there were more small 
 producers for whom the costs of <span class="highlight">sound</span> were prohibitive, and in other parts of the world problems with rights or <span class="highlight">access</span> to equipment delayed the <span class="highlight">shift</span> to <span class="highlight">sound</span> production 
 for a few more years (though cinemas in <span class="highlight">major</span> cities may have been wired in order to play foreign <span class="highlight">sound</span> films). The <span class="highlight">triumph</span> of <span class="highlight">sound</span> cinema was <span class="highlight">swift</span>, complete, and enormously <span class="highlight">popular</span>.</p>
