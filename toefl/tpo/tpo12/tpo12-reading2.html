Despite all the highly <span class="highlight">visible</span><span class="highlight">technological</span> developments in theatrical and home delivery of the moving <span class="highlight">image</span> that have occurred over the decades since then, no single <span class="highlight">innovation</span> has come close to being <span class="highlight question1">regarded</span> as a <span class="highlight">similar</span> kind of watershed. In nearly every language, however the words are phrased, the most <span class="highlight">basic</span><span class="highlight">division</span> in cinema <span class="highlight">history</span> lies between films that are mute and films that speak.</p><p>Yet this most <span class="highlight">fundamental</span><span class="highlight">standard</span> of historical periodization conceals a <span class="highlight">host</span> of <span class="question3">paradoxes</span>. Nearly every movie theater, however <span class="highlight">modest</span>, had a piano or organ to provide <span class="highlight">musical</span> accompaniment to silent pictures. In many instances, spectators in the <span class="highlight">era</span> before recorded <span class="highlight">sound</span> experienced <span class="highlight">elaborate</span><span class="highlight">aural</span> presentations alongside movies' <span class="highlight">visual</span> images, from the Japanese benshi (narrators) crafting multivoiced dialogue narratives to <span class="highlight">original</span><span class="highlight">musical</span> compositions performed by symphony-size orchestras in Europe and the United States. In Berlin, for the premiere performance outside the Soviet Union of The Battleship Potemkin, <span class="highlight">film</span><span class="highlight">director</span> Sergei Eisenstein worked with Austrian <span class="highlight">composer</span> Edmund Meisel (1874-1930) on a <span class="highlight">musical</span><span class="highlight">score</span> matching <span class="highlight">sound</span> to <span class="highlight">image</span>; the Berlin screenings with live music helped to bring the <span class="highlight">film</span> its wide international fame.</p><p>Beyond that, the <span class="highlight">triumph</span> of recorded <span class="highlight">sound</span> has <span class="question6">overshadowed</span> the rich <span class="highlight">diversity</span> of <span class="highlight">technological</span> and <span class="highlight">aesthetic</span> experiments with the <span class="highlight">visual</span><span class="highlight">image</span> that were going <span class="highlight">forward</span> simultaneously in the 1920s. New color processes, larger or differently shaped <span class="highlight">screen</span> sizes, multiple-screen projections, <span class="highlight">even</span> television, were among the developments invented or tried out during the period, sometimes with <span class="highlight">startling</span> success. The high costs of converting to <span class="highlight">sound</span> and the early limitations of <span class="highlight">sound</span> technology were among the factors that suppressed innovations or retarded advancement in these other areas. The <span class="highlight">introduction</span> of new <span class="highlight">screen</span> formats was put off for a quarter <span class="highlight">century</span>, and color, though utilized over the next two decades for <span class="highlight">special</span> productions, also did not become a norm until the 1950s.</p><p><span class="question8">Though it may be difficult to imagine from a later <span class="highlight">perspective</span>, a <span class="highlight">strain</span> of <span class="highlight">critical</span> opinion in the 1920s predicted that <span class="highlight">sound</span><span class="highlight">film</span> would be a <span class="highlight">technical</span><span class="highlight">novelty</span> that would soon <span class="highlight">fade</span> from sight, just as had many <span class="highlight">previous</span> attempts, dating well back before the First World War, to link images with recorded <span class="highlight">sound</span>.</span> These critics were making a <span class="highlight">common</span><span class="highlight">assumption</span>-that the <span class="highlight">technological</span> inadequacies of earlier efforts (poor <span class="highlight">synchronization</span>, weak <span class="highlight">sound</span> amplification, <span class="highlight">fragile</span><span class="highlight">sound</span> recordings) would <span class="highlight">invariably</span><span class="highlight">occur</span> again. To be sure, their evaluation of the <span class="highlight">technical</span> flaws in 1920s <span class="highlight">sound</span> experiments was not so far off the mark, yet they <span class="question9">neglected</span> to take into <span class="highlight">account</span> important new forces in the <span class="highlight">motion</span> picture <span class="highlight">field</span> that, in a <span class="highlight">sense</span>, would not take no for an answer.</p><p>These forces were the rapidly expanding electronics and telecommunications companies that were developing and linking telephone and wireless technologies in the 1920s.
In the United States, they included such firms as American Telephone and <span class="highlight">Telegraph</span>, General Electric, and Westinghouse. They were interested in all forms of <span class="highlight">sound</span> technology and all <span class="highlight">potential</span> avenues for <span class="highlight">commercial</span><span class="highlight">exploitation</span>. Their competition and collaboration were creating the broadcasting <span class="highlight">industry</span> in the United States, beginning with the <span class="highlight">introduction</span> of <span class="highlight">commercial</span> radio programming in the early 1920s.  <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>With <span class="highlight">financial</span> assets <span class="highlight">considerably</span> greater than those in the <span class="highlight">motion</span> picture <span class="highlight">industry</span>, and perhaps a wider <span class="highlight">vision</span> of the relationships among 
entertainment and communications <span class="highlight">media</span>, they revitalized research into recording <span class="highlight">sound</span> for <span class="highlight">motion</span> pictures.</p><p><span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>In 1929 the United States <span class="highlight">motion</span> picture <span class="highlight">industry</span> released more than 300 <span class="highlight">sound</span> films-a <span class="highlight">rough</span><span class="highlight">figure</span>, 
 since a number were silent films with music tracks, or films prepared in dual versions, to take <span class="highlight">account</span> of the many cinemas not yet wired for <span class="highlight">sound</span>.
  <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>At the production <span class="highlight">level</span>, in the United States the <span class="highlight">conversion</span> was <span class="highlight">virtually</span> complete by 1930.  <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>In Europe it took a little longer, mainly because there were more small 
 producers for whom the costs of <span class="highlight">sound</span> were prohibitive, and in other parts of the world problems with rights or <span class="highlight">access</span> to equipment delayed the <span class="highlight">shift</span> to <span class="highlight">sound</span> production 
 for a few more years (though cinemas in <span class="highlight">major</span> cities may have been wired in order to play foreign <span class="highlight">sound</span> films). The <span class="highlight">triumph</span> of <span class="highlight">sound</span> cinema was <span class="highlight">swift</span>, complete, and enormously <span class="highlight">popular</span>.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">regarded</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. analyzed</p><p>B. considered</p><p>C. altered</p><p>D. criticized</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B regard: respect, regard, care. A is an analysis; B is considered, considered; C is a change; D is a criticism. So B's considerer considers it correct. This corresponds to Despite all the highly visible technological developments in the atrical and home delivery of the moving image that have occurred over the decades since then, no single innovation has come close to being regarded as a similar kind of watershed. Technological development, but nothing like watershed. The previous innovation and the following watershed are a class of words, so alter and criticize are wrong, and A's analysis analysis is totally unreliable.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 1, which of the following is the most significant development in the history of film?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The technological innovation of sound film during the 1920s</p><p>B. The development of a technology for translating films into other languages</p><p>C. The invention of a method for delivering movies to people's homes</p><p>D. The technological improvements allowing clearer images in films</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A uses the most significant development keyword. Although the original text does not, the first sentence has the same meaning as the most important transformation. Saying from silent film to sound film is the most important development, so A is correct, and no other answer is said.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question3">paradoxes</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. difficulties</p><p>B. accomplishments</p><p>C. parallels</p><p>D. contradictions</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" D"><p>D, paradox: contradictory, paradoxical, paradoxical. A is difficult; B is achievement; C is parallel, matchmaker. So the contradiction of D is correct. Corresponding to the original most fundamental standard of historical periodization, the basic standard conceals a paradox, and the latter sentence says that the silent period also had piano or other musical instruments that appeared together with the movie, which was not completely silent. Paradox should be a contradiction, A difficulty and B achievements are not related to the following explanation; silent film and instrumental accompaniment a voice a silent, not parallel parallel.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the author mention "Japanese benshi" and "original musical compositions"?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To suggest that audiences preferred other forms of entertainment to film before the transition to sound inthe1920's</p><p>B. To provide examples of some of the first sounds that were recorded for film</p><p>C. To indicate some ways in which sound accompanied film before the innovation of sound films in the late 1920s</p><p>D. To show how the use of sound in films changed during different historical periods</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The purpose of the function, first look at the sentence, said that the spectator will hear a lot of aural presentation, then said from this to that, that is, these two things are aural presentation, so the answer is C. A's other forms of entertainment, B's recorded and D's change did not say.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Paragraph 2 suggests which of the following about Eisenstein's film The Battleship Potemkirf?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The film was not accompanied by sound before its Berlin screening.</p><p>B. The film was unpopular in the Soviet Union before it was screened in Berlin.</p><p>C. Eisenstein's film was the first instance of collaboration between a director and a composer.</p><p>D. Eisenstein believed that the musical score in a film was as important as dialogue.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A With Einsenstein as the key word to the last sentence, it is said that in Berlin, the film director worked for the first time with a composer, so the answer is A. B did not say that the original only said Berlin's performance brought the international fame, did not say before unpopular; C's first collaboration did not say; D's as important did not say.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question6">overshadowed</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. distracted from</p><p>B. explained</p><p>C. conducted</p><p>D. coordinated with</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" A"><p>A overshadow: Shade and lose color. So distract troubled, so that distractions are correct. Over on ... shadow shadows cool. So the whole word is shaded.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 3, which of the following is NOT true of the technological and aesthetic experiments of the 1920's?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Because the costs of introducing recorded sound were low, it was the only innovation that was put to use in the 1920's.</p><p>B. The introduction of recorded sound prevented the development of other technological innovations in the 1920's.</p><p>C. The new technological and aesthetic developments of the 1920s included the use of color, new screen formats, and television.</p><p>D. Many of the innovations developed in the 1920s were not widely introduced until as late as the 1950's.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A EXCEPT questions, exclusion. A's cost is positioned to the penultimate sentence, but high and low are inverse, so A is wrong and selected; B's other technological innovation is positioned to the first sentence, correct, not selected; C's color and screen are positioned to the second sentence. , correct, not selected; D's 1950s positioning to the last sentence, correct, not selected.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It was difficult for some critics in the 1920s to imagine why the idea of sound film had faded from sight well before the First World War.</p><p>B. As surprising as it seems today, some critics in the 1920s believed that the new attempts at sound films would fade just as quickly as the attempts made before the First World War.</p><p>C. Though some early critics thought that sound film would fade, its popularity during the First World War proved that it was not simply a technical novelty.</p><p>D. Although some critics predicted well before the First World War that sound film would be an important technical innovation, it was not attempted until the 1920s.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The main logic of B original sentence is to compare adverbial clauses. The main body of the original sentence is the movie club, just like many previous attempts. A completely changed the original text, and put the difficulty together with the later criticism; B was correct; C placed the fade after the afterth, and the things after theth were contrary to the original meaning, so it was against; D was wrong, not Predicted before World War I.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question9">neglected</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. failed</p><p>B. needed</p><p>C. started</p><p>D. expected</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" A"><p>A neglect: Ignore. A is failure, B is need, C is the beginning, D is expecting. So A's fail is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, which of the following is true about the technical problems of early sound films?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Linking images with recorded sound was a larger obstacle than weak sound amplification or fragile sound recordings.</p><p>B. Sound films in the 1920s were unable to solve the technical flaws found in sound films before the First World War.</p><p>C. Technical inadequacies occurred less frequently in early sound films than critics suggested.</p><p>D. Critics assumed that it would be impossible to overcome the technical difficulties experienced with earlier sound films.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D Keywords as a technical problem, but there are technical inadequacies, synonymous with technical problem, reading the sentence, saying that these problems will affect again, that is, D can not say overcome, the other did not say.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>In paragraph 5, commercial radio programming is best described as the result of</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. a financially successful development that enabled large telecommunications firms to weaken their competition.</p><p>B. the desire of electronics and telecommunications companies to make sound technology profitable</p><p>C. a major development in the broadcasting industry that occurred before the 1920s</p><p>D. the cooperation between telecommunications companies and the motion picture industry</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B. Targeting commercial radio programming to the third sentence, saying that the cooperation and competition of these companies has created industry, D is a somewhat confusing option, attention is the link between the company, not the connection between the film industry and the company; Did not say that; B is correct, the company's competition and cooperation are to make money, so B's profitable is correct; A's weakening the competition did not say the original.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 6, which of the following accounts for the delay in the conversion to sound films in Europe?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. European producers often lacked knowledge about the necessary equipment for the transition to sound films.</p><p>B. Smaller European producers were often unable to afford to add sound to their films.</p><p>C. It was often difficult to wire older cinemas in the major cities to play sound films.</p><p>D. Smaller European producers believed that silent films with music accompaniment were aesthetically superior to sound films.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B, with Europe as the keyword to locate the penultimate sentence, the question asks why, then after the sentence is the answer, the cost of the sound film is too high for the small producer, so B is correct. A's lack knowledge of the original did not say; C language parenthesis that may have been wired, so C said anti; D did not say the original.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>When this research resulted in the development of vastly improved sound techniques, film studios became convinced of the importance of converting to sound..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B. It is sufficient to have a transition for this research. It means that there must be a study in front of it, but there is only one study in the original text, so A and B are possible, and the pronoun this indicates that research must precede, so A is excluded.</p></div></div><div id="question14" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>
The transition from silent to sound films was the most important development in film history.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.Although music and speech had frequently accompanied film presentations before the 1920s, there was a strong desire to add sound to the films themselves.</p><p>B.Because of intense interest in developing and introducing sound in film, the general use of other technological innovations being developed in the 1920s was delayed.</p><p>C.The rapid progress in sound technology made possible by the involvement of telecommunications companies transformed the motion picture industry.</p><p>D.Japanese filmmakers had developed the technology for creating sound films before directors in Europe and the United States began experimenting with sound.</p><p>E.Before the First World War, film directors showed little interest in linking images with recorded sound.</p><p>F.The arrival of sound film technology in the United States forced smaller producers in the motion picture industry out of business.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="ABC"><p>The A.B.C. option corresponds to the second paragraph of the original text, correct.
