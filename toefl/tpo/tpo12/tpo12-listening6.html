              <span class="time" data-times="5.17" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in an <span class="underline">environmental</span> science class. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="12.17" data-time="5.17">[00:05.17]</span>Professor: All right, folks, let's continue our discussion of <span class="underline">alternative</span> energy sources and move on to what's probably the most well-known <span class="underline">alternative</span> energy <span class="underline">source</span>, uh, <span class="underline">solar</span> energy. <span class="time" data-times="11" data-time="17.34">[00:17.34]</span>The Sun basically provides Earth with a <span class="underline">virtually</span> unlimited <span class="underline">source</span> of energy everyday but the problem has always been how do we tap this <span class="underline">source</span> of energy? <span class="time" data-times="5.1" data-time="28.34">[00:28.34]</span>Can anyone think of why it's so difficult to make use of <span class="underline">solar</span> energy? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.29" data-time="33.44">[00:33.44]</span>Student A: Because it is hard to gather it? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.72" data-time="36.73">[00:36.73]</span>Professor: That's exactly it! <span class="time" data-times="4.86" data-time="38.45">[00:38.45]</span> <span class="underline">Solar</span> energy is everywhere but it's also quite diffused. <span class="time" data-times="9.82" data-time="43.31">[00:43.31]</span>And the thing is the dream of <span class="underline">solar</span> energy is not a new one, humanities have been trying to use the Sun's light as a <span class="underline">reliable</span> <span class="underline">source</span> of energy for centuries. <span class="time" data-times="10.14" data-time="53.13">[00:53.13]</span>And, uh, around the beginning of the twentieth <span class="underline">century</span>, there were actually some <span class="underline">primitive</span> <span class="underline">solar</span> water heaters on the consumer <span class="underline">market</span>, but they didn't sell very well. <span class="time" data-times="2.1" data-time="63.27">[01:03.27]</span>Any of you want to guess why? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.37" data-time="65.37">[01:05.37]</span>Student A: Well, there were other energy choices like oil and natural gas, right? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.48" data-time="70.74">[01:10.74]</span>Professor: Yeah! And for better or for worse, we chose to go down that <span class="underline">path</span> as a society. <span class="time" data-times="4.02" data-time="77.22">[01:17.22]</span>When you <span class="underline">consider</span> <span class="underline">economic</span> factors, it's easy to see why. <span class="time" data-times="4.7" data-time="81.24">[01:21.24]</span>But then in the 1970s, there was an <span class="underline">interest</span> in <span class="underline">solar</span> energy again. <span class="time" data-times="2.12" data-time="85.94">[01:25.94]</span>Why do you think that happened? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.62" data-time="88.06">[01:28.06]</span>Student B: Because oil and natural gas were...err...became <span class="underline">scarce</span>? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.46" data-time="92.68">[01:32.68]</span>Professor: Well, not exactly. <span class="time" data-times="5.73" data-time="95.14">[01:35.14]</span>The <span class="underline">amount</span> of oil and natural gas in the Earth was still <span class="underline">plentiful</span>, but there were other reasons. <span class="time" data-times="4.93" data-time="100.87">[01:40.87]</span>Uh, it's a <span class="underline">political</span> thing really and I'm not <span class="underline">gonna</span> get into that now. <span class="time" data-times="8.2" data-time="105.8">[01:45.80]</span>So what happened in the 1970s was: oil and natural gas became very expensive very quickly. <span class="time" data-times="7.68" data-time="114">[01:54.00]</span>And that spurred people to start looking into <span class="underline">alternative</span> forms of energy, <span class="underline">solar</span> energy probably being the most <span class="underline">popular</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.3" data-time="121.68">[02:01.68]</span>But then in the 80s, this <span class="underline">trend</span> reversed itself when price of oil and natural gas went down. <span class="time" data-times="10.92" data-time="128.98">[02:08.98]</span>All right, let's <span class="underline">shift</span> our <span class="underline">focus</span> now to some of the technologies that have been invented to <span class="underline">overcome</span> the problem of gathering diffused <span class="underline">solar</span> energy. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="12.09" data-time="139.9">[02:19.90]</span>The most <span class="underline">basic</span> <span class="underline">solution</span> is <span class="underline">simply</span> to carefully place windows in a building so that the Sun shines into the building and then it's absorbed and <span class="underline">converted</span> into heat. <span class="time" data-times="4.07" data-time="151.99">[02:31.99]</span>Can anyone think of where this is most commonly used? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.51" data-time="156.06">[02:36.06]</span>Student A: Greenhouses. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.41" data-time="157.57">[02:37.57]</span>Professor: Yep, greenhouses where plants are kept warm and provided with sunlight because the walls of the building are made <span class="underline">entirely</span> of glass. <span class="time" data-times="12.38" data-time="166.98">[02:46.98]</span>But we do also have more <span class="underline">complex</span> systems that are used for <span class="underline">space</span> heating and they fall into two categories, <span class="underline">passive</span> and active heating systems. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.64" data-time="179.36">[02:59.36]</span>
              <span class="underline">Passive</span> systems take <span class="underline">advantage</span> of the location or design of a house. <span class="time" data-times="5.17" data-time="185">[03:05.00]</span>For example, <span class="underline">solar</span> energy is gathered <span class="underline">through</span> large glass panels facing the Sun. <span class="time" data-times="4.57" data-time="190.17">[03:10.17]</span>The heat is then stored in water-filled tanks or <span class="underline">concrete</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.69" data-time="194.74">[03:14.74]</span>No <span class="underline">mechanical</span> devices are used in <span class="underline">passive</span> heating systems. <span class="time" data-times="3.18" data-time="198.43">[03:18.43]</span>They <span class="underline">operate</span> with little or no <span class="underline">mechanical</span> <span class="underline">assistance</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="18.38" data-time="201.61">[03:21.61]</span>With active systems, on the other hand, you <span class="underline">collect</span> the <span class="underline">solar</span> energy at one location and then you use pumps and fans to move heat from the collectors <span class="underline">through</span> a plumbing system to a tank, where it can be used to heat a home or to just provide hot water. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.67" data-time="219.99">[03:39.99]</span>Student B: Excuse me, professor, but I've got to ask, "how can <span class="underline">solar</span> energy work at night or on cloudy days?" </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.84" data-time="226.66">[03:46.66]</span>Professor: That's, well, that is a really good question. <span class="time" data-times="12.2" data-time="231.5">[03:51.50]</span>As a matter of fact, science is still working on it, uh, trying to find ways in enhancing energy <span class="underline">storage</span> techniques, so that the coming of night or cloudy days really wouldn't matter. <span class="time" data-times="9.82" data-time="243.7">[04:03.70]</span>That is the biggest <span class="underline">drawback</span> of <span class="underline">solar</span> energy, the problem of what do you do in cases where the sun's light is weak or <span class="underline">virtually</span> non-present. <span class="time" data-times="6.53" data-time="253.52">[04:13.52]</span>So, the <span class="underline">storage</span> of <span class="underline">solar</span> energy, lots of <span class="underline">solar</span> energy is really an important <span class="underline">aspect</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.14" data-time="260.05">[04:20.05]</span>Student A: Does that mean that <span class="underline">solar</span> energy can only be used on a small <span class="underline">scale</span>, like heating a home? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.96" data-time="266.19">[04:26.19]</span>Professor: Well, actually, there have been some attempts to build <span class="underline">solar</span> energy power plants. <span class="time" data-times="5.7" data-time="271.15">[04:31.15]</span>The world's largest <span class="underline">solar</span> power plant is located in Kramer <span class="underline">Junction</span>, California. <span class="time" data-times="7.86" data-time="276.85">[04:36.85]</span>It can <span class="underline">generate</span> 194 megawatts of electric power, but that's just a <span class="underline">drop</span> in the bucket. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="284.71">[04:44.71]</span>Right now the <span class="underline">utility</span> companies are interested in increasing the <span class="underline">capacity</span> of their Kramer <span class="underline">Junction</span> plant, but only time will tell if it will ever develop into a <span class="underline">major</span> <span class="underline">source</span> of power for that <span class="underline">region</span>, considering the <span class="underline">economic</span> and <span class="underline">political</span> factors involved. </p>
