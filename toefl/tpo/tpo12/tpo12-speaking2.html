Others don't believe music education is important. Which view do you agree with? Explain why.</p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>I think it's essential for a person's education to learn to play a musical instrument. There are two reasons why I say so. First, learning to play a musical instrument can give a person a way to express emotion. For example, I have a sister who can play the piano. Every time she was happy or depressed, she'd play the piano. Second, learning to play a musical instrument makes a person artsy or develop a person's artistic talent. Artistic people are more sensitive than normal ones. They can feel something that others can't feel. They can sense the emotions from what normal people think is a normal scene. For example, Beethoven can compose his Moonlight at night. But I don't think anybody can make a moonlight at night.</p></article></div></main></body></html>
