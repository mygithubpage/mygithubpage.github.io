            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.58" data-time="4.87">[00:04.87]</span>Student: So Professor Tibets, your notes said that you want to see me about my heavy-weight paper. <span class="time" data-times="3.19" data-time="10.45">[00:10.45]</span>I have to say that grade wasn't what I was expecting. <span class="time" data-times="1.94" data-time="13.64">[00:13.64]</span>I thought I'd done a <span class="underline">pretty</span> good job.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.22" data-time="15.58">[00:15.58]</span>Professor: Oh, you did. <span class="time" data-times="4.29" data-time="16.8">[00:16.80]</span>But do you really want to <span class="underline">settle</span> for <span class="underline">pretty</span> good when you can do something very good?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.56" data-time="21.09">[00:21.09]</span>Student: You think it can be very good?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="0.86" data-time="22.65">[00:22.65]</span>Professor: <span class="underline">Absolutely</span>!</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.98" data-time="23.51">[00:23.51]</span>Student: Would that mean you'd...I could get a better grade?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.08" data-time="26.49">[00:26.49]</span>Professor: Oh, sorry! It's not for your grade. <span class="time" data-times="4.03" data-time="28.57">[00:28.57]</span>It's...I think you could learn a lot by revising it.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.09" data-time="32.6">[00:32.60]</span>Student: You mean, rewrite the whole thing? <span class="time" data-times="1.2" data-time="34.69">[00:34.69]</span>I really swamped. <span class="time" data-times="4.55" data-time="35.89">[00:35.89]</span>There're deadlines wherever I turn in and... and I don't really know how much time I could give it.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.81" data-time="40.44">[00:40.44]</span>Professor: Well, it is a busy time, with <span class="underline">spring</span> <span class="underline">break</span> coming up next week. <span class="time" data-times="1.67" data-time="44.25">[00:44.25]</span>It's your call. <span class="time" data-times="4.71" data-time="45.92">[00:45.92]</span>But I think that with a little <span class="underline">extra</span> effort, you could really turn this into a fine <span class="underline">essay</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.07" data-time="50.63">[00:50.63]</span>Student : No... yeah...I mean, after I read your comments, I...I can see how it tries to do too much.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.09" data-time="56.7">[00:56.70]</span>Professor: Yeah. It's just too <span class="underline">ambitious</span> for the <span class="underline">scope</span> of the <span class="underline">assignment</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.09" data-time="59.79">[00:59.79]</span>Student: So I should cut out the historical part?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.94" data-time="61.88">[01:01.88]</span>Professor: Yes. I would just <span class="underline">stick</span> to the topic. <span class="time" data-times="7.89" data-time="63.82">[01:03.82]</span>Anything unrelated to the use of nature <span class="underline">image</span> has no place in the paper, all that tangential <span class="underline">material</span> just <span class="underline">distraction</span> from the main <span class="underline">argument</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.71" data-time="71.71">[01:11.71]</span>Student: Yeah, I never know how much to include. <span class="time" data-times="1.71" data-time="73.42">[01:13.42]</span>You know...where to <span class="underline">draw</span> the <span class="underline">line</span>?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="0.92" data-time="75.13">[01:15.13]</span>Professor: Tell me about it! <span class="time" data-times="2.71" data-time="76.05">[01:16.05]</span>All writers struggle with that one. <span class="time" data-times="1.36" data-time="78.76">[01:18.76]</span>But it's something you can learn. <span class="time" data-times="2.56" data-time="80.12">[01:20.12]</span>That will become more <span class="underline">clear</span> with practice. <span class="time" data-times="2.37" data-time="82.68">[01:22.68]</span>But I think if you just cut out the...emm...</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.71" data-time="85.05">[01:25.05]</span>Student: The <span class="underline">stuff</span> about <span class="underline">history</span>, but if I cut out those sections, won't it be too short?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.07" data-time="89.76">[01:29.76]</span>Professor: Well, better a short well-structured paper than a long paper that's poorly-structured and wanders off topic.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.12" data-time="95.83">[01:35.83]</span>Student: So all I have to do is to leave those sections?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.92" data-time="98.95">[01:38.95]</span>Professor: Well, not so fast. <span class="time" data-times="6.15" data-time="100.87">[01:40.87]</span>After you cut out those sections, you'll have to go back and <span class="underline">revise</span> the rest, to see how it all fits together. <span class="time" data-times="6.48" data-time="107.02">[01:47.02]</span>And of <span class="underline">course</span>, you'll have to <span class="underline">revise</span> the <span class="underline">introduction</span> too, to accurately <span class="underline">describe</span> what you do in the body of the paper. <span class="time" data-times="1.83" data-time="113.5">[01:53.50]</span>But that shouldn't be too difficult. <span class="time" data-times="2.74" data-time="115.33">[01:55.33]</span>Just remember to keep the discussion focused. <span class="time" data-times="2.62" data-time="118.07">[01:58.07]</span>Do you think you can get it to me by noon tomorrow?</p>
            <p>

Do try! <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="126.69">[02:06.69]</span>But if you can't, well, <span class="underline">shoot</span> for after <span class="underline">spring</span> <span class="underline">break</span>, OK?</p>
