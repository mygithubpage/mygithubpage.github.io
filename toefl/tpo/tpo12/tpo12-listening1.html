To check on the man's progress on a paper he is writing</p><p>B. To show the man techniques for organizing his time</p><p>C. To encourage the man to revise a paper he wrote</p><p>D. To clarify her comments on a paper the man wrote</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>So Professor Tibbits, your notes said that you wanted to see me about my Hemingway paper.</p><p>The professor advised the classmate to change the article. "Oh, sorry! It's not for your grade. It's...I think you could learn a lot by revising it." A, B is irrelevant, and D is a bit disturbing, but the subject is still suggesting that the young man change the article.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the man hesitate before agreeing to the professor's request?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. He is not sure his effort would be successful.</p><p>B. He feels overwhelmed by all his schoolwork</p><p>C. He is unclear about what the professor wants his to do.</p><p>D. He does not like to work on more than one assignment at a time.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>You mean, rewrite the whole thing? I'm really swamped.

"There're deadlines wherever I turn and... and I don't really know how much time I could give it." "it is a busy time, with spring break coming up next week. It's your call." Embodies the difficulties of young men. The reason is that the holiday has to be handed over. AC is irrelevant and D interferes because it also says a lot of work, but the young man did not indicate that he did not like to do a lot of work at one time.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the professor's main criticism of the man's paper?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It included unnecessary information.</p><p>B. It did not include enough examples to illustrate the main point.</p><p>C. The main point was expressed too abstractly.</p><p>D. The paper ignored a key historical fact.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>No... yeah...I mean, after I read your comments, I...I can see how it tries to do</p><p>The professor stated that the students wanted to expand the scope of the article too much and it was too verbose. Therefore, it needed to be deleted. BC is irrelevant. D is negative. The professor asks young men to delete the historical data section.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor suggest that the student change the introduction of his paper?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To make it less repetitive</p><p>B. To more clearly state the man's point of view.</p><p>C. To correct spelling and grammar mistakes.</p><p>D. To reflect changes made elsewhere in the paper.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>"And of course, you'll have to revise the introduction too, to clearly describe what you do in the body of the paper. But that shouldn't be too difficult. Just remember to keep the discussion focused. One sentence explains the purpose of revise introduction. Focusing the paper is actually clearing the viewpoint of the paper, so the answer is B.</p></div></div><div class="replay" id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor mean when she says this:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. She understands the student's problem.</p><p>B. She wants the student to explain his comment.</p><p>C. She did not hear what the student said.</p><p>D. She does not accept the student's excuse.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>Tell me about it! All writers struggled without one. But it's something you can learn.</p><p>After listening to the student's question, the professor kindly put forward his own proposal, so she explained that she knew what the student had just said. C had nothing to do. Didn't say later that students should make comments, B has nothing to do. Nor does it mean that he does not accept his excuse, D has nothing to do.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
