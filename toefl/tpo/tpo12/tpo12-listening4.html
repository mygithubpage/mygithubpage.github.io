              <span class="time" data-times="6.4" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to a <span class="underline">conversation</span> between a student and a <span class="underline">Department</span> Secretary. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.13" data-time="6.4">[00:06.40]</span>Student: Hi. Miss Handricks. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.3" data-time="7.53">[00:07.53]</span>Secretary: Hi Bret, how are you? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.86" data-time="8.83">[00:08.83]</span>Student: I'm fine, except I have a question about my paycheck. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.21" data-time="11.69">[00:11.69]</span>Secretary: Sure. What' up? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.05" data-time="12.9">[00:12.90]</span>Student: Well, it's already been several weeks at the end of the <span class="underline">semester</span> and my <span class="underline">check</span> was supposed to go directly into my bank <span class="underline">account</span> but there <span class="underline">haven</span>'t been any deposits. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.15" data-time="20.95">[00:20.95]</span>Secretary: That's <span class="underline">odd</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.58" data-time="22.1">[00:22.10]</span>Student: Yeah, and I thought graduate teaching <span class="underline">assistant</span> will automatically put on the payroll at the beginning of the <span class="underline">semester</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.1" data-time="28.68">[00:28.68]</span>Secretary: They are. Let's see did you complete all the forms for the payroll? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.18" data-time="32.78">[00:32.78]</span>Student: I filled in whatever they sent me, and I returned like the end of August. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.48" data-time="36.96">[00:36.96]</span>Secretary: <span class="underline">Hum</span>, well, you <span class="underline">definitely</span> should have been paid by now. <span class="time" data-times="2.71" data-time="40.44">[00:40.44]</span>At <span class="underline">least</span> two <span class="underline">pay</span> periods have passed since then. </p>

              <span class="time" data-times="2.8" data-time="43.15">[00:43.15]</span>Student: I asked the bank and they didn't know anything. <span class="time" data-times="1.98" data-time="45.95">[00:45.95]</span>Who should I talk to about this, payroll? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.95" data-time="47.93">[00:47.93]</span>Secretary: I'm going to <span class="underline">contact</span> them for you. <span class="time" data-times="4.55" data-time="49.88">[00:49.88]</span>There was a problem in processing some of the graduate students' payroll paper work. <span class="time" data-times="4.48" data-time="54.43">[00:54.43]</span>'Cause their computer program crashed after all the information was processed. <span class="time" data-times="3" data-time="58.91">[00:58.91]</span>And some people's information couldn't be retrieved. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.49" data-time="61.91">[01:01.91]</span>Student: <span class="underline">Hum</span>. But why didn't any one let me know? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.23" data-time="66.4">[01:06.40]</span>Secretary: I don't know how they work over there, 'cause they couldn't <span class="underline">even</span> <span class="underline">figure</span> out whose information was missing. <span class="time" data-times="4.07" data-time="71.63">[01:11.63]</span>And this isn't the first time, seems like something like this happens every <span class="underline">semester</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.14" data-time="75.7">[01:15.70]</span>Student: So how do I find out if my information was lost? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.08" data-time="78.84">[01:18.84]</span>Secretary: I will <span class="underline">contact</span> them tomorrow morning to see if you're in the system. <span class="time" data-times="1.41" data-time="81.92">[01:21.92]</span>But you're probably not. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.04" data-time="83.33">[01:23.33]</span>Student: Well, then let me to do...? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.48" data-time="85.37">[01:25.37]</span>Secretary: Sorry, but you will need to fill out those forms again and then I will fax them over the payroll office. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.19" data-time="90.85">[01:30.85]</span>Student: And then what... Well, what I really need to know is how long till I get the money. <span class="time" data-times="3.49" data-time="95.04">[01:35.04]</span>I'm already a month behind my bills and my tuitions <span class="underline">due</span> soon. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.24" data-time="98.53">[01:38.53]</span>Secretary: They'll get you into the system the same day they receive your paper works. <span class="time" data-times="3.22" data-time="101.77">[01:41.77]</span>So if you do that tomorrow, you'll get paid next Friday. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.8" data-time="104.99">[01:44.99]</span>Student: That's a long time from now. <span class="time" data-times="2.4" data-time="106.79">[01:46.79]</span>Will that <span class="underline">pay</span> checking include all the money I am owed? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.14" data-time="109.19">[01:49.19]</span>Secretary: It should. I will double <span class="underline">check</span> with the payroll <span class="underline">department</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.3" data-time="112.33">[01:52.33]</span>Student: And another thing, Is there any way I could get paid sooner? <span class="time" data-times="2.09" data-time="115.63">[01:55.63]</span>I have been teaching all these weeks... </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.52" data-time="117.72">[01:57.72]</span>Secretary: I know that's not <span class="underline">fair</span> but I don't think they can do anything; all the checks are computed automatically in the system. <span class="time" data-times="2.25" data-time="124.24">[02:04.24]</span>They can't just write checks. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.08" data-time="126.49">[02:06.49]</span>Student: But they are the ones that have made mistakes. <span class="time" data-times="1.57" data-time="128.57">[02:08.57]</span>And they never told me! </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.97" data-time="130.14">[02:10.14]</span>Woman: I understand how you feel and if I were you, I'd be <span class="underline">upset</span> too. <span class="time" data-times="5.8" data-time="134.11">[02:14.11]</span>I'll tell you what: when I call them, I will explain the situation and ask them if there is any way you can be paid sooner. <span class="time" data-times="4" data-time="139.91">[02:19.91]</span>But I have to tell you that <span class="underline">base</span> on past experiences, you shouldn't <span class="underline">count</span> on it. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.34" data-time="143.91">[02:23.91]</span>Student: (Sigh) I understand, thanks. <span class="time" data-times="3.19" data-time="147.25">[02:27.25]</span>I know it's not your <span class="underline">fault</span> and that you're doing everything you can. </p>

              <span class="time" data-times="6.35" data-time="150.44">[02:30.44]</span>Secretary: Well, what I can do is: make sure that your first <span class="underline">check</span> is for total <span class="underline">amount</span> the university owes you. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="0.91000000000001" data-time="156.79">[02:36.79]</span>Student: That'll be great!
