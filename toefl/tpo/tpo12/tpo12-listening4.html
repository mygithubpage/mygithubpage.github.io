        <h3>Listening Text</h3>
        <article>
          <p>Narrator: Listen to a conversation between a student and a Department Secretary.</p>
          <p>:Student: Hi. Miss Handricks.</p>
          <p>:Secretary: Hi Bret, how are you?</p>
          <p>:Student: I'm fine, except I have a question about my paycheck.</p>
          <p>:Secretary: Sure. What' up?</p>
          <p>:Student: Well, it's already been several weeks at the end of the semester and my check was supposed to go directly into my bank account but there haven't been any deposits.</p>
          <p>:Secretary: That's odd.</p>
          <p>:Student: Yeah, and I thought graduate teaching assistant will automatically put on the payroll at the beginning of the semester.</p>
          <p>:Secretary: They are. Let's see did you complete all the forms for the payroll?</p>
          <p>:Student: I filled in whatever they sent me, and I returned like the end of August.</p>
          <p>:Secretary: Hum, well, you definitely should have been paid by now. At least two pay periods have passed since then.</p>
          <p>:Student: I asked the bank and they didn't know anything. Who should I talk to about this, payroll?</p>
          <p>:Secretary: I'm going to contact them for you. There was a problem in processing some of the graduate students' payroll paper work. 'Cause their computer program crashed after all the information was processed. And some people's information couldn't be retrieved.</p>
          <p>:Student: Hum. But why didn't any one let me know?</p>
          <p>:Secretary: I don't know how they work over there, 'cause they couldn't even figure out whose information was missing. And this isn't the first time, seems like something like this happens every semester.</p>
          <p>:Student: So how do I find out if my information was lost?</p>
          <p>:Secretary: I will contact them tomorrow morning to see if you're in the system. But you're probably not.</p>
          <p>:Student: Well, then let me to do...?</p>
          <p>:Secretary: Sorry, but you will need to fill out those forms again and then I will fax them over the payroll office.</p>
          <p>:Student: And then what... Well, what I really need to know is how long till I get the money. I'm already a month behind my bills and my tuitions due soon.</p>
          <p>:Secretary: They'll get you into the system the same day they receive your paper works. So if you do that tomorrow, you'll get paid next Friday.</p>
          <p>:Student: That's a long time from now. Will that pay checking include all the money I am owed?</p>
          <p>:Secretary: It should. I will double check with the payroll department.</p>
          <p>:Student: And another thing, Is there any way I could get paid sooner? I have been teaching all these weeks...</p>
          <p>:Secretary: I know that's not fair but I don't think they can do anything; all the checks are computed automatically in the system. They can't just write checks.</p>
          <p>:Student: But they are the ones that have made mistakes. And they never told me!</p>
          <p>:Woman: I understand how you feel and if I were you, I'd be upset too. I'll tell you what: when I call them, I will explain the situation and ask them if there is any way you can be paid sooner. But I have to tell you that base on past experiences, you shouldn't count on it.</p>
          <p>:Student: (Sigh) I understand, thanks. I know it's not your fault and that you're doing everything you can.</p>
          <p>:Secretary: Well, what I can do is: make sure that your first check is for total amount the university owes you.</p>
          <p>:Student: That'll be great! Thank you. I will be on campus about 10 tomorrow morning and I will come by to see you then. </p>
