              <span class="time" data-times="4.28" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in a music <span class="underline">history</span> class. <span class="time" data-times="2.85" data-time="4.28">[00:04.28]</span>The professor has been discussing Opera.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.36" data-time="7.13">[00:07.13]</span>Professor: The word opera means work, actually it means works. <span class="time" data-times="3.5" data-time="12.49">[00:12.49]</span>It's the plural of the word opus from the <span class="underline">Latin</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.59" data-time="15.99">[00:15.99]</span>And in Italian, it refers in general to works of art. <span class="time" data-times="7.42" data-time="20.58">[00:20.58]</span>Opera Lyric or Lyric Opera refers to what we think of as opera, the <span class="underline">musical</span> drama. <span class="time" data-times="7.58" data-time="28">[00:28.00]</span>Opera was <span class="underline">commonplace</span> in Italy for almost a thousand years before it became <span class="underline">commercial</span> as a <span class="underline">venture</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9.61" data-time="35.58">[00:35.58]</span>And during those years, several things happened, <span class="underline">primarily</span> <span class="underline">linguistic</span> or <span class="underline">thematic</span> and both involving <span class="underline">secularization</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.87" data-time="45.19">[00:45.19]</span>
              <span class="underline">Musical</span> drama started in the churches. <span class="time" data-times="3.19" data-time="48.06">[00:48.06]</span>It was an educational tool. <span class="time" data-times="12.12" data-time="51.25">[00:51.25]</span>It was used <span class="underline">primarily</span> as a <span class="underline">vehicle</span> for teaching <span class="underline">religion</span> and was generally presented in the <span class="underline">Latin</span>, the language of the Christian Church which had <span class="underline">considerable</span> influence in Italy at that time. <span class="time" data-times="11.76" data-time="63.37">[01:03.37]</span>But the language of everyday life was evolving in Europe and at a certain point in the middle ages, it was really only aristocrats,merchants, and <span class="underline">clergy</span> who can <span class="underline">deal</span> with <span class="underline">Latin</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.36" data-time="75.13">[01:15.13]</span>The <span class="underline">vast</span> <span class="underline">majority</span> of the <span class="underline">population</span> used their own regional <span class="underline">vernacular</span> in all aspects of their lives.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.77" data-time="83.49">[01:23.49]</span>And so, in what is now Italy, operas <span class="underline">quit</span> being presented in <span class="underline">Latin</span> and started being presented in Italian. <span class="time" data-times="6.74" data-time="93.26">[01:33.26]</span>]And once that happened, the themes of the opera presentations also started to change. <span class="time" data-times="6.32" data-time="100">[01:40.00]</span>And <span class="underline">musical</span> drama moved from the church to the plaza right outside the church. <span class="time" data-times="3.81" data-time="106.32">[01:46.32]</span>And the themes again, the themes changed. <span class="time" data-times="15.99" data-time="110.13">[01:50.13]</span>And opera was no longer about teaching <span class="underline">religion</span> as it was about <span class="underline">satire</span> and about expressing the ideas of society or <span class="underline">government</span> without committing yourself to writing and risking imprisonment or <span class="underline">persecution</span>, or what have you.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.61" data-time="126.12">[02:06.12]</span>Opera, as we think of it, is of <span class="underline">course</span> a resurrected form. <span class="time" data-times="15.42" data-time="131.73">[02:11.73]</span>It is the <span class="underline">melodious</span> drama of <span class="underline">ancient</span> Greek theater, the <span class="underline">term</span> '<span class="underline">melodious</span> drama' being shortened <span class="underline">eventually</span> to '<span class="underline">melodrama</span>' because operas frequently are <span class="underline">melodramatic</span>, not to say unrealistic. <span class="time" data-times="13.61" data-time="147.15">[02:27.15]</span>And the group that put the first operas together that we have today <span class="underline">even</span>, were, well...it was a group of men that included Galileo's father Vincenzo, and they met in Florence.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.71" data-time="160.76">[02:40.76]</span>He and a group of friends of the <span class="underline">Count</span> of Bardi and they formed what is called the Camerata de Bardi. <span class="time" data-times="5.41" data-time="167.47">[02:47.47]</span>And they took <span class="underline">classical</span> theater and reproduced it in the Renaissance's time. <span class="time" data-times="4.45" data-time="172.88">[02:52.88]</span>This...uh...this produced some of the operas that we have today.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.57" data-time="177.33">[02:57.33]</span>Now what happened in the following centuries is very simple. <span class="time" data-times="6.39" data-time="181.9">[03:01.90]</span>Opera originated in Italy but was not confined to Italy any more than the Italians were. <span class="time" data-times="11.02" data-time="188.29">[03:08.29]</span>And so as the Italians migrated <span class="underline">across</span> Europe, they carried theater with them and opera <span class="underline">specifically</span> because it was an Italian form. <span class="time" data-times="5.88" data-time="199.31">[03:19.31]</span>What happened is that the <span class="underline">major</span> divide in opera that endures today took place.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="11.39" data-time="205.19">[03:25.19]</span>The French said opera ought to <span class="underline">reflect</span> the <span class="underline">rhythm</span> and <span class="underline">cadence</span> of <span class="underline">dramatic</span> <span class="underline">literature</span>, bearing in <span class="underline">mind</span> that we are talking about the golden age in French <span class="underline">literature</span>. <span class="time" data-times="22.04" data-time="216.58">[03:36.58]</span>And so the music was secondary, if you will, to the <span class="underline">dramatic</span> <span class="underline">cadence</span> of language, to the way the <span class="underline">rhythm</span> of language was used to express feeling and used to add drama and of <span class="underline">course</span> as a result, <span class="underline">instead</span> of arias or solos, which would come to dominated Italian opera. <span class="time" data-times="8.94" data-time="238.62">[03:58.62]</span>The French relied on what the Italians called recitativo or <span class="underline">recitative</span> in English. <span class="time" data-times="6.05" data-time="247.56">[04:07.56]</span>The lyrics were spoken, frequently to the accompaniment of a <span class="underline">harpsichord</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="19.03" data-time="253.61">[04:13.61]</span>The French said you really cannot talk about real people who lived in opera and they relied on <span class="underline">mythology</span> to give them their characters and their plots, <span class="underline">mythology</span>, the past old traditions, the novels of <span class="underline">chivalry</span> or the epics of <span class="underline">chivalry</span> out of the middle Ages. <span class="time" data-times="16.1" data-time="272.64">[04:32.64]</span>The Italian said, "no, this is a great historical tool and what a better way to educate the public about Neo or Attalla or any number of people than to put them into a play they can see and listen to".</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.04" data-time="288.74">[04:48.74]</span>The English appropriated opera after the French. <span class="time" data-times="7.78" data-time="292.78">[04:52.78]</span>Opera came late to England because all theaters, public theaters were closed, of <span class="underline">course</span>, during their <span class="underline">civil</span> war. <span class="time" data-times="7.27" data-time="300.56">[05:00.56]</span>And it wasn't until the <span class="underline">restoration</span> in 1660 that public theaters again opened and opera took off. <span class="time" data-times="8.36" data-time="307.83">[05:07.83]</span>The English made a <span class="underline">major</span> <span class="underline">adjustment</span> to opera and exported what they had done to opera back to Italy. <span class="time" data-times="14.53" data-time="316.19">[05:16.19]</span>So that you have this circle of <span class="underline">musical</span> influences, the Italians invented opera, the French adapted it, the English adopted it, the Italians took it back.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.92" data-time="330.72">[05:30.72]</span>It came to America late and was considered too <span class="underline">elitist</span> for the general public. <span class="time" data-times="5.25" data-time="336.64">[05:36.64]</span>But Broadway musicals fulfilled a <span class="underline">similar</span> <span class="underline">function</span> for a great long while. <span class="time" data-times="10.66" data-time="341.89">[05:41.89]</span>John J. Chapman wrote about opera, <span class="underline">quote</span> "If an extraterrestrial being or two <span class="underline">appear</span> before us and say: What is your society like? <span class="time" data-times="2.66" data-time="352.55">[05:52.55]</span>What is this Earth thing all about? <span class="time" data-times="5.56" data-time="355.21">[05:55.21]</span>You could do worse than take that creature to an opera." End <span class="underline">quote</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="360.77">[06:00.77]</span>Because opera does, after all, begin with a man and a woman and an <span class="underline">emotion</span>.</p>
