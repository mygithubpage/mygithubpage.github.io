in a music <span class="highlight">history</span> class. <span class="time" data-times="2.85" data-time="4.28">[00:04.28]</span>The professor has been discussing Opera.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.36" data-time="7.13">[00:07.13]</span>Professor: The word opera means work, actually it means works. <span class="time" data-times="3.5" data-time="12.49">[00:12.49]</span>It's the plural of the word opus from the <span class="highlight">Latin</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.59" data-time="15.99">[00:15.99]</span>And in Italian, it refers in general to works of art. <span class="time" data-times="7.42" data-time="20.58">[00:20.58]</span>Opera Lyric or Lyric Opera refers to what we think of as opera, the <span class="highlight">musical</span> drama. <span class="time" data-times="7.58" data-time="28">[00:28.00]</span>Opera was <span class="highlight">commonplace</span> in Italy for almost a thousand years before it became <span class="highlight">commercial</span> as a <span class="highlight">venture</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9.61" data-time="35.58">[00:35.58]</span>And during those years, several things happened, <span class="highlight">primarily</span><span class="highlight">linguistic</span> or <span class="highlight">thematic</span> and both involving <span class="highlight">secularization</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.87" data-time="45.19">[00:45.19]</span><span class="highlight">Musical</span> drama started in the churches. <span class="time" data-times="3.19" data-time="48.06">[00:48.06]</span>It was an educational tool. <span class="time" data-times="12.12" data-time="51.25">[00:51.25]</span>It was used <span class="highlight">primarily</span> as a <span class="highlight">vehicle</span> for teaching <span class="highlight">religion</span> and was generally presented in the <span class="highlight">Latin</span>, the language of the Christian Church which had <span class="highlight">considerable</span> influence in Italy at that time. <span class="time" data-times="11.76" data-time="63.37">[01:03.37]</span>But the language of everyday life was evolving in Europe and at a certain point in the middle ages, it was really only aristocrats,merchants, and <span class="highlight">clergy</span> who can <span class="highlight">deal</span> with <span class="highlight">Latin</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.36" data-time="75.13">[01:15.13]</span>The <span class="highlight">vast</span><span class="highlight">majority</span> of the <span class="highlight">population</span> used their own regional <span class="highlight">vernacular</span> in all aspects of their lives.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="9.77" data-time="83.49">[01:23.49]</span>And so, in what is now Italy, operas <span class="highlight">quit</span> being presented in <span class="highlight">Latin</span> and started being presented in Italian. <span class="time" data-times="6.74" data-time="93.26">[01:33.26]</span>]And once that happened, the themes of the opera presentations also started to change. <span class="time" data-times="6.32" data-time="100">[01:40.00]</span>And <span class="highlight">musical</span> drama moved from the church to the plaza right outside the church. <span class="time" data-times="3.81" data-time="106.32">[01:46.32]</span>And the themes again, the themes changed. <span class="time" data-times="15.99" data-time="110.13">[01:50.13]</span>And opera was no longer about teaching <span class="highlight">religion</span> as it was about <span class="highlight">satire</span> and about expressing the ideas of society or <span class="highlight">government</span> without committing yourself to writing and risking imprisonment or <span class="highlight">persecution</span>, or what have you.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.61" data-time="126.12">[02:06.12]</span>Opera, as we think of it, is of <span class="highlight">course</span> a resurrected form. <span class="time" data-times="15.42" data-time="131.73">[02:11.73]</span>It is the <span class="highlight">melodious</span> drama of <span class="highlight">ancient</span> Greek theater, the <span class="highlight">term</span> '<span class="highlight">melodious</span> drama' being shortened <span class="highlight">eventually</span> to '<span class="highlight">melodrama</span>' because operas frequently are <span class="highlight">melodramatic</span>, not to say unrealistic. <span class="time" data-times="13.61" data-time="147.15">[02:27.15]</span>And the group that put the first operas together that we have today <span class="highlight">even</span>, were, well...it was a group of men that included Galileo's father Vincenzo, and they met in Florence.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.71" data-time="160.76">[02:40.76]</span>He and a group of friends of the <span class="highlight">Count</span> of Bardi and they formed what is called the Camerata de Bardi. <span class="time" data-times="5.41" data-time="167.47">[02:47.47]</span>And they took <span class="highlight">classical</span> theater and reproduced it in the Renaissance's time. <span class="time" data-times="4.45" data-time="172.88">[02:52.88]</span>This...uh...this produced some of the operas that we have today.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.57" data-time="177.33">[02:57.33]</span>Now what happened in the following centuries is very simple. <span class="time" data-times="6.39" data-time="181.9">[03:01.90]</span>Opera originated in Italy but was not confined to Italy any more than the Italians were. <span class="time" data-times="11.02" data-time="188.29">[03:08.29]</span>And so as the Italians migrated <span class="highlight">across</span> Europe, they carried theater with them and opera <span class="highlight">specifically</span> because it was an Italian form. <span class="time" data-times="5.88" data-time="199.31">[03:19.31]</span>What happened is that the <span class="highlight">major</span> divide in opera that endures today took place.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="11.39" data-time="205.19">[03:25.19]</span>The French said opera ought to <span class="highlight">reflect</span> the <span class="highlight">rhythm</span> and <span class="highlight">cadence</span> of <span class="highlight">dramatic</span><span class="highlight">literature</span>, bearing in <span class="highlight">mind</span> that we are talking about the golden age in French <span class="highlight">literature</span>. <span class="time" data-times="22.04" data-time="216.58">[03:36.58]</span>And so the music was secondary, if you will, to the <span class="highlight">dramatic</span><span class="highlight">cadence</span> of language, to the way the <span class="highlight">rhythm</span> of language was used to express feeling and used to add drama and of <span class="highlight">course</span> as a result, <span class="highlight">instead</span> of arias or solos, which would come to dominated Italian opera. <span class="time" data-times="8.94" data-time="238.62">[03:58.62]</span>The French relied on what the Italians called recitativo or <span class="highlight">recitative</span> in English. <span class="time" data-times="6.05" data-time="247.56">[04:07.56]</span>The lyrics were spoken, frequently to the accompaniment of a <span class="highlight">harpsichord</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="19.03" data-time="253.61">[04:13.61]</span>The French said you really cannot talk about real people who lived in opera and they relied on <span class="highlight">mythology</span> to give them their characters and their plots, <span class="highlight">mythology</span>, the past old traditions, the novels of <span class="highlight">chivalry</span> or the epics of <span class="highlight">chivalry</span> out of the middle Ages. <span class="time" data-times="16.1" data-time="272.64">[04:32.64]</span>The Italian said, "no, this is a great historical tool and what a better way to educate the public about Neo or Attalla or any number of people than to put them into a play they can see and listen to".</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.04" data-time="288.74">[04:48.74]</span>The English appropriated opera after the French. <span class="time" data-times="7.78" data-time="292.78">[04:52.78]</span>Opera came late to England because all theaters, public theaters were closed, of <span class="highlight">course</span>, during their <span class="highlight">civil</span> war. <span class="time" data-times="7.27" data-time="300.56">[05:00.56]</span>And it wasn't until the <span class="highlight">restoration</span> in 1660 that public theaters again opened and opera took off. <span class="time" data-times="8.36" data-time="307.83">[05:07.83]</span>The English made a <span class="highlight">major</span><span class="highlight">adjustment</span> to opera and exported what they had done to opera back to Italy. <span class="time" data-times="14.53" data-time="316.19">[05:16.19]</span>So that you have this circle of <span class="highlight">musical</span> influences, the Italians invented opera, the French adapted it, the English adopted it, the Italians took it back.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.92" data-time="330.72">[05:30.72]</span>It came to America late and was considered too <span class="highlight">elitist</span> for the general public. <span class="time" data-times="5.25" data-time="336.64">[05:36.64]</span>But Broadway musicals fulfilled a <span class="highlight">similar</span><span class="highlight">function</span> for a great long while. <span class="time" data-times="10.66" data-time="341.89">[05:41.89]</span>John J. Chapman wrote about opera, <span class="highlight">quote</span> "If an extraterrestrial being or two <span class="highlight">appear</span> before us and say: What is your society like? <span class="time" data-times="2.66" data-time="352.55">[05:52.55]</span>What is this Earth thing all about? <span class="time" data-times="5.56" data-time="355.21">[05:55.21]</span>You could do worse than take that creature to an opera." End <span class="highlight">quote</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="360.77">[06:00.77]</span>Because opera does, after all, begin with a man and a woman and an <span class="highlight">emotion</span>.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>What is the lecture mainly about?Click on 2 answers.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Some changes that took place in the early years of opera.</p><p>B. Difference between opera and other forms of music.</p><p>C. Italy's musical influence throughout Europe.</p><p>D. Reasons that early French and Italian opera did not survive.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="AC"><p>And during those years, several things happened, the first linguistic or thematic and both involving secularization. (A option)</p><p>  They carried theater with them and opera specifically because it was an Italian form. Then talk about the impact of Italian music on Europe (C option)</p><p>The full text is about the origin and evolution of the opera. At the beginning of the lecture, it mentioned that opera originated in Italy. Therefore, the process of the opera's spread in Europe is Italy's influence on Europe in music. Therefore AC is correct. The full text only discusses opera, so item B is wrong; the causes of the demise of early French and Italian operas were not mentioned in the listening material, so D is wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor, what happened after the Italian language replaced Latin in Italian opera?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Operas became much longer.</p><p>B. Operas begin to express secular ideas.</p><p>C. Music in opera became more complex.</p><p>D. Opera was used to teach technology to the general public.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>And opera was no longer about teaching religion as it was about satire and about expressing the ideas of society or government without committing yourself to writing and risking imprisonment or persecution, or what have you.</p><p>The secular meaning of the correct option is "secular." At the beginning of the lecture, it was mentioned that the early themes of the opera were all related to religion, but people used to communicate in Italian in their daily lives. Over time, the language of the opera became Italian, and the venue of the opera shifted from the church to the square. They are all ironic to the government and society, so B is correct. None of the other options are mentioned.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor mention ancient Greek theater?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

To point out a precursor of opera.</p><p>D. To explain how opera was introduced into French society.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Opera, as we think of it, is of course a resurrected form. It is the melodious drama of ancient Greek theater, the term 'melodious drama' being shortened eventually to 'melodrama' because operas frequently are melodramatic, not to say unrealistic.</p><p>The professor mentioned the ancient Greek opera house. In order to give the precursor of the opera, C is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor say about music in French opera?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It resembled sacred church music.</p><p>B. It often inspired French novelists to write great piece of literature.</p><p>C. It revolved mainly around solo pieces.</p><p>D. It was secondary to the rhythmic flow of language.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>And so the music was was secondary, if you will, to the dramatic cadence of language, to the way the rhythm of language was used to express feeling and used to add drama and of course as a result instead of arias or solos, which would come To dominate Italian opera.</p><p>The signal word so leads to a small conclusion: the French believe that the opera's lyrics are the most rhythmical, so music is the second most important. Option D is correct. None of the other options are mentioned.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor say this:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To show difference between English and Italian opera.</p><p>B. To give one instance in the evolution of opera.</p><p>C. To discuss the popularity of opera in England at the time.</p><p>D. To point out that English and Italian opera companies often worked together.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The English made a major adjustment to opera and exported what they had done to opera back to Italy.</p><p>So that you have this circle of musical influences, the Italians invented opera, the French adapted it, the English adopted it, the Italians took it back.</p><p>The British changed the opera and passed it back to Italy. This is part of the history of opera development, so the professor mentioned this part only to give an event in the history of opera development. AD is irrelevant, heavy listening does not mention the popularity of the opera, C is wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor imply when he says this:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

He thinks Chapman's questions are difficult to answer.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>John. J. Chapman wrote about opera, "If an extraterrestrial being or two appear before us and say, what is your society like, what is this Earth thing all about, you could do worse than take that creature to an opera." Opera does, after all, begin with a man and a woman and any motion.</p><p>The professor did not express any objections in the hard-of-heard sentence, or the evaluation of GC, so the answer was A.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
