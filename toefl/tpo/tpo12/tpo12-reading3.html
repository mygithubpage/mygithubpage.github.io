          <h4 class="w3-center">Water in the Desert</h4>
          <p>
            <span class="highlight">Rainfall</span> is not completely absent in <span class="highlight">desert</span> areas, but it is highly <span class="highlight">variable</span>. An <span class="highlight">annual</span> <span class="highlight">rainfall</span> of four inches is often used to <span class="highlight">define</span> the limits of a <span class="highlight">desert</span>. The <span class="highlight">impact</span> of <span class="highlight">rainfall</span> upon the surface water and <span class="highlight">groundwater</span> resources of the <span class="highlight">desert</span> is greatly influenced by landforms. Flats and depressions where water can <span class="highlight">collect</span> are <span class="highlight">common</span> features, but they make up only a small part of the <span class="highlight">landscape</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="highlight">Arid</span> lands, surprisingly, <span class="highlight">contain</span> some of the world's largest river systems, such as the Murray-Darling in Australia, the Rio Grande in North America, the Indus in Asia, and the Nile in Africa. These rivers and river systems are known as "exogenous" because their sources lie outside the <span class="highlight">arid</span> <span class="highlight">zone</span>. They are <span class="highlight">vital</span> for sustaining life in some of the driest parts of the world. For centuries, the <span class="highlight">annual</span> floods of the Nile, <span class="highlight">Tigris</span>, and <span class="highlight">Euphrates</span>, for example, have brought <span class="highlight">fertile</span> silts and water to the inhabitants of their <span class="highlight">lower</span> valleys. Today, river discharges are increasingly controlled by human intervention, creating a need for international river-basin agreements. The filling of the Ataturk and other dams in <span class="highlight">Turkey</span> has <span class="highlight"><span class="question2">drastically</span></span> reduced flows in the <span class="highlight">Euphrates</span>, with potentially serious consequences for Syria and Iraq.</p>
          <p>The flow of exogenous rivers varies with the <span class="highlight">season</span>. The <span class="highlight">desert</span> sections of long rivers <span class="highlight">respond</span> several months after rain has fallen outside the <span class="highlight">desert</span>, so that <span class="highlight">peak</span> flows may be in the dry <span class="highlight">season</span>. This is useful for <span class="highlight">irrigation</span>, but the high temperatures, low humidities, and different day lengths of the dry <span class="highlight">season</span>, compared to the normal growing <span class="highlight">season</span>, can present difficulties with some crops.</p>
          <p>Regularly flowing rivers and streams that <span class="highlight">originate</span> <span class="highlight">within</span> <span class="highlight">arid</span> lands are known as "endogenous." These are generally fed by <span class="highlight">groundwater</span> springs, and many <span class="highlight">issue</span> from <span class="highlight">limestone</span> massifs, such as the Atlas Mountains in Morocco. Basaltic rocks also support springs, <span class="highlight">notably</span> at the Jabal Al-Arab on the Jordan-Syria <span class="highlight">border</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>Endogenous rivers often do not <span class="highlight">reach</span> the sea but <span class="highlight">drain</span> into inland basins, where the water evaporates or is lost in the ground. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>Most <span class="highlight">desert</span> streambeds are <span class="highlight">normally</span> dry, but they occasionally receive large flows of water and <span class="highlight">sediment</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span></p>
          <p>Deserts <span class="highlight">contain</span> large amounts of <span class="highlight">groundwater</span> when compared to the amounts they hold in surface stores such as lakes and rivers. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>But only a small <span class="highlight">fraction</span> of <span class="highlight">groundwater</span> enters the hydrological <span class="highlight">cycle</span>-feeding the flows of streams, maintaining lake levels, and being recharged (or refilled) <span class="highlight">through</span> surface flows and rainwater. In recent years, <span class="highlight">groundwater</span> has become an increasingly important <span class="highlight">source</span> of freshwater for <span class="highlight">desert</span> <span class="question5">dwellers</span>. The United Nations Environment Program and the World Bank have funded attempts to <span class="highlight">survey</span> the <span class="highlight">groundwater</span> resources of <span class="highlight">arid</span> lands and to develop <span class="highlight">appropriate</span> extraction techniques. Such programs are much needed because in many <span class="highlight">arid</span> lands there is only a <span class="highlight">vague</span> idea of the <span class="highlight">extent</span> of <span class="highlight">groundwater</span> resources. It is known, however, that the <span class="highlight">distribution</span> of <span class="highlight">groundwater</span> is <span class="highlight">uneven</span>, and that much of it lies at great depths.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="highlight">Groundwater</span> is stored in the <span class="highlight">pore</span> spaces and joints of rocks and <span class="highlight">unconsolidated</span> (unsolidified) sediments or in the openings widened <span class="highlight">through</span> <span class="question7">fractures</span> and <span class="highlight">weathering</span>. The water-saturated rock or <span class="highlight">sediment</span> is known as an "aquifer". Because they are <span class="highlight">porous</span>, <span class="highlight">sedimentary</span> rocks, such as sandstones and conglomerates, are important <span class="highlight">potential</span> sources of <span class="highlight">groundwater</span>. Large quantities of water may also be stored in limestones when joints and cracks have been enlarged to form cavities. Most <span class="highlight">limestone</span> and sandstone aquifers are deep and <span class="highlight">extensive</span> but may <span class="highlight">contain</span> groundwaters that are not being recharged. Most <span class="highlight">shallow</span> aquifers in sand and <span class="highlight">gravel</span> deposits produce <span class="highlight">lower</span> yields, but they can be rapidly recharged. Some deep aquifers are known as "<span class="highlight">fossil</span> waters. The <span class="highlight">term</span> "fossil" describes water that has been present for several thousand years. These aquifers became saturated more than 10,000 years ago and are no longer being recharged.</p>
          <p>Water does not <span class="highlight">remain</span> <span class="question10">immobile</span> in an <span class="highlight">aquifer</span> but can <span class="highlight">seep</span> out at springs or <span class="highlight">leak</span> into other aquifers. The <span class="highlight">rate</span> of movement may be very slow: in the Indus <span class="highlight">plain</span>, the movement of saline (salty) groundwaters has still not reached <span class="highlight">equilibrium</span> after 70 years of being tapped. The <span class="highlight">mineral</span> <span class="highlight">content</span> of <span class="highlight">groundwater</span> <span class="highlight">normally</span> increases with the depth, but <span class="highlight">even</span> quite <span class="highlight">shallow</span> aquifers can be highly saline.</p>

              <p>B. You may need to read more articles using auifer keyword positioning, and use the exclusion method faster. A limestone keyword positioning to the fifth sentence, but this sentence does not say drink thing, so A wrong; B sand and gravel keyword positioning to the penultimate sentence, said the low production of sand and aquifer water , but it's easier to recharge. The first sentence says limestone and sandstone, which means that the high is the two, so B is correct, and C is anti- ; D of the sedimentary rocks do keyword positioning to the third sentence, should be able to store, options Say it wrong, wrong.</p>

At the beginning of the fifth paragraph, A's message said that the amount of water in the desert is greater than that of rivers and lakes, while rivers and lakes are the most common forms of water, but not the most, so A is correct; B is wrong, and the third paragraph of the original text Speaking of being able to irrigate, but did not say can not drink, wrong; C's rapid recharged and apparently the sixth paragraph of the fifth sentence is not recharge the contrary; D original did not say.</p>
