        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>There are so many people doubting on whether a broad knowledge of many academic subjects take the advantage of specializing in one specific subject.</p>
          <p>We have to realize the fact that the method of learning is more essential rather than the knowledge itself. As we are in the century full of knowledge and information, just absorbing knowledge is not as important as before. However, to learn the way of study requires some training in the subject and of course those who have broad knowledge of many academic aspects can learn more about different ways of learning in different subjects. When given a new task, they can easily solve it by using various methods he has learned, who takes a lot advantage from the learning experience.</p>
          <p>Moreover, the distinction among subjects becomes less clear. In fact, to solve the problem in a certain aspect may use knowledge in other aspects. Thus it leads us to cover more knowledge instead of just specializing in one specific subject. For instance, the subject of biochemistry requires the knowledge of chemistry as well as biology. The one having the background of the two subjects can absorb more and discovery more in doing researches, and have more chances of success.</p>
          <p>In fact, to see the famous scientists in the past, we'll find that most of them specialized in more than one subject. Aristotle, one of the most famous philosophies in ancient Greek, knew a lot about the knowledge in science and did researches on such things. As for Franklin, he discovered the electricity when having storm, and he also did well in his political career. From their experience we will learn that it's not the knowledge of a certain subject contributes to their success, instead, it's their way of thinking and the good personality traits lead to their achievement.</p>
          <p>As the saying goes that knowledge is power, we can draw the conclusion that more knowledge more power.  Anyway there is nothing wrong in learning new knowledge and perhaps one day it can be used in researches or inventions.</p>
