Can one <span class="highlight">trace</span> this same <span class="highlight">pattern</span> far back in prehistory?  <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>Much of the <span class="highlight">evidence</span> about right-hand <span class="highlight">versus</span> left-hand dominance comes from stencils and prints found in rock shelters in Australia and elsewhere,
and in many Ice Age caves in France, Spain, and Tasmania. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>When a left hand has been stenciled, this implies that the artist was right-handed, and vice versa.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span><span class="highlight">Even</span> though the paint was often sprayed on by mouth, one can <span class="highlight">assume</span> that the <span class="highlight">dominant</span> hand <span class="question1">assisted in</span> the operation. One also has to make the <span class="highlight">assumption</span> that
hands were stenciled palm <span class="highlight">downward</span>-a left hand stenciled palm upward might of <span class="highlight">course</span> look as if it were a right hand. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>Of 158 stencils in the French cave of Gargas,
136 have been identified as left, and only 22 as right; right-handedness was <span class="highlight">therefore</span> heavily <span class="highlight">predominant</span>.</p><p>Cave art furnishes other types of <span class="highlight">evidence</span> of this <span class="highlight">phenomenon</span>. <span class="question4">Most engravings, for example, are best lit from the left, as befits the work of right-handed artists, who generally <span class="highlight">prefer</span> to have the light <span class="highlight">source</span> on the left so that the shadow of their hand does not fall on the tip of the <span class="highlight">engraving</span> tool or <span class="highlight">brush</span>.</span> In the few cases where an Ice Age <span class="highlight">figure</span> is <span class="question3">depicted</span> holding something, it is mostly, though not always, in the right hand.</p><p>Clues to right-handedness can also be found by other methods. Right-handers <span class="highlight">tend</span> to have longer, stronger, and more <span class="highlight">muscular</span> bones on the right side, and Marcellin Boule as long ago as 1911 <span class="highlight">noted</span> the La Chapelle-aux-Saints Neanderthal <span class="highlight">skeleton</span> had a right upper arm bone that was noticeably stronger than the left. <span class="highlight">Similar</span> observations have been made on other Neanderthal skeletons such as La Ferrassie I and Neanderthal itself.</p><p>Fractures and other cut marks are another <span class="highlight">source</span> of <span class="highlight">evidence</span>. Right-handed soldiers <span class="highlight">tend</span> to be wounded on the left. The <span class="highlight">skeleton</span> of a 40- or 50-year-old Nabatean warrior, buried 2,000 years ago in the Negev <span class="highlight">Desert</span>, Israel, had <span class="highlight">multiple</span> healed fractures to the <span class="highlight">skull</span>, the left arm, and the ribs.</p><p>Tools themselves can be revealing. Long-handed <span class="highlight">Neolithic</span> spoons of yew wood preserved in Alpine villages dating to 3000 B.C. have survived; the signs of rubbing on their left side <span class="highlight">indicate</span> that their users were right-handed. The late Ice Age rope found in the French cave of Lascaux consists of fibers spiraling to the right, and was <span class="highlight">therefore</span> tressed by a righthander.</p><p>Occasionally one can <span class="highlight">determine</span> whether stone tools were used in the right hand or the left, and it is <span class="highlight">even</span> possible to <span class="highlight">assess</span> how far back this feature can be traced. In stone toolmaking experiments, Nick Toth, a right-hander, held the <span class="highlight">core</span> (the stone that would become the tool) in his left hand and the <span class="highlight">hammer</span> stone in his right. As the tool was made, the <span class="highlight">core</span> was rotated <span class="highlight">clockwise</span>, and the flakes, removed in <span class="highlight">sequence</span>, had a little <span class="highlight">crescent</span> of cortex (the <span class="highlight">core</span>'s outer surface) on the side. Toth's knapping produced 56 percent flakes with the cortex on the right, and 44 percent left-oriented flakes. A left-handed toolmaker would produce the <span class="highlight">opposite</span><span class="highlight">pattern</span>. Toth has applied these <span class="highlight"><span class="question10">criteria</span></span> to the similarly made <span class="highlight">pebble</span> tools from a number of early sites (before 1.5 million years) at Koobi Fora, Kenya, probably made by Homo habilis. At seven sites he found that 57 percent of the flakes were right-oriented, and 43 percent left, a <span class="highlight">pattern</span> almost <span class="highlight">identical</span> to that produced today.</p><p>About 90 percent of modern humans are right-handed: we are the only <span class="highlight">mammal</span> with a preferential use of one hand. The part of the brain <span class="highlight">responsible</span> for fine control and movement is located in the left <span class="highlight">cerebral</span><span class="highlight">hemisphere</span>, and the findings above suggest that the human brain was already <span class="highlight">asymmetrical</span> in its structure and <span class="highlight">function</span> not long after 2 million years ago. Among Neanderthalers of 70,000ï¿½35,000 years ago, Marcellin Boule <span class="highlight">noted</span> that the La Chapelle-aux-Saints <span class="highlight">individual</span> had a left <span class="highlight">hemisphere</span><span class="highlight">slightly</span> bigger than the right, and the same was found for brains of specimens from Neanderthal, Gibraltar, and La Quina.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The phrase "<span class="highlight">assisted in</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. initiated</p><p>B. dominated</p><p>C. helped with</p><p>D. set up</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="assisted in C"><p>Assist in help, so C's help with is the correct answer. The original sentence says that although the piant is usually sprayed on the mouth, the dominant hand does what it does and helps, so C is correct. A's initiale and D's set up all start. The meaning of the creation is similar to both, and it has nothing to do with the article. It's all wrong. B's domination is contrary to the article. There is already a dominant in front of it.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>It can be inferred from paragraph 1 that even when paint was sprayed by mouth to make a hand stencil</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. there was no way to tell which hand was stenciled</p><p>B. the stenciled hand was the weaker hand</p><p>C. the stenciled hand was the dominant hand</p><p>D. artists stenciled more images of the dominant hand than they did of the weak</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B uses mouth and hand stencil as the key words to locate the penultimate and third sentence, saying that dominant hand is helpful; the last sentence says that stenciled 136 is the left hand 22 is the right hand, through the specific figures that the right hand is more than the main hand, So B is the answer; note that B and C are a pair of opposite answers, so C is wrong, A says not to know which one is wrong; D doesn't say.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The phrase "<span class="highlight"><span class="question3">depicted</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. identified</p><p>B. revealed</p><p>C. pictured</p><p>D. imagined</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" C"><p>C, depict description, so the picture of C is correct, picture is known as noun picture, the verb is related to the meaning of the original noun, so it is a description. The original sentence says that in a few cases, the figure is holding something, imagination imagines it, and the original meaning is really holding something, so the imagine is not right; reveal and identify both mean nothing. wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Right-handed artists could more easily have avoided casting shadows on their work, because engravings in prehistoric caves were lit from the left.</p><p>B. The tips of engraving tools and brushes indicate that these instruments were used by right-handed artists whose work was lit from the left.</p><p>C. The best lighting for most engravings suggests that they were made by right-handed people trying to avoid the shadow of their hands interfering with their work.</p><p>D. Right-handed artists try to avoid having the brush they are using interfere with the light source.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The main meaning of the C sentence is that most of the best light for engraving is from the left, which is convenient for the right-handed artist, and the shadow of the hand will not cover the spire of the carving and brush. C corresponds to the original sentence and is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>All of the following are mentioned in paragraphs 1 and 2 as evidence of right-handedness in art and artists EXCEPT</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. the ideal source of lighting for most engravings</p><p>B. the fact that a left hand stenciled palm upward might look like a right hand</p><p>C. the prevalence of outlines of left hands</p><p>D. figures in prehistoric art holding objects with the right hand</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B EXCEPT questions, elimination method, A's engraving positioning keywords to the second sentence of the second paragraph, correct, not selected; B corresponds to the first paragraph of the third sentence, but this is not the reason for right-handedness, so this option is wrong, Select; C's prevalence and left hand position to the last sentence of the first paragraph, correct, not selected; D positioning to the last sentence of the second paragraph, correct, not selected.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 3, the La Chapelle-aux-Saints Neanderthal skeleton can be identified as right-handed because</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. other Neanderthal skeletons found nearby are also right-handed</p><p>B. the right arm bone is stronger than the left</p><p>C. it is similar to skeletons of La Ferrassie I and Neanderthal</p><p>D. the right side of the skeleton shows less evidence of fractures</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B. With La as the key word to the penultimate sentence, noticeably stronger, answer B is correct, both A and C are mentioned, but neither is the reason why La was identified as right-handedness, so no selection, D did not say.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the following statements about fractures and cut marks can be inferred from paragraph 4?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Fractures and cut marks caused by right-handed soldiers tend to occur on the right side of the injured party's body.</p><p>B. The right arm sustains more injuries because, as the dominant arm, it is used more actively.</p><p>C. In most people, the left side of the body is more vulnerable to injury since it is not defended effectively by the dominant arm.</p><p>D. Fractures and cut marks on fossil humans probably occurred after death.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C. Focus on the keywords and other cut marks to locate the first sentence, but the first sentence is too little. Look down and say that the right-handed soldier is injured on the left, so the correct answer is C. B said negatively, the left side is vulnerable; A and D did not say.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 5, what characteristic of a Neolithic spoon would imply that the spoon's owner was right-handed?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The direction of the fibers</p><p>B. Its long handle</p><p>C. The yew wood it is carved from</p><p>D. Wear on its left side</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D. Use Neolithic spoon as the key word to locate the second sentence. This sentence does not answer the question. The question asks what characteristics indicate right-handed. After looking at the answer, signs of rubbing, friction traces, the answer is wear. Note that wear has one meaning of friction.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>In paragraph 5, why does the author mention the Ice Age rope found in the French cave of Lascaux?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. As an example of an item on which the marks of wear imply that it was used by a right-handed person</p><p>B. Because tressing is an activity that is easier for a right-handed person than for a left-handed person</p><p>C. Because the cave of Lascaux is the site where researchers have found several prehistoric tools made for right-handed people</p><p>D. As an example of an item whose construction shows that it was right handed made by a right-person</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>Using Ice Age rope to keyword ending to the last sentence: The late Ice Age rope found in the French cave of Lascaux consists of fibers spiraling to the right, and was therefore tressed by a righthander. Says the rope is right-handed, indicating that it is a Right-handed people get the answer, so the answer is D, an example, the right-hander made out. Neither B nor C said that A said that rope was used by right-handed people. The original said that rope was compiled by right-handed people and contradicted the original.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question10">criteria</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. standards</p><p>B. findings</p><p>C. ideas</p><p>D. techniques</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" A"><p>A <span class="question10">criteria</span>: Standard. A is the standard; B is the discovery; C is the idea, the point of view; D is the technology. So the standard of A is correct. Corresponding to the original Toth has applied these <span class="question10">criteria</span> to the similarly made pebble tools from a number of early sites (before 1.5 million years) at Koobi Fora, Kenya, probably made by Homo habilis. The original sentence says that T applied these <span class="question10">criteria</span> to the gravel device, Because of this, in the past, the previous sentence said that the pattern of left-handed craftsmen doing things was contrary to TOTH's discovery. This sentence is not a finding nor a technique, so B and D are not right. As far as idea is wrong, only Rely on understanding words.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What was the purpose of Toth's toolmaking experiment described in paragraph 6?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To shape tools that could be used by either hand</p><p>B. To produce replicas of early tools for display in museums</p><p>C. To imitate the production of pebble tools from early sites</p><p>D. To determine which hand made the early tools</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D first find the experiment of toth in the second sentence of this paragraph, then read this sentence and found that the whole sentence is an example, and then look forward, that is, the first sentence of this paragraph, saying that sometimes it can be determined exactly The hand uses this tool, so T's example is to illustrate this, so the answer is D, to determine the early tool is the hand to do.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the author's primary purpose in paragraph 7?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To illustrate the importance of studying the brain</p><p>B. To demonstrate that human beings are the only mammal to desire fine control of movement</p><p>C. To contrast the functions of the two hemispheres of the brain</p><p>D. To demonstrate that right-hand preference has existed for a long time</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D, ask the purpose of the whole paragraph, find the central sentence, and see the first sentence of this paragraph. The first sentence states that human beings are the only animals with left and right lice. The last sentence says that this phenomenon existed long ago and could respond to option D. The others did not say.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The stencils of hands found in these shelters and caves allow us to draw conclusions about which hand was dominant..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B Three transition points, noun shelters, noun caves, and the prose these, according to shelters and caves determine that A or B is correct, but this means that the sentence to be inserted should be inserted after the sentence containing the two words, so the answer B is correct, A wrong .</p></div></div><div id="question14" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>

The answer said that the right-handedness was the characteristic of the three places. It was different. The Signs option corresponds to the second sentence of the third paragraph of the original text and the second paragraph of the fourth paragraph, correct. The Instruments option corresponds to the first sentence of the fifth paragraph of the original text, correct. The amount option corresponds to the first sentence of the sixth and seventh paragraphs of the original text, correct. The Neanderthal option is a detail in the third paragraph of the original text and is not selected. The Nick Toth option is a detail of the sixth paragraph of the original text, not selected.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
