            <b>Which Hand Did They Use?</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>We all know that many more people today are right-handed than left-handed. Can one <span class="underline">trace</span> this same <span class="underline">pattern</span> far back in prehistory?  <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>Much of the <span class="underline">evidence</span> about right-hand <span class="underline">versus</span> left-hand dominance comes from stencils and prints found in rock shelters in Australia and elsewhere, 
and in many Ice Age caves in France, Spain, and Tasmania. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>When a left hand has been stenciled, this implies that the artist was right-handed, and vice versa.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span> <span class="underline">Even</span> though the paint was often sprayed on by mouth, one can <span class="underline">assume</span> that the <span class="underline">dominant</span> hand <span class="light">assisted in</span> the operation. One also has to make the <span class="underline">assumption</span> that 
hands were stenciled palm <span class="underline">downward</span>-a left hand stenciled palm upward might of <span class="underline">course</span> look as if it were a right hand. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>Of 158 stencils in the French cave of Gargas, 
136 have been identified as left, and only 22 as right; right-handedness was <span class="underline">therefore</span> heavily <span class="underline">predominant</span>.</p>
          <p>Cave art furnishes other types of <span class="underline">evidence</span> of this <span class="underline">phenomenon</span>. Most engravings, for example, are best lit from the left, as befits the work of right-handed artists, who generally <span class="underline">prefer</span> to have the light <span class="underline">source</span> on the left so that the shadow of their hand does not fall on the tip of the <span class="underline">engraving</span> tool or <span class="underline">brush</span>. In the few cases where an Ice Age <span class="underline">figure</span> is depicted holding something, it is mostly, though not always, in the right hand.</p>
          <p>Clues to right-handedness can also be found by other methods. Right-handers <span class="underline">tend</span> to have longer, stronger, and more <span class="underline">muscular</span> bones on the right side, and Marcellin Boule as long ago as 1911 <span class="underline">noted</span> the La Chapelle-aux-Saints Neanderthal <span class="underline">skeleton</span> had a right upper arm bone that was noticeably stronger than the left. <span class="underline">Similar</span> observations have been made on other Neanderthal skeletons such as La Ferrassie I and Neanderthal itself.</p>
          <p>Fractures and other cut marks are another <span class="underline">source</span> of <span class="underline">evidence</span>. Right-handed soldiers <span class="underline">tend</span> to be wounded on the left. The <span class="underline">skeleton</span> of a 40- or 50-year-old Nabatean warrior, buried 2,000 years ago in the Negev <span class="underline">Desert</span>, Israel, had <span class="underline">multiple</span> healed fractures to the <span class="underline">skull</span>, the left arm, and the ribs.</p>
          <p>Tools themselves can be revealing. Long-handed <span class="underline">Neolithic</span> spoons of yew wood preserved in Alpine villages dating to 3000 B.C. have survived; the signs of rubbing on their left side <span class="underline">indicate</span> that their users were right-handed. The late Ice Age rope found in the French cave of Lascaux consists of fibers spiraling to the right, and was <span class="underline">therefore</span> tressed by a righthander.</p>
          <p>Occasionally one can <span class="underline">determine</span> whether stone tools were used in the right hand or the left, and it is <span class="underline">even</span> possible to <span class="underline">assess</span> how far back this feature can be traced. In stone toolmaking experiments, Nick Toth, a right-hander, held the <span class="underline">core</span> (the stone that would become the tool) in his left hand and the <span class="underline">hammer</span> stone in his right. As the tool was made, the <span class="underline">core</span> was rotated <span class="underline">clockwise</span>, and the flakes, removed in <span class="underline">sequence</span>, had a little <span class="underline">crescent</span> of cortex (the <span class="underline">core</span>'s outer surface) on the side. Toth's knapping produced 56 percent flakes with the cortex on the right, and 44 percent left-oriented flakes. A left-handed toolmaker would produce the <span class="underline">opposite</span> <span class="underline">pattern</span>. Toth has applied these <span class="underline">criteria</span> to the similarly made <span class="underline">pebble</span> tools from a number of early sites (before 1.5 million years) at Koobi Fora, Kenya, probably made by Homo habilis. At seven sites he found that 57 percent of the flakes were right-oriented, and 43 percent left, a <span class="underline">pattern</span> almost <span class="underline">identical</span> to that produced today.</p>
          <p>About 90 percent of modern humans are right-handed: we are the only <span class="underline">mammal</span> with a preferential use of one hand. The part of the brain <span class="underline">responsible</span> for fine control and movement is located in the left <span class="underline">cerebral</span> <span class="underline">hemisphere</span>, and the findings above suggest that the human brain was already <span class="underline">asymmetrical</span> in its structure and <span class="underline">function</span> not long after 2 million years ago. Among Neanderthalers of 70,000–35,000 years ago, Marcellin Boule <span class="underline">noted</span> that the La Chapelle-aux-Saints <span class="underline">individual</span> had a left <span class="underline">hemisphere</span> <span class="underline">slightly</span> bigger than the right, and the same was found for brains of specimens from Neanderthal, Gibraltar, and La Quina.</p>
