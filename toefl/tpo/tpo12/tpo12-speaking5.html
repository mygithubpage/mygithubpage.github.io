I won an award from the Pacific Journalism Institute for an article I submitted, and...</p><p>(man) Doesn't sound like anything's wrong.</p><p>(woman) Well, it's a huge honor to win and there's an award ceremony they've invited me to attend which I am super excited about. But, and here's what's frustrating, I've got a philosophy exam that scheduled to end right when the ceremony begins.</p><p>(man) Uh oh! You're saying you'll just be finishing up taking the exam right when the ceremony starts?</p><p>(woman) Exactly!</p><p>(man) But those ceremonies never start on time, they give long introductions, you know, after a general speech or something before they ever get to handing out awards. I'm sure they won't be ready to hand out your award right at the beginning. Just go when you're done with the test. You won't miss anything important.</p><p>(woman) Maybe,but that's a bit risky. I don't want to miss being there when they announce my name.</p><p>(man) Well, have you talked to you r professor about this?</p><p>(woman) Dr. Forester? No.</p><p>(man) Maybe she'll let you take the test some other time.</p><p>(woman) True. She lets people reschedule exams sometimes. But she always make them take it a couple of days early, that'll mean less studying time for me which I'm not thrilled about.</p><p>(man) Less time to study, Oh!</p><p>(woman) Like I said, I'm still struggling about what to do.</p></article></section><section id="question"><h4>Question</h4><p>The speakers discussed two possible solutions to the woman's problem. Briefly summarize the problem then state which of the solutions you recommend and explain why. </p></section><section id="sample-response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><article><p>Well, the woman's problem is that she hopes to attend an award ceremony but she has got her philosophy exam exactly before the ceremony. Accordingly, there are two solutions for the woman's problem: first she could try to finish her exam just before the ceremony and hurry to the ceremony just in time; the second solution is that she could talk to the professor to take the test some other time. In such a dilemma I guess she should talk to the professor to get the exam rescheduled and there are two reasons. Firstly, she could try harder studying for her exam exactly from now on, so even if the exam might be rescheduled ahead of time her preparation is even earlier. By studying harder she could get full preparation for both the exam and her attendance of the ceremony that day. Secondly, hurrying to the ceremony would be suffering for both her exam and attendance of ceremony; she could probably get both ruined. So I guess talking to the professor to get the exam time changed is a wiser choice. (186 words)</p></article></section></main></body></html>
