            <b>Begging by Nestlings</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>Many signals that animals make <span class="underline">seem</span> to <span class="light"><span class="underline">impose</span> on</span> the signalers costs that are overly damaging. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>A <span class="underline">classic</span> example is noisy begging by <span class="underline">nestling</span> songbirds when a parent returns to the
<span class="underline">nest</span> with food. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>These loud cheeps and peeps might give the location of the <span class="underline">nest</span> away to a listening <span class="underline">hawk</span> or raccoon, resulting in the death of the <span class="underline">defenseless</span> nestlings. 
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>In fact, when tapes of begging tree swallows were played at an <span class="underline">artificial</span> <span class="underline">swallow</span> <span class="underline">nest</span> containing an egg, the egg in that "noisy" <span class="underline">nest</span> was taken or destroyed by predators 
before the egg in a nearby quiet <span class="underline">nest</span> in 29 of 37 trials. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p>
          <p>Further <span class="underline">evidence</span> for the costs of begging comes from a study of differences in the begging calls of warbler <span class="underline">species</span> that <span class="underline">nest</span> on the ground <span class="underline">versus</span> those that <span class="underline">nest</span> in the <span class="underline">relative</span> safety of trees. The young of ground-nesting warblers produce begging cheeps of higher frequencies than do their tree-nesting relatives. These higher-frequency sounds do not travel as far, and so may better <span class="underline">conceal</span> the individuals producing them, who are especially <span class="underline">vulnerable</span> to predators in their ground nests. David Haskell created <span class="underline">artificial</span> nests with <span class="underline">clay</span> eggs and placed them on the ground beside a tape recorder that played the begging calls of either tree-nesting or of ground-nesting warblers. The eggs "advertised" by the tree-nesters' begging calls were found bitten <span class="underline">significantly</span> more often than the eggs <span class="underline">associated</span> with the ground-nesters' calls.</p>
          <p>The <span class="underline">hypothesis</span> that begging calls have evolved properties that reduce their <span class="underline">potential</span> for attracting predators yields a prediction: baby birds of <span class="underline">species</span> that experience high rates of <span class="underline">nest</span> <span class="underline">predation</span> should produce softer begging signals of higher <span class="underline">frequency</span> than nestlings of other <span class="underline">species</span> less often victimized by <span class="underline">nest</span> predators. This prediction was supported by <span class="underline">data</span> collected in one <span class="underline">survey</span> of 24 <span class="underline">species</span> from an Arizona forest, more <span class="underline">evidence</span> that <span class="underline">predator</span> <span class="underline">pressure</span> favors the <span class="underline">evolution</span> of begging calls that are hard to <span class="underline">detect</span> and <span class="underline">pinpoint</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="underline">Given</span> that predators can make it costly to beg for food, what <span class="underline">benefit</span> do begging nestlings <span class="underline">derive</span> from their communications? One possibility is that a noisy baby bird provides <span class="underline">accurate</span> signals of its real hunger and good health, making it <span class="underline">worthwhile</span> for the listening parent to give it food in a <span class="underline">nest</span> where several other <span class="underline">offspring</span> are usually <span class="underline">available</span> to be fed. If this <span class="underline">hypothesis</span> is true, then it follows that nestlings should <span class="underline">adjust</span> the intensity of their signals in relation to the signals produced by their nestmates, who are <span class="underline">competing</span> for parental <span class="underline">attention</span>. When experimentally deprived baby robins are placed in a <span class="underline">nest</span> with <span class="underline">normally</span> fed siblings, the hungry nestlings beg more loudly than usual-but so do their better-fed siblings, though not as loudly as the hungrier birds.</p>
          <p>If parent birds use begging intensity to direct food to healthy <span class="underline">offspring</span> <span class="underline">capable</span> of <span class="underline">vigorous</span> begging, then parents should make food delivery decisions on the basis of their offsprings' calls. Indeed, if you take baby tree swallows out of a <span class="underline">nest</span> for an hour feeding half the set and starving the other half, when the birds are replaced in the <span class="underline">nest</span>, the starved youngsters beg more loudly than the fed birds, and the parent birds feed the active beggars more than those who beg less vigorously.</p>
          <p>As these experiments show, begging apparently provides a <span class="underline">signal</span> of need that parents use to make judgments about which <span class="underline">offspring</span> can <span class="underline">benefit</span> most from a feeding. But the question arises, why don't nestlings beg loudly when they aren't all that hungry? By doing so, they could possibly <span class="underline">secure</span> more food, which should result in more rapid growth or larger size, either of which is <span class="underline">advantageous</span>. The answer lies apparently not in the increased energy costs of exaggerated begging-such energy costs are small <span class="underline">relative</span> to the <span class="underline">potential</span> gain in calories-but rather in the damage that any successful cheater would do to its siblings, which share genes with one another. An individual's success in propagating his or her genes can be affected by more than just his or her own <span class="underline">personal</span> <span class="underline">reproductive</span> success. Because close relatives have many of the same genes, animals that harm their close relatives may in effect be destroying some of their own genes. <span class="underline">Therefore</span>, a begging <span class="underline">nestling</span> that secures food at the expense of its siblings might actually leave behind fewer copies of its genes <span class="underline">overall</span> than it might <span class="underline">otherwise</span>.</p>
