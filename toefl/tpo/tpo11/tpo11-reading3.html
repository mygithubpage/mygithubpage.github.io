<span class="highlight">nest</span> with food. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>These loud cheeps and peeps might give the location of the <span class="highlight">nest</span> away to a listening <span class="highlight">hawk</span> or raccoon, resulting in the death of the <span class="highlight">defenseless</span> nestlings. 
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>In fact, when tapes of begging tree swallows were played at an <span class="highlight">artificial</span><span class="highlight">swallow</span><span class="highlight">nest</span> containing an egg, the egg in that "noisy" <span class="highlight">nest</span> was taken or destroyed by predators 
before the egg in a nearby quiet <span class="highlight">nest</span> in 29 of 37 trials. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p><p>Further <span class="highlight">evidence</span> for the costs of begging comes from a study of differences in the begging calls of warbler <span class="highlight">species</span> that <span class="highlight">nest</span> on the ground <span class="highlight">versus</span> those that <span class="highlight">nest</span> in the <span class="highlight">relative</span> safety of trees. The young of ground-nesting warblers produce begging cheeps of higher frequencies than do their tree-nesting relatives. These higher-frequency sounds do not travel as far, and so may better <span class="highlight">conceal</span> the individuals producing them, who are especially <span class="highlight">vulnerable</span> to predators in their ground nests. David Haskell created <span class="highlight"><span class="question3">artificial</span></span> nests with <span class="highlight">clay</span> eggs and placed them on the ground beside a tape recorder that played the begging calls of either tree-nesting or of ground-nesting warblers. The eggs "advertised" by the tree-nesters' begging calls were found bitten <span class="highlight">significantly</span> more often than the eggs <span class="highlight">associated</span> with the ground-nesters' calls.</p><p>The <span class="highlight">hypothesis</span> that begging calls have evolved properties that reduce their <span class="highlight">potential</span> for attracting predators yields a <span class="question6">prediction</span>: baby birds of <span class="highlight">species</span> that experience high rates of <span class="highlight">nest</span><span class="highlight">predation</span> should produce softer begging signals of higher <span class="highlight">frequency</span> than nestlings of other <span class="highlight">species</span> less often victimized by <span class="highlight">nest</span> predators. This prediction was supported by <span class="highlight">data</span> collected in one <span class="highlight">survey</span> of 24 <span class="highlight">species</span> from an Arizona forest, more <span class="highlight">evidence</span> that <span class="highlight">predator</span><span class="highlight">pressure</span> favors the <span class="highlight">evolution</span> of begging calls that are hard to <span class="highlight">detect</span> and <span class="highlight"><span class="question7">pinpoint</span></span>.</p><p><span class="highlight">Given</span> that predators can make it costly to beg for food, what <span class="highlight">benefit</span> do begging nestlings <span class="highlight"><span class="question8">derive</span></span> from their communications? One possibility is that a noisy baby bird provides <span class="highlight">accurate</span> signals of its real hunger and good health, making it <span class="highlight">worthwhile</span> for the listening parent to give it food in a <span class="highlight">nest</span> where several other <span class="highlight">offspring</span> are usually <span class="highlight">available</span> to be fed. If this <span class="highlight">hypothesis</span> is true, then it follows that nestlings should <span class="highlight">adjust</span> the intensity of their signals in relation to the signals produced by their nestmates, who are <span class="highlight">competing</span> for parental <span class="highlight">attention</span>. When experimentally deprived baby robins are placed in a <span class="highlight">nest</span> with <span class="highlight">normally</span> fed siblings, the hungry nestlings beg more loudly than usual-but so do their better-fed siblings, though not as loudly as the hungrier birds.</p><p>If parent birds use begging intensity to direct food to healthy <span class="highlight">offspring</span><span class="highlight">capable</span> of <span class="highlight">vigorous</span> begging, then parents should make food delivery decisions on the basis of their offsprings' calls. Indeed, if you take baby tree swallows out of a <span class="highlight">nest</span> for an hour feeding half the set and starving the other half, when the birds are replaced in the <span class="highlight">nest</span>, the starved youngsters beg more loudly than the fed birds, and the parent birds feed the active beggars more than those who beg less vigorously.</p><p>As these experiments show, begging apparently provides a <span class="highlight">signal</span> of need that parents use to make judgments about which <span class="highlight">offspring</span> can <span class="highlight">benefit</span> most from a feeding. But the question arises, why don't nestlings beg loudly when they aren't all that hungry? By doing so, they could possibly <span class="highlight">secure</span> more food, which should result in more rapid growth or larger size, either of which is <span class="highlight">advantageous</span>. The answer lies apparently not in the increased energy costs of exaggerated begging-such energy costs are small <span class="highlight">relative</span> to the <span class="highlight">potential</span> gain in calories-but rather in the damage that any successful cheater would do to its siblings, which share genes with one another. An individual's success in propagating his or her genes can be affected by more than just his or her own <span class="highlight">personal</span><span class="highlight">reproductive</span> success. Because close relatives have many of the same genes, animals that harm their close relatives may in effect be destroying some of their own genes. <span class="highlight">Therefore</span>, a begging <span class="highlight">nestling</span> that secures food at the expense of its siblings might actually leave behind fewer copies of its genes <span class="highlight">overall</span> than it might <span class="highlight">otherwise</span>.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The phrase "<span class="highlight">impose on</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. increase for</p><p>B. remove from</p><p>C. place on</p><p>D. distribute to</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="impose on C"><p>C impose on: exert influence on, force. A is for ... increase; B is removed from ... C is imposed on ... D is assigned to. So the answer placed on the answer is the correct answer. The first thing is to look at impose itself, im indicates what is within, and pose means to put it, so it is put in what is inside and can be guessed and put. Meaning, so place is reliable. The original sentence says how the signal sent by the animal signals the animal, and A adds B and moves D to the animal.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 1, the experiment with tapes of begging tree swallows establishes which of the following?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Begging by nestling birds can attract the attention of predators to the nest.</p><p>B. Nest predators attack nests that contain nestlings more frequently than they attack nests that contain only eggs.</p><p>C. Tapes of begging nestlings attract predators to the nest less frequently than real begging calls do.</p><p>D. Nest predators have no other means of locating bird nests except the begging calls of nestling birds.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A. Use the tapes of begging tree swallows as the key word to locate the last sentence. However, this only means that the nest who put the tape will suffer more attacks. It doesn't say why. Looking forward, the sentence says that cheeps leaked information to the predator. The bird nest was attacked, and then the example of the tape was given. It simply means that cheeps attracted the attack, so A was correct. The two original comparisons of B and C did not say, and D did not say anything else.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">artificial</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. attractive</p><p>B. not real</p><p>C. short-term</p><p>D. well designed</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Well designed" "artificial: Man-made, artificial, false. A is attractive; B is unreal; C is short-term; D is well-designed. So the answer is not real. The original text says that this man has made a artificial nests with clay eggs and placed them on the ground beside a tape recorder that played the begging calls of either tree-nesting or of ground-nesting warblers. The sentence says that the young bird is vulnerable to attack in the ground nest, and then immediately said to have made a nest. The latter part of the sentence says that there was a recording playing sound next to it, so it must be false. The ACD does not touch the edge.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Paragraph 2 indicates that the begging calls of tree nesting warblers</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. put them at more risk than ground-nesting warblers experience</p><p>B. can be heard from a greater distance than those of ground-nesting warblers</p><p>C. are more likely to conceal the signaler than those of ground-nesting warblers</p><p>D. have higher frequencies than those of ground-nesting warblers</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B This is a difficult topic. You need to read more because the keyword tree-nestling warblers appears multiple times. The second half said David's experiment, so it's only a fact. Looking forward, you see the second and third sentences saying that the sound of ground-nestling birds is high-frequency, not far-flung, and tree-nestling On the contrary, answer B spread farther and rightly. C and D clearly say the opposite; B and C are opposite answers. A is confusing, the original text only said that in the experiment the nest eggs of the tree nestling were bitten badly, and if they did not say tree, they would be more dangerous than the ground.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The experiment described in paragraph 2 supports which of the following conclusions?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Predators are unable to distinguish between the begging cheeps of ground-nesting and those of tree-nesting warblers except by the differing frequencies of the calls.</p><p>B. When they can find them, predators prefer the eggs of tree-nesting warblers to those of ground-nesting warblers.</p><p>C. The higher frequencies of the begging cheeps of ground-nesting warblers are an adaptation to the threat that ground-nesting birds face from predators.</p><p>D. The danger of begging depends more on the frequency of the begging cheep than on how loud it is.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C exclusion, there is no corresponding A option original text, the original did not say what method except frequency; no B corresponding to the original, did not say which predator prefer; C option is correct, corresponding to the second sentence and the third sentence of the original; D option No correspondence.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">prediction</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. surprise</p><p>B. discovery</p><p>C. explanation</p><p>D. expectation</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D predict: forecast, forecast, forecast. A is surprised; B is found; C is explanation; D is expected. So D's expectation is correct. Before what was pre, dict said, it was prediction. Corresponding to the original hypothesis that begging calls have evolved properties that reduce their potential for attracting predators yields a <span class="question6">prediction</span>: ... the original hypothesis (hypothesis) produces what, the colon is followed by the interpretation, assuming that what is produced is certainly not realized, Both discovery and interpretation are incorrect. Surprise more expresses subjective emotions and does not choose.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question7">pinpoint</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. observe</p><p>B. locate exactly</p><p>C. copy accurately</p><p>D. recognize</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>B <span class="question7">pinpoint</span>: Find it exactly, aim it. A is observation; B is accurate positioning; C is accurate copy; D is cognitive. So B's locate exactly is correct. Pin pins, point points, and pin points are certainly accurate.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question8">derive</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. require</p><p>B. gain</p><p>C. use</p><p>D. produce</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>B <span class="question8">derive</span>: Get, get. A is a requirement; B is obtained; C is used; D is manufactured. So B's gain is correct. Corresponding to original Given that predators can make it costly to beg for food, what benefit do begging nestlings <span class="question8">derive</span> from their communications? The original sentence says: Since begging is very dangerous, what benefit can birds <span class="question8">derive</span> from begging? Immediately after the answer is given, that is, noisy bird has food to eat, and the second is blabla, which is what the bird can get from begging, so Derive get, require use and production are not right.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>In paragraphs 4 and 5, what evidence supports the claim that the intensity of nestling begging calls is a good indicator of which offspring in a nest would most benefit from a feeding?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. When placed in a nest with hungry robins, well-fed robins did not beg for food.</p><p>B. Among robin nestlings, the intensity of begging decreased the more the nestlings were fed.</p><p>C. Hungry tree swallow nestlings begged louder than well-fed nestlings in the same nest.</p><p>D. Hungry tree swallow nestlings continued to beg loudly until they were fed whereas well-fed nestlings soon stopped begging.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C exclusion. A's robins do the keyword positioning to the last sentence of the fourth paragraph. The original said that even the well-fed birds are called, but the only ones are not powerful, so C is correct, A says anti-; the same sentence can be obtained by B. Didn't say that the more birds they feed, the more they don't call; D's whereas was right before, but the original didn't say well-fed soon and didn't call, it should be continuing to call.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>It can be inferred from paragraphs 4 and 5 that parent songbirds normally do not feed</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. nestlings that are too weak to beg for food as vigorously as their nestmates</p><p>B. more than one hungry nestling during a single visit to the nest</p><p>C. offspring that were fed by the parents on the previous visit to the nest</p><p>D. nestlings that have been removed and then later put back into their nest</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A Following the previous question, you can know from the previous question that the more intense you are called, the easier it is to feed, so you can quit. If you call too weak, you will not be fed, corresponding to the A option.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>In paragraph 6, the author compares the energy costs of vigorous begging with the potential gain in calories from such begging in order to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. explain why begging for food vigorously can lead to faster growth and increased size</p><p>B. explain how begging vigorously can increase an individual's chance of propagating its own genes</p><p>C. point out a weakness in a possible explanation for why nestlings do not always beg vigorously</p><p>D. argue that the benefits of vigorous begging outweigh any possible disadvantages</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C. First of all, according to the comparison in the question to the fourth sentence, saying that such energy costs are small relative to the potential gain in calories, first read the sentence, and that this kind of exaggerated begging will cause harm to other siblings. Injuries to the entire group, so the answer is C, giving a bird exaggerated begging shortcomings. A said but not the purpose; B did not say D said anti.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 6, which of the following explains the fact that a well-fed nestling does not beg loudly for more food?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. There is no benefit for a nestling to get more food than it needs to survive.</p><p>B. By begging loudly for food it does not need, a nestling would unnecessarily expose itself to danger from predators.</p><p>C. If a nestling begs loudly when it is not truly hungry, then when it is truly hungry its own begging may be drowned out by that of its well-fed siblings.</p><p>D. More of a nestling's genes will be passed to the next generation if its hungry siblings get enough food to survive.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D. Read from the fourth sentence of the previous question, saying that it will hurt sibling, and then that there are many common genes in the same species. Injury to siblings means that the genes of the entire species are harmed, so D is correct. Did not say anything else.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The cheeping provides important information to the parent, but it could also attract the attention of others..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B Three transition points, namely the noun cheeping, the parent, and the pronouns others, can be judged according to the cheeping that B or C is correct; the parent can conclude that A or B is correct, so the correct answer is B, and the others and the following listening hawk or raccoon correspond exactly. ; In addition, the cheeps after point B just refers to the cheeping of the sentence to be inserted.</p></div></div><div id="question14" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>Experiments have shed much light on the begging behaviors of baby songbirds.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.Songbird species that are especially vulnerable to predators have evolved ways of reducing the dangers associated with begging calls.</p><p>B.Songbird parents focus their feeding effort on the nestlings that beg loudest for food.</p><p>C.It is genetically disadvantageous for nestlings to behave as if they are really hungry when they are not really hungry.</p><p>D.The begging calls of songbird nestlings provide a good example of overly damaging cost to signalers of signaling.</p><p>E.The success with which songbird nestlings communicate their hunger to their parents is dependent on the frequencies of the nestlings' begging calls.</p><p>F.Songbird nestlings have evolved several different ways to communicate the intensity of their hunger to their parents.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="ABC"><p>The Songbird species option corresponds to the third sentence of the second paragraph of the original text. Note that the first sentence of this paragraph is not the center sentence. The entire paragraph is talking about the comparison between the two birds, so the A option is correct. The Songbird parents option corresponds to the second sentence of the fourth paragraph of the original text. B is correct. The It is option corresponds to the second half of the sixth paragraph. C is correct. The original begging option did not say, D is not selected. The original option did not say the original, E does not choose. Songbird nestlings option did not say the original, F not selected.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
