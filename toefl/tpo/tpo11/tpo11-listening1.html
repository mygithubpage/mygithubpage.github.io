Thanks. </p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What are the speakers mainly discussing?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. What the gym pass is used for.</p><p>B. How to try out for the swimming team.</p><p>C. The popularity of the new exercise at the gym.</p><p>D. The schedule of exercise classes at the gym.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>At the beginning, the students explained their intentions, indicating that the entire conversation was about a gym pass. Afterwards, the students expressed the thought that the university gym participated in the swimming class and thought that there was a pass to attend the class. Then the later dialogue centered around the employee explaining to students the role of pass. . B C D can be excluded.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the woman's initial excitement turn to disappointment?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. She is told that all swimming classes are full.</p><p>B. She learns that she will have to pay extra for classes.</p><p>C. She finds out that there are no swimming classes at her level.</p><p>D. She thought all sports activities were supervised by coaches.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The student had also said with excitement before: I was very excited about joining the swimming class. Suddenly the mood turned into a very frustrating and disappointing. It was after the gym staff told her that if I had to attend the swimming course, I would need to pay extra for the course. None of the ACDs were mentioned in the dialogue.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the man imply about people who play sports in the gym?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They do not need an instructor to coach them.</p><p>B. They do not usually take swimming classes.</p><p>C. They must pay an extra fee to use the equipment.</p><p>D. They do not need a gym pass.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The students said that those who exercise in the gym are free to enter. But is a sign. The employee stated that they are all playing or swim on their own. If they attend the course, they need to pay the instructors, which means they have entered the gym. People are not coached. The meaning of C is relatively easy to confuse. The use of equipment does not require additional payment. The participation of the course led by the coach requires additional payment.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the woman make an appointment with the swimming instructor?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

To find out which swimming class she should take.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>Students need to meet with the coaches to tell the coaches their own level of swimming to confirm which course they should attend. A B C was not mentioned in the dialogue.</p></div></div><div class="replay" id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the man imply when he says this?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.
