Others think that parents should exercise control over the television programs their children watch. Which do you agree with? Explain why.</p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>I think parents should exercise control over the television programs their children watch. It's a way of protection, since many shows are full of violent or horrifying scenes. But children are not mature enough to bear those scenes so they may feel terrified. Take myself as an example, When I was 7-year-old, I was watching TV alone at home. I accidentally ran into a horror movie and was frightened by the horrible zombies in the movie. They eat human beings and tear bodies into pieces. I was shocked by the bloody scenes. From then on, I started to be afraid of darkness. Every time I walked along the street in the evening, I would feel a zombie following me. I didn't get rid of the bad influence from that movie until high school.</p></article></div></main></body></html>
