          <p>Listen to part of a lecture in an Interior Design class.</p>
          <p>(professor) So we're talking about interior design, uh, specifically the basic principles typically used in home and office decoration in the United States. Effective designs create a delicate balance between two things: you need unity and you also need contrast, which is essentially a break in unity. Now, this might seem a little contradictory but let me explain why we need both of these for an effective design.The first principle, we need unity in our design. Think of it as a consistency. Well, an easy and very effective way to do this is by bringing together similar elements, uh, common example is by matching colors. You pick a color and use it for different parts of the room. Say, you pick green and then use a light shade of green for the walls, and maybe a somewhat darker shade for the fabric on the sofa and finally compliment that with a matching green rug. When elements match, the room is unified and gives its resident a sense of order and comfort. OK, but there is such a thing as too much unity. Remember, you need a balance of unity and contrast. If all you do is focus on unity, the result will be a boring room! So what do you do? Well, you apply the second basic principle of design, which is contrast. Contrast serves to disrupt or break up unity in places, but, in a careful and intentional way. Um, well, let's continue using color as an example. To create contrast, color contrast, you need to abruptly change your color scheme once in a while. Uh, let's see, you could throw bright red cushions on your dark green sofa for example. Contrast makes things stand out. The green will look even greener next to the red! So, now your room is more interesting, not completely the same.But watch out! Too much contrast is also dangerous. Just like too much sameness is. Too much contrast will make the room feel busy, chaotic."</p>

        <article>
          <p>There're two principles for balance in interior design, one is unity, another is contrast. Unity means bringing together same elements into a design. For example, you can use green to decorate your house, grassy green for the wall, darker shady green for the sofa and complement with a matching green in the rug. And this will provide you a sense of order and consistence. However, if you have too much unity in a room, it'll become boring. So you need some contrast to break up that unity, to make your room livelier. For example, you can put bright red cushions on the green sofa, so that the green appears greener next to the red. But you should be careful because too much contrast probably will also destroy the balance by making the room seem busy. (140 words)</p>
