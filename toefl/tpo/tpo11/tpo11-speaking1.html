I think it's very interesting because in the story the main character's experience is similar to mine. The main character wants to be a poet while I want to be a writer. He abandoned his well-paying job for his dream and I also quit my job for my dream. He had a time when he was impoverished and I also experienced a time when I couldn't afford a lunch. He lives in a society where money talks and I live in a society where money is everything. So these similar experiences make me think the book interesting.</p></article></div></main></body></html>
