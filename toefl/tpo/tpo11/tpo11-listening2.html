of a lecture in a <span class="highlight">Biology</span> Class. <span class="time" data-times="2.96" data-time="4.18">[00:04.18]</span>The class has been learning about birds.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.67" data-time="7.14">[00:07.14]</span>Professor: OK, today we are going to continue our discussion of the parenting behaviors of birds. <span class="time" data-times="5.21" data-time="13.81">[00:13.81]</span>And we are going to start by talking about what are known as <span class="highlight">distraction</span> displays. <span class="time" data-times="3.71" data-time="19.02">[00:19.02]</span>Now if you were a bird and there was a <span class="highlight">predator</span> around. <span class="time" data-times="1.54" data-time="22.73">[00:22.73]</span>What are you going to do? <span class="time" data-times="5.35" data-time="24.27">[00:24.27]</span>Well, for one thing you are going to try to <span class="highlight">attract</span> as little <span class="highlight">attention</span> as possible, right?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.5" data-time="29.62">[00:29.62]</span>Because if the <span class="highlight">predator</span> doesn't know you are there, it is not going to try to eat you. <span class="time" data-times="10.18" data-time="34.12">[00:34.12]</span>But sometimes certain <span class="highlight">species</span> of birds do the <span class="highlight">exact</span><span class="highlight">opposite</span> when a <span class="highlight">predator</span> approaches, they do their best to <span class="highlight">attract</span> the <span class="highlight">attention</span> of that <span class="highlight">predator</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.34" data-time="44.3">[00:44.30]</span>Now why would they do that? <span class="time" data-times="7.54" data-time="46.64">[00:46.64]</span>Well, they do that to <span class="highlight">draw</span> the <span class="highlight">predator</span> away from their <span class="highlight">nest</span>, away from their eggs or their young birds. <span class="time" data-times="7.47" data-time="54.18">[00:54.18]</span>And the behaviors that the birds <span class="highlight">engage</span> in to <span class="highlight">distract</span> predators are called <span class="highlight">distraction</span> displays.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.07" data-time="61.65">[01:01.65]</span>And there are a number of different kinds of <span class="highlight">distraction</span> displays. <span class="time" data-times="16.89" data-time="65.72">[01:05.72]</span>Most of the time, when birds are <span class="highlight">engaging</span> in <span class="highlight">distraction</span> displays, they are going to be pretending either that they have an injury or that they're ill or that they're exhausted, you know, something that'll make the <span class="highlight">predator</span> think "<span class="highlight">Hum</span>... here is an easy meal". <span class="time" data-times="5.58" data-time="82.61">[01:22.61]</span>One <span class="highlight">pretty</span><span class="highlight">common</span><span class="highlight">distraction</span><span class="highlight">display</span> was called the broken wing <span class="highlight">display</span>. <span class="time" data-times="11.77" data-time="88.19">[01:28.19]</span>And in a broken wing <span class="highlight">display</span>, the bird spreads and drags its wing or its tail, and while it does that, it slowly moves away from the <span class="highlight">nest</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.33" data-time="99.96">[01:39.96]</span>So it really looks like a bird with a broken wing. <span class="time" data-times="4.18" data-time="103.29">[01:43.29]</span>And these broken wing displays can be <span class="highlight">pretty</span> convincing.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="11.13" data-time="107.47">[01:47.47]</span>Another <span class="highlight">version</span> of this kind of <span class="highlight">distraction</span><span class="highlight">display</span> is where the bird creates the <span class="highlight">impression</span> of a mouse or some other small animal that's running <span class="highlight">along</span> the ground. <span class="time" data-times="6.44" data-time="118.6">[01:58.60]</span>A good example of that kind of displays is created by a bird called the <span class="highlight">purple</span> sandpiper. <span class="time" data-times="15.92" data-time="125.04">[02:05.04]</span>Now what the <span class="highlight">purple</span> sandpiper does is when a <span class="highlight">predator</span> approaches, it drags its wings, but not to give the <span class="highlight">impression</span> that its wings are broken, but to create the <span class="highlight">illusion</span> that it has a <span class="highlight">second</span> pair of legs.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.33" data-time="140.96">[02:20.96]</span>And then it raises its feathers, so it looks like it's got a coat of <span class="highlight">fur</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.73" data-time="146.29">[02:26.29]</span>And then it runs <span class="highlight">along</span> the ground, swirling left and right, you know like it's running around a little rocks and sticks. <span class="time" data-times="4.43" data-time="154.02">[02:34.02]</span>And as it goes <span class="highlight">along</span>, it makes a little squealing noise. <span class="time" data-times="7.61" data-time="158.45">[02:38.45]</span>So from a distance, it really looks and sounds like a little animal running <span class="highlight">along</span> the ground, trying to get away. <span class="time" data-times="4.57" data-time="166.06">[02:46.06]</span>Again to the <span class="highlight">predator</span>, it looks like an easy meal.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.13" data-time="170.63">[02:50.63]</span>Now what's interesting is that birds have different levels of performance of these <span class="highlight">distraction</span> displays. <span class="time" data-times="5.65" data-time="177.76">[02:57.76]</span>They don't give their top performance, their <span class="highlight">prime</span> time performance every time. <span class="time" data-times="14.08" data-time="183.41">[03:03.41]</span>What they do is they <span class="highlight">save</span> their best performances, their most <span class="highlight">conspicuous</span> and most risky displays, for the time just before the baby birds become able to take <span class="highlight">care</span> of themselves. <span class="time" data-times="6.42" data-time="197.49">[03:17.49]</span>And they time it that way because that's when they have made the greatest investment in parenting their young.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="9.07" data-time="203.91">[03:23.91]</span>So they are not going to put on their best performance just after they laid their eggs because they <span class="highlight">haven</span>'t invested that much more time and energy in parenting yet. <span class="time" data-times="3.03" data-time="212.98">[03:32.98]</span>The top performance is going to come later. <span class="time" data-times="6.79" data-time="216.01">[03:36.01]</span>Now you have some birds that are quiet <span class="highlight">mature</span>, are quite <span class="highlight">capable</span> almost as soon as they <span class="highlight">hatch</span>. <span class="time" data-times="15.57" data-time="222.8">[03:42.80]</span>And in that case, the parent will put on the most <span class="highlight">conspicuous</span> distractions displays just before the babies' <span class="highlight">hatch</span> because once the babies are hatched they can <span class="highlight">pretty</span> much take <span class="highlight">care</span> of themselves, and then you have others birds that are helpless when they <span class="highlight">hatch</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="238.37">[03:58.37]</span>In that case, the parent will <span class="highlight">save</span> its best performances until just before the babies get their feathers.</p></article><div

Birds in the distraction display generally have these two kinds of performance. So the answer is A D.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the lecture,when do birds put on their most conspicuous distraction displays?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Just before they lay their eggs.</p><p>B. Immediately after they have laid their eggs.</p><p>C. Just before their young become independent.</p><p>D. Immediately after young have left the nest.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Now is a keyword. The first half of the sentence prompts us to teach what will happen next when we say that birds will most obviously confuse performances. That is, just before the baby birds can become able to take care of themselves. The C option is the best match.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor say this?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

To emphasize a point that should be obvious.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>After the word Well, the sentence was followed by a response to the question "Now why would they do that?". Therefore, the professor said that the purpose of this passage was to provide an explanation.</p></div></div><div class="replay" id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor say this?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To explain the behavior of the predator.</p><p>B. To emphasize that predators have excellent hunting skills.</p><p>C. To state the purpose of birds' behavior.</p><p>D. To emphasize the risks involved in a distraction display.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Before saying this, the professor said that birds usually pretend to be injured and other obsessive shows, saying that you know, something that'll make the predator think ah, here's an easy meal! discusses how the bird can achieve this. The effect of this is to confuse the purpose of the performance. The answer is C.</p></div></div><div class="replay" id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor say this?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To describe the behavior of an injured sandpiper.</p><p>B. To give an example of a well-performed broken-wing display.</p><p>C. To show why some sandpipers fail to distract predators.</p><p>D. To distinguish the sandpiper's display from another kind of display.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>This passage appears in the professor's other distraction display. In the case of the sandpiper professor, for example, the sandpiper must behave differently than the distraction display. The sentence pattern not to...but to... is given to distinguish the two.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
