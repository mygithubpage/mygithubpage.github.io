              <span class="time" data-times="4.18" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in a <span class="underline">Biology</span> Class. <span class="time" data-times="2.96" data-time="4.18">[00:04.18]</span>The class has been learning about birds.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.67" data-time="7.14">[00:07.14]</span>Professor: OK, today we are going to continue our discussion of the parenting behaviors of birds. <span class="time" data-times="5.21" data-time="13.81">[00:13.81]</span>And we are going to start by talking about what are known as <span class="underline">distraction</span> displays. <span class="time" data-times="3.71" data-time="19.02">[00:19.02]</span>Now if you were a bird and there was a <span class="underline">predator</span> around. <span class="time" data-times="1.54" data-time="22.73">[00:22.73]</span>What are you going to do? <span class="time" data-times="5.35" data-time="24.27">[00:24.27]</span>Well, for one thing you are going to try to <span class="underline">attract</span> as little <span class="underline">attention</span> as possible, right?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.5" data-time="29.62">[00:29.62]</span>Because if the <span class="underline">predator</span> doesn't know you are there, it is not going to try to eat you. <span class="time" data-times="10.18" data-time="34.12">[00:34.12]</span>But sometimes certain <span class="underline">species</span> of birds do the <span class="underline">exact</span> <span class="underline">opposite</span> when a <span class="underline">predator</span> approaches, they do their best to <span class="underline">attract</span> the <span class="underline">attention</span> of that <span class="underline">predator</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.34" data-time="44.3">[00:44.30]</span>Now why would they do that? <span class="time" data-times="7.54" data-time="46.64">[00:46.64]</span>Well, they do that to <span class="underline">draw</span> the <span class="underline">predator</span> away from their <span class="underline">nest</span>, away from their eggs or their young birds. <span class="time" data-times="7.47" data-time="54.18">[00:54.18]</span>And the behaviors that the birds <span class="underline">engage</span> in to <span class="underline">distract</span> predators are called <span class="underline">distraction</span> displays.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.07" data-time="61.65">[01:01.65]</span>And there are a number of different kinds of <span class="underline">distraction</span> displays. <span class="time" data-times="16.89" data-time="65.72">[01:05.72]</span>Most of the time, when birds are <span class="underline">engaging</span> in <span class="underline">distraction</span> displays, they are going to be pretending either that they have an injury or that they're ill or that they're exhausted, you know, something that'll make the <span class="underline">predator</span> think "<span class="underline">Hum</span>... here is an easy meal". <span class="time" data-times="5.58" data-time="82.61">[01:22.61]</span>One <span class="underline">pretty</span> <span class="underline">common</span> <span class="underline">distraction</span> <span class="underline">display</span> was called the broken wing <span class="underline">display</span>. <span class="time" data-times="11.77" data-time="88.19">[01:28.19]</span>And in a broken wing <span class="underline">display</span>, the bird spreads and drags its wing or its tail, and while it does that, it slowly moves away from the <span class="underline">nest</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.33" data-time="99.96">[01:39.96]</span>So it really looks like a bird with a broken wing. <span class="time" data-times="4.18" data-time="103.29">[01:43.29]</span>And these broken wing displays can be <span class="underline">pretty</span> convincing.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="11.13" data-time="107.47">[01:47.47]</span>Another <span class="underline">version</span> of this kind of <span class="underline">distraction</span> <span class="underline">display</span> is where the bird creates the <span class="underline">impression</span> of a mouse or some other small animal that's running <span class="underline">along</span> the ground. <span class="time" data-times="6.44" data-time="118.6">[01:58.60]</span>A good example of that kind of displays is created by a bird called the <span class="underline">purple</span> sandpiper. <span class="time" data-times="15.92" data-time="125.04">[02:05.04]</span>Now what the <span class="underline">purple</span> sandpiper does is when a <span class="underline">predator</span> approaches, it drags its wings, but not to give the <span class="underline">impression</span> that its wings are broken, but to create the <span class="underline">illusion</span> that it has a <span class="underline">second</span> pair of legs.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.33" data-time="140.96">[02:20.96]</span>And then it raises its feathers, so it looks like it's got a coat of <span class="underline">fur</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.73" data-time="146.29">[02:26.29]</span>And then it runs <span class="underline">along</span> the ground, swirling left and right, you know like it's running around a little rocks and sticks. <span class="time" data-times="4.43" data-time="154.02">[02:34.02]</span>And as it goes <span class="underline">along</span>, it makes a little squealing noise. <span class="time" data-times="7.61" data-time="158.45">[02:38.45]</span>So from a distance, it really looks and sounds like a little animal running <span class="underline">along</span> the ground, trying to get away. <span class="time" data-times="4.57" data-time="166.06">[02:46.06]</span>Again to the <span class="underline">predator</span>, it looks like an easy meal.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.13" data-time="170.63">[02:50.63]</span>Now what's interesting is that birds have different levels of performance of these <span class="underline">distraction</span> displays. <span class="time" data-times="5.65" data-time="177.76">[02:57.76]</span>They don't give their top performance, their <span class="underline">prime</span> time performance every time. <span class="time" data-times="14.08" data-time="183.41">[03:03.41]</span>What they do is they <span class="underline">save</span> their best performances, their most <span class="underline">conspicuous</span> and most risky displays, for the time just before the baby birds become able to take <span class="underline">care</span> of themselves. <span class="time" data-times="6.42" data-time="197.49">[03:17.49]</span>And they time it that way because that's when they have made the greatest investment in parenting their young.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.07" data-time="203.91">[03:23.91]</span>So they are not going to put on their best performance just after they laid their eggs because they <span class="underline">haven</span>'t invested that much more time and energy in parenting yet. <span class="time" data-times="3.03" data-time="212.98">[03:32.98]</span>The top performance is going to come later. <span class="time" data-times="6.79" data-time="216.01">[03:36.01]</span>Now you have some birds that are quiet <span class="underline">mature</span>, are quite <span class="underline">capable</span> almost as soon as they <span class="underline">hatch</span>. <span class="time" data-times="15.57" data-time="222.8">[03:42.80]</span>And in that case, the parent will put on the most <span class="underline">conspicuous</span> distractions displays just before the babies' <span class="underline">hatch</span> because once the babies are hatched they can <span class="underline">pretty</span> much take <span class="underline">care</span> of themselves, and then you have others birds that are helpless when they <span class="underline">hatch</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="238.37">[03:58.37]</span>In that case, the parent will <span class="underline">save</span> its best performances until just before the babies get their feathers.</p>
