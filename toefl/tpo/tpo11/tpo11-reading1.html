            <b>Ancient Egyptian Sculpture</b>
          </h4>
          <p>static2.zhan.com/beikao/images/icon.png?v=201803081738"&gt;In order to understand <span class="highlight">ancient</span> Egyptian art, it is <span class="highlight question1">vital</span> to know as much as possible of the elite Egyptians' view of the world and the functions and contexts of the art produced for them. Without this knowledge we can <span class="highlight">appreciate</span> only the <span class="highlight">formal</span> <span class="highlight">content</span> of Egyptian art, and we will fail to understand why it was produced or the concepts that shaped it and caused it to <span class="highlight">adopt</span> its <span class="highlight">distinctive</span> forms. In fact, a <span class="highlight">lack</span> of understanding concerning the purposes of Egyptian art has often led it to be compared unfavorably with the art of other cultures: Why did the Egyptians not develop <span class="highlight">sculpture</span> in which the body turned and twisted <span class="highlight">through</span> <span class="highlight">space</span> like <span class="highlight">classical</span> Greek statuary? Why do the artists <span class="highlight">seem</span> to get left and right <span class="highlight">confused</span>? And why did they not discover the geometric <span class="highlight">perspective</span> as European artists did in the Renaissance? The answer to such questions has nothing to do with a <span class="highlight">lack</span> of skill or imagination on the part of Egyptian artists and everything to do with the purposes for which they were producing their art.</p>
          <p>The <span class="highlight">majority</span> of three-dimensional representations, whether standing, seated, or kneeling, <span class="highlight">exhibit</span> what is called frontality: they face straight ahead, neither twisting nor turning. When such statues are viewed in isolation, out of their <span class="highlight">original</span> <span class="highlight question5">context</span> and without knowledge of their <span class="highlight">function</span>, it is easy to <span class="highlight">criticize</span> them for their <span class="highlight">rigid</span> attitudes that remained unchanged for three thousand years. Frontality is, however, directly related to the functions of Egyptian statuary and the contexts in which the statues were set up. Statues were created not for their <span class="highlight">decorative</span> effect but to play a <span class="highlight">primary</span> role in the cults of the gods, the king, and the dead. They were designed to be put in places where these beings could <span class="highlight">manifest</span> themselves in order to be the recipients of <span class="highlight">ritual</span> actions. Thus it made <span class="highlight">sense</span> to show the <span class="highlight">statue</span> looking ahead at what was happening in front of it, so that the living performer of the <span class="highlight">ritual</span> could <span class="highlight">interact</span> with the divine or deceased recipient. Very often such statues were enclosed in <span class="highlight">rectangular</span> shrines or wall niches whose only opening was at the front, making it natural for the <span class="highlight">statue</span> to <span class="highlight">display</span> frontality. Other statues were designed to be placed <span class="highlight">within</span> <span class="question6">an architectural <span class="highlight">setting</span></span>, for <span class="highlight">instance</span>, in front of the <span class="highlight">monumental</span> <span class="highlight">entrance</span> gateways to temples known as pylons, or in pillared courts, where they would be placed against or between pillars: their frontality worked perfectly <span class="highlight">within</span> the architectural <span class="highlight question5">context</span>.</p>
          <p>Statues were <span class="highlight">normally</span> made of stone, wood, or metal. Stone statues were worked from single <span class="highlight">rectangular</span> blocks of <span class="highlight">material</span> and retained the compactness of the <span class="highlight">original</span> <span class="highlight">shape</span>. The stone between the arms and the body and between the legs in standing figures or the legs and the seat in seated ones was not <span class="highlight">normally</span> cut away. From a <span class="highlight">practical</span> <span class="highlight">aspect</span> this protected the figures against breakage and psychologically gives the images a <span class="highlight">sense</span> of strength and power, usually enhanced by a supporting back pillar. By <span class="highlight">contrast</span>, wooden statues were carved from several pieces of wood that were pegged together to form the finished work, and metal statues were either made by wrapping sheet metal around a wooden <span class="highlight question9">core</span> or <span class="highlight">cast</span> by the lost <span class="highlight">wax</span> <span class="highlight">process</span>. The arms could be held away from the body and carry <span class="highlight">separate</span> items in their hands; there is no back pillar. The effect is <span class="highlight">altogether</span> lighter and freer than that achieved in stone, but because both <span class="highlight">perform</span> the same <span class="highlight">function</span>, <span class="highlight">formal</span> wooden and metal statues still <span class="highlight">display</span> frontality.</p>
          <p>Apart from statues representing deities, kings, and named members of the elite that can be called <span class="highlight">formal</span>, there is another group of three-dimensional 
representations that <span class="question11">depicts</span> generic figures, frequently servants, from the nonelite <span class="highlight">population</span>.  <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>The <span class="highlight">function</span> of these is quite different. 
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>Many are made to be put in the tombs of the elite in order to serve the tomb owners in the afterlife.  <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>Unlike <span class="highlight">formal</span> statues that are limited to <span class="highlight">static</span> poses of standing, sitting, 
and kneeling, these figures <span class="highlight">depict</span> a wide <span class="highlight">range</span> of actions, such as grinding <span class="highlight">grain</span>, baking bread, producing pots, and making music, and they are shown in <span class="highlight">appropriate</span> poses, bending and squatting as they carry out their tasks. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p>
