In an effort to counteract the trend, the college has announced a plan to renovate its on-campus housing. The renovations will take two years, and they will include improvements to the bathrooms, lighting, and heating in the dormitories. "A lot of people are moving off campus because the dorms aren't in great shape," explained the college president. "By renovating the dorms, we can make them more appealing than off-campus housing, and more students will choose to remain on campus."</p></article><div><audio src="tpo11-speaking3.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></div><article id="listening-passage" class="passage"><h3>Listening Text</h3><p>Now listen to two students discussing the college's plan.</p><p>(woman) The college's making a mistake with this new plan.</p><p>(man) What do you mean? I think it will really help the college to accomplish its goals.</p><p>(woman) Don't' be so sure! All that construction, for two years? It's gonna create a lot of noise.</p><p>(man) Well, you mean in the beginning, for students still living in the dorms.</p><p>(woman) Yeah, students who are trying to sleep or do works are constantly going to be disturbed. So, people will try to get as far away as possible, probably by moving off campus. So they are losing even more people!</p><p>(man) Huh, I haven't thought of that. But still, once all the constructions are over, more people will probably want to live in the dorms, right? I mean, the living conditions will be so much better.</p><p>(woman) If they can afford to, do you know how the college is planning on paying for this plan? By raising the cost of campus housing!</p><p>(man) Oh! I didn't realize that.</p><p>(woman) Yeah, so if it's more expensive why would people want to move back into the dorms if they can rent an apartment for less money?" "</p></article><section id="question"><h4>Question</h4><p>The woman expresses her opinion about the college's plan. State her opinion and explain the reasons she gives for holding that opinion. </p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>Actually, the woman opposes the college's plan for some reasons. First of all, all the constructions in the plan will cause a lot of noise which will disturb the students when they are trying to get some sleep or to work constantly, so the students could possibly move out to avoid the noise, which means the campus will lose more students instead of getting more of them staying. Another reason from the woman is that the campus housing cost will be way too much for the students to afford, so they will move out and rent an apartment for a lower price. So based on the reasons stated above the woman disagrees with the plan. (112 words)</p></article></div></main></body></html>
