Others think access to much information creates problems. Which view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. </p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>Internet must be one of the greatest inventions during the 20th century. It shortens the distance between people all over the world by providing various kinds and large amounts of information. In my point of view, I agree that Internet can provide a lot of valuable information, which would benefit us in the long run without troubling at all.</p><p>By surfing through the Internet, we can get large quantities of useful skills, which can benefit ourselves, from the information that is available on the Internet. Learning these skills can help us keep healthy, gain more money or even improve our living standard. In my country, there used to be some isolated villages, where books and knowledge are hard to spread. People living in these villages lack the basic skills to have a good harvest and they live in the really poor condition. Meanwhile, our government has helped them to have access to the Internet recently and the villagers can get the information they want without any difficulties. By using this information, they improved their living conditions. Therefore, information getting from the Internet can benefit our lives.</p><p>Another important aspect is the current affairs. Internet could offer us a lot of information about things happened all over the world without peopling travelling around the world. From the new scientific discovery to the war in the Middle East, from the economic crisis happened in Europe to the World  Cup  held  in  South  Africa,  things  happened  in  every  corner  of  the  world  can  be  known worldwide in no minute through the Internet. Under this circumstance, people can have their own opinions on these affairs, or they can give their hands to the ones who need help. Internet gives us a chance to learn more about the whole world by proving us information.</p><p>Admittedly, there is some unreal information on the Internet. On the contrary, I do not think it as a trouble at all. The existence of unreal information forces us to be critical thinking and have the ability to tell the truth. In addition, it is the person who creates unreal news rather than the Internet to be blamed.</p><p>All in all, the Internet is a great tool to offer us tremendous amount of information. Surrounded by large amount of information can broad our sight and make us more intelligent rather than trap us into troubles.</p></article></div></main></body></html>
