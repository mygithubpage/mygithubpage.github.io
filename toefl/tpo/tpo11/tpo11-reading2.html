            <b>Orientation and Navigation</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>To South Americans, robins are birds that fly north every <span class="underline">spring</span>. To North Americans, the robins <span class="underline">simply</span> <span class="underline">vacation</span> in the south each winter. Furthermore, they fly to very <span class="underline">specific</span> places in South America and will often come back to the same trees in North American yards the following <span class="underline">spring</span>. The question is not why they would leave the cold of winter so much as how they find their way around. The question perplexed people for years, until, in the 1950s, a German scientist named Gustave Kramer provided some answers and, in the <span class="underline">process</span>, raised new questions.</p>
          <p>Kramer initiated important new kinds of research regarding how animals orient and <span class="underline">navigate</span>. <span class="underline">Orientation</span> is <span class="underline">simply</span> facing in the right direction; <span class="underline">navigation</span> involves finding ones way from point A to point B.</p>
          <p>Early in his research, Kramer found that caged <span class="underline">migratory</span> birds became very restless at about the time they would <span class="underline">normally</span> have begun <span class="underline">migration</span> in the wild. Furthermore, he noticed that as they fluttered around in the cage, they often launched themselves in the direction of their normal <span class="underline">migratory</span> <span class="underline">route</span>. He then set up experiments with caged starlings and found that their <span class="underline">orientation</span> was, in fact, in the <span class="underline">proper</span> <span class="underline">migratory</span> direction except when the sky was overcast, at which times there was no <span class="underline">clear</span> direction to their restless movements. Kramer surmised, <span class="underline">therefore</span>, that they were orienting according to the <span class="underline">position</span> of the Sun. To test this idea, he blocked their view of the Sun and used mirrors to change its <span class="underline">apparent</span> <span class="underline">position</span>. He found that under these circumstances, the birds oriented with <span class="underline">respect</span> to the new "Sun." They seemed to be using the Sun as a <span class="underline">compass</span> to <span class="underline">determine</span> direction. At the time, this idea seemed preposterous. How could a bird <span class="underline">navigate</span> by the Sun when some of us lose our way with road maps? <span class="underline">Obviously</span>, more testing was in order.</p>
          <p>So, in another set of experiments, Kramer put <span class="underline">identical</span> food boxes around the cage, with food in only one of the boxes. 
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>The boxes were <span class="underline">stationary</span>, and the one containing food was always at the same point of the <span class="underline">compass</span>. 
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>However, its <span class="underline">position</span> with <span class="underline">respect</span> to the surroundings could be changed by revolving either the <span class="underline">inner</span> cage containing the birds or the outer walls, which served as the background.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>As long as the birds could see the Sun, no matter how their surroundings were altered, they went directly to the correct food box. 
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>whether the box appeared in front of the right wall or the left wall, they showed no signs of <span class="underline">confusion</span>. On overcast days, however,
the birds were <span class="underline">disoriented</span> and had trouble locating their food box.</p>
          <p>In experimenting with <span class="underline">artificial</span> suns, Kramer made another interesting discovery. If the <span class="underline">artificial</span> Sun remained <span class="underline">stationary</span>, the birds would <span class="underline">shift</span> their direction with <span class="underline">respect</span> to it at a <span class="underline">rate</span> of about 15 degrees per hour, the Sun's <span class="underline">rate</span> of movement <span class="underline">across</span> the sky. Apparently, the birds were assuming that the "Sun" they saw was moving at that <span class="underline">rate</span>. When the real Sun was <span class="underline">visible</span>, however, the birds maintained a <span class="underline">constant</span> direction as it moved <span class="underline">across</span> the sky. In other words, they were able to <span class="underline">compensate</span> for the Sun's movement. This meant that some <span class="underline">sort</span> of biological clock was operating-and a very <span class="underline">precise</span> clock at that.</p>
          <p>What about birds that <span class="underline">migrate</span> at night? Perhaps they <span class="underline">navigate</span> by the night sky. To test the idea, caged night-migrating birds were placed on the floor of a planetarium during their <span class="underline">migratory</span> period. A planetarium is <span class="underline">essentially</span> a theater with a domelike ceiling onto which a night sky can be projected for any night of the year. When the planetarium sky matched the sky outside, the birds fluttered in the direction of their normal <span class="underline">migration</span>. But when the <span class="underline">dome</span> was rotated, the birds changed their direction to <span class="underline">match</span> the <span class="underline">artificial</span> sky. The results clearly indicated that the birds were orienting according to the stars.</p>
          <p>There is accumulating <span class="underline">evidence</span> indicating that birds <span class="underline">navigate</span> by using a wide <span class="underline">variety</span> of <span class="underline">environmental</span> cues. Other areas under <span class="underline">investigation</span> include magnetism, landmarks, coastlines, sonar, and <span class="underline">even</span> smells. The studies are <span class="underline">complicated</span> by the fact that the <span class="underline">data</span> are sometimes <span class="underline">contradictory</span> and the mechanisms apparently change from time to time. Furthermore, one <span class="underline">sensory</span> <span class="underline">ability</span> may back up another.</p>
