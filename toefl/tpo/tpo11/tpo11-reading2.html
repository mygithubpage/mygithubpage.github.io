To North Americans, the robins <span class="highlight">simply</span><span class="highlight">vacation</span> in the south each winter. Furthermore, they fly to very <span class="highlight">specific</span> places in South America and will often come back to the same trees in North American yards the following <span class="highlight">spring</span>. The question is not why they would leave the cold of winter so much as how they find their way around. The question <span class="question2">perplexed </span>people for years, until, in the 1950s, a German scientist named Gustave Kramer provided some answers and, in the <span class="highlight">process</span>, raised new questions.</p><p>Kramer initiated important new kinds of research regarding how animals orient and <span class="highlight">navigate</span>. <span class="highlight">Orientation</span> is <span class="highlight">simply</span> facing in the right direction; <span class="highlight">navigation</span> involves finding ones way from point A to point B.</p><p>Early in his research, Kramer found that caged <span class="highlight">migratory</span> birds became very restless at about the time they would <span class="highlight">normally</span> have begun <span class="highlight">migration</span> in the wild. Furthermore, he noticed that as they fluttered around in the cage, they often launched themselves in the direction of their normal <span class="highlight">migratory</span><span class="highlight">route</span>. <span class="question3">He then set up experiments with caged starlings and found that their <span class="highlight">orientation</span> was, in fact, in the <span class="highlight">proper</span><span class="highlight">migratory</span> direction except when the sky was overcast, at which times there was no <span class="highlight">clear</span> direction to their restless movements. </span>Kramer surmised, <span class="highlight">therefore</span>, that they were orienting according to the <span class="highlight">position</span> of the Sun. To test this idea, he blocked their view of the Sun and used mirrors to change its <span class="highlight">apparent</span><span class="highlight">position</span>. He found that under these circumstances, the birds oriented with <span class="highlight">respect</span> to the new "Sun." They seemed to be using the Sun as a <span class="highlight">compass</span> to <span class="highlight">determine</span> direction. At the time, this idea seemed <span class="question4">preposterous. </span>How could a bird <span class="highlight">navigate</span> by the Sun when some of us lose our way with road maps? <span class="highlight">Obviously</span>, more testing was in order.</p><p>So, in another set of experiments, Kramer put <span class="highlight">identical</span> food boxes around the cage, with food in only one of the boxes. 
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>The boxes were <span class="highlight">stationary</span>, and the one containing food was always at the same point of the <span class="highlight">compass</span>. 
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>However, its <span class="highlight">position</span> with <span class="highlight">respect</span> to the surroundings could be changed by revolving either the <span class="highlight">inner</span> cage containing the birds or the outer walls, which served as the background.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>As long as the birds could see the Sun, no matter how their surroundings were altered, they went directly to the correct food box. 
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>whether the box appeared in front of the right wall or the left wall, they showed no signs of <span class="highlight">confusion</span>. On overcast days, however,
the birds were <span class="highlight">disoriented</span> and had trouble locating their food box.</p><p>In experimenting with <span class="highlight">artificial</span> suns, Kramer made another interesting discovery. If the <span class="highlight">artificial</span> Sun remained <span class="highlight">stationary</span>, the birds would <span class="highlight">shift</span> their direction with <span class="highlight">respect</span> to it at a <span class="highlight">rate</span> of about 15 degrees per hour, the Sun's <span class="highlight">rate</span> of movement <span class="highlight">across</span> the sky. Apparently, the birds were assuming that the "Sun" they saw was moving at that <span class="highlight">rate</span>. When the real Sun was <span class="highlight">visible</span>, however, the birds maintained a <span class="highlight">constant</span> direction as it moved <span class="highlight">across</span> the sky. In other words, they were able to <span class="highlight">compensate</span> for the Sun's movement. This meant that some <span class="highlight">sort</span> of biological clock was operating-and a very <span class="highlight">precise</span> clock at that.</p><p>What about birds that <span class="highlight">migrate</span> at night? Perhaps they <span class="highlight">navigate</span> by the night sky. To test the idea, caged night-migrating birds were placed on the floor of a planetarium during their <span class="highlight">migratory</span> period. A planetarium is <span class="highlight">essentially</span> a theater with a domelike ceiling onto which a night sky can be projected for any night of the year. When the planetarium sky matched the sky outside, the birds fluttered in the direction of their normal <span class="highlight">migration</span>. But when the <span class="highlight">dome</span> was rotated, the birds changed their direction to <span class="highlight">match</span> the <span class="highlight">artificial</span> sky. The results clearly indicated that the birds were orienting according to the stars.</p><p>There is <span class="question12">accumulating <span class="highlight"></span>evidence</span> indicating that birds <span class="highlight">navigate</span> by using a wide <span class="highlight">variety</span> of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> cues. Other areas under <span class="highlight">investigation</span> include magnetism, landmarks, coastlines, sonar, and <span class="highlight">even</span> smells. The studies are <span class="highlight">complicated</span> by the fact that the <span class="highlight">data</span> are sometimes <span class="highlight">contradictory</span> and the mechanisms apparently change from time to time. Furthermore, one <span class="highlight">sensory</span><span class="highlight">ability</span> may back up another.</p></article></div><div id="question"><div id="question1"><p>Which of the following can be inferred about bird migration from paragraph 1?</p><label class="my-label"><span>A.
