So I didn't apply for a dorm room for the summer. I'm afraid it's too late for that now.</p><p>(woman) Yeah, the deadline for campus housing application has already passed. So what are you gonna do now?</p><p>(man) Well, I can stay with my parents. They live two hours from here so I thought I could drive and commute to campus everyday. I know my mom and dad would be happy to have me over for a few weeks and most of my old friends would be home for the summer so, in a way, it'd be fun.</p><p>(woman) Yeah, I understand. But you'd spend quite a bit of time on the road going back and forth. Won't you get tired?</p><p>(man) Yeah, that thought did cross my mind. The other thing I could do is rent an apartment off campus. Besides being closer to work, I'd also save tons of money on gas.</p><p>(woman) Uh, huh. But then you'd have to pay rent.</p><p>(man) I know. There's always something, isn't there?"</p></article></section><section id="question"><h4>Question</h4><p>The students discussed a problem and two possible solutions. Briefly summarize the problem then state which of the two solutions you prefer and explain why. </p></section><section id="sample-response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><article><p>Well, the man's problem is that it's too late for him to apply for a dorm room for the summer so he might have no place to live in. There are two solutions for the man: first, he could stay with his parents; and second, he could rent an apartment off campus. According to my understanding, renting an apartment is a better idea for the man for two reasons. First of all, renting an apartment is what most students do when they could not find a chance to live in a dorm, and for the man, it could save him gas fee for reference books or better food. Secondly, renting an apartment always means one could choose roommate for his or her own preference, especially finding someone who shares almost the same living habits And I am sure the man would like to live with someone he really gets along well with. So I think finding an apartment is a better option. (160 words)</p></article></section></main></body></html>
