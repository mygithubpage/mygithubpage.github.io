          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.62" data-time="7">[00:07.00]</span>Professor: Let's get started. <span class="time" data-times="4.39" data-time="8.62">[00:08.62]</span>Um, last time we were talking about the need for advertising. <span class="time" data-times="7.31" data-time="13.01">[00:13.01]</span>Now, let's look at how you can successfully call <span class="highlight">attention</span> to the service or product you want to sell. <span class="time" data-times="4.97" data-time="20.32">[00:20.32]</span>To succeed, you've got to develop a <span class="highlight">systematic</span> <span class="highlight">approach</span>. <span class="time" data-times="11.12" data-time="25.29">[00:25.29]</span>If you don't come up with a system, um, a plan, you risk making decisions that <span class="highlight">waste</span> money, or <span class="highlight">even</span> <span class="highlight">drive</span> away <span class="highlight">potential</span> customers. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.89" data-time="36.41">[00:36.41]</span>But what does a <span class="highlight">systematic</span> advertising plan look like? <span class="time" data-times="4.69" data-time="41.3">[00:41.30]</span>Well, it covers what we call – the 'Four Ms'. <span class="time" data-times="11.8" data-time="45.99">[00:45.99]</span>The 'Four Ms': <span class="highlight">Market</span>, <span class="highlight">Media</span>, Money, Message. <span class="time" data-times="5.66" data-time="57.79">[00:57.79]</span>All are important areas to <span class="highlight">focus</span> on when creating your advertising plan. <span class="time" data-times="2.12" data-time="63.45">[01:03.45]</span>We will look at them one by one. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="10.26" data-time="65.57">[01:05.57]</span>The First step is to look at your <span class="highlight">market</span>, that's the people who might become customers, buyers of your service or product. <span class="time" data-times="4.03" data-time="75.83">[01:15.83]</span>You need to know all about your possible customers: Who are they? <span class="time" data-times="2.03" data-time="79.86">[01:19.86]</span>What age group are they? <span class="time" data-times="1.88" data-time="81.89">[01:21.89]</span>What do they like, or dislike?<span class="time" data-times="1.62" data-time="83.77">[01:23.77]</span> How do they shop? <span class="time" data-times="2.45" data-time="85.39">[01:25.39]</span>So, you got that? <span class="time" data-times="4.61" data-time="87.84">[01:27.84]</span>A <span class="highlight">market</span> is a group of <span class="highlight">potential</span> customers. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="14.1" data-time="92.45">[01:32.45]</span>Next, <span class="highlight">Media</span>. <span class="highlight">Obviously</span>, the <span class="highlight">major</span> <span class="highlight">media</span> are television, radio, newspapers, magazines, um, the billboards, and so forth. <span class="time" data-times="2.77" data-time="106.55">[01:46.55]</span>They are all avenues of communication. <span class="time" data-times="4.7" data-time="109.32">[01:49.32]</span>And you need to <span class="highlight">figure</span> out: Which <span class="highlight">media</span> you should <span class="highlight">advertise</span> <span class="highlight">through</span>? <span class="time" data-times="4.76" data-time="114.02">[01:54.02]</span>Which <span class="highlight">media</span> will <span class="highlight">reach</span> your intended <span class="highlight">audience</span>, your <span class="highlight">market</span>? <span class="time" data-times="10.15" data-time="118.78">[01:58.78]</span>So, you do research, trying to <span class="highlight">determine</span> which <span class="highlight">media</span> will <span class="highlight">reach</span> the most <span class="highlight">potential</span> customers for the lowest <span class="highlight">cost</span>. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="11.66" data-time="128.93">[02:08.93]</span>For <span class="highlight">instance</span>, if you have a product, that we'll say teachers would like, then teachers are your <span class="highlight">market</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.54" data-time="140.59">[02:20.59]</span>So you ask yourself: What magazines do the <span class="highlight">majority</span> of teachers read? <span class="time" data-times="3.6" data-time="146.13">[02:26.13]</span>What TV programs do teachers watch? <span class="time" data-times="3.19" data-time="149.73">[02:29.73]</span>Do teachers listen to much radio? <span class="time" data-times="2.09" data-time="152.92">[02:32.92]</span>At what times of the day? </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.95" data-time="155.01">[02:35.01]</span>Say, now your research turns up two magazines that teachers read. <span class="time" data-times="18.96" data-time="161.96">[02:41.96]</span>And it also shows that the <span class="highlight">majority</span> of teachers, say ages twenty to thirty, read the magazine about classroom activities, while most teachers older than that read the other magazine, the one about, oh, let's say, 'Educational <span class="highlight">Psychology</span>'. <span class="time" data-times="13.06" data-time="180.92">[03:00.92]</span>You think your product will <span class="highlight">appeal</span> most to teachers ages twenty to thirty, so you decide to put your advertisement in their favorite magazine, the one about classroom activities. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="10.14" data-time="193.98">[03:13.98]</span>You don't <span class="highlight">waste</span> money advertising in the 'Educational <span class="highlight">Psychology</span>' magazine, you know the one that the younger teachers generally don't read. <span class="time" data-times="12.23" data-time="204.12">[03:24.12]</span>And since you're reaching the <span class="highlight">majority</span> of the teachers in your <span class="highlight">target</span> age group, you're probably spending your money well, which brings us to the third M – Money. <span class="time" data-times="5.48" data-time="216.35">[03:36.35]</span>You have an advertising <span class="highlight">budget</span> to spend, but how do you to spend it wisely. <span class="time" data-times="3.71" data-time="221.83">[03:41.83]</span>Again, research is the key. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="13.45" data-time="225.54">[03:45.54]</span>Good research gives you facts, facts that can help you decide, well, as we already mentioned, decide the right <span class="highlight">market</span> to <span class="highlight">target</span>, and the best <span class="highlight">media</span> to use. <span class="time" data-times="2.67" data-time="238.99">[03:58.99]</span>But also: When to <span class="highlight">advertise</span>? <span class="time" data-times="2.51" data-time="241.66">[04:01.66]</span>Or...or how to get the best rates? <span class="time" data-times="10.6" data-time="244.17">[04:04.17]</span>Like, may be you're advertising Sport equipment, and you have been spending most of your <span class="highlight">budget</span> during the holiday <span class="highlight">season</span> when people buy gifts for each other. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="16.67" data-time="254.77">[04:14.77]</span>Now, in <span class="highlight">theory</span>, that would <span class="highlight">seem</span> a great time to <span class="highlight">advertise</span>, but may be a research shows you're wrong, that the customers who buy sports equipment <span class="highlight">tend</span> not to give it as a holiday gift, but want to use it themselves. <span class="time" data-times="6.69" data-time="271.44">[04:31.44]</span>In that case, advertising during a different <span class="highlight">season</span> of the year might give you better results. <span class="time" data-times="4.46" data-time="278.13">[04:38.13]</span>And, um, may be it <span class="highlight">even</span> <span class="highlight">lower</span> non-holiday rates. <span class="time" data-times="1.78" data-time="282.59">[04:42.59]</span>So you actually <span class="highlight">save</span> money. <span class="time" data-times="10.57" data-time="284.37">[04:44.37]</span>But you need to get the facts; facts that come from good research to be certain and know for sure that you're getting your money's <span class="highlight">worth</span>. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="7.25" data-time="294.94">[04:54.94]</span>OK, finally, there is your message: What you want to say about your product? <span class="time" data-times="5.53" data-time="302.19">[05:02.19]</span>Why buying it will make the customer's life easier, or safer or better somehow. <span class="time" data-times="4.57" data-time="307.72">[05:07.72]</span>Whatever the message is, make sure you get it right. <span class="time" data-times="11.21" data-time="312.29">[05:12.29]</span>Let me give you an example of not getting it right, Ha...ha...ha... you are going to love this one: There was this Soup Shop. <span class="time" data-times="3.71" data-time="323.5">[05:23.50]</span>The soup was really tasty, but there weren't a lot of customers. <span class="time" data-times="7" data-time="327.21">[05:27.21]</span>The owner thought that may be if they give something away for free with each <span class="highlight">purchase</span>, then more people would come buy soup. <span class="time" data-times="7" data-time="334.21">[05:34.21]</span>So they got some cheap socks, and they <span class="highlight">advertise</span> to give a pair away with each bowl of soup. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.02" data-time="341.21">[05:41.21]</span>But, then <span class="highlight">even</span> fewer people came to the restaurant. <span class="time" data-times="2.54" data-time="345.23">[05:45.23]</span>Well, you can imagine why. <span class="time" data-times="7.26" data-time="347.77">[05:47.77]</span>People started to <span class="highlight">associate</span> the soup with feet; they began to imagine the soup smelled like feet. <span class="time" data-times="7.42" data-time="355.03">[05:55.03]</span>The advertising massage, "soup means free socks", was a bad choice; it was a <span class="highlight">waste</span> of money. <span class="time" data-times="3.47" data-time="362.45">[06:02.45]</span>And worse, it caused the loss of customers. <span class="time" data-times="10.45" data-time="365.92">[06:05.92]</span>Now, I want everyone to get into small groups and come up with some examples, not of good advertising messages, but of truly disastrous ones. <span class="time" data-times="7.58" data-time="376.37">[06:16.37]</span>Think of real examples or make some up, and talk about the reasons those messages are unsuccessful. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="383.95">[06:23.95]</span>And then we'll get back together and share. </p>
