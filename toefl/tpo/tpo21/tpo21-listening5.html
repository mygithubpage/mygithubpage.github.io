            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.2" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in a <span class="underline">biology</span> class. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="12.52" data-time="9.2">[00:09.20]</span>Professor: Probably back in some <span class="underline">previous</span> <span class="underline">biology</span> <span class="underline">course</span> you learned that snakes evolved from lizards, and that the first snakes weren't venomous and then <span class="underline">along</span> came more <span class="underline">advanced</span> snakes, the venomous snakes. <span class="time" data-times="7.22" data-time="21.72">[00:21.72]</span>Ok, venomous snakes are the ones that <span class="underline">secrete</span> <span class="underline">poisonous</span> substances or <span class="underline">venom</span>, like the snakes of the viper family or cobras. <span class="time" data-times="3.82" data-time="28.94">[00:28.94]</span>Then there is non-venomous snakes like constrictors and pythons. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.91" data-time="32.76">[00:32.76]</span>Another family of snakes, the colubrids, don't really fit neatly into either <span class="underline">category</span> though. <span class="time" data-times="9.57" data-time="38.67">[00:38.67]</span>Colubrids, and you probably learned this too, although they are often classified as venomous snakes, they are actually generally non-venomous. <span class="time" data-times="7.44" data-time="48.24">[00:48.24]</span>They are classified as venomous snakes because they <span class="underline">resemble</span> them, their <span class="underline">advanced</span> features more than the other non-venomous snakes. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.99" data-time="55.68">[00:55.68]</span>Now, what if I told you that there is a good <span class="underline">chance</span> that most everything I just said is wrong? <span class="time" data-times="4.1" data-time="62.67">[01:02.67]</span>Well, everything except the part about snakes evolving from lizards. <span class="time" data-times="13.95" data-time="66.77">[01:06.77]</span>See, the <span class="underline">basic</span> <span class="underline">theory</span> about snake <span class="underline">evolution</span> has been challenged by a recent study that revealed a whole new understanding of <span class="underline">evolutionary</span> relationship for reptiles, you know, which reptiles descended from which ancestors. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.61" data-time="80.72">[01:20.72]</span>The researchers study the proteins in the <span class="underline">venom</span> genes of various <span class="underline">species</span> of colubrids. <span class="time" data-times="6.01" data-time="86.33">[01:26.33]</span>Emm... snake <span class="underline">venom</span> is a mixture of proteins, some <span class="underline">toxic</span>, <span class="underline">poisonous</span>, and some not. <span class="time" data-times="13.93" data-time="92.34">[01:32.34]</span>By analyzing the DNA, the <span class="underline">genetic</span> <span class="underline">material</span> of the proteins, the researchers could <span class="underline">focus</span> on the <span class="underline">toxic</span> genes and use them to <span class="underline">trace</span> the <span class="underline">evolution</span> of snake <span class="underline">venom</span>, and from this, the <span class="underline">evolution</span> of snakes. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="14.78" data-time="106.27">[01:46.27]</span>Traditionally, to understanding <span class="underline">evolutionary</span> relationships, we looked at various easily observed <span class="underline">physical</span> characteristics of animals, their <span class="underline">skeleton</span>, the size of their brain, and... and then <span class="underline">classify</span> them based on similarities and differences. <span class="time" data-times="7.66" data-time="121.05">[02:01.05]</span>The problem with this <span class="underline">method</span> is that characteristics that <span class="underline">appear</span> <span class="underline">similar</span> may actually have developed in quite different ways. <span class="time" data-times="11.76" data-time="128.71">[02:08.71]</span>For example, some venoms are chemical-based, and others are bacteria-based, so they clearly had to have developed <span class="underline">along</span> different routes and may not be as closely related as we thought. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.6" data-time="140.47">[02:20.47]</span>Now, and not everyone will agree about this. <span class="time" data-times="5.02" data-time="144.07">[02:24.07]</span>The <span class="underline">classification</span> based on DNA seems to be much more <span class="underline">reliable</span>.<span class="time" data-times="2.46" data-time="149.09">[02:29.09]</span>Ok, back to the research. <span class="time" data-times="9.16" data-time="151.55">[02:31.55]</span>The researchers found that <span class="underline">venom</span> evolved before snakes <span class="underline">even</span> existed, about a hundred million years before. <span class="time" data-times="4.39" data-time="160.71">[02:40.71]</span>Now, a <span class="underline">couple</span> of venomous lizards were included in this study. <span class="time" data-times="5.79" data-time="165.1">[02:45.10]</span>And the researchers found some of the same DNA in their <span class="underline">venom</span> as in the snakes' <span class="underline">venom</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="19.54" data-time="170.89">[02:50.89]</span>This suggested that the <span class="underline">common</span> <span class="underline">ancestor</span> of all snakes was actually a venomous <span class="underline">lizard</span>, which means that actually, according to this research, anyway, in terms of the snakes' ancestry, there is no such thing as a non-venomous snake, not <span class="underline">even</span> colubrids. <span class="time" data-times="11.74" data-time="190.43">[03:10.43]</span>What separates colubrids from other snakes we have been classifying is venomous, is not the <span class="underline">lack</span> of <span class="underline">venom</span>, but the <span class="underline">lack</span> of an <span class="underline">effective</span> way to <span class="underline">deliver</span> the <span class="underline">venom</span> into its <span class="underline">prey</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="13.73" data-time="202.17">[03:22.17]</span>In most venomous snakes, like vipers and cobras, the <span class="underline">venom</span> is used to catch and immoblize the <span class="underline">prey</span>; but in colubrids, <span class="underline">venom</span> drips onto the <span class="underline">prey</span> only after the <span class="underline">prey</span> is in the snake's mouth. <span class="time" data-times="6.84" data-time="215.9">[03:35.90]</span>So for colubrids, the <span class="underline">venom</span> must serve some other purpose, maybe linked to digesting <span class="underline">prey</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="19.47" data-time="222.74">[03:42.74]</span>As the different families of venomous snakes evolved, the teeth moved <span class="underline">forward</span>, becoming larger, and the <span class="underline">venom</span> becoming stronger, so the <span class="underline">evolution</span> of the <span class="underline">obvious</span> venomous snakes, like cobras and vipers, is about the <span class="underline">evolution</span> of an <span class="underline">efficient</span> delivery system, not so much the <span class="underline">evolution</span> of the <span class="underline">venom</span> itself. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="12.26" data-time="242.21">[04:02.21]</span>So, if there are no truly non-venomous snakes, were the so-called non-venomous snakes, like constrictors and pythons, were they venomous at some point in their <span class="underline">evolution</span>? <span class="time" data-times="2.81" data-time="254.47">[04:14.47]</span>Well, that's not <span class="underline">clear</span> at this point. <span class="time" data-times="13.37" data-time="257.28">[04:17.28]</span>Constrictors have evolved to kill their <span class="underline">prey</span> by crushing, but perhaps they once were venomous, and then at some point their venom-producing <span class="underline">apparatus</span> wasn't needed anymore, so it <span class="underline">gradually</span> disappeared.<span class="time" data-times="8.24" data-time="270.65">[04:30.65]</span>There's one <span class="underline">species</span> of snake, the brown tree snake that uses both constriction and <span class="underline">venom</span>, depending on its <span class="underline">prey</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.36" data-time="278.89">[04:38.89]</span>So, well, it is possible. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.96" data-time="282.25">[04:42.25]</span>So, we have these new concepts of snakes' <span class="underline">evolution</span> and a new DNA database, all these information on the <span class="underline">genetic</span> makeup of snake <span class="underline">venom</span>.<span class="time" data-times="9.26" data-time="292.21">[04:52.21]</span>And what we have learned from this has led researchers to believe that <span class="underline">venom</span> proteins may have some <span class="underline">exciting</span> applications in the <span class="underline">field</span> of medical research. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="14.28" data-time="301.47">[05:01.47]</span>You see, <span class="underline">venom</span> alters biological functions in the same way certain drugs do, and the big <span class="underline">benefit</span> of drugs made from snakes <span class="underline">venom</span> would be that they <span class="underline">target</span> only certain cells, so maybe that'll create fewer side effects. <span class="time" data-times="4.82" data-time="315.75">[05:15.75]</span>Now, it sounds <span class="underline">far-fetched</span>, <span class="underline">venom</span> is the basis for human drugs. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="320.57">[05:20.57]</span>So far, only one <span class="underline">protein</span> has been targeted for study as a <span class="underline">potential</span> drug, but who knows, maybe someday. </p>
