Now, 'cause the two teams weren't working well together, the fixes were coming very very slowly. <span class="time" data-times="13.61" data-time="201.28">[03:21.28]</span>And you know, a lot of times when you <span class="highlight">fix</span> bugs you introduce new bugs, or you discover bugs and other areas that only come to light because something has been changed, so fixing all those new <span class="highlight">additional</span> bugs was also being delayed.<span class="time" data-times="9.94" data-time="214.89">[03:34.89]</span>Um... the test <span class="highlight">process</span> went on much longer than expected and we ended up having to put the product on the <span class="highlight">market</span> with known bugs in it, which was <span class="highlight">obviously</span> not <span class="highlight">ideal</span>. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.13" data-time="224.83">[03:44.83]</span>Student: Ok, and what about <span class="highlight">Project</span><span class="highlight">Unity</span>? <span class="time" data-times="1.1" data-time="228.96">[03:48.96]</span>How was it different? </p><p><span class="time" data-times="8.49" data-time="230.06">[03:50.06]</span>Professor: Um... this was different because two teams worked closely together during the <span class="highlight">defect</span> meetings, <span class="highlight">instead</span> of put up walls. <span class="time" data-times="4.85" data-time="238.55">[03:58.55]</span>Um... we didn't <span class="highlight">even</span> talked about, you know, who should <span class="highlight">fix</span> this, who is at <span class="highlight">fault</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.54" data-time="243.4">[04:03.40]</span>We all <span class="highlight">acknowledge</span> what needed to be fixed. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="9.13" data-time="245.94">[04:05.94]</span>So if we had ten bugs, we said, 'Hey, you know what?

To describe some recent improvements in computer technology.</p><p>B. To explain why so many software products have flaws when they are put on the market.</p><p>C. To show that creating good software depends on people with distinct roles working well together.</p><p>D. To discuss how the software development process has evolved since the time of early computers.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Through the full text, we can see that the professor has compared the examples of the two teams. The two team members have different roles and different results. This proves that a good software needs to have the roles of the team (developer and tester). Cooperation.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor,where does the term "bug" used for computer problems come from?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It originated because of similar between computer virus and real virus.</p><p>B. It is based on an incident in which an insect interfered with the function of any early computer.</p><p>C. It was first used by early computer scientists who noticed small problems in programming code.</p><p>D. It was first used by developers who did not like testers identifying problems in their work.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>When they detected it, they found a five-centimeter long moth caught in there. The speech explained that the word bug was used as the source of the computer problem.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>What points does the professor make about software developers? (2 answers).</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The work they do is mainly creative.</p><p>B. They enjoy the challenge of identifying problems to fix.</p><p>C. Their work is easier than the work of testers.</p><p>D. They are not always able to detect software problems.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="AD"><p>The mentality of the software developer is constructive, creative, they are spending long hours working together to create and build something new.(A)</p><p>My personal opinion is that they have to be different groups of people because developers often have a bias for their own work, and it blinds them to certain problems that might be obvious to somebody else. (D)</p><p>Professor pointed out that developer 1. is creative, 2. Because of their own code, sometimes they can not find the problem.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What factor made work on Project Unity efficient?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. No unplanned changes were made during defect meetings.</p><p>B. The teams focused on fixing only major problems.</p><p>C. The software developers were not defensive about problems detected by the testers.</p><p>D. Some of the software testers had previous experience as software developers.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Um... this was different because two teams worked closely together during the defect meetings, instead of putting up walls. From the dialog we can see that in Project Unity, there was no hostile mentality between developer and tester.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>How did the software product developed during Project Split differ from the product developed during Project Unity?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The Project Split product was released to the market in a shorter amount of time.</p><p>B. The Project Split product could be used in more types of computer systems.</p><p>C. The Project Split product cost less money to develop.</p><p>D. The Project Split product was of inferior quality.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>Um... the test process went on much longer than expected and we ended up having to the the product on the market with known bugs in it, which was clearly not ideal.</p><p>When talking about the results of the Project Split, the professor said that in the end it had to put products with known bugs on the market, that is, the product quality was poor.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>When the professor discusses some work meeting attended by two teams,why does he say this:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To emphasize the fact that the two teams were in conflict with one another.</p><p>B. To make the point that testers are just as important as developers.</p><p>C. To indicate that the teams had different ideas about how to market the new software.</p><p>D. To emphasize the importance of meeting in the development process.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>Literally, the testers and the developers sat on opposite sides on the table. The professor said this to emphasize the conflict between tester and developer.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
