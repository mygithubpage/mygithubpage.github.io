              <span class="time" data-times="4.72" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in a Computer Science class. <span class="time" data-times="3.76" data-time="4.72">[00:04.72]</span>The professor is discussing software <span class="highlight">engineering</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="14.46" data-time="8.48">[00:08.48]</span>Professor: We've been talking about the software <span class="highlight">development</span> <span class="highlight">cycle</span>, and today I'd like to move on to the next <span class="highlight">stage</span> of that cycle-testing, and why finding bugs during testing is actually a great thing. <span class="time" data-times="7.88" data-time="22.94">[00:22.94]</span>Eh...eh... the <span class="highlight">quality</span> of the software product often relies heavily on how well it's been tested. Liz? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.15" data-time="30.82">[00:30.82]</span>Student: Um... just a quick thing. <span class="time" data-times="3.33" data-time="33.97">[00:33.97]</span>Bugs is the word for problems in the program <span class="highlight">code</span>, correct? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.9" data-time="37.3">[00:37.30]</span>Professor: Yeah, in <span class="highlight">code</span> or in a computer itself. <span class="time" data-times="2.79" data-time="40.2">[00:40.20]</span>There is a bit of a story behind that <span class="highlight">term</span>. <span class="time" data-times="10.99" data-time="42.99">[00:42.99]</span>Um... back in the 1940s, when the computer <span class="highlight">industry</span> was just starting, a group of computer scientists was working late one night, and there was a problem in one of the computers' circuits. <span class="time" data-times="4.82" data-time="53.98">[00:53.98]</span>When they examined it, they found a five-centimeter long <span class="highlight">moth</span> caught in there. <span class="time" data-times="4" data-time="58.8">[00:58.80]</span>Once they debugged the computer, it worked just fine. <span class="time" data-times="4.72" data-time="62.8">[01:02.80]</span>And ever since then, all kinds of computer problems have been known as bugs. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.71" data-time="67.52">[01:07.52]</span>Anyway, you want to find bugs while the software is still in the <span class="highlight">development</span> and testing phases.<span class="time" data-times="5.04" data-time="73.23">[01:13.23]</span>Finding them when the software product has already been put on the <span class="highlight">market</span> can be quite embarrassing. <span class="time" data-times="7.53" data-time="78.27">[01:18.27]</span>Generally speaking, every software <span class="highlight">development</span> <span class="highlight">project</span> has a group of testers and a group of developers. Jack? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.55" data-time="85.8">[01:25.80]</span>Student: And they are different people? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.98" data-time="89.35">[01:29.35]</span>Professor: They are generally completely different group of people. <span class="time" data-times="12.26" data-time="92.33">[01:32.33]</span>My <span class="highlight">personal</span> opinion is that they have to be different groups of people because developers often have a <span class="highlight">bias</span> for their own work, and it blinds them to certain problems that might be <span class="highlight">obvious</span> to somebody else. <span class="time" data-times="6.02" data-time="104.59">[01:44.59]</span>So it is always good to have a different set of eyes to go in there and make sure that everything is tested properly. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.96" data-time="110.61">[01:50.61]</span>Ok, now, here's the key. <span class="time" data-times="4.62" data-time="112.57">[01:52.57]</span>Developers and testers have different mentalities. <span class="time" data-times="9.36" data-time="117.19">[01:57.19]</span>The mentality of the software developer is <span class="highlight">constructive</span>, <span class="highlight">creative</span>; they are spending long hours working together to create and build something new.<span class="time" data-times="8.32" data-time="126.55">[02:06.55]</span>A software tester, on the other hand, their entire goal is to look at this product and find problems with it, to <span class="highlight">improve</span> it. <span class="time" data-times="6.78" data-time="134.87">[02:14.87]</span>Now, this <span class="highlight">difference</span> between the testers and the developers can <span class="highlight">lead</span> to an environment where there is a bit of <span class="highlight">friction</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.12" data-time="141.65">[02:21.65]</span>And that <span class="highlight">friction</span> sometimes makes it difficult for the two teams to work together. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.77" data-time="145.77">[02:25.77]</span>There are two projects that I worked on a <span class="highlight">couple</span> of years ago. <span class="time" data-times="6.93" data-time="151.54">[02:31.54]</span>One, which I'll call <span class="highlight">Project</span> <span class="highlight">Split</span>, well, the testing and <span class="highlight">development</span> teams did not work well together. <span class="time" data-times="5.43" data-time="158.47">[02:38.47]</span>And the other, I'll call <span class="highlight">Project</span> <span class="highlight">Unity</span>, during which both teams worked very well together. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="11.69" data-time="163.9">[02:43.90]</span>Now, during <span class="highlight">Project</span> <span class="highlight">Split</span>, we had <span class="highlight">defect</span> meetings where the developers and the testers met together, eh... eh... to discuss various problems and how they should be fixed. <span class="time" data-times="3.69" data-time="175.59">[02:55.59]</span>And you could <span class="highlight">sense</span> the <span class="highlight">conflict</span> just by walking into the room. <span class="time" data-times="5.6" data-time="179.28">[02:59.28]</span> <span class="highlight">Literally</span>, the testers and the developers sat on <span class="highlight">opposite</span> sides on the table.<span class="time" data-times="4.32" data-time="184.88">[03:04.88]</span>Um... and ... and the developers were very <span class="highlight">defensive</span> about the <span class="highlight">feedback</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.74" data-time="189.2">[03:09.20]</span>Student: Well, if bugs are being <span class="highlight">pointed</span> out they wouldn't be too happy since it's their work. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.34" data-time="193.94">[03:13.94]</span>Professor: Exactly. Now, 'cause the two teams weren't working well together, the fixes were coming very very slowly. <span class="time" data-times="13.61" data-time="201.28">[03:21.28]</span>And you know, a lot of times when you <span class="highlight">fix</span> bugs you introduce new bugs, or you discover bugs and other areas that only come to light because something has been changed, so fixing all those new <span class="highlight">additional</span> bugs was also being delayed.<span class="time" data-times="9.94" data-time="214.89">[03:34.89]</span>Um... the test <span class="highlight">process</span> went on much longer than expected and we ended up having to put the product on the <span class="highlight">market</span> with known bugs in it, which was <span class="highlight">obviously</span> not <span class="highlight">ideal</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.13" data-time="224.83">[03:44.83]</span>Student: Ok, and what about <span class="highlight">Project</span> <span class="highlight">Unity</span>? <span class="time" data-times="1.1" data-time="228.96">[03:48.96]</span>How was it different? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.49" data-time="230.06">[03:50.06]</span>Professor: Um... this was different because two teams worked closely together during the <span class="highlight">defect</span> meetings, <span class="highlight">instead</span> of put up walls. <span class="time" data-times="4.85" data-time="238.55">[03:58.55]</span>Um... we didn't <span class="highlight">even</span> talked about, you know, who should <span class="highlight">fix</span> this, who is at <span class="highlight">fault</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.54" data-time="243.4">[04:03.40]</span>We all <span class="highlight">acknowledge</span> what needed to be fixed. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.13" data-time="245.94">[04:05.94]</span>So if we had ten bugs, we said, 'Hey, you know what? Let's do this one first 'cause this would <span class="highlight">expose</span> another whole <span class="highlight">bunch</span> of defects that we <span class="highlight">haven</span>'t <span class="highlight">even</span> seen yet.' <span class="time" data-times="3.25" data-time="255.07">[04:15.07]</span>So we were being proactive and <span class="highlight">effective</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="258.32">[04:18.32]</span>And because we were so much more <span class="highlight">effective</span> with our time, we were actually able to do more than just <span class="highlight">fix</span> the bugs, we <span class="highlight">even</span> put in some improvements that we hadn't planned. </p>
