What a way to begin! Lost going to orientation. ... You're right, the general ones. I went to one of those sessions ealier today. But now I need the one for my major, engineering . My schedule says the meeting room is in ... Johnson Hall? In the engineering department, which should be right here in front of us, according to the map? But this building is called the Morgan Hall.</p><p>From the above dialogue, it can be seen that the boys are not unaware of the location of the general orientation session but they cannot find the location.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the cause of the man's problem?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. He did not allow enough time to find the location of his orientation session.</p><p>B. He did not receive the orientation materials on time.</p><p>C. He is not using the most up-to-date map.</p><p>D. He made a mistake reading his map.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>I got a second pack in the mail more recently with another one of these maps in it. I guess they must have the updated name. I left that one in my dorm room. From the conversation, the boys are not using the latest version of the map. .</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why was the building given a new name?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To acknowledge a large donation from a prominent engineering graduate.</p><p>B. To honor an important professor who retired recently.</p><p>C. To represent the engineering department that moved into it.</p><p>D. To honor a former student who became an astronaut.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>This building was renamed after one of our professors. She retired a few months ago. She is very well-known in the world of physics. From the dialogue, the name was changed to commemorate a recently retired professor.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the man's attitude toward his new university?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. He is impressed by the architecture of the buildings.</p><p>B. He does not value its long tradition in aerospace engineering.</p><p>C. He thinks it needs a more efficient orientation program.</p><p>D. He believes it will help him become successful in his chosen field.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>Professor: Unfortunately, I thinks his ideas are going out of style. Science kept marching forward.</p><p>Student: I'll say it does. That's why I transferred to this university. I was really impressed with all the research equipment you guys have at the laboratories. You are really on the forefront.</p><p>From the above dialogue, it can be seen that the reason why male students transfer to explain this university is that the school has advanced equipment and is at the academic frontier, indicating that he believes the school can help him succeed in the selected field.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor imply about aerospace engineering students?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They have more possibilities for jobs if they take additional math courses.</p><p>B. Many of them eventually teach math courses at other universities.</p><p>C. Many of them have unrealistic expectations about becoming astronauts.</p><p>D. They are not required to take a math course for a degree in the department.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>Professor is very clear that students with a strong mathematical background can have more opportunities in this field. There are many more opportunities available in the field when you have a strong math background.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
