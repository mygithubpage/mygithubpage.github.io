        Earth's <span class="highlight">internal</span> heat, fueled by radioactivity, provides the energy for <span class="highlight">plate</span><span class="highlight">tectonics</span> and <span class="highlight">continental</span><span class="highlight">drift</span>, mountain building, and earthquakes. It can also be harnessed to <span class="highlight">drive</span> electric generators and heat homes. <span class="highlight">Geothermal</span> energy becomes <span class="highlight">available</span> in a <span class="highlight"><span class="question2">practical</span></span>form when <span class="highlight">underground</span> heat is transferred by water that is heated as it passes <span class="highlight">through</span> a <span class="highlight">subsurface</span><span class="highlight">region</span> of hot rocks (a heat <span class="highlight">reservoir</span>) that may be hundreds or thousands of feet deep. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>The water is usually naturally occurring <span class="highlight">groundwater</span> that seeps down <span class="highlight">along</span> fractures in the rock; less typically, the water is artificially introduced by being pumped down from the surface. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>The water is brought to the surface, as a <span class="highlight">liquid</span> or steam, <span class="highlight">through</span> holes drilled for the purpose. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span></p><p><span id="arrow"></span>By far the most <span class="highlight"><span class="question3">abundant</span></span>form of <span class="highlight">geothermal</span> energy occurs at the <span class="highlight">relatively</span> low temperatures of 80ï¿½ to 180ï¿½ <span class="highlight">centigrade</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>Water circulated <span class="highlight">through</span>
 heat reservoirs in this <span class="highlight">temperature</span><span class="highlight">range</span> is able to <span class="highlight">extract</span> enough heat to warm <span class="highlight">residential</span>, <span class="highlight">commercial</span>, and <span class="highlight">industrial</span> spaces. More than 20,000 apartments in France are now heated by warm
 <span class="highlight">underground</span> water drawn from a heat <span class="highlight">reservoir</span> in a geologic structure near Paris called the Paris Basin. Iceland sits on a <span class="highlight">volcanic</span> structure known as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Reykjavik,
 the capital of Iceland, is <span class="highlight">entirely</span> heated by <span class="highlight">geothermal</span> energy derived from <span class="highlight">volcanic</span> heat.</p><p><span class="highlight">Geothermal</span> reservoirs with temperatures above 180ï¿½ <span class="highlight">centigrade</span> are useful for generating <span class="highlight">electricity</span>. They <span class="highlight">occur</span><span class="highlight">primarily</span> in regions of recent <span class="highlight">volcanic</span><span class="highlight">activity</span> as hot, dry rock; natural hot water; or natural steam. The <span class="highlight">latter</span> two sources are limited to those few areas where surface water seeps down <span class="highlight">through</span><span class="highlight">underground</span> faults or fractures to <span class="highlight">reach</span> deep rocks heated by the recent <span class="highlight">activity</span> of <span class="highlight">molten</span> rock <span class="highlight">material</span>. The world's largest <span class="highlight">supply</span> of natural steam occurs at The Geysers, 120 kilometers north of San Francisco, California. In the 1990s enough <span class="highlight">electricity</span> to meet about half the needs of San Francisco was being generated there. This <span class="highlight">facility</span> was then in its third <span class="highlight">decade</span> of production and was beginning to show signs of <span class="highlight">decline</span>, perhaps because of over <span class="highlight">development</span>. By the late 1990s some 70 <span class="highlight">geothermal</span> electric-generating plants were in operation in California, Utah, Nevada, and Hawaii, generating enough power to <span class="highlight">supply</span> about a million people. Eighteen countries now <span class="highlight">generate</span><span class="highlight">electricity</span> using <span class="highlight">geothermal</span> heat.</p><p>Extracting heat from very hot, dry rocks presents a more difficult problem: the rocks must be fractured to <span class="highlight">permit</span> the <span class="highlight">circulation</span> of water, and the water must be provided artificially. The rocks are fractured by water pumped down at very high pressures. Experiments are under way to develop technologies for <span class="question9">exploiting </span>this <span class="highlight">resource</span>.</p><p>Like most other energy sources, <span class="highlight">geothermal</span> energy presents some <span class="highlight">environmental</span> problems. The surface of the ground can sink if hot <span class="highlight">groundwater</span> is withdrawn without being replaced. In <span class="highlight">addition</span>, water heated geothermally can <span class="highlight">contain</span> salts and <span class="highlight"><span class="question10">toxic</span> materials </span>dissolved from the hot rock. These waters present a <span class="highlight">disposal</span> problem if they are not returned to the ground from which they were removed.</p><p>The <span class="highlight">contribution</span> of <span class="highlight">geothermal</span> energy to the world's energy future is difficult to <span class="highlight">estimate</span>. <span class="highlight"><span class="question11">Geothermal</span> energy is in a <span class="highlight">sense</span> not renewable, because in most cases the heat would be drawn out of a <span class="highlight">reservoir</span> much more rapidly than it would be replaced by the very slow geological processes by which heat flows <span class="highlight">through</span><span class="highlight">solid</span> rock into a heat <span class="highlight">reservoir</span>. </span>However, in many places (for example, California, Hawaii, the Philippines, Japan, Mexico, the rift valleys of Africa)the <span class="highlight">resource</span> is potentially so large that its future will <span class="highlight">depend</span> on the economics of production. At present, we can make <span class="highlight">efficient</span> use of only naturally occurring hot water or steam deposits. Although the <span class="highlight">potential</span> is <span class="highlight">enormous</span>, it is likely that in the near future <span class="highlight">geothermal</span> energy can make important <span class="highlight">local</span> contributions only where the <span class="highlight">resource</span> is close to the user and the economics are <span class="highlight">favorable</span>, as they are in California, New Zealand, and Iceland. <span class="highlight">Geothermal</span> energy probably will not make large-scale contributions to the world energy <span class="highlight">budget</span> until well into the twenty-first <span class="highlight">century</span>, if ever.</p></article></div><div id="question"><div id="question1"><p>According to the processes described in paragraph 1, what is the relationship between radioactivity and the steam produced by geothermal heat?</p><label class="my-label"><span>A.
