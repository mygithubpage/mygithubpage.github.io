        Earth's <span class="highlight">internal</span> heat, fueled by radioactivity, provides the energy for <span class="highlight">plate</span><span class="highlight">tectonics</span> and <span class="highlight">continental</span><span class="highlight">drift</span>, mountain building, and earthquakes. It can also be harnessed to <span class="highlight">drive</span> electric generators and heat homes. <span class="highlight">Geothermal</span> energy becomes <span class="highlight">available</span> in a <span class="highlight"><span class="question2">practical</span></span> form when <span class="highlight">underground</span> heat is transferred by water that is heated as it passes <span class="highlight">through</span> a <span class="highlight">subsurface</span><span class="highlight">region</span> of hot rocks (a heat <span class="highlight">reservoir</span>) that may be hundreds or thousands of feet deep. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>The water is usually naturally occurring <span class="highlight">groundwater</span> that seeps down <span class="highlight">along</span> fractures in the rock; less typically, the water is artificially introduced by being pumped down from the surface. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>The water is brought to the surface, as a <span class="highlight">liquid</span> or steam, <span class="highlight">through</span> holes drilled for the purpose. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span></p><p>By far the most <span class="highlight"><span class="question3">abundant</span></span> form of <span class="highlight">geothermal</span> energy occurs at the <span class="highlight">relatively</span> low temperatures of 80ï¿½ to 180ï¿½ <span class="highlight">centigrade</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>Water circulated <span class="highlight">through</span>
 heat reservoirs in this <span class="highlight">temperature</span><span class="highlight">range</span> is able to <span class="highlight">extract</span> enough heat to warm <span class="highlight">residential</span>, <span class="highlight">commercial</span>, and <span class="highlight">industrial</span> spaces. More than 20,000 apartments in France are now heated by warm
 <span class="highlight">underground</span> water drawn from a heat <span class="highlight">reservoir</span> in a geologic structure near Paris called the Paris Basin. Iceland sits on a <span class="highlight">volcanic</span> structure known as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Reykjavik,
 the capital of Iceland, is <span class="highlight">entirely</span> heated by <span class="highlight">geothermal</span> energy derived from <span class="highlight">volcanic</span> heat.</p><p><span class="highlight">Geothermal</span> reservoirs with temperatures above 180ï¿½ <span class="highlight">centigrade</span> are useful for generating <span class="highlight">electricity</span>. They <span class="highlight">occur</span><span class="highlight">primarily</span> in regions of recent <span class="highlight">volcanic</span><span class="highlight">activity</span> as hot, dry rock; natural hot water; or natural steam. The <span class="highlight">latter</span> two sources are limited to those few areas where surface water seeps down <span class="highlight">through</span><span class="highlight">underground</span> faults or fractures to <span class="highlight">reach</span> deep rocks heated by the recent <span class="highlight">activity</span> of <span class="highlight">molten</span> rock <span class="highlight">material</span>. The world's largest <span class="highlight">supply</span> of natural steam occurs at The Geysers, 120 kilometers north of San Francisco, California. In the 1990s enough <span class="highlight">electricity</span> to meet about half the needs of San Francisco was being generated there. This <span class="highlight">facility</span> was then in its third <span class="highlight">decade</span> of production and was beginning to show signs of <span class="highlight">decline</span>, perhaps because of over <span class="highlight">development</span>. By the late 1990s some 70 <span class="highlight">geothermal</span> electric-generating plants were in operation in California, Utah, Nevada, and Hawaii, generating enough power to <span class="highlight">supply</span> about a million people. Eighteen countries now <span class="highlight">generate</span><span class="highlight">electricity</span> using <span class="highlight">geothermal</span> heat.</p><p>Extracting heat from very hot, dry rocks presents a more difficult problem: the rocks must be fractured to <span class="highlight">permit</span> the <span class="highlight">circulation</span> of water, and the water must be provided artificially. The rocks are fractured by water pumped down at very high pressures. Experiments are under way to develop technologies for <span class="question9">exploiting</span> this <span class="highlight">resource</span>.</p><p>Like most other energy sources, <span class="highlight">geothermal</span> energy presents some <span class="highlight">environmental</span> problems. The surface of the ground can sink if hot <span class="highlight">groundwater</span> is withdrawn without being replaced. In <span class="highlight">addition</span>, water heated geothermally can <span class="highlight">contain</span> salts and <span class="question10"><span class="highlight">toxic</span> materials</span> dissolved from the hot rock. These waters present a <span class="highlight">disposal</span> problem if they are not returned to the ground from which they were removed.</p><p>The <span class="highlight">contribution</span> of <span class="highlight">geothermal</span> energy to the world's energy future is difficult to <span class="highlight">estimate</span>. <span class="question11"><span class="highlight">Geothermal</span> energy is in a <span class="highlight">sense</span> not renewable, because in most cases the heat would be drawn out of a <span class="highlight">reservoir</span> much more rapidly than it would be replaced by the very slow geological processes by which heat flows <span class="highlight">through</span><span class="highlight">solid</span> rock into a heat <span class="highlight">reservoir</span>.</span> However, in many places (for example, California, Hawaii, the Philippines, Japan, Mexico, the rift valleys of Africa)the <span class="highlight">resource</span> is potentially so large that its future will <span class="highlight">depend</span> on the economics of production. At present, we can make <span class="highlight">efficient</span> use of only naturally occurring hot water or steam deposits. Although the <span class="highlight">potential</span> is <span class="highlight">enormous</span>, it is likely that in the near future <span class="highlight">geothermal</span> energy can make important <span class="highlight">local</span> contributions only where the <span class="highlight">resource</span> is close to the user and the economics are <span class="highlight">favorable</span>, as they are in California, New Zealand, and Iceland. <span class="highlight">Geothermal</span> energy probably will not make large-scale contributions to the world energy <span class="highlight">budget</span> until well into the twenty-first <span class="highlight">century</span>, if ever.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the processes described in paragraph 1, what is the relationship between radioactivity and the steam produced by geothermal heat?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Geothermally heated steam is produced when water is exposed to radioactivity deep underground.</p><p>B. When water is introduced into holes drilled thousands of feet in the ground, it becomes radioactive and turns to steam.</p><p>C. Radioactivity heats Earth's interior rock, which in turn can heat water to the point it becomes steam.</p><p>D. When a reservoir of steam in subsurface rock is produced by radioactivity, it is said to be geothermally heated.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C detailed questions, ask the relationship between radioactivity and steam, so find double keywords, respectively, positioning to the first sentence and the last sentence of this paragraph, the first sentence said that radioactivity provides the heat of the earth, the last sentence said that the water into the steam to reach the surface The water is heated by steam, and this heat is provided by geothermal energy. This is the relationship between the two, so the answer is C. When A's water is exposed to the radioactive underground steam does not say; B water becomes radioactive did not say; D's radioactivity generates steam is not reliable</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question2">practical</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. usable</p><p>B. plentiful</p><p>C. economical</p><p>D. familiar</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" A"><p>A <span class="question2">practical</span>: <span class="question2">practical</span>, available. A is available, B is a lot, C is economical, saving, D is familiar. The answer is A's usable.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question3">abundant</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. economical</p><p>B. familiar</p><p>C. plentiful</p><p>D. useful</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" C"><p>C <span class="question3">abundant</span>: A large number, sufficient. A is economical and economical; B is familiar; C is many and <span class="question3">abundant</span>; D is useful. According to the word meaning, the answer is plentiful of C.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 2, which of the following is true about heat reservoirs with a temperature in the range of 80ï¿½ to 180ï¿½ centigrade?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They are under international control.</p><p>B. They are more common than reservoirs that have a higher temperature.</p><p>C. Few of them produce enough heat to warm large industrial spaces.</p><p>D. They are used to generate electricity.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B. Positioning the keyword to the first sentence with 80 to 180 degrees, saying that the most <span class="question3">abundant</span> geothermal energy is in the range of 80 to 180 degrees, so the synonymous substitution is B's more common than higher temperature. A's international control did not say the original; C and the second sentence of this paragraph said the opposite; D was not mentioned in this paragraph, but the next paragraph said that higher than 180 degrees can be used to generate electricity, so D said it was the opposite.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 3, what is the connection between underground faults and naturally occurring steam?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Underground faults enable the heat from molten-rock material to escape upward to regions where it can heat surface water enough to produce steam.</p><p>B. Underground faults are created by steam that is produced in geothermal reservoirs deep inside Earth.</p><p>C. Underground faults create spaces in which natural steam is sometimes trapped.</p><p>D. Underground faults allow surface water to reach deep rocks that are hot enough to turn it into steam.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D is again a question that asks the relationship between the two, finds double keywords, and locates the third sentence, saying that natural hot water and natural steam exist only in those locations, surface water seeps into the ground through the fault or fracture, and it is heated. Blabla, the answer is obviously D. A said that the fault heat run up, and the original direction of the anti-reported, the original is the water running down; B said that steam created a fault completely not fly; C steam was trap did not say the original.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>In paragraph 3, why does the author mention that in the 1990s The Geysers was in its third decade of production?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To provide the historical context of the geothermal production of electricity in the United States</p><p>B. To imply that The Geysers was the first geothermal site to be put into production in California</p><p>C. To help explain the signs of decline shown by The Geysers</p><p>D. To explain why 70 new geothermal sites were put into electricity production in the late 1990s</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C. Rhetoric purpose. First read the example. The sentence is just the detail. It should be looked at according to the convention. But the previous sentence has already been read on the previous question. It has nothing to do with the answer. In the past, another reason to look at the next sentence is because of pronouns. This, the following sentence says that G has gone through 30 years of operation and has shown signs of decline, probably because of over-development, so the answer is C, and the contents of A and B are not mentioned in the original; D itself is also a detail.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the following can be inferred from paragraphs 2 and 3 about geothermal reservoirs?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Volcanic heat is associated only with geothermal reservoirs that have a temperature over 180ï¿½ centigrade.</p><p>B. More countries produce power from geothermal reservoirs than use them for heating buildings.</p><p>C. Most geothermal reservoirs are suitable for producing electricity.</p><p>D. A higher geothermal reservoir temperature is needed to generate electricity than is needed to heat homes.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D. This problem is solved faster by using the exclusion method. A and the first sentence of the second paragraph are said to be the opposite and the wrong; the second paragraph just says that geothermal energy can be used to heat the building, not saying that most, B is wrong; both C and D can be from two paragraphs. In the first sentence, the second paragraph said that it was mostly between 80 and 180 degrees. In the third paragraph, it said that the power generation needed more than 180 degrees, so the power generation was higher than other temperatures. D was right and C was against.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, extracting heat from very hot, dry rocks is difficult in part because</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. the underground rock must be fractured before heat can be removed from it</p><p>B. the water above the rock is under very high pressure</p><p>C. the rock breaks apart when water is pumped into it</p><p>D. the water circulated through the rock must be much cooler than the rock itself</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A. The entire problem is targeted at the first sentence. It is particularly difficult to extract heat from hot and dry rock. It must be fracture rock first, and the water must be introduced artificially. So the answer is A. D did not say that the original B and C do have to say, but why not answer is difficult, that is, the option to answer is not asked, so it is not right.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question9">exploiting</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. locating</p><p>B. increasing</p><p>C. making use of</p><p>D. estimating the size of</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" C"><p>C exploit: Development, use. A is position; B is increase; C is use, use; D is estimated size. So C's making use of it is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>How is the problem that the surface may sink related to the problem that water heated geothermally may contain |toxic materials|</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Both problems could be solved by returning groundwater that is removed from an underground heat reservoir back to the reservoir after heat is extracted from it.</p><p>B. The problem of sinking is more difficult to solve than is the problem of toxic materials.</p><p>C. Land at the surface sinks because the rock beneath the surface is weakened when salts and toxic materials are removed from it in the process of extracting geothermal energy.</p><p>D. Both problems are caused by the fact that the hot groundwater in a heat reservoir dissolves the rock, which weakens the rock and makes the water toxic with salt.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A is another question that asks the relationship between the two. Originally, you should find double keywords. However, this section is too short. You might as well read the keyword. After the rapid sweep, it was found that both of these problems were caused by the problems caused by the exploitation of groundwater. In the second sentence, it was emphasized that if the groundwater is removed, the surface will sink if it is not added back; and the last sentence says that if it is not When groundwater is added back, these waters will have the problem of cleaning up because they contain toxic substances. So the solution to the two problems is to add the groundwater that is pumped back, so the answer is A. The two issues are in a side-by-side relationship. There is neither comparison nor causality, so neither B nor C is correct; D's dissolution does not dissolve the original, nor is it correct.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Heat flows through solid rock very slowly, so it takes a very long time for geological processes to produce a reservoir of geothermal energy.</p><p>B. Geothermal energy is not renewable because heat flows very slowly through solid rock into or out of a heat reservoir.</p><p>C. The heat quickly removed from a heat reservoir is replaced so slowly by geological processes that geothermal energy is not practically speaking, renewable.</p><p>D. In most cases, heat travels into a heat reservoir so slowfy that it is a much quicker process to remove the heat from a reservoir than to replace it.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The main logic of C original sentence is cause and effect, the result is geothermal energy is not renewable, because the extraction speed is much faster than the speed of supply, and in the causal logic, the result is particularly important, so the previous results must have, A and D excludes; another logical relationship in the original sentence occurs in the cause. There is a comparison in the reason that draw out is faster than replace, C reproduces the comparison, B does not, so the correct answer is C.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>In paragraph 6, the author implies that in California, Hawaii, the Philippines, Japan, Mexico, and the rift valleys of Africa the potential size of the geothermal resource is so large that</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. it might be economically worth developing these sites even though geothermal energy is not renewable</p><p>B. these sites will be the first geothermal energy sites to be developed with new technology</p><p>C. these sites are likely to make a large-scale contribution to the world energy budget in the twenty-first century</p><p>D. it does not matter whether they have naturally occurring deposits of hot water or steam</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A First read the details of the sentence, said that in these places where resources are so <span class="question3">abundant</span>, the prospects for the use of resources depends on the economies of production production economy. Among the four answers, only A mentions whether the exploitation is cost-effective, so the answer is A. The original text of B and D did not say directly; C went to the last sentence, and it had nothing to do with the example. Note that MS also has an example in the penultimate sentence, but the question is not that.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>In either case, the heated water will usually be under considerable pressure, and so may have a temperature that is well above its sea-level boiling point of 100ï¿½ centigrade..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B. There is enough transition point for this question. In either case, there must be two cases before the correct insertion point. B is determined directly, because there are two situations, conventionally and less typically.</p></div></div><div id="question14" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>Heat reservoirs in the form of hot rock far beneath Earth's surface are a potential source of usable geothermal energy.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.Heat reservoirs with a temperature from 80ï¿½ to 180ï¿½ centigrade can be used, as in France and Iceland, to heat buildings.</p><p>B.Most heat reservoirs with a temperature above 180ï¿½ centigrade cannot be used for energy because they are usually too close to recent volcanic activity.</p><p>C.Experiments are under way to determine if geothermally heated waters could be used as a source of certain minerals that have been dissolved out of hot rocks deep within Earth.</p><p>D.A number of countries now use geothermal reservoirs that contain water or steam above 180ï¿½ centigrade to generate electricity</p><p>E.The sinking of land above heat reservoirs and other environmental problems arise when water is pumped into a heat reservoir under high pressure.</p><p>F.A number of issues, including how to extract heat from reservoirs that do not have a natural supply of water, will significantly limit the use of geothermal energy for the foreseeable future.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="ADF"><p>A.D.F</p><p>  The Heat option corresponds to the second paragraph of the original text, and it is correct; be careful not to take this option as a detail because of the temperature and the state, even when the details are correct, you can use the exclusion method of other options to solve the problem of the Most Heat option and say the first sentence of the third paragraph of the original text. Do not select the Experiments option MS corresponds to the last sentence of the fourth paragraph of the original text, but the original statement is that the use of thermal energy, not minerals, so this option does not select the A number of countries option corresponds to the first paragraph of the original paragraph, correct; pay attention not to temperature this Options as details</p><p>The sinking option is incomprehensible, it seems that there is a syntax error, I do not know if it is not my TPO version of the problem, but even if this option syntax is no problem, it should be the details of the fifth paragraph, or simply did not say, so do not choose The A number of issues option corresponds to the sixth paragraph of the original text.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
