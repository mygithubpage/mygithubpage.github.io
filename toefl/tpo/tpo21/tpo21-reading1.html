            <b>Geothermal Energy</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>By far the most <span class="underline">abundant</span> form of <span class="underline">geothermal</span> energy occurs at the <span class="underline">relatively</span> low temperatures of 80° to 180° <span class="underline">centigrade</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>Water circulated <span class="underline">through</span> 
 heat reservoirs in this <span class="underline">temperature</span> <span class="underline">range</span> is able to <span class="underline">extract</span> enough heat to warm <span class="underline">residential</span>, <span class="underline">commercial</span>, and <span class="underline">industrial</span> spaces. More than 20,000 apartments in France are now heated by warm 
 <span class="underline">underground</span> water drawn from a heat <span class="underline">reservoir</span> in a geologic structure near Paris called the Paris Basin. Iceland sits on a <span class="underline">volcanic</span> structure known as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Reykjavik, 
 the capital of Iceland, is <span class="underline">entirely</span> heated by <span class="underline">geothermal</span> energy derived from <span class="underline">volcanic</span> heat.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="underline">Geothermal</span> reservoirs with temperatures above 180° <span class="underline">centigrade</span> are useful for generating <span class="underline">electricity</span>. They <span class="underline">occur</span> <span class="underline">primarily</span> in regions of recent <span class="underline">volcanic</span> <span class="underline">activity</span> as hot, dry rock; natural hot water; or natural steam. The <span class="underline">latter</span> two sources are limited to those few areas where surface water seeps down <span class="underline">through</span> <span class="underline">underground</span> faults or fractures to <span class="underline">reach</span> deep rocks heated by the recent <span class="underline">activity</span> of <span class="underline">molten</span> rock <span class="underline">material</span>. The world's largest <span class="underline">supply</span> of natural steam occurs at The Geysers, 120 kilometers north of San Francisco, California. In the 1990s enough <span class="underline">electricity</span> to meet about half the needs of San Francisco was being generated there. This <span class="underline">facility</span> was then in its third <span class="underline">decade</span> of production and was beginning to show signs of <span class="underline">decline</span>, perhaps because of over <span class="underline">development</span>. By the late 1990s some 70 <span class="underline">geothermal</span> electric-generating plants were in operation in California, Utah, Nevada, and Hawaii, generating enough power to <span class="underline">supply</span> about a million people. Eighteen countries now <span class="underline">generate</span> <span class="underline">electricity</span> using <span class="underline">geothermal</span> heat.</p>
          <p>Extracting heat from very hot, dry rocks presents a more difficult problem: the rocks must be fractured to <span class="underline">permit</span> the <span class="underline">circulation</span> of water, and the water must be provided artificially. The rocks are fractured by water pumped down at very high pressures. Experiments are under way to develop technologies for exploiting this <span class="underline">resource</span>.</p>
          <p>Like most other energy sources, <span class="underline">geothermal</span> energy presents some <span class="underline">environmental</span> problems. The surface of the ground can sink if hot <span class="underline">groundwater</span> is withdrawn without being replaced. In <span class="underline">addition</span>, water heated geothermally can <span class="underline">contain</span> salts and <span class="underline">toxic</span> materials dissolved from the hot rock. These waters present a <span class="underline">disposal</span> problem if they are not returned to the ground from which they were removed.</p>
          <p>The <span class="underline">contribution</span> of <span class="underline">geothermal</span> energy to the world's energy future is difficult to <span class="underline">estimate</span>. <span class="underline">Geothermal</span> energy is in a <span class="underline">sense</span> not renewable, because in most cases the heat would be drawn out of a <span class="underline">reservoir</span> much more rapidly than it would be replaced by the very slow geological processes by which heat flows <span class="underline">through</span> <span class="underline">solid</span> rock into a heat <span class="underline">reservoir</span>. However, in many places (for example, California, Hawaii, the Philippines, Japan, Mexico, the rift valleys of Africa)the <span class="underline">resource</span> is potentially so large that its future will <span class="underline">depend</span> on the economics of production. At present, we can make <span class="underline">efficient</span> use of only naturally occurring hot water or steam deposits. Although the <span class="underline">potential</span> is <span class="underline">enormous</span>, it is likely that in the near future <span class="underline">geothermal</span> energy can make important <span class="underline">local</span> contributions only where the <span class="underline">resource</span> is close to the user and the economics are <span class="underline">favorable</span>, as they are in California, New Zealand, and Iceland. <span class="underline">Geothermal</span> energy probably will not make large-scale contributions to the world energy <span class="underline">budget</span> until well into the twenty-first <span class="underline">century</span>, if ever.</p>
