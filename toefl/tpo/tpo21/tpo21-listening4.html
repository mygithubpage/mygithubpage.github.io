            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.9" data-time="24.69">[00:24.69]</span>Professor: Yeah, a lot of students are taken aback by this, and some public relations consultants don't <span class="underline">figure</span> it out until they've worked in the <span class="underline">field</span> a while.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.74" data-time="32.59">[00:32.59]</span>Student: Everyone thinks, public relations, eh, PR is easy, but there's a lot to it. <span class="time" data-times="1.63" data-time="38.33">[00:38.33]</span>You really got to know what you are doing.</p>

            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.49" data-time="76.41">[01:16.41]</span>Professor: Ok, Ok. I hear you. <span class="time" data-times="6.86" data-time="79.9">[01:19.90]</span>Eh... you say you <span class="underline">wanted</span> a master's in marketing, you have got one more <span class="underline">semester</span> till graduation. <span class="time" data-times="2.72" data-time="86.76">[01:26.76]</span>Have you taken any marketing courses yet?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.34" data-time="89.48">[01:29.48]</span>Student: No, I figured I've got the marketing basis already since I have taken every PR in communication courses offered here.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.92" data-time="95.82">[01:35.82]</span>Professor: Well, there's some <span class="underline">overlap</span> between PR and marketing, but there are important differences too. <span class="time" data-times="10.17" data-time="101.74">[01:41.74]</span>Marketing focuses on selling your product or service, eh, you know, attracting customers <span class="underline">through</span> advertising, and also building relationships with customers. <span class="time" data-times="2.89" data-time="111.91">[01:51.91]</span>That's what a marketing <span class="underline">department</span> does. <span class="time" data-times="3.97" data-time="114.8">[01:54.80]</span>PR is all about, it involves relationships too.<span class="time" data-times="3.15" data-time="118.77">[01:58.77]</span>That's why I am saying the two fields <span class="underline">overlap</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.88" data-time="121.92">[02:01.92]</span>But in PR, you are developing relationships with a wider <span class="underline">range</span> of audiences.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.46" data-time="126.8">[02:06.80]</span>Student: Right. Like employees, suppliers, the <span class="underline">media</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.59" data-time="130.26">[02:10.26]</span>I do understand this in <span class="underline">theory</span>, but aren't you still selling your product, just in a different way?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.74" data-time="135.85">[02:15.85]</span>Professor: Not necessarily. Ok, do you remember that PR <span class="underline">strategy</span> I alluded to the other day? <span class="time" data-times="6.02" data-time="142.59">[02:22.59]</span>The one our university uses, a <span class="underline">strategy</span> that doesn't <span class="underline">overlap</span> its marketing <span class="underline">strategy</span>?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.65" data-time="148.61">[02:28.61]</span>Student: You mean how the university invites <span class="underline">local</span> residents to <span class="underline">attend</span> certain lectures and classes for free?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.56" data-time="154.26">[02:34.26]</span>Professor: Yeah, this cultivates a <span class="underline">sense</span> of good will and helps the university <span class="underline">avoid</span> becoming <span class="underline">isolated</span> from the larger <span class="underline">community</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.62" data-time="161.82">[02:41.82]</span>Bringing neighbours into our classrooms is good PR, but it is not marketing since our neighbours aren't our customers, for the most part.</p>
