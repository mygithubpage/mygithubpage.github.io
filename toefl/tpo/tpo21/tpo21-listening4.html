              <span class="time" data-times="5.92" data-time="95.82">[01:35.82]</span>Professor: Well, there's some <span class="highlight">overlap</span> between PR and marketing, but there are important differences too. <span class="time" data-times="10.17" data-time="101.74">[01:41.74]</span>Marketing focuses on selling your product or service, eh, you know, attracting customers <span class="highlight">through</span> advertising, and also building relationships with customers. <span class="time" data-times="2.89" data-time="111.91">[01:51.91]</span>That's what a marketing <span class="highlight">department</span> does. <span class="time" data-times="3.97" data-time="114.8">[01:54.80]</span>PR is all about, it involves relationships too.<span class="time" data-times="3.15" data-time="118.77">[01:58.77]</span>That's why I am saying the two fields <span class="highlight">overlap</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.88" data-time="121.92">[02:01.92]</span>But in PR, you are developing relationships with a wider <span class="highlight">range</span> of audiences.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.46" data-time="126.8">[02:06.80]</span>Student: Right. Like employees, suppliers, the <span class="highlight">media</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.59" data-time="130.26">[02:10.26]</span>I do understand this in <span class="highlight">theory</span>, but aren't you still selling your product, just in a different way?</p>

              <span class="time" data-times="6.74" data-time="135.85">[02:15.85]</span>Professor: Not necessarily.

              <span class="time" data-times="5.65" data-time="148.61">[02:28.61]</span>Student: You mean how the university invites <span class="highlight">local</span> residents to <span class="highlight">attend</span> certain lectures and classes for free?</p>

              <span class="time" data-times="7.56" data-time="154.26">[02:34.26]</span>Professor: Yeah, this cultivates a <span class="highlight">sense</span> of good will and helps the university <span class="highlight">avoid</span> becoming <span class="highlight">isolated</span> from the larger <span class="highlight">community</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.62" data-time="161.82">[02:41.82]</span>Bringing neighbours into our classrooms is good PR, but it is not marketing since our neighbours aren't our customers, for the most part.</p>

              <span class="time" data-times="3.05" data-time="201.95">[03:21.95]</span>Student: I wish my advisor had suggested those courses.</p>
