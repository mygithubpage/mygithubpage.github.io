            <span class="time" data-times="11.46" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in a <span class="highlight">history</span> of science class.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="12.89" data-time="11.46">[00:11.46]</span>Professor: Ok, we have been talking about how <span class="highlight">throughout</span> <span class="highlight">history</span>, it was often difficult for people to give up ideas which have long been taken for granted as <span class="highlight">scientific</span> truth, <span class="highlight">even</span> if those ideas were false. <span class="time" data-times="7.63" data-time="24.35">[00:24.35]</span>In Astronomy, for example, the <span class="highlight">distinction</span> between the <span class="highlight">solar</span> system and the <span class="highlight">universe</span> wasn't <span class="highlight">clear</span> until modern times.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="11.1" data-time="31.98">[00:31.98]</span>The <span class="highlight">ancient</span> Greeks believed that what we called the <span class="highlight">solar</span> system was in fact the entire <span class="highlight">universe</span>, and that the <span class="highlight">universe</span> was geocentric. <span class="time" data-times="11.56" data-time="43.08">[00:43.08]</span>Geocentric means Earth-centered, so the geocentric view holds that the Sun, the planets, and the stars, all revolve around the Earth, which is <span class="highlight">stationary</span>. <span class="time" data-times="10.89" data-time="54.64">[00:54.64]</span>Of <span class="highlight">course</span>, we now know that the planets, including Earth, revolve around the Sun, and that the <span class="highlight">solar</span> system is only a tiny part of the <span class="highlight">universe</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.11" data-time="65.53">[01:05.53]</span>So, why did the <span class="highlight">ancient</span> Greeks believe that the Earth was the center of the <span class="highlight">universe</span>? <span class="time" data-times="2.29" data-time="71.64">[01:11.64]</span>Well, it made <span class="highlight">sense</span> to them. <span class="time" data-times="11.54" data-time="73.93">[01:13.93]</span>Observations of the sky make it <span class="highlight">appear</span> as if the Sun, the moon, and the stars all revolve around the Earth every day, while the Earth itself stayed in one place.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="7.35" data-time="85.47">[01:25.47]</span>And this view is also supported by their philosophical and <span class="highlight">religious</span> beliefs about the <span class="highlight">origin</span> and structure of the <span class="highlight">universe</span>. <span class="time" data-times="13.74" data-time="92.82">[01:32.82]</span>It was presented in the works of well-known Greek philosophers as early as the fourth <span class="highlight">century</span> B.C.E., and the geocentric <span class="highlight">theory</span> continue to <span class="highlight">prevail</span> in Western thought for almost 2,000 years, until the 17th <span class="highlight">century</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="12.74" data-time="106.56">[01:46.56]</span>Now, what's especially interesting is that when <span class="highlight">astronomical</span> observations were made that seemed to be inconsistent with the geocentric view, the <span class="highlight">ancient</span> Greeks did not really <span class="highlight">consider</span> <span class="highlight">alternative</span> theories.<span class="time" data-times="13.96" data-time="119.3">[01:59.30]</span>It was so <span class="highlight">intuitive</span>, so <span class="highlight">sensible</span> that the Earth was the center of the <span class="highlight">universe</span> that astronomers found ways to explain those seemingly inconsistent phenomena <span class="highlight">within</span> the geocentric view.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="11.03" data-time="133.26">[02:13.26]</span>For example, Greek astronomers made excellent, very <span class="highlight">accurate</span> observations of the movements of the planets, but the observations revealed a bit of a problem. <span class="time" data-times="6.48" data-time="144.29">[02:24.29]</span>The geocentric <span class="highlight">theory</span> said, that the planets would move around the Earth in one direction.<span class="time" data-times="20.85" data-time="150.77">[02:30.77]</span>However, astronomers noticed that at times, several planets <span class="highlight">seem</span> to stop moving in one direction and start moving backward in their orbits around the Earth, and they came up with a <span class="highlight">theory</span> that these planets themselves moved in smaller circles called epicycles as they travelled around the Earth.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.16" data-time="171.62">[02:51.62]</span>Here's a picture of what they imagined. <span class="time" data-times="5.13" data-time="176.78">[02:56.78]</span>You see how this epicycle <span class="highlight">theory</span> could <span class="highlight">account</span> for the seemingly backward <span class="highlight">motion</span> of the <span class="highlight">planet</span>. <span class="time" data-times="15.07" data-time="181.91">[03:01.91]</span>Of <span class="highlight">course</span>, today we know that this <span class="highlight">appearance</span> of backward <span class="highlight">motion</span> is caused by the fact that Earth, as well as other planets, all move in their own orbits around the Sun, and the <span class="highlight">relative</span> movements of the planets with <span class="highlight">respect</span> to each other can get quite <span class="highlight">complex</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="11.31" data-time="196.98">[03:16.98]</span>However, there were a few astronomers in Greece and other places who didn't agree with the geocentric view, for example, a Greek <span class="highlight">astronomer</span> who lived in the third <span class="highlight">century</span> B.C.E. <span class="time" data-times="9.28" data-time="208.29">[03:28.29]</span>He proposed the <span class="highlight">theory</span> that our <span class="highlight">planetary</span> system might be heliocentric, his name was Aristarchus.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.53" data-time="217.57">[03:37.57]</span>Heliocentric means Sun-centered, that the Earth revolves around the Sun. <span class="time" data-times="7.04" data-time="223.1">[03:43.10]</span>Aristarchus recognized from his calculations that the Sun was much larger than the Earth and other planets. <span class="time" data-times="6.03" data-time="230.14">[03:50.14]</span>It was probably this discovery that led him to <span class="highlight">conclude</span> that the <span class="highlight">universe</span> is heliocentric. <span class="time" data-times="9.44" data-time="236.17">[03:56.17]</span>I mean, isn't it more <span class="highlight">sensible</span> to think that a smaller heavenly body would <span class="highlight">orbit</span> a larger one, rather than the <span class="highlight">opposite</span>?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="11.39" data-time="245.61">[04:05.61]</span>However, his proposition was rejected largely based on other <span class="highlight">scientific</span> beliefs held at the time, which all made <span class="highlight">sense</span> in a way <span class="highlight">even</span> if they were incorrect.<span class="time" data-times="4.62" data-time="257">[04:17.00]</span>Let me <span class="highlight">mention</span> two objections Greeks made to Aristarchus's <span class="highlight">theory</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.93" data-time="261.62">[04:21.62]</span>First, they believe that everything that moves creates its own wind, so to speak, everyone has this experience when you are running, right? <span class="time" data-times="9.25" data-time="270.55">[04:30.55]</span>So, they thought that if the Earth itself was moving, there would have to be a <span class="highlight">constant</span> wind blowing, <span class="highlight">sweeping</span> them off their feet, and of <span class="highlight">course</span> there wasn't.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="7.94" data-time="279.8">[04:39.80]</span>And <span class="highlight">second</span>, the idea of an Earth that moved didn't fit in with the <span class="highlight">ancient</span> Greeks' understanding of <span class="highlight">gravity</span>. <span class="time" data-times="13.97" data-time="287.74">[04:47.74]</span>They thought that <span class="highlight">gravity</span> was basically a natural <span class="highlight">tendency</span> of all things to move towards the center of the <span class="highlight">universe</span>, which was the Earth, or the center of the Earth, so that explains why apples and other falling objects were falling straight down. <span class="time" data-times="8.97" data-time="301.71">[05:01.71]</span>If the Sun was at the center of the <span class="highlight">universe</span>, things would fall toward the Sun and away from the Earth, which of <span class="highlight">course</span> they didn't.<span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="310.68">[05:10.68]</span>So these were some of the reasons they rejected the heliocentric <span class="highlight">theory</span>.</p>
