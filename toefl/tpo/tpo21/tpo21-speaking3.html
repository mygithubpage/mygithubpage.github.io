Rather than getting information about activities once a week in the campus newspaper, students will get the information every day, thus ensuring that it is always up-to-date. According to the university spokesperson who announced the plan, "For all of us now, e-mail is part of our daily lives. Students in particular have become used to relying on e-mail and the Internet for most communication, so this is a logical change that will benefit everyone."</p></article><div><audio src="tpo21-speaking3.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></div><article id="listening-passage" class="passage"><h3>Listening Text</h3><p>Now listen to two students discussing the announcement.</p><p>(woman) Did you read about the new plan?</p><p>(man) Yeah, what do you think?</p><p>(woman) I think it's a great idea.</p><p>(man) Really? Why?</p><p>(woman) Well, I just don't think the newspaper gives the most up-to-date information about activities.</p><p>(man) Well, the paper comes out weekly, what's the problem?</p><p>(woman) The fact it comes out just once a week is the problem. I read the paper every Monday but then I forget they're having a concert or showing a film or whatever, like on Thursday or Friday. And this will always give a reminder, all on the day of the event.</p><p>(man) Yeah, that way you wouldn't forget.</p><p>(woman) And, like, if something gets cancelled at the last minute, well, that way you would know and you wouldn't waste time showing up and no one's there.</p><p>(man) I haven't thought of that. That would be really helpful. But do you think students are actually gonna read the e-mail?</p><p>(woman) Are you kidding? Everyone checks their e-mail at least once a day. And if maybe they'll also include the cafeteria menu for the day in the e-mail, well, then people are definitely gonna read it.</p><p>(man) You're so right! I can't wait until they start.</p></article><section id="question"><h4>Question</h4><p>The woman expresses her opinion about the university's plan. Briefly summarize the plan. Then state her opinion about the plan and explain the reasons she gives for holding that opinion. </p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>According to the university's plan, the university will send to all students daily e-mails instead of weekly campus newspaper to update them with the campus events and activities. The woman agrees with the plan for two main reasons. First of all, she thinks that the weekly newspaper can't get students updated about what's going on, and the major problem with the newspaper is that she could forget the events later on or she couldn't be informed and go straight to the cancelled events which is a waste of time due to the weekly frequency. On the other hand, a daily e-mail would be a better reminder. Secondly, the woman is sure that everyone checks their e-mail at least once a day, so the students won't miss anything that they are interested in. So the woman agrees with the plan of the university. (141 words)</p></article></div></main></body></html>
