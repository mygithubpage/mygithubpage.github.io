          <h4 class="w3-center">Autobiographical Memory</h4>
          <p>Think back to your childhood and try to <span class="highlight">identify</span> your earliest memory. How old were you? <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>Most people are not able to recount memories for experiences <span class="highlight">prior</span> to the age of three years,
a <span class="highlight">phenomenon</span> called infantile <span class="highlight">amnesia</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>The question of why infantile <span class="highlight">amnesia</span> occurs has intrigued psychologists for decades, especially in light of <span class="highlight question1">ample</span> <span class="highlight">evidence</span> that infants and young 
children can <span class="highlight">display</span> <span class="highlight">impressive</span> memory capabilities. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>Many find that understanding the general nature of autobiographical memory, that is, memory for events that have occurred in one's own life,
can provide some important clues to this mystery. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>Between ages three and four, children begin to give <span class="highlight">fairly</span> <span class="highlight">lengthy</span> and cohesive descriptions of events in their past.
What factors are <span class="highlight">responsible</span> for this developmental turning point?</p>
          <p>Perhaps the explanation goes back to some ideas raised by <span class="highlight">influential</span> Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget-namely, that children under age two years <span class="highlight">represent</span> events in a qualitatively different form than older children do. According to this <span class="highlight">line</span> of thought, the <span class="highlight">verbal</span> abilities that <span class="highlight">blossom</span> in the two year old allow events to be coded in a form <span class="highlight">radically</span> different from the action-based codes of the <span class="highlight">infant</span>. <span class="highlight">Verbal</span> abilities of one year olds are, in fact, related to their memories for events one year later. When researchers had one year olds <span class="highlight">imitate</span> an <span class="highlight">action</span> <span class="highlight">sequence</span> one year after they first saw it, there was correlation between the children's <span class="highlight">verbal</span> skills at the time they first saw the event and their success on the later memory task. However, <span class="highlight">even</span> children with low <span class="highlight">verbal</span> skills showed <span class="highlight">evidence</span> of remembering the event; thus, memories may be facilitated by but are not dependent on those <span class="highlight">verbal</span> skills.</p>
          <p>Another suggestion is that before children can talk about past events in their lives, they need to have a <span class="highlight"><span class="question5">reasonable</span></span> understanding of the self as a psychological entity. The <span class="highlight">development</span> of an understanding of the self becomes <span class="highlight">evident</span> between the first and <span class="highlight">second</span> years of life and shows rapid <span class="question6">elaboration</span> in <span class="highlight">subsequent</span> years. The <span class="highlight">realization</span> that the <span class="highlight">physical</span> self has <span class="highlight">continuity</span> in time, according to this <span class="highlight">hypothesis</span>, lays the <span class="highlight">foundation</span> for the <span class="highlight">emergence</span> of autobiographical memory.</p>
          <p>A third possibility is that children will not be able to tell their own "life story" until they understand something about the general form stories take, that is, the structure of narratives. Knowledge about narratives arises from social interactions, particularly the storytelling that children experience from parents and the attempts parents make to talk with children about past events in their lives. When parents talk with children about "what we did today" or "last week" or "last year," they guide the children's <span class="highlight">formation</span> of a <span class="highlight">framework</span> for talking about the past. They also provide children with reminders about the memory and <span class="highlight">relay</span> the message that memories are valued as part of the cultural experience. It is interesting to note that some studies show Caucasian American children have earlier childhood memories than Korean children do. Furthermore, other studies show that Caucasian American mother-child pairs talk about past events three times more often than do Korean mother-child pairs. Thus, the types of social  experiences children have do <span class="highlight">factor</span> into the <span class="highlight">development</span> of autobiographical memories.</p>
          <p>A final suggestion is that children must begin to develop a "<span class="question10"><span class="highlight">theory</span> of mind</span>"-an <span class="highlight">awareness</span> of the <span class="highlight">concept</span> of <span class="highlight">mental</span> states (feelings, desires, beliefs, and thoughts), their own and those of others-before they can talk about their own past memories. Once children become <span class="highlight">capable</span> of answering such questions as "What does it mean to remember?" and "What does it mean to know something?" improvements in memory <span class="highlight">seem</span> to <span class="highlight">occur</span>.</p>
          <p>It may be that the developments just described are intertwined with and influence one another. Talking with parents about the past may <span class="highlight">enhance</span> the <span class="highlight">development</span> of the self-concept, for example, as well as help the child understand what it means to "remember." No <span class="highlight">doubt</span> the <span class="highlight">ability</span> to talk about one's past represents memory of a different <span class="highlight">level</span> of <span class="highlight">complexity</span> than simple <span class="highlight">recognition</span> or <span class="highlight">recall</span>.</p>

The existence of this means that there is no way to explain why the evidence is still infantile amnesia, so the correct answer is D.
