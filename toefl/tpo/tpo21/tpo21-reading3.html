How old were you? <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>Most people are not able to recount memories for experiences <span class="highlight">prior</span> to the age of three years,
a <span class="highlight">phenomenon</span> called infantile <span class="highlight">amnesia</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>The question of why infantile <span class="highlight">amnesia</span> occurs has intrigued psychologists for decades, especially in light of <span class="highlight question1">ample</span><span class="highlight">evidence</span> that infants and young 
children can <span class="highlight">display</span><span class="highlight">impressive</span> memory capabilities. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>Many find that understanding the general nature of autobiographical memory, that is, memory for events that have occurred in one's own life,
can provide some important clues to this mystery. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>Between ages three and four, children begin to give <span class="highlight">fairly</span><span class="highlight">lengthy</span> and cohesive descriptions of events in their past.
What factors are <span class="highlight">responsible</span> for this developmental turning point?</p><p>Perhaps the explanation goes back to some ideas raised by <span class="highlight">influential</span> Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget-namely, that children under age two years <span class="highlight">represent</span> events in a qualitatively different form than older children do. According to this <span class="highlight">line</span> of thought, the <span class="highlight">verbal</span> abilities that <span class="highlight">blossom</span> in the two year old allow events to be coded in a form <span class="highlight">radically</span> different from the action-based codes of the <span class="highlight">infant</span>. <span class="highlight">Verbal</span> abilities of one year olds are, in fact, related to their memories for events one year later. When researchers had one year olds <span class="highlight">imitate</span> an <span class="highlight">action</span><span class="highlight">sequence</span> one year after they first saw it, there was correlation between the children's <span class="highlight">verbal</span> skills at the time they first saw the event and their success on the later memory task. However, <span class="highlight">even</span> children with low <span class="highlight">verbal</span> skills showed <span class="highlight">evidence</span> of remembering the event; thus, memories may be facilitated by but are not dependent on those <span class="highlight">verbal</span> skills.</p><p>Another suggestion is that before children can talk about past events in their lives, they need to have a <span class="highlight"><span class="question5">reasonable</span></span> understanding of the self as a psychological entity. The <span class="highlight">development</span> of an understanding of the self becomes <span class="highlight">evident</span> between the first and <span class="highlight">second</span> years of life and shows rapid <span class="question6">elaboration</span> in <span class="highlight">subsequent</span> years. The <span class="highlight">realization</span> that the <span class="highlight">physical</span> self has <span class="highlight">continuity</span> in time, according to this <span class="highlight">hypothesis</span>, lays the <span class="highlight">foundation</span> for the <span class="highlight">emergence</span> of autobiographical memory.</p><p>A third possibility is that children will not be able to tell their own "life story" until they understand something about the general form stories take, that is, the structure of narratives. Knowledge about narratives arises from social interactions, particularly the storytelling that children experience from parents and the attempts parents make to talk with children about past events in their lives. When parents talk with children about "what we did today" or "last week" or "last year," they guide the children's <span class="highlight">formation</span> of a <span class="highlight">framework</span> for talking about the past. They also provide children with reminders about the memory and <span class="highlight">relay</span> the message that memories are valued as part of the cultural experience. It is interesting to note that some studies show Caucasian American children have earlier childhood memories than Korean children do. Furthermore, other studies show that Caucasian American mother-child pairs talk about past events three times more often than do Korean mother-child pairs. Thus, the types of social  experiences children have do <span class="highlight">factor</span> into the <span class="highlight">development</span> of autobiographical memories.</p><p>A final suggestion is that children must begin to develop a "<span class="question10"><span class="highlight">theory</span> of mind</span>"-an <span class="highlight">awareness</span> of the <span class="highlight">concept</span> of <span class="highlight">mental</span> states (feelings, desires, beliefs, and thoughts), their own and those of others-before they can talk about their own past memories. Once children become <span class="highlight">capable</span> of answering such questions as "What does it mean to remember?" and "What does it mean to know something?" improvements in memory <span class="highlight">seem</span> to <span class="highlight">occur</span>.</p><p>It may be that the developments just described are intertwined with and influence one another. Talking with parents about the past may <span class="highlight">enhance</span> the <span class="highlight">development</span> of the self-concept, for example, as well as help the child understand what it means to "remember." No <span class="highlight">doubt</span> the <span class="highlight">ability</span> to talk about one's past represents memory of a different <span class="highlight">level</span> of <span class="highlight">complexity</span> than simple <span class="highlight">recognition</span> or <span class="highlight">recall</span>.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">ample</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. surprising</p><p>B. convincing</p><p>C. plentiful</p><p>D. questionable</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C ample: Lots, enough. A is surprising; B is convincing; C is rich and numerous; D is questionable and problematic. So the answer is plentiful of C.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 1, infantile amnesia has intrigued psychologists because</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. the ability to recount memories prior to three years of age seems to be connected to intelligence in adulthood</p><p>B. psychologists do not understand why some people are able to recount memories from before the age of three years, while others are not able do so</p><p>C. psychologists do not understand the connection between infantile amnesia and autobiographical memory</p><p>D. although psychologists have evidence that infants have memory abilities, most people cannot remember life events that happened before the age of three years</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D. Using the intrigue psychologists as a key word to locate the third sentence, which is the sentence of the question vocabulary, said that the problem of amnesia in infancy has been plagued by people for a long time, especially considering that there is evidence that the child has some memories. The existence of this means that there is no way to explain why the evidence is still infantile amnesia, so the correct answer is D. A's intelligence in adulthood, B's other are not able to and C's autobiographical memory did not say anything.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 1, what is the evidence that a child has developed autobiographical memory?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The child is able to remember past events from before the age of three years.</p><p>B. The child is able to describe past events in a sufficiently lengthy and cohesive manner.</p><p>C. The child is aware that he or she does not remember experiences from before the age of three years.</p><p>D. The child is able to give a basic description of the nature of autobiographical memory.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B. With the developed autobiographical memory as a keyword to locate the penultimate sentence and the penultimate sentence, when the child is three or four years old, the child can give a lengthy and cohesive description of the past. This is a developmental turning point, so the answer is B. . A said remember, C said that the child knows blabla, D describes something wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>In paragraph 2, why does the author provide the information that children with low verbal skills showed evidence of remembering a past event?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To provide evidence that memories do not depend only upon verbal skills</p><p>B. To challenge the idea that one year olds are too young to form memories</p><p>C. To argue that the memory of one year olds depends only on action-based codes</p><p>D. To suggest that Piaget later revised his findings on the correlation between memory and verbal ability</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A rhetorical question, first read the sentence where the example is located. The child whose language ability is not good can also remember things. Therefore, language ability can help to form autobiographical memory instead of determining its formation. So the answer is A, not only relying on verbal, B, and C. One year olds, D's names were not originally written, and none were selected.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question5">reasonable</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. consistent</p><p>B. sufficient</p><p>C. apparent</p><p>D. deep</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>B <span class="question5">reasonable</span>: More, quite big. Note that <span class="question5">reasonable</span> in the original text is not "<span class="question5">reasonable</span>". A is consistent; B is sufficient; C is obvious; D is deep. So the correct answer is B's sufficient.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question6">elaboration</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. development</p><p>B. specialization</p><p>C. use</p><p>D. transformation</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" A"><p>A <span class="question6">elaboration</span>: elaborated, elaborate and refined. In the text, word meanings have changed slightly, with the meaning of (good) development. A is development; B is specialization, specialization; C is use; D is transformation. So the answer is A's development.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 3, what is the relationship between autobiographical memory and the development of an understanding of the self?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Autobiographical memory aids in the development of an understanding of the self.</p><p>B. Children possess an understanding of the self when they can talk about past events in their lives.</p><p>C. The realization that the self continues through time may aid in the onset of autobiographical memory.</p><p>D. The development of autobiographical memory helps children gain an understanding of their roles in their social relationships.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C asked the relationship between the two, looking for the understanding of the self and autobiographical memory double keyword positioning to the last sentence, said that self-knowledge lay the foundation for the occurrence of autobiographical memory, so the answer is C, onset beginning, A and B did not say two The relationship between the people, D said the opposite.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>All of the following are mentioned in paragraph 4 as ways in which parents help their children understand the structure of narratives EXCEPT</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. talking with their children about past events</p><p>B. telling stories to their children</p><p>C. having their children repeat stories back to them</p><p>D. showing their children that they think memories are important</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>D EXCEPT questions, exclusion. Both A's past events and B's telling stories are targeted to the second sentence. They say that parents taught their children the knowledge of storytelling and past events. Therefore, A and B are both right and not selected. The original options did not say, wrong, and election; D option is not easy to find, through the memories are important to the fourth sentence, memories are valued as part of the cultural experience, D correct, not selected.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, the studies of Caucasian American and Korean children suggest which of the following?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Autobiographical memories develop similarly across all cultures.</p><p>B. Parents from different cultures tell their children different kinds of stories about the past.</p><p>C. Children's pleasure in hearing stories varies from culture to culture.</p><p>D. The kinds of interactions children have with their parents affect the development of autobiographical memories.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D Inference questions, examples of questions asked in the penultimate and third sentences of this paragraph, the entire sentence is an example, so according to common sense should look ahead, but the previous sentence said that parents told children that the memory is very important, not the center, this paragraph The first sentence is not supported by the answer, so it should be looked back, and the last sentence of thus is clearly a center, so the answer is D, pay attention to the noun verb of factor, B and C are not similar, A is too absolute, and the remaining The three answers are purely examples and do not meet the characteristics of options for rhetorical purposes.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 5, what evidence is there that a "<span class="highlight">theory of mind</span>" is a factor in the development of autobiographical memory?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Even children who are not aware of their mental states are still able to talk about past events.</p><p>B. Autobiographical memory decreases when a child's feelings and mental state are upset.</p><p>C. Older children who are unable to achieve awareness of mental states lack autobiographical memory.</p><p>D. Children's memory of past events grows once children can answer questions about what it means to know and remember.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="theory of mind D"><p>D. Use the quotation mark as the key word to locate the first sentence of this paragraph. But this sentence does not say anything except to repeat the title, and there are only two sentences in this paragraph. After reading the second sentence quickly, the original sentence says Once the child can answer this question, the memories begin to develop, so the answer is D. A said the opposite with the first sentence; B's decrease and C's lack did not say anything.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The organization of the passage can best be described as</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. the presentation of an argument followed by the evidence for and against it</p><p>B. a description of a phenomenon followed by several possible theories about how it develops</p><p>C. the definition of a psychological term followed by a history of its usage</p><p>D. an explanation of a process followed by a discussion of its practical applications</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B: The full text, see the beginning of the paragraphs, the first paragraph raises questions, the second paragraph to the fifth paragraph proposes four possible reasons, the sixth paragraph says that several reasons may be intertwined, and only B mentions the possible possible Theories, so the answer is B.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The passage supports which of the following statements about the development of autobiographical memory?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It is unlikely that a single factor is responsible for the development of autobiographical memory.</p><p>B. Jean Piaget was the first psychologist to understand the development of autobiographical memory.</p><p>C. Understanding the development of autobiographical memory will help psychologists eliminate infant amnesia</p><p>D. Understanding what it means to remember is the most important factor in the development of autobiographical memory.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A asked the full text, see the beginning of each paragraph, but in fact this question has not looked at the beginning, and then you can do on the question, because the question has been said of the most possible theories, so the answer is obviously A, can not be a single factor. JP's JP was the first psychologist, C's eliminate and D's most important factor were not spoken.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>It is unlikely that this memory will be from the first two years of life..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A Two transition points, the pronoun phrase this memory and the first two years of life, note this memory, so the plural does not work, excluding the B option. So A, C and D may be the answer, but C is the memory capabilities, not overlap with the transition point, exclude; D has no age-related words, and A has how old were you, so the correct answer is A.</p></div></div><div id="question14" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>
