          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="7.23" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in an Art <span class="highlight">History</span> class. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.38" data-time="7.23">[00:07.23]</span>Professor: All right, so today we are moving on to Alice Neel, N-E-E-L. <span class="time" data-times="7.31" data-time="13.61">[00:13.61]</span>Um... Alice Neel painted portraits, she was born in Pennsylvania, and she lived from 1900 to 1984.<span class="time" data-times="5.35" data-time="20.92">[00:20.92]</span>And I guess you might say, she experienced difficulties as an artist. <span class="time" data-times="5.83" data-time="26.27">[00:26.27]</span>She was in her 70s, before she had her first <span class="highlight">major</span> <span class="highlight">solo</span> exhibition. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.87" data-time="32.1">[00:32.10]</span>Um, and this is <span class="highlight">due</span> at <span class="highlight">least</span> in part to eh... or... because of <span class="highlight">photography</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.88" data-time="37.97">[00:37.97]</span>After <span class="highlight">photography</span> became regarded as an art form, <span class="highlight">portrait</span> painting became less <span class="highlight">prestigious</span>, less respected as an art form. <span class="time" data-times="8.69" data-time="46.85">[00:46.85]</span>And, well, art <span class="highlight">photography</span> kind of took its place, so you can imagine that a <span class="highlight">portrait</span> artist, would have had a hard time finding acceptance. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="8.66" data-time="55.54">[00:55.54]</span>Eh, but the real <span class="highlight">reason</span> I want to look at Neel, is that I really find her style ... eh, she had interesting ways of portraying people. <span class="time" data-times="3" data-time="64.2">[01:04.20]</span>She combined some elements of <span class="highlight">realism</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.8" data-time="67.2">[01:07.20]</span>What's <span class="highlight">realism</span>, Alison? </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="12.05" data-time="70">[01:10.00]</span>Student: It's like painting something exactly how it is, so an artist would try to make it as <span class="highlight">accurate</span>, um... and <span class="highlight">objective</span> as possible. <span class="time" data-times="2.5" data-time="82.05">[01:22.05]</span>Painting <span class="highlight">stuff</span> just how it appears on the surface. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.4" data-time="84.55">[01:24.55]</span>Professor: Ok, good. <span class="time" data-times="5.59" data-time="85.95">[01:25.95]</span>So Neel combined <span class="highlight">realism</span> with, well, actually, with expressionism. <span class="time" data-times="4.99" data-time="91.54">[01:31.54]</span>And that is? We, we just covered this. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="8.78" data-time="96.53">[01:36.53]</span>Student: Um... It's into <span class="highlight">emotion</span>, like artists are trying to, well, express themselves <span class="highlight">through</span> the painting, right? </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="9.96" data-time="105.31">[01:45.31]</span>Professor: Yep. The artist is depicting subjective emotions, showing the <span class="highlight">inner</span> reality as interpreted by the artist rather than the outward form. <span class="time" data-times="5.1" data-time="115.27">[01:55.27]</span>So the <span class="highlight">image</span> itself might be distorted or exaggerated in some way. <span class="time" data-times="4.54" data-time="120.37">[02:00.37]</span>The expression overrides <span class="highlight">objective</span> representation. <span class="time" data-times="6.35" data-time="124.91">[02:04.91]</span>Ok, so, Alice Neel combined these two styles ... Yes? </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.92" data-time="131.26">[02:11.26]</span>Student: Em... How is that <span class="highlight">even</span> possible? <span class="time" data-times="6.73" data-time="134.18">[02:14.18]</span>How can your <span class="highlight">portray</span> something exactly as it is and at the same time <span class="highlight">distort</span> it with emotions? <span class="time" data-times="1.5" data-time="140.91">[02:20.91]</span>I don't get it. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.83" data-time="142.41">[02:22.41]</span>Professor: All right, good question. <span class="time" data-times="7.1" data-time="144.24">[02:24.24]</span>It is actually a good lead-in to some of the techniques that Neel used, that she employed to bridge that <span class="highlight">contradiction</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.32" data-time="151.34">[02:31.34]</span>In a <span class="highlight">minute</span>, I'll show you some of her portraits, and I'll want you to notice a few things about them. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.8" data-time="156.66">[02:36.66]</span>First, Neel's use of <span class="highlight">bold</span> color. All right? <span class="time" data-times="9.01" data-time="160.46">[02:40.46]</span>You'll see she uses color to <span class="highlight">convey</span> <span class="highlight">emotion</span> and feeling, like the subjects' clothing for <span class="highlight">instance</span>, it appears brighter than it really is. <span class="time" data-times="5.86" data-time="169.47">[02:49.47]</span>And the subjects, the people being portrayed, Neel paid <span class="highlight">special</span> <span class="highlight">attention</span> to faces. <span class="time" data-times="8.66" data-time="175.33">[02:55.33]</span>The way she paints the eyes and how the faces are portrayed, these are quite <span class="highlight">realistic</span>, like the realists' work. <span class="time" data-times="5.82" data-time="183.99">[03:03.99]</span>But another thing Neel did was use <span class="highlight">elongated</span>, <span class="highlight">sort</span> of stretchy figures. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.34" data-time="189.81">[03:09.81]</span>Student: But didn't a lot of expressionist painters do that? <span class="time" data-times="4.49" data-time="195.15">[03:15.15]</span>So really you are saying that Neel's techniques were <span class="highlight">similar</span> to what other artists were doing. <span class="time" data-times="3.23" data-time="199.64">[03:19.64]</span>What was it that she did, that was like all her own? </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.22" data-time="202.87">[03:22.87]</span>Professor: Ok, well, I think it has to do <span class="highlight">partly</span> with the way she combined these techniques. <span class="time" data-times="6.56" data-time="209.09">[03:29.09]</span>So, for example, those <span class="highlight">realistic</span> faces and eyes, but bright, distorted figures. <span class="time" data-times="1.31" data-time="215.65">[03:35.65]</span>It is a mix. <span class="time" data-times="6.21" data-time="216.96">[03:36.96]</span>You'll see that her portraits do <span class="highlight">reflect</span> reality, the people that were actually sitting there.<span class="time" data-times="6.64" data-time="223.17">[03:43.17]</span> <span class="highlight">Realism</span> was important in the <span class="highlight">sense</span> that she <span class="highlight">wanted</span> to show people as they really were, much like a photographer would. <span class="time" data-times="6.38" data-time="229.81">[03:49.81]</span>But Neel wasn't satisfied with photo-like <span class="highlight">realism</span>, she went beyond that. <span class="time" data-times="2.97" data-time="236.19">[03:56.19]</span>And this is where expressionism comes in. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="12.96" data-time="239.16">[03:59.16]</span>She believed in capturing the whole person, not just what was on the surface, that's where the expressionists' <span class="highlight">distortion</span> is important, in an <span class="highlight">attempt</span> to <span class="highlight">reveal</span> the subjects' <span class="highlight">character</span> or <span class="highlight">personality</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.64" data-time="252.12">[04:12.12]</span>But Neel's paintings are <span class="highlight">distinctive</span> for her time in part because they are portraits. <span class="time" data-times="11.97" data-time="258.76">[04:18.76]</span>Remember I said that <span class="highlight">photography</span> and art <span class="highlight">photography</span> had largely taken the place of <span class="highlight">portraiture</span>, to the <span class="highlight">extent</span> that some critics had declared the <span class="highlight">genre</span> of <span class="highlight">portraiture</span> to be dead. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="7.73" data-time="270.73">[04:30.73]</span>But Neel felt that painting should <span class="highlight">reflect</span> reality, a real realist's <span class="highlight">stance</span> you could say. <span class="time" data-times="9.93" data-time="278.46">[04:38.46]</span>And to her, individuals, people best <span class="highlight">reflect</span> the reality of their time, of the age that they lived in, so she painted portraits. <span class="time" data-times="5.2" data-time="288.39">[04:48.39]</span>And if you look at her work, we are talking in the <span class="highlight">vicinity</span> of three thousand paintings. <span class="time" data-times="16.03" data-time="293.59">[04:53.59]</span>If you looked at them, it is like this <span class="highlight">gallery</span> of the whole <span class="highlight">century</span>, an <span class="highlight">enormous</span> <span class="highlight">range</span> of subjects: families, women, children, artists, people in poverty--these paintings really <span class="highlight">span</span> class, age and <span class="highlight">gender</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9.81" data-time="309.62">[05:09.62]</span>It is like she transformed the <span class="highlight">genre</span>, it is not just <span class="highlight">formal</span> depictions of presidents and ancestors any more. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.23" data-time="319.43">[05:19.43]</span>But keep in <span class="highlight">mind</span> that she was doing this when <span class="highlight">abstract</span> art dominated the art <span class="highlight">scene</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.16" data-time="325.66">[05:25.66]</span>Representations of people weren't <span class="highlight">fashionable</span> in the art world. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="329.82">[05:29.82]</span>And it wasn't until <span class="highlight">fairly</span> late in the <span class="highlight">century</span> that critics recognized the power of what she did. </p>

              <p>Professor: ...First, Neel's use of bold color. All right? You'll see she uses color to convey emotion and feeling, like the subjects' clothing for instance, it appears brighter than it really is. And the subjects, the People being portrayed, Neel paid special attention to faces. The way she paints the eyes and how the faces are portrayed, these are quite realistic, like the realists' work. But another thing Neel did was used elongated, sort of stretchy figures.</p>

              <p>But Neel felt that painting should reflect reality, a real realist's stance9 you could say.
