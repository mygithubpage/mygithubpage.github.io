          <p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.23" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in an Art <span class="underline">History</span> class. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.38" data-time="7.23">[00:07.23]</span>Professor: All right, so today we are moving on to Alice Neel, N-E-E-L. <span class="time" data-times="7.31" data-time="13.61">[00:13.61]</span>Um... Alice Neel painted portraits, she was born in Pennsylvania, and she lived from 1900 to 1984.<span class="time" data-times="5.35" data-time="20.92">[00:20.92]</span>And I guess you might say, she experienced difficulties as an artist. <span class="time" data-times="5.83" data-time="26.27">[00:26.27]</span>She was in her 70s, before she had her first <span class="underline">major</span> <span class="underline">solo</span> exhibition. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.87" data-time="32.1">[00:32.10]</span>Um, and this is <span class="underline">due</span> at <span class="underline">least</span> in part to eh... or... because of <span class="underline">photography</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.88" data-time="37.97">[00:37.97]</span>After <span class="underline">photography</span> became regarded as an art form, <span class="underline">portrait</span> painting became less <span class="underline">prestigious</span>, less respected as an art form. <span class="time" data-times="8.69" data-time="46.85">[00:46.85]</span>And, well, art <span class="underline">photography</span> kind of took its place, so you can imagine that a <span class="underline">portrait</span> artist, would have had a hard time finding acceptance. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.66" data-time="55.54">[00:55.54]</span>Eh, but the real <span class="underline">reason</span> I want to look at Neel, is that I really find her style ... eh, she had interesting ways of portraying people. <span class="time" data-times="3" data-time="64.2">[01:04.20]</span>She combined some elements of <span class="underline">realism</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.8" data-time="67.2">[01:07.20]</span>What's <span class="underline">realism</span>, Alison? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="12.05" data-time="70">[01:10.00]</span>Student: It's like painting something exactly how it is, so an artist would try to make it as <span class="underline">accurate</span>, um... and <span class="underline">objective</span> as possible. <span class="time" data-times="2.5" data-time="82.05">[01:22.05]</span>Painting <span class="underline">stuff</span> just how it appears on the surface. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.4" data-time="84.55">[01:24.55]</span>Professor: Ok, good. <span class="time" data-times="5.59" data-time="85.95">[01:25.95]</span>So Neel combined <span class="underline">realism</span> with, well, actually, with expressionism. <span class="time" data-times="4.99" data-time="91.54">[01:31.54]</span>And that is? We, we just covered this. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.78" data-time="96.53">[01:36.53]</span>Student: Um... It's into <span class="underline">emotion</span>, like artists are trying to, well, express themselves <span class="underline">through</span> the painting, right? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.96" data-time="105.31">[01:45.31]</span>Professor: Yep. The artist is depicting subjective emotions, showing the <span class="underline">inner</span> reality as interpreted by the artist rather than the outward form. <span class="time" data-times="5.1" data-time="115.27">[01:55.27]</span>So the <span class="underline">image</span> itself might be distorted or exaggerated in some way. <span class="time" data-times="4.54" data-time="120.37">[02:00.37]</span>The expression overrides <span class="underline">objective</span> representation. <span class="time" data-times="6.35" data-time="124.91">[02:04.91]</span>Ok, so, Alice Neel combined these two styles ... Yes? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.92" data-time="131.26">[02:11.26]</span>Student: Em... How is that <span class="underline">even</span> possible? <span class="time" data-times="6.73" data-time="134.18">[02:14.18]</span>How can your <span class="underline">portray</span> something exactly as it is and at the same time <span class="underline">distort</span> it with emotions? <span class="time" data-times="1.5" data-time="140.91">[02:20.91]</span>I don't get it. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.83" data-time="142.41">[02:22.41]</span>Professor: All right, good question. <span class="time" data-times="7.1" data-time="144.24">[02:24.24]</span>It is actually a good lead-in to some of the techniques that Neel used, that she employed to bridge that <span class="underline">contradiction</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.32" data-time="151.34">[02:31.34]</span>In a <span class="underline">minute</span>, I'll show you some of her portraits, and I'll want you to notice a few things about them. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.8" data-time="156.66">[02:36.66]</span>First, Neel's use of <span class="underline">bold</span> color. All right? <span class="time" data-times="9.01" data-time="160.46">[02:40.46]</span>You'll see she uses color to <span class="underline">convey</span> <span class="underline">emotion</span> and feeling, like the subjects' clothing for <span class="underline">instance</span>, it appears brighter than it really is. <span class="time" data-times="5.86" data-time="169.47">[02:49.47]</span>And the subjects, the people being portrayed, Neel paid <span class="underline">special</span> <span class="underline">attention</span> to faces. <span class="time" data-times="8.66" data-time="175.33">[02:55.33]</span>The way she paints the eyes and how the faces are portrayed, these are quite <span class="underline">realistic</span>, like the realists' work. <span class="time" data-times="5.82" data-time="183.99">[03:03.99]</span>But another thing Neel did was use <span class="underline">elongated</span>, <span class="underline">sort</span> of stretchy figures. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.34" data-time="189.81">[03:09.81]</span>Student: But didn't a lot of expressionist painters do that? <span class="time" data-times="4.49" data-time="195.15">[03:15.15]</span>So really you are saying that Neel's techniques were <span class="underline">similar</span> to what other artists were doing. <span class="time" data-times="3.23" data-time="199.64">[03:19.64]</span>What was it that she did, that was like all her own? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.22" data-time="202.87">[03:22.87]</span>Professor: Ok, well, I think it has to do <span class="underline">partly</span> with the way she combined these techniques. <span class="time" data-times="6.56" data-time="209.09">[03:29.09]</span>So, for example, those <span class="underline">realistic</span> faces and eyes, but bright, distorted figures. <span class="time" data-times="1.31" data-time="215.65">[03:35.65]</span>It is a mix. <span class="time" data-times="6.21" data-time="216.96">[03:36.96]</span>You'll see that her portraits do <span class="underline">reflect</span> reality, the people that were actually sitting there.<span class="time" data-times="6.64" data-time="223.17">[03:43.17]</span> <span class="underline">Realism</span> was important in the <span class="underline">sense</span> that she <span class="underline">wanted</span> to show people as they really were, much like a photographer would. <span class="time" data-times="6.38" data-time="229.81">[03:49.81]</span>But Neel wasn't satisfied with photo-like <span class="underline">realism</span>, she went beyond that. <span class="time" data-times="2.97" data-time="236.19">[03:56.19]</span>And this is where expressionism comes in. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="12.96" data-time="239.16">[03:59.16]</span>She believed in capturing the whole person, not just what was on the surface, that's where the expressionists' <span class="underline">distortion</span> is important, in an <span class="underline">attempt</span> to <span class="underline">reveal</span> the subjects' <span class="underline">character</span> or <span class="underline">personality</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.64" data-time="252.12">[04:12.12]</span>But Neel's paintings are <span class="underline">distinctive</span> for her time in part because they are portraits. <span class="time" data-times="11.97" data-time="258.76">[04:18.76]</span>Remember I said that <span class="underline">photography</span> and art <span class="underline">photography</span> had largely taken the place of <span class="underline">portraiture</span>, to the <span class="underline">extent</span> that some critics had declared the <span class="underline">genre</span> of <span class="underline">portraiture</span> to be dead. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.73" data-time="270.73">[04:30.73]</span>But Neel felt that painting should <span class="underline">reflect</span> reality, a real realist's <span class="underline">stance</span> you could say. <span class="time" data-times="9.93" data-time="278.46">[04:38.46]</span>And to her, individuals, people best <span class="underline">reflect</span> the reality of their time, of the age that they lived in, so she painted portraits. <span class="time" data-times="5.2" data-time="288.39">[04:48.39]</span>And if you look at her work, we are talking in the <span class="underline">vicinity</span> of three thousand paintings. <span class="time" data-times="16.03" data-time="293.59">[04:53.59]</span>If you looked at them, it is like this <span class="underline">gallery</span> of the whole <span class="underline">century</span>, an <span class="underline">enormous</span> <span class="underline">range</span> of subjects: families, women, children, artists, people in poverty--these paintings really <span class="underline">span</span> class, age and <span class="underline">gender</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9.81" data-time="309.62">[05:09.62]</span>It is like she transformed the <span class="underline">genre</span>, it is not just <span class="underline">formal</span> depictions of presidents and ancestors any more. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.23" data-time="319.43">[05:19.43]</span>But keep in <span class="underline">mind</span> that she was doing this when <span class="underline">abstract</span> art dominated the art <span class="underline">scene</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.16" data-time="325.66">[05:25.66]</span>Representations of people weren't <span class="underline">fashionable</span> in the art world. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="329.82">[05:29.82]</span>And it wasn't until <span class="underline">fairly</span> late in the <span class="underline">century</span> that critics recognized the power of what she did. </p>
