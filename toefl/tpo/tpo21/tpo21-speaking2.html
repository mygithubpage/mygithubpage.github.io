Use details and examples to explain your opinion.</p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>I agree with the statement friends are the most important influence in my life. Firstly, I learned how to be sociable from friends. When I first entered a company, I was a loner. I didn't understand the basic social rules. One of my friends, Lillian, gave me a lot of advice about how to behave in front of the boss and what to say in front of colleagues. Secondly, friends are my good-listeners. Many times I felt helpless and painful because of some frustrations, I went to my friends. They would sit in front of me, listening to my complaints or swear words and then comforted me. These are the things that neither my parents or other relatives can give me.</p></article></div></main></body></html>
