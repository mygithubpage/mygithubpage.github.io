The one you wrote and directing?</p><p>(woman) In one week.</p><p>(man) And how's it coming along?</p><p>(woman) Well, the rehearsal had been going pretty well, there's just one problem.</p><p>(man) What's that?</p><p>(woman) We have a guy named Bill playing one of the supporting roles, one of the minor characters.(man) OK?</p><p>(woman) And he just can't remember his lines. All the other characters have their parts memorized except Bill. We'll be in the middle of rehearsing a big scene and he'll forget what he is supposed to say next. I thought he'd eventually improve but now I'm not sure he'll be ready for opening night.</p><p>(woman) Well, I could replace him. There are other actors on campus, actors who could play the part.</p><p>(man) Yeah, since it's such a minor role, another actor could probably learn the part in time.</p><p>(woman) That's true. It's just that I don't know how he'd feel about that. Removing him from the play could hurt his feelings and he was really looking forward to being in it.</p><p>(man) I see, well, could you, I mean, maybe another thing you could do is spent time with him, after rehearsals, you know, work with him to help him learn to remember his lines.</p><p>(woman) Yeah, I could do that. But there are other parts of the production I try to take care of after rehearsals. So it'll take away from other things that I need to do before opening night.</p></article><section id="question"><h4>Question</h4><p>Briefly summarize the problem the speakers are discussing. Then state which solution you would recommend. Explain the reasons for your recommendation. </p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>Well, the woman's problem is that her play will be in the middle of rehearsing a big scene but one of the supporting roles couldn't remember his lines. Accordingly, there are two solutions for the woman's problem: first she could replace the actor, and second, she could spend some time with him and help him learn to remember his lines. I think the woman should choose the second solution for two reasons. Firstly, replacing a character during the rehearsal just before the opening night is kind of cruel for the actor no matter how minor an role he plays. After all, it takes everyone's spare time and effort to get together aiming for the final show, not only the main roles but the minor ones. Secondly, I guess it'll take more time to find someone new to replace and even longer time for the new to fit in the whole team. So comparatively, do him a little favor and help him remember his lines after rehearsals would show the real team spirit and definitely will work.
