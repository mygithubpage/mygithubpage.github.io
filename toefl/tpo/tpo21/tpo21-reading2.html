            <b>The Origins of Agriculture</b>
          </h4>
          <p>How did it come about that farming developed independently in a number of world centers (the Southeast Asian mainland, Southwest Asia, Central America, <span class="highlight">lowland</span> and highland South America,
and <span class="highlight">equatorial</span> Africa) at more or less the same time? <span class="highlight">Agriculture</span> developed slowly among populations that had an <span class="highlight">extensive</span> knowledge of plants and animals. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>Changing from hunting and gathering to <span class="highlight">agriculture</span> had no <span class="highlight">immediate</span> advantages. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>To start with, it forced the <span class="highlight">population</span> to <span class="highlight">abandon</span> the nomad's life and became <span class="highlight">sedentary</span>, 
to develop methods of <span class="highlight">storage</span> and, often, systems of <span class="highlight">irrigation</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>While hunter-gatherers always had the <span class="highlight question1">option</span> of moving elsewhere when the resources were exhausted, 
this became more difficult with farming. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>Furthermore, as the <span class="highlight">archaeological</span> <span class="highlight">record</span> shows, the <span class="highlight">state</span> of health of agriculturalists was worse than that of their <span class="highlight">contemporary</span> hunter-gatherers.</p>
          <p>Traditionally, it was believed that the <span class="highlight">transition</span> to <span class="highlight">agriculture</span> was the result of a worldwide <span class="highlight">population</span> crisis. It was argued that once hunter-gatherers had occupied the whole world, the <span class="highlight">population</span> started to grow everywhere and food became <span class="highlight">scarce</span>; <span class="highlight">agriculture</span> would have been a <span class="highlight">solution</span> to this problem. We know, however, that <span class="highlight">contemporary</span> hunter-gatherer societies control their <span class="highlight">population</span> in a <span class="highlight">variety</span> of ways. The idea of a world <span class="highlight">population</span> crisis is <span class="highlight question3">therefore</span> <span class="highlight">unlikely</span>, although <span class="highlight">population</span> <span class="highlight">pressure</span> might have arisen in some areas.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="highlight">Climatic</span> changes at the end of the <span class="highlight">glacial</span> period 13,000 years ago have been proposed to <span class="highlight">account</span> for the <span class="highlight">emergence</span> of farming. <span class="question5">The <span class="highlight">temperature</span> increased <span class="highlight">dramatically</span> in a short period of time (years rather than centuries), allowing for a growth of the hunting-gathering <span class="highlight">population</span> <span class="highlight">due</span> to the <span class="highlight">abundance</span> of resources.</span> There were, however, fluctuations in the <span class="highlight">climatic</span> conditions, with the consequences that wet conditions were followed by dry ones, so that the <span class="highlight">availability</span> of plants and animals oscillated brusquely.</p>
          <p>It would <span class="highlight">appear</span> that the <span class="highlight">instability</span> of the <span class="highlight">climatic</span> conditions led populations that had originally been <span class="highlight">nomadic</span> to <span class="highlight">settle</span> down and develop a <span class="highlight">sedentary</span> style of life, which led in turn to <span class="highlight">population</span> growth and to the need to increase the <span class="highlight">amount</span> of food <span class="highlight">available</span>. Farming originated in these conditions. Later on, it became very difficult to change because of the <span class="highlight">significant</span> <span class="highlight">expansion</span> of these populations. It could be argued, however, that these conditions are not <span class="highlight">sufficient</span> to explain the origins of <span class="highlight">agriculture</span>. <span class="question8">Earth had experienced <span class="highlight">previous</span> periods of <span class="highlight">climatic</span> change, and yet <span class="highlight">agriculture</span> had not been developed.</span></p>
          <p>It is archaeologist Steven Mithen's <span class="highlight">thesis</span>, brilliantly developed in his book The Prehistory of the <span class="highlight">Mind</span> (1996), that <span class="highlight">approximately</span> 40,000 years ago the human <span class="highlight">mind</span> developed <span class="highlight">cognitive</span> fluidity, that is, the <span class="highlight">integration</span> of the specializations of the mind: <span class="highlight">technical</span>, natural <span class="highlight">history</span> (geared to understanding the <span class="highlight">behavior</span> and <span class="highlight">distribution</span> of natural resources), social <span class="highlight">intelligence</span>, and the <span class="highlight">linguistic</span> <span class="highlight">capacity</span>. <span class="highlight">Cognitive</span> fluidity explains the <span class="highlight">appearance</span> of art, <span class="highlight">religion</span>, and <span class="highlight">sophisticated</span> speech. Once humans possessed such a <span class="highlight">mind</span>, they were able to find an <span class="question9">imaginative</span> <span class="highlight">solution</span> to a situation of <span class="highlight">severe</span> <span class="highlight">economic</span> crisis such as the farming <span class="highlight">dilemma</span> described earlier. Mithen proposes the <span class="highlight">existence</span> of four <span class="highlight">mental</span> elements to <span class="highlight">account</span> for the <span class="highlight">emergence</span> of farming: (1) the <span class="highlight">ability</span> to develop tools that could be used intensively to <span class="highlight">harvest</span> and <span class="highlight">process</span> plant resources; (2) the <span class="highlight">tendency</span> to use plants and animals as the <span class="highlight">medium</span> to <span class="highlight">acquire</span> social <span class="highlight">prestige</span> and power; (3) the <span class="highlight">tendency</span> to develop "social relationships" with animals structurally <span class="highlight">similar</span> to those developed with people-<span class="highlight">specifically</span>, the <span class="highlight">ability</span> to think of animals as people (anthropomorphism) and of people as animals (totemism); and (4) the <span class="highlight">tendency</span> to <span class="highlight">manipulate</span> plants and animals.</p>
          <p>The fact that some societies <span class="highlight">domesticated</span> animals and plants, discovered the use of metal tools, became <span class="highlight">literate</span>, and developed a <span class="highlight">state</span> should not make us forget that others developed pastoralism or horticulture (vegetable gardening) but remained <span class="highlight">illiterate</span> and at low levels of <span class="highlight">productivity</span>; a few entered the modern period as hunting and gathering societies. It is anthropologically important to <span class="highlight">inquire</span> into the conditions that made some societies <span class="highlight">adopt</span> <span class="highlight">agriculture</span> while others remained hunter-gatherers or horticulturalists. However, it should be kept in <span class="highlight">mind</span> that many societies that knew of <span class="highlight">agriculture</span> more or less <span class="highlight">consciously</span> avoided it. Whether Mithen's explanation is satisfactory is open to <span class="question11">contention</span>, and some authors have recently emphasized the importance of other factors.</p>
