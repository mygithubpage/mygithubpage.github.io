          <h4 class="w3-center">The Origins of Agriculture</h4>
          <p>How did it come about that farming developed independently in a number of world centers (the Southeast Asian mainland, Southwest Asia, Central America, <span class="highlight">lowland</span> and highland South America,
and <span class="highlight">equatorial</span> Africa) at more or less the same time? <span class="highlight">Agriculture</span> developed slowly among populations that had an <span class="highlight">extensive</span> knowledge of plants and animals. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>Changing from hunting and gathering to <span class="highlight">agriculture</span> had no <span class="highlight">immediate</span> advantages. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>To start with, it forced the <span class="highlight">population</span> to <span class="highlight">abandon</span> the nomad's life and became <span class="highlight">sedentary</span>, 
to develop methods of <span class="highlight">storage</span> and, often, systems of <span class="highlight">irrigation</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>While hunter-gatherers always had the <span class="highlight question1">option</span> of moving elsewhere when the resources were exhausted, 
this became more difficult with farming. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>Furthermore, as the <span class="highlight">archaeological</span> <span class="highlight">record</span> shows, the <span class="highlight">state</span> of health of agriculturalists was worse than that of their <span class="highlight">contemporary</span> hunter-gatherers.</p>
          <p>Traditionally, it was believed that the <span class="highlight">transition</span> to <span class="highlight">agriculture</span> was the result of a worldwide <span class="highlight">population</span> crisis. It was argued that once hunter-gatherers had occupied the whole world, the <span class="highlight">population</span> started to grow everywhere and food became <span class="highlight">scarce</span>; <span class="highlight">agriculture</span> would have been a <span class="highlight">solution</span> to this problem. We know, however, that <span class="highlight">contemporary</span> hunter-gatherer societies control their <span class="highlight">population</span> in a <span class="highlight">variety</span> of ways. The idea of a world <span class="highlight">population</span> crisis is <span class="highlight"><span class="question3">therefore</span></span> <span class="highlight">unlikely</span>, although <span class="highlight">population</span> <span class="highlight">pressure</span> might have arisen in some areas.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="highlight">Climatic</span> changes at the end of the <span class="highlight">glacial</span> period 13,000 years ago have been proposed to <span class="highlight">account</span> for the <span class="highlight">emergence</span> of farming. <span class="question5">The <span class="highlight">temperature</span> increased <span class="highlight">dramatically</span> in a short period of time (years rather than centuries), allowing for a growth of the hunting-gathering <span class="highlight">population</span> <span class="highlight">due</span> to the <span class="highlight">abundance</span> of resources.</span> There were, however, fluctuations in the <span class="highlight">climatic</span> conditions, with the consequences that wet conditions were followed by dry ones, so that the <span class="highlight">availability</span> of plants and animals oscillated brusquely.</p>
          <p>It would <span class="highlight">appear</span> that the <span class="highlight">instability</span> of the <span class="highlight">climatic</span> conditions led populations that had originally been <span class="highlight">nomadic</span> to <span class="highlight">settle</span> down and develop a <span class="highlight">sedentary</span> style of life, which led in turn to <span class="highlight">population</span> growth and to the need to increase the <span class="highlight">amount</span> of food <span class="highlight">available</span>. Farming originated in these conditions. Later on, it became very difficult to change because of the <span class="highlight">significant</span> <span class="highlight">expansion</span> of these populations. It could be argued, however, that these conditions are not <span class="highlight">sufficient</span> to explain the origins of <span class="highlight">agriculture</span>. <span class="question8">Earth had experienced <span class="highlight">previous</span> periods of <span class="highlight">climatic</span> change, and yet <span class="highlight">agriculture</span> had not been developed.</span></p>
          <p>It is archaeologist Steven Mithen's <span class="highlight">thesis</span>, brilliantly developed in his book The Prehistory of the <span class="highlight">Mind</span> (1996), that <span class="highlight">approximately</span> 40,000 years ago the human <span class="highlight">mind</span> developed <span class="highlight">cognitive</span> fluidity, that is, the <span class="highlight">integration</span> of the specializations of the mind: <span class="highlight">technical</span>, natural <span class="highlight">history</span> (geared to understanding the <span class="highlight">behavior</span> and <span class="highlight">distribution</span> of natural resources), social <span class="highlight">intelligence</span>, and the <span class="highlight">linguistic</span> <span class="highlight">capacity</span>. <span class="highlight">Cognitive</span> fluidity explains the <span class="highlight">appearance</span> of art, <span class="highlight">religion</span>, and <span class="highlight">sophisticated</span> speech. Once humans possessed such a <span class="highlight">mind</span>, they were able to find an <span class="question9">imaginative</span> <span class="highlight">solution</span> to a situation of <span class="highlight">severe</span> <span class="highlight">economic</span> crisis such as the farming <span class="highlight">dilemma</span> described earlier. Mithen proposes the <span class="highlight">existence</span> of four <span class="highlight">mental</span> elements to <span class="highlight">account</span> for the <span class="highlight">emergence</span> of farming: (1) the <span class="highlight">ability</span> to develop tools that could be used intensively to <span class="highlight">harvest</span> and <span class="highlight">process</span> plant resources; (2) the <span class="highlight">tendency</span> to use plants and animals as the <span class="highlight">medium</span> to <span class="highlight">acquire</span> social <span class="highlight">prestige</span> and power; (3) the <span class="highlight">tendency</span> to develop "social relationships" with animals structurally <span class="highlight">similar</span> to those developed with people-<span class="highlight">specifically</span>, the <span class="highlight">ability</span> to think of animals as people (anthropomorphism) and of people as animals (totemism); and (4) the <span class="highlight">tendency</span> to <span class="highlight">manipulate</span> plants and animals.</p>
          <p>The fact that some societies <span class="highlight">domesticated</span> animals and plants, discovered the use of metal tools, became <span class="highlight">literate</span>, and developed a <span class="highlight">state</span> should not make us forget that others developed pastoralism or horticulture (vegetable gardening) but remained <span class="highlight">illiterate</span> and at low levels of <span class="highlight">productivity</span>; a few entered the modern period as hunting and gathering societies. It is anthropologically important to <span class="highlight">inquire</span> into the conditions that made some societies <span class="highlight">adopt</span> <span class="highlight">agriculture</span> while others remained hunter-gatherers or horticulturalists. However, it should be kept in <span class="highlight">mind</span> that many societies that knew of <span class="highlight">agriculture</span> more or less <span class="highlight">consciously</span> avoided it. Whether Mithen's explanation is satisfactory is open to <span class="question11">contention</span>, and some authors have recently emphasized the importance of other factors.</p>

The reason why the original text says that it is difficult to change back is because of the expansion of the population, that is, the large population during the agricultural period and the small population during the nomadic period.

            <div class="explanation">
              <p>B. The rhetorical question. First read the sentence in which the example is written. It is said that the earth had climate change before, but agriculture did not develop. Since the entire sentence is an example, looking forward, the preceding sentence states that the above explanation alone cannot explain the origin of agriculture. That is to say, the climate change mentioned later is not enough to explain the origin of agriculture. So the answer is B.</p>
