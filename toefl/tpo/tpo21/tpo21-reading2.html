and <span class="highlight">equatorial</span> Africa) at more or less the same time? <span class="highlight">Agriculture</span> developed slowly among populations that had an <span class="highlight">extensive</span> knowledge of plants and animals. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>Changing from hunting and gathering to <span class="highlight">agriculture</span> had no <span class="highlight">immediate</span> advantages. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>To start with, it forced the <span class="highlight">population</span> to <span class="highlight">abandon</span> the nomad's life and became <span class="highlight">sedentary</span>, 
to develop methods of <span class="highlight">storage</span> and, often, systems of <span class="highlight">irrigation</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>While hunter-gatherers always had the <span class="highlight question1">option</span> of moving elsewhere when the resources were exhausted, 
this became more difficult with farming. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>Furthermore, as the <span class="highlight">archaeological</span><span class="highlight">record</span> shows, the <span class="highlight">state</span> of health of agriculturalists was worse than that of their <span class="highlight">contemporary</span> hunter-gatherers.</p><p>Traditionally, it was believed that the <span class="highlight">transition</span> to <span class="highlight">agriculture</span> was the result of a worldwide <span class="highlight">population</span> crisis. It was argued that once hunter-gatherers had occupied the whole world, the <span class="highlight">population</span> started to grow everywhere and food became <span class="highlight">scarce</span>; <span class="highlight">agriculture</span> would have been a <span class="highlight">solution</span> to this problem. We know, however, that <span class="highlight">contemporary</span> hunter-gatherer societies control their <span class="highlight">population</span> in a <span class="highlight">variety</span> of ways. The idea of a world <span class="highlight">population</span> crisis is <span class="highlight"><span class="question3">therefore</span></span><span class="highlight">unlikely</span>, although <span class="highlight">population</span><span class="highlight">pressure</span> might have arisen in some areas.</p><p><span class="highlight">Climatic</span> changes at the end of the <span class="highlight">glacial</span> period 13,000 years ago have been proposed to <span class="highlight">account</span> for the <span class="highlight">emergence</span> of farming. <span class="question5">The <span class="highlight">temperature</span> increased <span class="highlight">dramatically</span> in a short period of time (years rather than centuries), allowing for a growth of the hunting-gathering <span class="highlight">population</span><span class="highlight">due</span> to the <span class="highlight">abundance</span> of resources.</span> There were, however, fluctuations in the <span class="highlight">climatic</span> conditions, with the consequences that wet conditions were followed by dry ones, so that the <span class="highlight">availability</span> of plants and animals oscillated brusquely.</p><p>It would <span class="highlight">appear</span> that the <span class="highlight">instability</span> of the <span class="highlight">climatic</span> conditions led populations that had originally been <span class="highlight">nomadic</span> to <span class="highlight">settle</span> down and develop a <span class="highlight">sedentary</span> style of life, which led in turn to <span class="highlight">population</span> growth and to the need to increase the <span class="highlight">amount</span> of food <span class="highlight">available</span>. Farming originated in these conditions. Later on, it became very difficult to change because of the <span class="highlight">significant</span><span class="highlight">expansion</span> of these populations. It could be argued, however, that these conditions are not <span class="highlight">sufficient</span> to explain the origins of <span class="highlight">agriculture</span>. <span class="question8">Earth had experienced <span class="highlight">previous</span> periods of <span class="highlight">climatic</span> change, and yet <span class="highlight">agriculture</span> had not been developed.</span></p><p>It is archaeologist Steven Mithen's <span class="highlight">thesis</span>, brilliantly developed in his book The Prehistory of the <span class="highlight">Mind</span> (1996), that <span class="highlight">approximately</span> 40,000 years ago the human <span class="highlight">mind</span> developed <span class="highlight">cognitive</span> fluidity, that is, the <span class="highlight">integration</span> of the specializations of the mind: <span class="highlight">technical</span>, natural <span class="highlight">history</span> (geared to understanding the <span class="highlight">behavior</span> and <span class="highlight">distribution</span> of natural resources), social <span class="highlight">intelligence</span>, and the <span class="highlight">linguistic</span><span class="highlight">capacity</span>. <span class="highlight">Cognitive</span> fluidity explains the <span class="highlight">appearance</span> of art, <span class="highlight">religion</span>, and <span class="highlight">sophisticated</span> speech. Once humans possessed such a <span class="highlight">mind</span>, they were able to find an <span class="question9">imaginative</span><span class="highlight">solution</span> to a situation of <span class="highlight">severe</span><span class="highlight">economic</span> crisis such as the farming <span class="highlight">dilemma</span> described earlier. Mithen proposes the <span class="highlight">existence</span> of four <span class="highlight">mental</span> elements to <span class="highlight">account</span> for the <span class="highlight">emergence</span> of farming: (1) the <span class="highlight">ability</span> to develop tools that could be used intensively to <span class="highlight">harvest</span> and <span class="highlight">process</span> plant resources; (2) the <span class="highlight">tendency</span> to use plants and animals as the <span class="highlight">medium</span> to <span class="highlight">acquire</span> social <span class="highlight">prestige</span> and power; (3) the <span class="highlight">tendency</span> to develop "social relationships" with animals structurally <span class="highlight">similar</span> to those developed with people-<span class="highlight">specifically</span>, the <span class="highlight">ability</span> to think of animals as people (anthropomorphism) and of people as animals (totemism); and (4) the <span class="highlight">tendency</span> to <span class="highlight">manipulate</span> plants and animals.</p><p>The fact that some societies <span class="highlight">domesticated</span> animals and plants, discovered the use of metal tools, became <span class="highlight">literate</span>, and developed a <span class="highlight">state</span> should not make us forget that others developed pastoralism or horticulture (vegetable gardening) but remained <span class="highlight">illiterate</span> and at low levels of <span class="highlight">productivity</span>; a few entered the modern period as hunting and gathering societies. It is anthropologically important to <span class="highlight">inquire</span> into the conditions that made some societies <span class="highlight">adopt</span><span class="highlight">agriculture</span> while others remained hunter-gatherers or horticulturalists. However, it should be kept in <span class="highlight">mind</span> that many societies that knew of <span class="highlight">agriculture</span> more or less <span class="highlight">consciously</span> avoided it. Whether Mithen's explanation is satisfactory is open to <span class="question11">contention</span>, and some authors have recently emphasized the importance of other factors.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">option</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. choice</p><p>B. benefit</p><p>C. idea</p><p>D. experience</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A option: selection, option. A is choice; B is benefit, benefit; C is idea, idea; D is experience, experience. So A's choice is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 1, all of the following are advantages of hunting and gathering over agriculture EXCEPT:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It is a healthier lifestyle.</p><p>B. It requires less knowledge of plants and animals.</p><p>C. It does not need storage capabilities.</p><p>D. It is not tied to any specific location.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B EXCEPT questions, exclusion method. A's healthier lifestyle is targeted to the last sentence, saying that nomadic life is healthier, so A is right, not selected; B's knowledge of plants and animals is targeted to the second sentence, and the original text is said to be among people with rich knowledge Agricultural development, but MS can not rely on this to introduce nomadic people knowledge is less, so B wrong, choose; C's storage keyword positioning to the fourth sentence, said that agriculture needs develop storage method, so nomadic storage capacity is not so Well, C is right, not selected; D's specific location is positioned to the penultimate sentence, and according to the answer to the above question, this is obviously right and not selected.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question3">therefore</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. in theory</p><p>B. obviously</p><p>C. frequently</p><p>D. as a result</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" D"><p>D <span class="question3">therefore</span>, so the correct answer is D as a result. This question is simple, A theoretically B obviously C is often not right.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the following best describes the way paragraph 2 is organized?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. A possible explanation for a phenomenon is presented and then criticized</p><p>B. Two similar ways of accounting for a puzzling fact are considered.</p><p>C. Early societies' response to a problem is contrasted with contemporary societies' response.</p><p>D. A prehistoric development is first explained in traditional terms and then in contemporary terms.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A asked how to organize the whole paragraph. Look at the beginning. Note that at the beginning the author said traditionally. The appearance of this word means that there may be a turning point in the whole paragraph. Sure enough, the second sentence is it was argued. This is different from the first sentence. So the answer is A, first put forward, and then criticize.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The resources needed by the growing hunting and gathering population increased rapidly once temperatures rose.</p><p>B. Dramatic temperature increases and the simultaneous growth of the hunting and gathering population led to the need for more resources.</p><p>C. Higher temperatures led to the existence of increased resources, thus enabling the hunting and gathering population to grow.</p><p>D. The dramatic temperature increase occurred during the few years when abundant resources allowed the hunting and gathering population to grow.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C. Note the double cause-and-effect relationship between allowing and due to. The increase in temperature makes the resource abundant, and then makes the population grow. So the answer is C, which repeats this double cause. A. The final result, which is the population; B's simultaneous mistakenly wrong; D is mistaken for the relationship between the first two reasons.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 3, the abundance of resources fluctuated sharply after the end of the glacial period because</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. locally abundant resources were quickly exhausted by hunter-gatherers</p><p>B. the temperature became much higher in some areas over others</p><p>C. different types of plants and animals became available as the climate changed</p><p>D. the amount of rainfall varied radically from one period to the next</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D fluctuate keyword positioning to the last sentence, said that climate change, first wet followed by drought, resulting in also fluctuate availability, so the cause of resource fluctuations is the climate of dry and wet, so the answer is D changes of rainfall. A and B completely did not say that C's different plant and animal did not say</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>It can be inferred from paragraph 4 that it was difficult for people to change from farming back to hunting and gathering because</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. people had become more used to different types of food</p><p>B. climatic conditions were no longer favorable for hunting and gathering</p><p>C. populations had become too large to be supported by hunting and gathering</p><p>D. the farmer's sedentary life was easier than the hunter-gatherer's nomadic life</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C. Change from farming back to hunting and gathering to keyword positioning to the penultimate sentence. The reason why the original text says that it is difficult to change back is because of the expansion of the population, that is, the large population during the agricultural period and the small population during the nomadic period. So the answer is C, The other three answers did not say</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the author state that "<span class="highlight">Earth had experienced previous periods of climatic change, and yet agriculture had not been developed</span>"?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To suggest that climate change had occurred long before the development of agriculture</p><p>B. To argue that climate change does not properly explain why agriculture developed</p><p>C. To challenge the assumption that agriculture developed only in some parts of the world</p><p>D. To question the claim that climate change occurred at the time when agriculture developed</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="Earth had experienced previous periods of climatic change, and yet agriculture had not been developed B"><p>B. The rhetorical question. First read the sentence in which the example is written. It is said that the earth had climate change before, but agriculture did not develop. Since the entire sentence is an example, looking forward, the preceding sentence states that the above explanation alone cannot explain the origin of agriculture. That is to say, the climate change mentioned later is not enough to explain the origin of agriculture. So the answer is B.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question9">imaginative</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. complex</p><p>B. creative</p><p>C. immediate</p><p>D. reliable</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>B <span class="question9">imaginative</span>: <span class="question9">imaginative</span>. A is complex; B is creative; C is immediate; D is reliable. So the correct answer is B, creative.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 5, Steven Mithen believes that all of the following contributed to the emergence of farming EXCEPT</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. the development of a mind flexible enough to come up with solutions to complex problems</p><p>B. the tendency to use plants and animals to acquire power</p><p>C. the tendency to emphasize the differences between animals and people</p><p>D. the ability to make tools that could be used for the large-scale harvesting of plants</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C EXCEPT questions, exclusion. A's solutions are targeted to the third sentence, saying that there is a mind to solve the problem, so A is right, not selected; B's plants and animals and power do keyword positioning to the second point of three o'clock, B is correct, not Selected; C's difference did not say the original, so C is wrong, election; D's tools do keyword positioning to the first of three points, so D right, not selected</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question11">contention</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. investigation</p><p>B. improvement</p><p>C. debate</p><p>D. interpretation</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" C"><p>C <span class="question11">contention</span>: Controversy. A is a survey; B is an improvement, improvement; C is a dispute, an argument; D is an explanation, an explanation. So the correct answer is C's debate.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 6, which of the following is a weakness of Mithen</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It does not clearly distinguish agriculture from pastoralism and horticulture.</p><p>B. It fails to explain why some societies adopted agriculture while others did not.</p><p>C. It explains the domestication of plants and animals but not the development of metal tools.</p><p>D. It overlooks the fact that illiteracy and low productivity remain problems even today</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B asked him what the problem was. He used the name of the person as the key word to position the last sentence, but we had seen the last sentence. We did not say the shortcomings. Looking ahead, we said that some ethnic groups have settled in nomadic ethnic groups. Some people who have mastered agricultural technology are more or less avoiding agriculture. Then they say that M's explanation is controversial. That is, M cannot explain the reason for this situation well. So the answer is B, and A cannot The distinction is wrong, the original is still different; the C and D texts are not spoken</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Because humans had built up this knowledge as hunter-gatherers, it is logical to conclude that over time they would have become extremely efficient..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A This question is simple, a transition point is enough, to insert the sentence to say this knowledge, so there must be knowledge before, so the answer is A. Exclusion can also be solved, B behind the start to start with inserting points before no immediate advantages, so do not insert any sentences; C said after moving difficult, corresponding to the sedentary before C; D after furthermore progressive convergence close, Do not insert any sentence.</p></div></div><div id="question14" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>
It is unclear why hunter-gatherers in different parts of the world independently developed agriculture at roughly the same time.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.One obstacle to the transition from a nomadic lifestyle to the sedentary lifestyle required by agriculture was that hunter-gatherers had not developed storage techniques.</p><p>B.The origins of agriculture maybe linked to climate change at the end of the last ice age, but this does not explain why earlier climatic instability had not led to agriculture.</p><p>C.One recent theory suggests that the invention of agriculture was made possible by the integration of various mental capacities in the human mind</p><p>D.It seems unlikely that agriculture emerged in response to a food shortage brought on by a worldwide population crisis that developed once the whole world was occupied</p><p>E.The only available means of understanding the social organization and technical abilities of ancient hunter-gatherer societies is the study of contemporary hunter-gatherers.</p><p>F.Little is known about why only some societies that adopted agriculture rapidly progressed to using metal tools, becoming literate, and developing a state</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="BCD"><p>The BCD One obstacle option is a detail of the first paragraph. Do not select the .It seems option corresponding to the second sentence of the second paragraph of the original text. The correct .The origins option corresponds to the last two sentences of the fourth paragraph of the original text. The correct answer to the only option is selected. But personally feel that this option is wrong, because did not find a paragraph to say this option, so personally think not to choose. One recent option answers to the wrong, but personally think this is right, because the entire fifth paragraph is This answer, so it is correct. Little is known to seem related to the first sentence of the sixth paragraph of the original text, but the original said that we can not forget advanced because some advanced, options do not know the reason, said is not a In fact, do not choose.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
