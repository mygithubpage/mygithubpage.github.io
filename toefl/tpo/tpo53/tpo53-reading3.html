            <b>Paleolithic Cave Paintings</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>In any <span class="underline">investigation</span> of the origins of art, <span class="underline">attention</span> focuses on the cave paintings created in Europe during the <span class="underline">Paleolithic</span> <span class="underline">era</span> (c. 40,000-10,000 years ago) such as those depicting bulls and other animals in the Lascaux cave in France. Accepting that they are the best preserved and most <span class="underline">visible</span> signs of what was a global <span class="underline">creative</span> <span class="underline">explosion</span>, how do we start to explain their <span class="underline">appearance</span>? Instinctively, we may want to update the earliest human artists by assuming that they painted for the <span class="underline">sheer</span> joy of painting. The philosophers of <span class="underline">Classical</span> Greece recognized it as a defining <span class="underline">trait</span> of humans to "<span class="underline">delight</span> in works of imitation"-to enjoy the very act and <span class="underline">triumph</span> of representation. If we were close to a real lion or snake, we might feel frightened. But a well- executed picture of a lion or snake will give us pleasure. Why <span class="underline">suppose</span> that our <span class="underline">Paleolithic</span> ancestors were any different?</p>
          <p>This simple acceptance of art for art's <span class="underline">sake</span> has a certain <span class="underline">appeal</span>. To think of Lascaux as a <span class="underline">gallery</span> allows it to be a <span class="underline">sort</span> of <span class="underline">special</span> viewing place where the handiwork of <span class="underline">accomplished</span> artists might be displayed. Plausibly, daily <span class="underline">existence</span> in parts of <span class="underline">Paleolithic</span> Europe may not have been so hard, with an <span class="underline">abundance</span> of ready food and <span class="underline">therefore</span> the <span class="underline">leisure</span> time for art. The problems with this explanation, however, are various. In the first place, the <span class="underline">proliferation</span> of <span class="underline">archaeological</span> discoveries-and this includes some of the world's <span class="underline">innumerable</span> rock art sites that cannot be <span class="underline">dated</span>-has served to <span class="underline">emphasize</span> a <span class="underline">remarkably</span> limited <span class="underline">repertoire</span> of subjects. The images that <span class="underline">recur</span> are those of animals. Human figures are unusual, and when they do make an <span class="underline">appearance</span>, they are <span class="underline">rarely</span> done with the same <span class="underline">attention</span> to form accorded to the animals. If <span class="underline">Paleolithic</span> artists were <span class="underline">simply</span> seeking to <span class="underline">represent</span> the beauty of the world around them, would they not have left a far greater <span class="underline">range</span> of pictures-of trees, flowers, of the Sun and the stars?</p>
          <p>A further question to the <span class="underline">theory</span> of art for art's <span class="underline">sake</span> is posed by the high incidence of <span class="underline">Paleolithic</span> images that <span class="underline">appear</span> not to be imitative of any reality whatsoever. These are <span class="underline">geometrical</span> shapes or patterns consisting of dots or lines. Such marks may be found <span class="underline">isolated</span> or repeated over a <span class="underline">particular</span> surface but also <span class="underline">scattered</span> <span class="underline">across</span> more recognizable forms. A good example of this may be seen in the geologically <span class="underline">spectacular</span> grotto of Pêche Merle, in the Lot <span class="underline">region</span> of France. Here we <span class="underline">encounter</span> some favorite animals from the <span class="underline">Paleolithic</span> <span class="underline">repertoire</span>-a pair of stout-bellied horses. But over and around the horses' outlines are <span class="underline">multiple</span> dark spots, daubed in <span class="underline">disregard</span> for the <span class="underline">otherwise</span> naturalistic representation of animals. What does such patterning <span class="underline">imitate</span>? There is also the <span class="underline">factor</span> of location. The caves of Lascaux might <span class="underline">conceivably</span> <span class="underline">qualify</span> as <span class="underline">underground</span> galleries, but many other paintings have been found in recesses totally unsuitable for any kind of viewing-tight nooks and crannies that must have been <span class="underline">awkward</span> <span class="underline">even</span> for the artists to <span class="underline">penetrate</span>, let alone for anyone else wanting to see the art.</p>
          <p>Finally, we may <span class="underline">doubt</span> the <span class="underline">notion</span> that the Upper <span class="underline">Paleolithic</span> period was a paradise in which food came <span class="underline">readily</span>, leaving humans <span class="underline">ample</span> time to <span class="underline">amuse</span> themselves with art. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> For Europe it was still the Ice Age. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> An <span class="underline">estimate</span> of the <span class="underline">basic</span> <span class="underline">level</span> of <span class="underline">sustenance</span> then necessary for human <span class="underline">survival</span> has been judged at 2200 calories per day. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span> This <span class="underline">consideration</span>, combined with the <span class="underline">stark</span> emphasis upon animals in the cave art, has persuaded some archaeologists that the <span class="underline">primary</span> <span class="underline">motive</span> behind <span class="underline">Paleolithic</span> images must lie with the <span class="underline">primary</span> <span class="underline">activity</span> of <span class="underline">Paleolithic</span> people: hunting. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p>
          <p>Hunting is a skill. Tracking, stalking, chasing, and killing the <span class="underline">prey</span> are difficult, sometimes dangerous activities. What if the <span class="underline">process</span> could be made easier-by art? In the early decades of the twentieth <span class="underline">century</span>, Abbé Henri Breuil argued that the cave paintings were all about "<span class="underline">sympathetic</span> magic. " The artists strived diligently to make their animal images evocative and <span class="underline">realistic</span> because they were attempting to <span class="underline">capture</span> the spirit of their <span class="underline">prey</span>. What could have prompted their studious <span class="underline">attention</span> to making such naturalistic, recognizable images? According to Breuil, the artists may have believed that if a hunter were able to make a true likeness of some animal, then that animal was <span class="underline">virtually</span> trapped. Images, <span class="underline">therefore</span>, may have had the magical <span class="underline">capacity</span> to <span class="underline">confer</span> success or luck in the hunt.</p>
