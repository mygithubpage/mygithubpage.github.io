Accepting that they are the best preserved and most <span class="highlight">visible</span> signs of what was a global <span class="highlight">creative</span><span class="highlight">explosion</span>, how do we start to explain their <span class="highlight">appearance</span>? Instinctively, we may want to update the earliest human artists by assuming that they painted for the <span class="highlight">sheer</span> joy of painting. The philosophers of <span class="highlight">Classical</span> Greece recognized it as a defining <span class="highlight">trait</span> of humans to "<span class="highlight">delight</span> in works of imitation"-to enjoy the very act and <span class="highlight">triumph</span> of representation. If we were close to a real lion or snake, we might feel frightened. But a well- executed picture of a lion or snake will give us pleasure. Why <span class="highlight">suppose</span> that our <span class="highlight">Paleolithic</span> ancestors were any different?</p><p>This simple acceptance of art for art's <span class="highlight">sake</span> has a certain <span class="highlight">appeal</span>. To think of Lascaux as a <span class="highlight">gallery</span> allows it to be a <span class="highlight">sort</span> of <span class="highlight">special</span> viewing place where the handiwork of <span class="highlight">accomplished</span> artists might be displayed. <span class="question4">Plausibly</span>, daily <span class="highlight">existence</span> in parts of <span class="highlight">Paleolithic</span> Europe may not have been so hard, with an <span class="highlight">abundance</span> of ready food and <span class="highlight">therefore</span> the <span class="highlight">leisure</span> time for art. The problems with this explanation, however, are various. <span class="question5">In the first place, the <span class="highlight">proliferation</span> of <span class="highlight">archaeological</span> discoveries-and this includes some of the world's <span class="highlight">innumerable</span> rock art sites that cannot be <span class="highlight">dated</span>-has served to <span class="highlight">emphasize</span> a <span class="highlight">remarkably</span> limited <span class="highlight">repertoire</span> of subjects.</span> The images that <span class="highlight">recur</span> are those of animals. Human figures are unusual, and when they do make an <span class="highlight">appearance</span>, they are <span class="highlight">rarely</span> done with the same <span class="highlight">attention</span> to form accorded to the animals. If <span class="highlight">Paleolithic</span> artists were <span class="highlight">simply</span> seeking to <span class="highlight">represent</span> the beauty of the world around them, would they not have left a far greater <span class="highlight">range</span> of pictures-of trees, flowers, of the Sun and the stars?</p><p>A further question to the <span class="highlight">theory</span> of art for art's <span class="highlight">sake</span> is posed by the high incidence of <span class="highlight">Paleolithic</span> images that <span class="highlight">appear</span> not to be imitative of any reality whatsoever. These are <span class="highlight">geometrical</span> shapes or patterns consisting of dots or lines. Such marks may be found <span class="highlight">isolated</span> or repeated over a <span class="highlight">particular</span> surface but also <span class="highlight">scattered</span><span class="highlight">across</span> more recognizable forms. A good example of this may be seen in the geologically <span class="highlight"><span class="question7">spectacular</span></span> grotto of Pï¿½che Merle, in the Lot <span class="highlight">region</span> of France. Here we <span class="highlight">encounter</span> some favorite animals from the <span class="highlight">Paleolithic</span><span class="highlight">repertoire</span>-a pair of stout-bellied horses. But over and around the horses' outlines are <span class="highlight">multiple</span> dark spots, daubed in <span class="highlight">disregard</span> for the <span class="highlight">otherwise</span> naturalistic representation of animals. What does such patterning <span class="highlight">imitate</span>? There is also the <span class="highlight">factor</span> of location. The caves of Lascaux might <span class="highlight">conceivably</span><span class="highlight">qualify</span> as <span class="highlight">underground</span> galleries, but many other paintings have been found in recesses totally unsuitable for any kind of viewing-tight nooks and crannies that must have been <span class="highlight">awkward</span><span class="highlight">even</span> for the artists to <span class="highlight">penetrate</span>, let alone for anyone else wanting to see the art.</p><p>Finally, we may <span class="highlight">doubt</span> the <span class="highlight">notion</span> that the Upper <span class="highlight">Paleolithic</span> period was a paradise in which food came <span class="highlight">readily</span>, leaving humans <span class="highlight">ample</span> time to <span class="highlight">amuse</span> themselves with art. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> For Europe it was still the Ice Age. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> An <span class="highlight">estimate</span> of the <span class="highlight">basic</span><span class="highlight">level</span> of <span class="highlight">sustenance</span> then necessary for human <span class="highlight">survival</span> has been judged at 2200 calories per day. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span> This <span class="highlight">consideration</span>, combined with the <span class="highlight">stark</span> emphasis upon animals in the cave art, has persuaded some archaeologists that the <span class="highlight">primary</span><span class="highlight">motive</span> behind <span class="highlight">Paleolithic</span> images must lie with the <span class="highlight">primary</span><span class="highlight">activity</span> of <span class="highlight">Paleolithic</span> people: hunting. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p><p>Hunting is a skill. Tracking, stalking, chasing, and killing the <span class="highlight">prey</span> are difficult, sometimes dangerous activities. What if the <span class="highlight">process</span> could be made easier-by art? In the early decades of the twentieth <span class="highlight">century</span>, Abbï¿½ Henri Breuil argued that the cave paintings were all about "<span class="highlight">sympathetic</span> magic. " The artists strived <span class="question10">diligently</span> to make their animal images evocative and <span class="highlight">realistic</span> because they were attempting to <span class="highlight">capture</span> the spirit of their <span class="highlight">prey</span>. What could have <span class="question12">prompted</span> their studious <span class="highlight">attention</span> to making such naturalistic, recognizable images? According to Breuil, the artists may have believed that if a hunter were able to make a true likeness of some animal, then that animal was <span class="highlight">virtually</span> trapped. Images, <span class="highlight">therefore</span>, may have had the magical <span class="highlight">capacity</span> to <span class="highlight">confer</span> success or luck in the hunt.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 1, what is significant about the paintings in the Lascaux caves?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.
