Others prefer to save the extra money. Which do you like to do? Explain why.</p></section><section id="sample-response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><article><p>I will definitely save it up, because this money could promise my life standard even though I will have a big cost. For example, before my marriage, I used to spend all of my salary for fun. I love traveling so usually I planned 3 or 4 trips a year. But, when one day I considered buying my own apartment and getting into marriage, I found nothing from my bank savings. I felt myself in total despair. So I loaned a lot of money from the bank. And ever since then, my life changed. I began to work very hard, cut all my travel plans, and save every extra penny for my savings. What a painful experience!</p></article></section></main></body></html>
