Beth?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="1.89" data-time="142.65">[02:22.65]</span>Student: How do the rings form?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.4" data-time="144.54">[02:24.54]</span>Professor: How do the rings form! <span class="time" data-times="3.81" data-time="146.94">[02:26.94]</span>Because they are apparently replenishing themselves somehow. <span class="time" data-times="3.34" data-time="150.75">[02:30.75]</span>OK, here is one possibility. <span class="time" data-times="6.69" data-time="154.09">[02:34.09]</span>The moons, the dozens of moons, they all <span class="highlight">orbit</span> Saturn, are providing <span class="highlight">raw</span> material for the rings.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="9.88" data-time="160.78">[02:40.78]</span>A moon in the system is complex at Saturn's, and Saturn has at least 49 known moons which vary tremendously in size and shape. <span class="time" data-times="11.33" data-time="170.66">[02:50.66]</span>A moon in such a complex system, is not only affected by the <span class="highlight">gravitational</span> force of the planet, but also by that of the other moons.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.49" data-time="181.99">[03:01.99]</span>Student: So the planet may be pulling a moon one way, and other moons may be pulling it other ways?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="10.03" data-time="187.48">[03:07.48]</span>Professor: Exactly. Such forces could actually <span class="highlight">alter</span> a moon's <span class="highlight">orbit</span>, and as a result there might be a <span class="highlight">collision</span> when moon might crash into another. <span class="time" data-times="4.6" data-time="197.51">[03:17.51]</span>And the <span class="highlight">debris</span> from that <span class="highlight">collision</span> could become part of the rings. <span class="time" data-times="9.61" data-time="202.11">[03:22.11]</span>Then there are <span class="highlight">tidal</span> forces, a moon might get too close to the planet and get broken apart by Saturn's <span class="highlight">tidal</span> forces.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.33" data-time="211.72">[03:31.72]</span>Student: Excuse me! You mean, <span class="highlight">tidal</span> force is like high tide and low tide on the oceans?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.64" data-time="217.05">[03:37.05]</span>Professor: Well, by <span class="highlight">tidal</span> force, I'm referring to the <span class="highlight">gravitational</span> pull of Saturn on its moons. <span class="time" data-times="10.39" data-time="223.69">[03:43.69]</span>In the mid-1800s, a French scientist named Edouard Roche was studying the effects of a planet's <span class="highlight">tidal</span> forces on its moons.<span class="time" data-times="16.88" data-time="234.08">[03:54.08]</span>Roche was able to show mathematically that if one <span class="highlight">celestial</span> body, say a moon, if it passes too close to another, say a planet, that has a <span class="highlight">gravitational</span> force stronger than the force of self-attraction that holds the moon together.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.12" data-time="250.96">[04:10.96]</span>Well, that first body,that moon, it'd be ripped apart. <span class="time" data-times="4.75" data-time="256.08">[04:16.08]</span>We call the distance at which this happens the "Roche limit". <span class="time" data-times="12.59" data-time="260.83">[04:20.83]</span>So if one of Saturn's moons reaches the Roche limit of the planet, or even a larger moon, it would disintegrate, be torn apart and thus add more material to the ring system.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.63" data-time="273.42">[04:33.42]</span>And there's another way new material might be added to the Saturn's rings, an <span class="highlight">asteroid</span> crashing into one of the moons. <span class="time" data-times="8.67" data-time="281.05">[04:41.05]</span>This <span class="highlight">hypothesis</span> is supported by the fact that some of the many rings are a bit <span class="highlight">reddish</span> in color. Yes, George?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.41" data-time="289.72">[04:49.72]</span>Student: I'm sorry, I don't follow the logic.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="10.5" data-time="292.13">[04:52.13]</span>Professor: Well, this <span class="highlight">reddish</span><span class="highlight">coloration</span> suggests the presence of complex organic molecules, carbon-based molecules, mixed in with the water ice. <span class="time" data-times="5.69" data-time="302.63">[05:02.63]</span>Remember, the rest of Saturn's rings are made almost entirely of water ice. <span class="time" data-times="3.14" data-time="308.32">[05:08.32]</span>And none of Saturn's moons is red. <span class="time" data-times="2.87" data-time="311.46">[05:11.46]</span>But asteroids could be. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="314.33">[05:14.33]</span>And thus could end up contributing to the ring system, the kind of carbon-based molecules we're talking about.</p></p></article></section><div id="question"><div id="question1"><p>What is the main purpose of the lecture?</p><label class="my-label"><span>A.
