              <span class="time" data-times="6" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Listen to part of a lecture in a world <span class="underline">history</span> class.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.59" data-time="6">[00:06.00]</span>Professor: Now, according to Chinese <span class="underline">legend</span>, the first person to drink tea was a Chinese <span class="underline">emperor</span> who lived nearly 5000 years ago. <span class="time" data-times="6.19" data-time="14.59">[00:14.59]</span>This <span class="underline">emperor</span> was, oh, you could call him an <span class="underline">amateur</span> scientist. <span class="time" data-times="4.66" data-time="20.78">[00:20.78]</span>And he wisely required all drinking water to be boiled for <span class="underline">hygiene</span>. <span class="time" data-times="12.55" data-time="25.44">[00:25.44]</span>So, once, emm, when visiting some <span class="underline">distant</span> part of his <span class="underline">empire</span>, he noticed that a <span class="underline">breeze</span> had blown some leaves into his pot of boiling water and these leaves turned the water kind of brown. <span class="time" data-times="4.27" data-time="37.99">[00:37.99]</span>So, well, would it be your first <span class="underline">impulse</span> to drink this? <span class="time" data-times="4.13" data-time="42.26">[00:42.26]</span>Probably not. But he thought the resulting brews smell <span class="underline">pretty</span> good. <span class="time" data-times="4.03" data-time="46.39">[00:46.39]</span>And in the name of science and discovery, he tasted it. <span class="time" data-times="3.17" data-time="50.42">[00:50.42]</span>And the practice of drinking tea was born.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.98" data-time="53.59">[00:53.59]</span>Oh, well, a good story. <span class="time" data-times="6.91" data-time="56.57">[00:56.57]</span>But actually we cannot say with any certainty just who first discovered how to make tea. <span class="time" data-times="8.06" data-time="63.48">[01:03.48]</span>We can be confident though, that the Chinese have been using it in some form for close to 5000 years. <span class="time" data-times="9.75" data-time="71.54">[01:11.54]</span>And from those earliest times, more and more tea was <span class="underline">cultivated</span> to meet the growing demand, and tea became an important part of the <span class="underline">economy</span> of China. <span class="time" data-times="7.1" data-time="81.29">[01:21.29]</span>In fact, it was formed into <span class="underline">sort</span> of bricks, and used as a <span class="underline">common</span> type of <span class="underline">currency</span> for <span class="underline">trade</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.47" data-time="88.39">[01:28.39]</span>But its effect on Chinese <span class="underline">culture</span> was <span class="underline">even</span> more <span class="underline">profound</span>. <span class="time" data-times="10.84" data-time="92.86">[01:32.86]</span>Tea became extremely <span class="underline">popular</span> in China, and scholars <span class="underline">even</span> wrote works discussing how to grow tea, <span class="underline">prepare</span> it, drink it, really championing tea; <span class="time" data-times="4.76" data-time="103.7">[01:43.70]</span>one of them saying it was like the sweetest dew of heaven.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.6" data-time="108.46">[01:48.46]</span>Now, recommendations like this could only add to its huge popularity there. <span class="time" data-times="3.6" data-time="113.06">[01:53.06]</span>But tea was also spreading throughout Asia. <span class="time" data-times="10.71" data-time="116.66">[01:56.66]</span>In Japan, perhaps <span class="underline">even</span> more than in China, tea became a <span class="underline">major</span> cultural <span class="underline">symbol</span>, and one of <span class="underline">refinement</span> of <span class="underline">etiquette</span> and <span class="underline">aesthetics</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.07" data-time="127.37">[02:07.37]</span>Well, best seen in the <span class="underline">traditional</span> Japanese tea <span class="underline">ceremony</span>, which is still performed today. <span class="time" data-times="6.86" data-time="133.44">[02:13.44]</span>This is an <span class="underline">intricate</span> <span class="underline">formal</span> <span class="underline">ritual</span>, emm, <span class="underline">ceremony</span> that can take hours to complete.<span class="time" data-times="6.24" data-time="140.3">[02:20.30]</span>Clearly, tea became not just a <span class="underline">beverage</span> in Japanese <span class="underline">culture</span> but much much more. <span class="time" data-times="11.04" data-time="146.54">[02:26.54]</span>Tea <span class="underline">eventually</span> got to western Europe, after European traders, mainly Portuguese and Dutch, brought the first small <span class="underline">commercial</span> shipment of tea back to Europe. <span class="time" data-times="7.59" data-time="157.58">[02:37.58]</span> <span class="underline">Unfortunately</span>, it was mostly just treated as a <span class="underline">curiosity</span>, since no one knew quite how it was supposed to be used.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.65" data-time="165.17">[02:45.17]</span>A few has some <span class="underline">pretty</span> strong opinions though. <span class="time" data-times="5.08" data-time="168.82">[02:48.82]</span>One German doctor wrote a book saying tea was harmful, actually <span class="underline">poisonous</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9.41" data-time="173.9">[02:53.90]</span>But at about the same time, another doctor from Holland wrote another book calling tea 'a <span class="underline">miracle</span> cure for just about everything'. <span class="time" data-times="1.32" data-time="183.31">[03:03.31]</span>Who to believe?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.16" data-time="184.63">[03:04.63]</span>So, anyway, tea didn't really catch on in Germany or France, as something just to enjoy drinking, they <span class="underline">seem</span> to <span class="underline">prefer</span> coffee. <span class="time" data-times="3.17" data-time="192.79">[03:12.79]</span>But England did take to tea. <span class="time" data-times="3.02" data-time="195.96">[03:15.96]</span>And to an <span class="underline">extent</span> that nobody could have foreseen. <span class="time" data-times="5.67" data-time="198.98">[03:18.98]</span>Such that, <span class="underline">even</span> today we <span class="underline">tend</span> to <span class="underline">associate</span> England, Great Britain with tea. <span class="time" data-times="8.45" data-time="204.65">[03:24.65]</span>And, well, a bit of <span class="underline">perspective</span>, at the start of the 18th <span class="underline">century</span>, almost nobody in England drank tea. <span class="time" data-times="2.88" data-time="213.1">[03:33.10]</span>But by the end of it, almost everybody did. <span class="time" data-times="8.54" data-time="215.98">[03:35.98]</span>By the 1750s, <span class="underline">official</span> records show tea imports up from almost nothing to about 20 million kilos. <span class="time" data-times="7.06" data-time="224.52">[03:44.52]</span>And those records didn't <span class="underline">even</span> begin to <span class="underline">account</span> for all the tea smuggled into the country illegally to <span class="underline">avoid</span> paying taxes. <span class="time" data-times="11.66" data-time="231.58">[03:51.58]</span>And as for reasons for the popularity of tea there, well, tea first became <span class="underline">fashionable</span> after the king of England married a Portuguese princess who loved tea. <span class="time" data-times="4.94" data-time="243.24">[04:03.24]</span>And <span class="underline">pretty</span> soon, more and more people started copying her and drinking tea. <span class="time" data-times="7.73" data-time="248.18">[04:08.18]</span>Later, when a direct <span class="underline">trade</span> <span class="underline">route</span> was established between China and England, the <span class="underline">supply</span> of tea greatly increased. <span class="time" data-times="4.27" data-time="255.91">[04:15.91]</span>Most important though, tea drinking became <span class="underline">sociable</span>. <span class="time" data-times="10.42" data-time="260.18">[04:20.18]</span>And although coffee houses or <span class="underline">tavern</span> were generally considered to be for men only, tea shops became places where women could come. <span class="time" data-times="2.16" data-time="270.6">[04:30.60]</span>And <span class="underline">even</span> bring their families. <span class="time" data-times="17.81" data-time="272.76">[04:32.76]</span>And soon there were tea parties, books on tea <span class="underline">etiquette</span>, and <span class="underline">even</span> tea gardens-parks filled with lights and walkways and venues for <span class="underline">musical</span> performances, places where people of all social classes could go to drink tea and socialize. <span class="time" data-times="8.21" data-time="290.57">[04:50.57]</span>By the end of the 18th <span class="underline">century</span>, all classes of English society drank tea, from royalty to <span class="underline">common</span> workers. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="298.78">[04:58.78]</span>Tea became a <span class="underline">staple</span> of everyday life, part of the <span class="underline">common</span> <span class="underline">culture</span>, and traditionally considered by many, the very mark of being English.</p>
