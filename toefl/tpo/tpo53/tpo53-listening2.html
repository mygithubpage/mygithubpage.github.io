          <p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.01" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Listen to part of a lecture in a <span class="underline">film</span> studies class.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.61" data-time="5.01">[00:05.01]</span>Professor: Nowadays we take <span class="underline">sound</span> in films for granted. <span class="time" data-times="3.03" data-time="8.62">[00:08.62]</span>I mean you still might see black and white films occasionally. <span class="time" data-times="2.35" data-time="11.65">[00:11.65]</span>But you'll <span class="underline">hardly</span> ever see silent films anymore.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.17" data-time="14">[00:14.00]</span>So it's interesting to note that the use of recorded <span class="underline">sound</span> was originally <span class="underline">controversial</span>. <span class="time" data-times="13.64" data-time="19.17">[00:19.17]</span>And some directors, uh, some filmmakers <span class="underline">even</span> thought it shouldn't be used, that it would destroy the <span class="underline">purity</span> of cinema, somehow <span class="underline">reverse</span> all the progress that had been made in the art of cinema. Abby?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.34" data-time="32.81">[00:32.81]</span>Abby: What about all the sounds you hear in some silent movies? <span class="time" data-times="3.76" data-time="36.15">[00:36.15]</span>Like, you know, a loud <span class="underline">sound</span> when somebody falls down or something?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.9" data-time="39.91">[00:39.91]</span>Professor: Okay, you're talking about a soundtrack added much later, which has over time become part of the <span class="underline">film</span> we know. <span class="time" data-times="2.77" data-time="46.81">[00:46.81]</span>But this recorded <span class="underline">track</span> didn't exist then.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.72" data-time="49.58">[00:49.58]</span>And it's not that most people didn't want <span class="underline">sound</span> in films. <span class="time" data-times="2.58" data-time="53.3">[00:53.30]</span>It's just that the technology wasn't <span class="underline">available</span> yet. <span class="time" data-times="9.66" data-time="55.88">[00:55.88]</span>Don't forget that <span class="underline">instead</span> of recorded <span class="underline">sound</span>, there was often live music that accompanied movies in those days, like a piano player or a larger <span class="underline">orchestra</span> in the movie theater.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.64" data-time="65.54">[01:05.54]</span>Also, think of the <span class="underline">stage</span>, the live theater, it has used wonderful <span class="underline">sound</span> effects for a long time. <span class="time" data-times="4.65" data-time="72.18">[01:12.18]</span>And if <span class="underline">wanted</span>, these could be produced during the viewing of a <span class="underline">film</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.6" data-time="76.83">[01:16.83]</span>You know, the rolling of drums for thunder or whatever. <span class="time" data-times="2.09" data-time="80.43">[01:20.43]</span>But that wasn't as <span class="underline">common</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="29.21" data-time="82.52">[01:22.52]</span>Oh, and another thing, that they might have in movie theaters in the early days, was a group of live actors reading the parts to go <span class="underline">along</span> with the <span class="underline">film</span>, or, and this seems a particularly bad idea to us now, one person narrating the <span class="underline">action</span>, an early example of a long tradition of movie producers, the ones concerned mostly about making money, not having much <span class="underline">confidence</span> in their <span class="underline">audience</span>, thinking that people somehow couldn't follow the events <span class="underline">otherwise</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.42" data-time="111.73">[01:51.73]</span>So, it finally became possible to play recorded <span class="underline">sound</span> as part of the <span class="underline">film</span> in the 1920s. <span class="time" data-times="3.76" data-time="118.15">[01:58.15]</span>Trouble was, it wasn't always used to very good effect. <span class="time" data-times="10.61" data-time="121.91">[02:01.91]</span>First it was, you know, amazing to see somebody's mouth move at the same time you hear the words, or hear a door close when you see it closing on <span class="underline">screen</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.59" data-time="132.52">[02:12.52]</span>But that <span class="underline">luster</span> wears off, of <span class="underline">course</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.33" data-time="135.11">[02:15.11]</span>And if you're a <span class="underline">director</span>, a filmmaker, what's the next step?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.4" data-time="139.44">[02:19.44]</span>Abby: Well, you <span class="underline">sound</span> to <span class="underline">enhance</span> the movie right? <span class="time" data-times="2.35" data-time="142.84">[02:22.84]</span>Bring something more to it that wasn't possible?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.22" data-time="145.19">[02:25.19]</span>Professor: Yes. That's exactly what directors, who were more interested in cinema as art, not <span class="underline">commerce</span>, were thinking.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7" data-time="151.41">[02:31.41]</span>But they also predicted that there would be a problem that <span class="underline">sound</span> would be misused and, boy, was it ever.<span class="time" data-times="13.37" data-time="158.41">[02:38.41]</span>Because the <span class="underline">commercial</span> types, the producers and so on, were thinking, "Okay. Now that <span class="underline">sound</span> is possible, let's talk as much as possible and forget about the fact that we're making a movie, that we have this powerful <span class="underline">visual</span> <span class="underline">medium</span>."</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.74" data-time="171.78">[02:51.78]</span>So many of the films of the twenties were basically straight adaptations of successful shows from the <span class="underline">stage</span>, theatre. <span class="time" data-times="9.56" data-time="178.52">[02:58.52]</span>The name they used for <span class="underline">sound</span> films then was "talking films" and that was on the mark, since, well, all they <span class="underline">pretty</span> much did was talk and talk.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.99" data-time="188.08">[03:08.08]</span>So, remedy? <span class="time" data-times="10.6" data-time="190.07">[03:10.07]</span>Well what was proposed by a number of filmmakers and theorists was the <span class="underline">creative</span> <span class="underline">expressive</span> use of <span class="underline">sound</span>, what they generally called nonsynchronous <span class="underline">sound</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.96" data-time="200.67">[03:20.67]</span>Okay, synchronous <span class="underline">sound</span> means basically that what we hear is what we see. <span class="time" data-times="3.19" data-time="206.63">[03:26.63]</span>Everything on the soundtrack is seen on the <span class="underline">screen</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.51" data-time="209.82">[03:29.82]</span>And everything was recorded simultaneously, which... <span class="time" data-times="6.79" data-time="215.33">[03:35.33]</span>Well, since the <span class="underline">sound</span> technicians working on films often had experience with live radio that made <span class="underline">sense</span> to them. <span class="time" data-times="3.4" data-time="222.12">[03:42.12]</span>Recording the <span class="underline">sound</span> separately and adding it in afterward? <span class="time" data-times="1.88" data-time="225.52">[03:45.52]</span>Well, that idea was less <span class="underline">obvious</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.38" data-time="227.4">[03:47.40]</span>Anyway synchronous <span class="underline">sound</span> means the <span class="underline">source</span> of the <span class="underline">sound</span> is the <span class="underline">image</span> on the <span class="underline">screen</span>.<span class="time" data-times="3.24" data-time="232.78">[03:52.78]</span>Nonsynchronous <span class="underline">sound</span> then is...</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.14" data-time="236.02">[03:56.02]</span>Abby: The <span class="underline">sound</span> doesn't <span class="underline">match</span> the picture?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.45" data-time="238.16">[03:58.16]</span>Professor: Right. Now we can look at this in various ways. <span class="time" data-times="2.92" data-time="241.61">[04:01.61]</span>But let's take it as <span class="underline">literally</span> as possible.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.01" data-time="244.53">[04:04.53]</span>Music, unless we see the radio or the <span class="underline">orchestra</span>, that's nonsynchronous. <span class="time" data-times="5.96" data-time="250.54">[04:10.54]</span>If the camera <span class="underline">shot</span> is of the listener rather than the speaker that's nonsynchronous. <span class="time" data-times="6.48" data-time="256.5">[04:16.50]</span>If we hear, say, background sounds that aren't on the <span class="underline">screen</span>, that's nonsynchronous.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.5" data-time="262.98">[04:22.98]</span>So, that doesn't <span class="underline">seem</span> so <span class="underline">radical</span>, does it? <span class="time" data-times="4.91" data-time="265.48">[04:25.48]</span>But again, those early producers didn't think their audiences could keep up with this.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.74" data-time="270.39">[04:30.39]</span>Abby: Excuse me, but did you say earlier that some filmmakers actually advocated not using <span class="underline">sound</span> at all?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.39" data-time="277.13">[04:37.13]</span>Professor: Well, yes. But that was a bit of an exaggeration, I guess. <span class="time" data-times="7.94" data-time="281.52">[04:41.52]</span>What I meant to say was that some filmmakers thought that the way the <span class="underline">film</span> <span class="underline">sound</span> was actually used was <span class="underline">setting</span> the art of filmmaking back.<span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="289.46">[04:49.46]</span>But everyone agreed that sounds solved some very difficult issues and offered potentially <span class="underline">exciting</span> tools.</p>
