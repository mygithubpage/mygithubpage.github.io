It looks exactly like the ring showed in the movie, with the words 'one ring controls them all' engraved on, and fits perfectly on his index finger. The reason why I picked it up for his birthday was that he loves this movie series so much and every time, to be honest, for real every time when we are wandering in the mall, he would visit every jewelry shop to look for the similar ring. And he even wishes to have our wedding ring engraved with the same words on. He's cute, right? So when I gave this ring to him, he started to wear it every time we went out for our date! Isn't it so special?</p></article></div></main></body></html>
