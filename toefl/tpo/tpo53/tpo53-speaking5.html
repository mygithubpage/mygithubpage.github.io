I forgot to bring it back with me after my last visit home. I have to wear a suit to the interview. It's expected.</p><p>W: What are you gonna do?</p><p>M: Well, my roommate said I could borrow his suit for the interview if I want to. It's a nice suit too.</p><p>W: But he is bigger than you. Does his suit fit?</p><p>M: I tried the trousers and suit coat on, they are kind of big on me, a little baggy. I mean, I don't look great in that suit, but I look okay I think. I could wear it.</p><p>W: But you might not make such great impression on the employer, wearing a suit that doesn't fit you very well.</p><p>M: And I do want them to hire me. It'll giveme the chance to work in a professional law office right out of college.</p><p>W: Well the stores will still be open for a couple of hours tonight, why don't you gobuy a new suit?</p><p>M: I could, it will be nice to have a new suit. Mine's pretty old.</p><p>W: So why don't you go for it?</p><p>M: Suits are expensive. And I have been saving to buy a bicycle for a long time. I am so sick of having to get everywhere on foot. I almost have enough money saved up. If I buy a suit, I'll have to wait a while to get the bike.</p></article><section id="question"><h4>Question</h4><p>Briefly summarize the man's problem. Then state which solution you would recommend. Explain the reasons for your recommendation.</p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>The man is facing a problem that he is expected to wear a suit attending tomorrow morning's interview, but unfortunately he forgot his suit at his parents' house. However, he has two solutions. He could either borrow his roommate's suit, or buy another new suit from the store. Well, if I were him, I would choose the second one. Because if he worries about the money he saved for a bike, he could borrow some from his parents or friends, and then after the interview he would have the chance taking some part-time jobs to pay the money back. Besides, he really wants to pass the interview, but his roommate's looks too baggy on him, it won't be nice.</p></article></div></main></body></html>
