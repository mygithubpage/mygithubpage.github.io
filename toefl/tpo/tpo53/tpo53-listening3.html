lecture in an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> science class.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.02" data-time="6.16">[00:06.16]</span>Professor: The Chesapeake Bay on the east <span class="highlight">coast</span> of United States is huge. <span class="time" data-times="5.07" data-time="11.18">[00:11.18]</span>The largest estuary in the U.S., and it's very important to <span class="highlight">local</span> economies.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.86" data-time="16.25">[00:16.25]</span>But like many of the world's waterways, the Chesapeake is being polluted. <span class="time" data-times="4.18" data-time="21.11">[00:21.11]</span>And efforts to stop that from happening have not been <span class="highlight">entirely</span> successful. <span class="time" data-times="6.94" data-time="25.29">[00:25.29]</span>And that's <span class="highlight">partly</span> because of the type of pollution affecting the Chesapeake which may not be what you might <span class="highlight">predict</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.6" data-time="32.23">[00:32.23]</span>Um, first let's <span class="highlight">mention</span> that the sources of pollution are of two general types. <span class="time" data-times="4.54" data-time="37.83">[00:37.83]</span>And let's begin with what's known as point <span class="highlight">source</span> pollution. <span class="time" data-times="10.82" data-time="42.37">[00:42.37]</span>Point <span class="highlight">source</span> pollution has an <span class="highlight">identifiable</span><span class="highlight">source</span> and you can find the <span class="highlight">specific</span> point where say one <span class="highlight">particular</span><span class="highlight">pipe</span> is dumping pollutants into the bay. <span class="time" data-times="3.55" data-time="53.19">[00:53.19]</span>And then treat the water right there where the pollution's coming from.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.55" data-time="56.74">[00:56.74]</span>And that's what's happened over the past thirty years or so. <span class="time" data-times="7.89" data-time="60.29">[01:00.29]</span>Modifications have been made in factories and <span class="highlight">sewage</span> treatment plants to treat polluted water before it's released into public waterways. <span class="time" data-times="5.12" data-time="68.18">[01:08.18]</span>But there's also something we call non-point <span class="highlight">source</span> pollution.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="12.38" data-time="73.3">[01:13.30]</span>Nowadays the most serious pollution threat doesn't come from any <span class="highlight">particular</span><span class="highlight">source</span> like a factory or <span class="highlight">sewage</span> treatment plant, but originates from many sources over a large area. <span class="time" data-times="7.47" data-time="85.68">[01:25.68]</span>And this non-point <span class="highlight">source</span> pollution is a <span class="highlight">challenge</span> to <span class="highlight">deal</span> with because it doesn't just enter the bay <span class="highlight">through</span> one <span class="highlight">pipe</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.29" data-time="93.15">[01:33.15]</span>You can't <span class="highlight">identify</span> precisely where it's coming from.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="12.54" data-time="96.44">[01:36.44]</span>And to be <span class="highlight">specific</span>, the biggest problem now facing the Chesapeake Bay is <span class="highlight">due</span> not to toxins but to nutrients contained in chemical fertilizers used on farms all over the <span class="highlight">region</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.2" data-time="108.98">[01:48.98]</span>These nutrients like <span class="highlight">phosphorus</span> and especially <span class="highlight">nitrogen</span> wash away what we call agricultural <span class="highlight">runoff</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.32" data-time="117.18">[01:57.18]</span>That's when water from a hard rain or from <span class="highlight">melting</span> snow carries these chemicals down to streams and into the bay.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="11.6" data-time="124.5">[02:04.50]</span>And there they <span class="highlight">stimulate</span> the <span class="highlight">explosive</span> growth of <span class="highlight">algae</span> and that uses up much of the <span class="highlight">oxygen</span> in the water, <span class="highlight">oxygen</span> that fish and other <span class="highlight">aquatic</span> organisms need to stay alive. <span class="time" data-times="14.63" data-time="136.1">[02:16.10]</span>So since there is no single place you can treat the <span class="highlight">runoff</span> before it reaches the bay, any efforts to reduce this non-point <span class="highlight">source</span> pollution generally need to be aimed at keeping pollution out of the streams in the first place.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.68" data-time="150.73">[02:30.73]</span>But before we go into that, let's look at the role of <span class="highlight">nitrogen</span><span class="highlight">fertilizer</span> in modern farming. <span class="time" data-times="6.79" data-time="157.41">[02:37.41]</span>Until about sixty years ago, before a great increase in <span class="highlight">industrialization</span>, this wasn't a problem. <span class="time" data-times="14.06" data-time="164.2">[02:44.20]</span>In the past, farmers use natural fertilizers, and rotated crops so that in <span class="highlight">addition</span> to <span class="highlight">commercial</span> food crops like corn and wheat, they might plant legumes like <span class="highlight">alfalfa</span> and clover for animal feed.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="10.6" data-time="178.26">[02:58.26]</span>But these legumes also enriched the soil by converting <span class="highlight">nitrogen</span> in the <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span> into nitrates, a form of <span class="highlight">nitrogen</span> that crops like wheat or corn could use as <span class="highlight">nutrient</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.85" data-time="188.86">[03:08.86]</span>And these and other cover crops, planted to hold the soil after the wheat or corn was harvested. <span class="time" data-times="6.01" data-time="195.71">[03:15.71]</span>They stored much of the <span class="highlight">surplus</span><span class="highlight">nitrogen</span> during the time of the year when the <span class="highlight">runoff</span> tended to be the greatest.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="10.92" data-time="201.72">[03:21.72]</span>But farming practices changed as farmers came under <span class="highlight">pressure</span> to use more and more chemical <span class="highlight">fertilizer</span> in order to increase crop production on the same <span class="highlight">amount</span> of land. <span class="time" data-times="5.9" data-time="212.64">[03:32.64]</span>But more isn't always better, at <span class="highlight">least</span> in terms of chemical <span class="highlight">fertilizer</span> in the environment. <span class="time" data-times="8.98" data-time="218.54">[03:38.54]</span>And <span class="highlight">along</span> the way, farmers <span class="highlight">switch</span> from legumes to animal feeds more suited to <span class="highlight">intensive</span> large <span class="highlight">scale</span> animal production.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="20.85" data-time="227.52">[03:47.52]</span>And the <span class="highlight">excess</span><span class="highlight">nitrogen</span> once trapped by these cover crops either washed away in the next big rain or went down into the <span class="highlight">groundwater</span> and either way <span class="highlight">eventually</span> ended up in the streams and the bay, and that as we said means more <span class="highlight">algae</span> in the water and less <span class="highlight">oxygen</span> for the fish and other <span class="highlight">aquatic</span> life to breathe.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.4" data-time="248.37">[04:08.37]</span>So what's being done? <span class="time" data-times="2.2" data-time="250.77">[04:10.77]</span>Well, two things.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.75" data-time="252.97">[04:12.97]</span>First, after the main crops are harvested, more farmers are planting cover crops again. <span class="time" data-times="8.83" data-time="258.72">[04:18.72]</span>Other kinds like <span class="highlight">rye</span> and barley that hold the <span class="highlight">nitrogen</span> and keep it from washing out of the soil during the months when that most likely to <span class="highlight">occur</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.85" data-time="267.55">[04:27.55]</span>And the <span class="highlight">second</span><span class="highlight">strategy</span> is to plant <span class="highlight">buffer</span> zones at the edges of streams. <span class="time" data-times="3.91" data-time="273.4">[04:33.40]</span>Not crops but natural areas, trees. <span class="time" data-times="6.9" data-time="277.31">[04:37.31]</span>The roots of these trees can <span class="highlight">absorb</span> the <span class="highlight">excess</span><span class="highlight">nitrogen</span> in the <span class="highlight">runoff</span> before it reaches the streams. <span class="time" data-times="6.85" data-time="284.21">[04:44.21]</span>Farmers sometimes object to letting trees grow on land where they might <span class="highlight">otherwise</span> be cultivating crops. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="291.06">[04:51.06]</span>But there's a <span class="highlight">government</span> program that compensates them, that pays them for creating these <span class="highlight">buffer</span> zones between their fields and the streams that <span class="highlight">eventually</span> feed into bays like the Chesapeake and it's beginning to show some success.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the lecture mainly about?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.
