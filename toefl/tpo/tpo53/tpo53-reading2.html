            <b>Rain Forest Soils</b>
          </h4>
          <p>On viewing the <span class="highlight">lush</span> plant growth of a <span class="highlight">tropical</span> rain forest, most people would <span class="highlight">conclude</span> that the soil <span class="highlight">beneath</span> it is rich in nutrients. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> However, although rain forest soils are highly <span class="highlight">variable</span>, they have in <span class="highlight">common</span> the fact that <span class="highlight question10">abundant</span> <span class="highlight">rainfall</span> washes <span class="highlight">mineral</span> nutrients out of them and into streams. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> This <span class="highlight">process</span> is known as leaching. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span> Because of rain leaching, most <span class="highlight">tropical</span> rain forest soils have low to very low <span class="highlight">mineral</span> <span class="highlight">nutrient</span> <span class="highlight">content</span>, in <span class="highlight">dramatic</span> <span class="highlight">contrast</span> to mineral-rich grassland soils. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span> <span class="highlight">Tropical</span> forest soils also often <span class="highlight">contain</span> <span class="highlight">particular</span> types of clays that, unlike the mineral-binding clays of <span class="highlight">temperate</span> forest soils, do not <span class="highlight">bind</span> <span class="highlight">mineral</span> ions well. <span class="highlight">Aluminum</span> is the <span class="highlight">dominant</span> cation (positively charged <span class="highlight">ion</span>) present in <span class="highlight">tropical</span> soils; but plants do not <span class="highlight">require</span> this <span class="highlight">element</span>, and it is moderately <span class="highlight">toxic</span> to a wide <span class="highlight">range</span> of plants. <span class="highlight">Aluminum</span> also reduces the <span class="highlight">availability</span> of <span class="highlight">phosphorus</span>, an <span class="highlight">element</span> in high demand by plants.</p>
          <p>High <span class="highlight">moisture</span> and temperatures speed the growth of soil microbes that <span class="highlight">decompose</span> <span class="highlight">organic</span> compounds, so <span class="highlight">tropical</span> soils typically <span class="highlight">contain</span> far <span class="highlight">lower</span> amounts of <span class="highlight">organic</span> materials (<span class="highlight">humus</span>) than do other forest or grassland soils. Because <span class="highlight">organic</span> compounds help loosen <span class="highlight">compact</span> <span class="highlight">clay</span> soils, hold water, and <span class="highlight">bind</span> <span class="highlight">mineral</span> nutrients, the <span class="highlight">relative</span> <span class="highlight">lack</span> of <span class="highlight">organic</span> materials in <span class="highlight">tropical</span> soils is deleterious to plants. Plant roots cannot <span class="highlight">penetrate</span> far into hard <span class="highlight">clay</span> soils, and during dry periods, the soil cannot hold enough water to <span class="highlight">supply</span> plant needs. Because the <span class="highlight">concentration</span> of dark-colored <span class="highlight">organic</span> materials is low in <span class="highlight">tropical</span> soils, they are often colored red or yellow by the presence of iron, aluminum: and manganese oxides; when dry, these soils become rock hard. The famous Cambodian temples of <span class="question5">Angkor Wat</span>, which have survived for many centuries, were constructed from blocks of such hard rain forest soils.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="highlight">Given</span> such poor soils, how can <span class="highlight">lush</span> <span class="highlight">tropical</span> forests exist? The answer is that the forest's minerals are held in its living biomass-the trees and other plants and the animals. In <span class="highlight">contrast</span> to grasslands, where a large <span class="highlight">proportion</span> of plant biomass is produced <span class="highlight">underground</span>, that of <span class="highlight">tropical</span> forests is nearly all aboveground. Dead leaves, branches, and other plant parts, as well as the wastes and bodies of rain forest animals, <span class="highlight">barely</span> <span class="highlight">reach</span> the forest floor before they are rapidly <span class="highlight">decayed</span> by <span class="highlight question10">abundant</span> decomposers-<span class="highlight">bacterial</span> and <span class="highlight">fungal</span>. Minerals released by <span class="highlight">decay</span> are quickly absorbed by <span class="highlight question7">multitudinous</span> <span class="highlight">shallow</span>, fine tree feeder roots and stored in plant tissues. Many <span class="highlight">tropical</span> rain forest plants (like those in other forests) have mycorrhizal (fungus-root) partners whose <span class="highlight">delicate</span> hyphae <span class="highlight">spread</span> <span class="highlight">through</span> great volumes of soil, from which they <span class="highlight">release</span> and <span class="highlight">absorb</span> minerals and ferry them back to the <span class="highlight">host</span> plant in <span class="highlight">exchange</span> for needed <span class="highlight">organic</span> compounds. The <span class="highlight">fungal</span> hyphae are able to <span class="highlight">absorb</span> <span class="highlight">phosphorus</span> that plant roots could not themselves <span class="highlight">obtain</span> from the very <span class="highlight">dilute</span> soil solutions, and <span class="highlight">fungal</span> hyphae can <span class="highlight">transfer</span> <span class="highlight">mineral</span> nutrients from one forest plant to another. <span class="highlight question8">Consequently</span>, <span class="highlight">tropical</span> rain forests typically have what are known as closed <span class="highlight">nutrient</span> systems, in which minerals are handed off from one <span class="highlight">organism</span> to another with little leaking <span class="highlight">through</span> to the soil. When <span class="highlight">mineral</span> nutrients do not spend much time in the soil, they cannot be leached into streams. Closed <span class="highlight">nutrient</span> systems have evolved in <span class="highlight">response</span> to the leaching effects of heavy <span class="highlight">tropical</span> <span class="highlight">rainfall</span>. <span class="highlight">Evidence</span> for this conclusion is that <span class="highlight">nutrient</span> systems are more open in the richest <span class="highlight">tropical</span> soils and tightest in the poorest soils.</p>
          <p>The growth of organisms is dependent on the <span class="highlight">availability</span> of nutrients, none of which is more important than <span class="highlight">nitrogen</span>. Although there is an <span class="highlight question10">abundant</span> <span class="highlight">supply</span> of <span class="highlight">nitrogen</span> in Earth's <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span>, it cannot be absorbed by plants unless it is "fixed," or combined chemically with other elements to form <span class="highlight">nitrogen</span> compounds. Nitrogen-fixing <span class="highlight">bacteria</span> help <span class="highlight">tropical</span> rain forest plants cope with the poor soils there by supplying them with needed <span class="highlight">nitrogen</span>. Many <span class="highlight">species</span> of <span class="highlight">tropical</span> rain forest trees belong to the <span class="highlight">legume</span> family, which is known for associations of nitrogen-fixing <span class="highlight">bacteria</span> <span class="highlight">within</span> <span class="highlight">root</span> nodules. Also, cycads (a type of <span class="highlight">tropical</span> plant that resembles a palm tree) produce <span class="highlight">special</span> aboveground roots that <span class="highlight">harbor</span> nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria. By growing above the ground, the roots are <span class="highlight">exposed</span> to sunlight, which the cyanobacteria <span class="highlight">require</span> for growth. <span class="highlight">Nitrogen</span> fixation by free-living <span class="highlight">bacteria</span> in <span class="highlight">tropical</span> soils is also <span class="highlight">beneficial</span>.</p>
