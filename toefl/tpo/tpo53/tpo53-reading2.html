            <p>
              <span id="arrow">
              </span>On viewing the <span class="underline">lush</span> plant growth of a <span class="underline">tropical</span> rain forest, most people would <span class="underline">conclude</span> that the soil <span class="underline">beneath</span> it is rich in nutrients. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> However, although rain forest soils are highly <span class="underline">variable</span>, they have in <span class="underline">common</span> the fact that <span class="underline">abundant</span><span class="underline">rainfall</span> washes <span class="underline">mineral</span> nutrients out of them and into streams. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> This <span class="underline">process</span> is known as leaching. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span> Because of rain leaching, most <span class="underline">tropical</span> rain forest soils have low to very low <span class="underline">mineral</span><span class="underline">nutrient</span><span class="underline">content</span>, in <span class="underline">dramatic</span><span class="underline">contrast</span> to mineral-rich grassland soils. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span><span class="underline">Tropical</span> forest soils also often <span class="underline">contain</span><span class="underline">particular</span> types of clays that, unlike the mineral-binding clays of <span class="underline">temperate</span> forest soils, do not <span class="underline">bind</span><span class="underline">mineral</span> ions well. <span class="underline">Aluminum</span> is the <span class="underline">dominant</span> cation (positively charged <span class="underline">ion</span>) present in <span class="underline">tropical</span> soils; but plants do not <span class="underline">require</span> this <span class="underline">element</span>, and it is moderately <span class="underline">toxic</span> to a wide <span class="underline">range</span> of plants. <span class="underline">Aluminum</span> also reduces the <span class="underline">availability</span> of <span class="underline">phosphorus</span>, an <span class="underline">element</span> in high demand by plants.</p>
            <p>High <span class="underline">moisture</span> and temperatures speed the growth of soil microbes that <span class="underline">decompose</span><span class="underline">organic</span> compounds, so <span class="underline">tropical</span> soils typically <span class="underline">contain</span> far <span class="underline">lower</span> amounts of <span class="underline">organic</span> materials (<span class="underline">humus</span>) than do other forest or grassland soils. Because <span class="underline">organic</span> compounds help loosen <span class="underline">compact</span><span class="underline">clay</span> soils, hold water, and <span class="underline">bind</span><span class="underline">mineral</span> nutrients, the <span class="underline">relative</span><span class="underline">lack</span> of <span class="underline">organic</span> materials in <span class="underline">tropical</span> soils is deleterious to plants. Plant roots cannot <span class="underline">penetrate</span> far into hard <span class="underline">clay</span> soils, and during dry periods, the soil cannot hold enough water to <span class="underline">supply</span> plant needs. Because the <span class="underline">concentration</span> of dark-colored <span class="underline">organic</span> materials is low in <span class="underline">tropical</span> soils, they are often colored red or yellow by the presence of iron, aluminum: and manganese oxides; when dry, these soils become rock hard. The famous Cambodian temples of Angkor Wat, which have survived for many centuries, were constructed from blocks of such hard rain forest soils.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="underline">Given</span> such poor soils, how can <span class="underline">lush</span><span class="underline">tropical</span> forests exist? The answer is that the forest's minerals are held in its living biomass-the trees and other plants and the animals. In <span class="underline">contrast</span> to grasslands, where a large <span class="underline">proportion</span> of plant biomass is produced <span class="underline">underground</span>, that of <span class="underline">tropical</span> forests is nearly all aboveground. Dead leaves, branches, and other plant parts, as well as the wastes and bodies of rain forest animals, <span class="underline">barely</span><span class="underline">reach</span> the forest floor before they are rapidly <span class="underline">decayed</span> by <span class="underline">abundant</span> decomposers-<span class="underline">bacterial</span> and <span class="underline">fungal</span>. Minerals released by <span class="underline">decay</span> are quickly absorbed by <span class="underline">multitudinous</span><span class="underline">shallow</span>, fine tree feeder roots and stored in plant tissues. Many <span class="underline">tropical</span> rain forest plants (like those in other forests) have mycorrhizal (fungus-root) partners whose <span class="underline">delicate</span> hyphae <span class="underline">spread</span><span class="underline">through</span> great volumes of soil, from which they <span class="underline">release</span> and <span class="underline">absorb</span> minerals and ferry them back to the <span class="underline">host</span> plant in <span class="underline">exchange</span> for needed <span class="underline">organic</span> compounds. The <span class="underline">fungal</span> hyphae are able to <span class="underline">absorb</span><span class="underline">phosphorus</span> that plant roots could not themselves <span class="underline">obtain</span> from the very <span class="underline">dilute</span> soil solutions, and <span class="underline">fungal</span> hyphae can <span class="underline">transfer</span><span class="underline">mineral</span> nutrients from one forest plant to another. <span class="underline">Consequently</span>, <span class="underline">tropical</span> rain forests typically have what are known as closed <span class="underline">nutrient</span> systems, in which minerals are handed off from one <span class="underline">organism</span> to another with little leaking <span class="underline">through</span> to the soil. When <span class="underline">mineral</span> nutrients do not spend much time in the soil, they cannot be leached into streams. Closed <span class="underline">nutrient</span> systems have evolved in <span class="underline">response</span> to the leaching effects of heavy <span class="underline">tropical</span><span class="underline">rainfall</span>. <span class="underline">Evidence</span> for this conclusion is that <span class="underline">nutrient</span> systems are more open in the richest <span class="underline">tropical</span> soils and tightest in the poorest soils.</p>
            <p>The growth of organisms is dependent on the <span class="underline">availability</span> of nutrients, none of which is more important than <span class="underline">nitrogen</span>. Although there is an <span class="underline">abundant</span><span class="underline">supply</span> of <span class="underline">nitrogen</span> in Earth's <span class="underline">atmosphere</span>, it cannot be absorbed by plants unless it is "fixed," or combined chemically with other elements to form <span class="underline">nitrogen</span> compounds. Nitrogen-fixing <span class="underline">bacteria</span> help <span class="underline">tropical</span> rain forest plants cope with the poor soils there by supplying them with needed <span class="underline">nitrogen</span>. Many <span class="underline">species</span> of <span class="underline">tropical</span> rain forest trees belong to the <span class="underline">legume</span> family, which is known for associations of nitrogen-fixing <span class="underline">bacteria</span><span class="underline">within</span><span class="underline">root</span> nodules. Also, cycads (a type of <span class="underline">tropical</span> plant that resembles a palm tree) produce <span class="underline">special</span> aboveground roots that <span class="underline">harbor</span> nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria. By growing above the ground, the roots are <span class="underline">exposed</span> to sunlight, which the cyanobacteria <span class="underline">require</span> for growth. <span class="underline">Nitrogen</span> fixation by free-living <span class="underline">bacteria</span> in <span class="underline">tropical</span> soils is also <span class="underline">beneficial</span>.</p>
