        <h3>Listening Text</h3>
        <article>
          <p>Listen to a conversation between a student and a cafeteria manager.</p>
          <p>:Manager: Oh, hi, you're Amy, right?</p>
          <p>:Student: Yes.</p>
          <p>:Manager: I haven't seen you here for a while. Welcome back.</p>
          <p>:Student: Thanks. Uh, you're right. I haven't been eating here regularly like I used to.</p>
          <p>:Manager: Why not?</p>
          <p>:Student: A couple of reasons. First of all, I have a class that ends during lunch time. So by the time I get here, there's hardly any food left.</p>
          <p>:Manager: Really?</p>
          <p>:Student: Yeah. And then I have a chemistry lab at night this semester. It's 2 hours every Tuesday and Thursday. You know that building is way across campus. So I just eat something in my dorm before I leave or skip dinner altogether. I come here afterward, but lab lets out at 7:30 and...By then the cafeteria is already closed.</p>
          <p>:Manager: Oh, I'm really sorry. Well, what about getting something to go and eating it in class?</p>
          <p>:Student: I can’t. Food isn't permitted anywhere near the laboratories. I wish you stayed open later.</p>
          <p>:Manager: Have you complained formally? We've always had a suggestion box. And now, you can send us an e-mail.</p>
          <p>:Student: As a matter of fact, I did fill out a suggestion card. I asked for longer hours and for better food choices, too. But that was like weeks ago. And nothing’s changed from what I can see.</p>
          <p>:Manager: You know, I was just promoted to cafeteria manager, and one of the things I'm trying to do is pay more attention to students' concerns. There have been a lot of complaints similar to yours over the years.</p>
          <p>:Student: Yeah. A lot of my friends complain about the cafeteria, but I figure nothing will ever be done.</p>
          <p>:Manager: Well, some things can change. For instance, you mentioned you like better food choices. Is there anything in particular you like added to the menu?</p>
          <p>:Student: Hmm, I guess it'd be nice to get hot cereal in the morning, and maybe a wider choice of soups and salads at lunch and dinner. And there should definitely be enough food to feed everyone whenever the cafeteria is open.</p>
          <p>:Manager: Hmm hmm. ... But all good suggestions. Say, were you aware that the university has recently formed a food advisory committee? It includes myself, a nutritionist, the school chef, a food science professor and the person who oversees the cafeteria budget.</p>
          <p>:Student: Do you want me to talk to the committee?</p>
          <p>:Manager: I was thinking you might like to serve on the committee. If you are interested, I'll recommend you as the student representative.</p>
          <p>:Student: Oh, I'm not so sure if I have enough spare time to get that involved.</p>
          <p>:Manager: Ok, then why don't I let you know when and where our next meeting is? And we will put you on the agenda. You may also want to send me an e-mail with all of your suggestions. Now that I am in charge, I will make sure they get serious consideration.</p>
          <p>:Student: I’d appreciate that. Thanks.</p>
