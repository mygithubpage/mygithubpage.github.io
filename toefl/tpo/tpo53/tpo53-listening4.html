              <p>Student: A couple of reasons. First of all, I have a class thats during lunch times. So by the time I get here, there's hardly any food left.</p>
              <p>The original idea here is that the students here are complaining that the opening hours of the restaurant are too short, and wait until the next evening. The restaurant is closed.</p>

              <p>Option A means that she does not like the food in the restaurant, Option B means she eats in the dorm with her friends, Option C means the conflict between her class time and restaurant opening hours, and Option D means the restaurant and her dormitory.

              <p>The general idea of the original text here is that the girls proposed several kinds of food that they liked but did not have in the restaurant, and said that the restaurant should be opened for a longer period of time.</p>

              <p>This question is targeted to the original: Manager: You know, I was just promoted to cafeteria manager, and one of the things I'm trying to do is pay more attention to students' concerns. There have been a lot of complaints similar to yours over the Years.</p>
              <p>The general idea of the original text here is that the manager indicates that he is newly appointed but will pay attention to the students' complaints about the restaurant.</p>
              <p>The question asked why the manager said these things.</p>
              <p>Option A means that the suggestion box has been set up recently. Option B means that the previous manager was not responsible for the student's complaint. Option C means that the restaurant's policy is unlikely to change in the future. Option D means The manager plans to increase the salaries of restaurant employees. Option B follows the original meaning. The other three options do not meet.</p>
