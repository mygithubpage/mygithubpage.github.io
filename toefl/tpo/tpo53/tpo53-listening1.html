            <span class="time" data-times="5.54" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Listen to a <span class="highlight">conversation</span> between a student and his drama professor.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.66" data-time="5.54">[00:05.54]</span>Professor: Hi Robert. So how's your paper going?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.86" data-time="9.2">[00:09.20]</span>Robert: <span class="highlight">Pretty</span> well. It's a lot of work, but I'm getting into it, so I don't <span class="highlight">mind</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.93" data-time="13.06">[00:13.06]</span>I'll probably have some questions for you in the next week or so.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.66" data-time="15.99">[00:15.99]</span>Professor: Okay. Glad to hear you're progressing so well.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.69" data-time="18.65">[00:18.65]</span>Robert: Um... There was something you said at the end of the lecture on Tuesday, something about there not really being any <span class="highlight">original</span> plays.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.55" data-time="25.34">[00:25.34]</span>Professor: There's no such thing as an <span class="highlight">original</span> play. <span class="time" data-times="2.77" data-time="28.89">[00:28.89]</span>Yes. That's the direct <span class="highlight">quote</span> from Charles Mee.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.72" data-time="31.66">[00:31.66]</span>Robert: Mee... that's with two "e"s, right?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.6" data-time="34.38">[00:34.38]</span>Professor: Yep. M-E-E. You'll probably be hearing a lot about him. <span class="time" data-times="1.93" data-time="37.98">[00:37.98]</span>He's becoming a <span class="highlight">pretty</span> famous <span class="highlight">playwright</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.41" data-time="39.91">[00:39.91]</span>Robert: Yeah,well, I've been thinking about his <span class="highlight">quote</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.92" data-time="42.32">[00:42.32]</span>I mean there must be some <span class="highlight">original</span> plays out there.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.45" data-time="45.24">[00:45.24]</span>Professor: I'll <span class="highlight">grant</span> that he's overstating things <span class="highlight">somewhat</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.03" data-time="48.69">[00:48.69]</span>But the theater does have a long tradition of borrowing. <span class="time" data-times="5.85" data-time="52.72">[00:52.72]</span>Take Shakespeare. Like most writers of his day, he borrowed plots from other sources unabashedly. <span class="time" data-times="5.8" data-time="58.57">[00:58.57]</span>And the <span class="highlight">ancient</span> Greeks, all the plays they wrote were based on earlier plays, poems and myths.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.44" data-time="64.37">[01:04.37]</span>Robert: And borrowing applies to plays being written nowadays, too?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.73" data-time="67.81">[01:07.81]</span>Professor: To some <span class="highlight">extent</span>, yes. <span class="time" data-times="5.8" data-time="69.54">[01:09.54]</span>Mee, for example, he's made a <span class="highlight">career</span> out of remaking plays, one of which we'll be studying soon. <span class="time" data-times="5.07" data-time="75.34">[01:15.34]</span>It's called Full Circle and Mee based it on an earlier play by a German <span class="highlight">playwright</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.43" data-time="80.41">[01:20.41]</span>Robert: Oh Full Circle... Wasn't that based on the Caucasian Chalk Circle?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="0.79" data-time="84.84">[01:24.84]</span>Professor: That's right.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.03" data-time="85.63">[01:25.63]</span>Robert: I remember hearing about that play from my <span class="highlight">acting</span> coach.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="18.68" data-time="88.66">[01:28.66]</span>Professor: Okay. Well, the Caucasian Chalk Circle was based on a play by yet another German <span class="highlight">playwright</span>, someone who was fascinated by the <span class="highlight">ancient</span> literatures of China, India and <span class="highlight">Persia</span>, and many of his works were adapted from those literatures, including his <span class="highlight">version</span> of the Chalk Circle which was based on an early Chinese play.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.37" data-time="107.34">[01:47.34]</span>Robert: So this Full Circle play, by Charles Mee, the one we're going to study, it's like the third or fourth remake. <span class="time" data-times="4.55" data-time="113.71">[01:53.71]</span>Wow... And we <span class="highlight">complain</span> that Hollywood keeps making the same movies over and over again.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.87" data-time="118.26">[01:58.26]</span>Professor: Well, part of what Mee's trying to do is <span class="highlight">drive</span> home the point that: One, theater's always a collaborative effort.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.78" data-time="125.13">[02:05.13]</span>Robert: Well, yeah, the <span class="highlight">playwright</span>, the <span class="highlight">director</span>, the actors, people have to work together to produce a play.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.03" data-time="129.91">[02:09.91]</span>Professor: Yes, of <span class="highlight">course</span>. But Mee means historically. <span class="time" data-times="5.38" data-time="132.94">[02:12.94]</span>The <span class="highlight">dramatic</span> <span class="highlight">literature</span> of early periods is hugely <span class="highlight">influential</span> in shaping later <span class="highlight">dramatic</span> works.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.23" data-time="138.32">[02:18.32]</span>Robert: So it's like when the <span class="highlight">playwright</span> bases a play on a <span class="highlight">previous</span> <span class="highlight">playwright</span>'s theme or message.<span class="time" data-times="2.82" data-time="142.55">[02:22.55]</span>It's like they're talking to each other, collaborating. <span class="time" data-times="1.99" data-time="145.37">[02:25.37]</span>Uh, just not at the same time right?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="11.96" data-time="147.36">[02:27.36]</span>Professor: Exactly. And the <span class="highlight">second</span> point Mee's trying to make, I think, is that it's <span class="highlight">legitimate</span> to retell an old story in a new way, in a way that's, uh... more in <span class="highlight">line</span> with <span class="highlight">contemporary</span> concerns. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="159.32">[02:39.32]</span>So when playwrights reinvent or update an earlier play, it shouldn't be construed as a <span class="highlight">lack</span> of imagination or an <span class="highlight">artistic</span> failure.</p>
