            <b>Evidence of the Earliest Writing</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span class="question1">Although <span class="highlight">literacy</span> appeared independently in several parts of the <span class="highlight">prehistoric</span> world, the earliest <span class="highlight">evidence</span> of writing is the <span class="highlight">cuneiform</span> <span class="highlight">Sumerian</span> <span class="highlight">script</span> on the <span class="highlight">clay</span> tablets of <span class="highlight">ancient</span> <span class="highlight">Mesopotamia</span>, which, <span class="highlight">archaeological</span> <span class="highlight">detective</span> work has revealed, had its origins in the <span class="highlight">accounting</span> practices of <span class="highlight">commercial</span> <span class="highlight">activity</span>.</span> Researchers demonstrated that preliterate people, to keep <span class="highlight">track</span> of the goods they produced and exchanged, created a system of <span class="highlight">accounting</span> using <span class="highlight">clay</span> tokens as <span class="highlight">symbolic</span> representations of their products. Over many thousands of years, the symbols evolved <span class="highlight">through</span> several stages of abstraction until they became wedge- shaped (<span class="highlight">cuneiform</span>) signs on <span class="highlight">clay</span> tablets, recognizable as writing.</p>
          <p>The <span class="highlight">original</span> tokens (circa 8500 B.C.E.) were three-dimensional <span class="highlight">solid</span> shapes-tiny spheres, cones, disks, and cylinders. A <span class="highlight">debt</span> of six units of <span class="highlight">grain</span> and eight head of <span class="highlight">livestock</span>, for example might have been represented by six conical and eight cylindrical tokens. To keep batches of tokens together, an <span class="highlight">innovation</span> was introduced (circa 3250 B. C. E.) <span class="highlight">whereby</span> they were sealed inside <span class="highlight">clay</span> envelopes that could be broken open and counted when it came time for a <span class="highlight">debt</span> to be repaid. But because the contents of the envelopes could easily be forgotten, two-dimensional representations of the three-dimensional tokens were impressed into the surface of the envelopes before they were sealed. <span class="highlight">Eventually</span>, having two sets of <span class="highlight">equivalent</span> symbols-the <span class="highlight">internal</span> tokens and <span class="highlight">external</span> markings-came to <span class="highlight">seem</span> <span class="highlight">redundant</span>, so the tokens were eliminated (circa 3250-3100 B.C.E.), and only <span class="highlight">solid</span> <span class="highlight">clay</span> tablets with two-dimensional symbols were retained. Over time, the symbols became more <span class="highlight">numerous</span>, <span class="highlight">varied</span>, and <span class="highlight">abstract</span> and came to <span class="highlight">represent</span> more than <span class="highlight">trade</span> commodities, evolving <span class="highlight">eventually</span> into <span class="highlight">cuneiform</span> writing.</p>
          <p>The <span class="highlight">evolution</span> of the symbolism is reflected in the <span class="highlight">archaeological</span> <span class="highlight">record</span> first of all by the increasing <span class="highlight">complexity</span> of the tokens themselves. The earliest tokens, dating from about 10,000 to 6,000 years ago, were of only the simplest geometric shapes. But about 3500 B.C.E., more <span class="highlight">complex</span> tokens came into <span class="highlight">common</span> usage, including many naturalistic forms shaped like miniature tools, furniture, fruit, and humans. The earlier, <span class="highlight">plain</span> tokens were counters for agricultural products, whereas the <span class="highlight">complex</span> ones stood for finished products, such as bread, oil, <span class="highlight">perfume</span>, wool, and rope, and for items produced in workshops, such as metal, bracelets, types of cloth, garments, mats, pieces of furniture, tools, and a <span class="highlight">variety</span> of stone and <span class="highlight">pottery</span> vessels. The signs <span class="highlight">marked</span> on <span class="highlight">clay</span> tablets <span class="highlight question6">likewise</span> evolved from simple wedges, circles, ovals, and triangles based on the <span class="highlight">plain</span> tokens to pictographs derived from the <span class="highlight">complex</span> tokens.</p>
          <p>Before this <span class="highlight">evidence</span> came to light, the inventors of writing were assumed by researchers to have been an <span class="highlight">intellectual</span> elite. <span class="question7">Some</span>, for example, hypothesized that writing emerged when members of the <span class="highlight">priestly</span> caste agreed among themselves on written signs. But the <span class="highlight">association</span> of the <span class="highlight">plain</span> tokens with the first farmers and of the <span class="highlight">complex</span> tokens with the first artisans-and the fact that the token-and-envelope <span class="highlight">accounting</span> system <span class="highlight question9">invariably</span> represented only small-scale transactions-testifies to the <span class="highlight">relatively</span> <span class="highlight">modest</span> social <span class="highlight">status</span> of the creators of writing.</p>
          <p>And not only of <span class="highlight">literacy</span>, but numeracy (the representation of quantitative concepts) as well. The <span class="highlight">evidence</span> of the tokens provides further confirmation that <span class="highlight">mathematics</span> originated in people's <span class="highlight">desire</span> to keep records of flocks and other goods. Another immensely <span class="highlight">significant</span> step occurred around 3100 B.C.E., when <span class="highlight">Sumerian</span> accountants extended the token-based signs to include the first real numerals. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> <span class="highlight">Previously</span>, units of <span class="highlight">grain</span> had been represented by direct one-to-one <span class="highlight">correspondence</span>?by repeating the <span class="highlight">token</span> or <span class="highlight">symbol</span> for a unit of <span class="highlight">grain</span> the required number of times. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>The accountants, however, devised numeral signs <span class="highlight">distinct</span> from <span class="highlight">commodity</span> signs, so that eighteen units of <span class="highlight">grain</span> could be indicated by preceding a single <span class="highlight">grain</span> <span class="highlight">symbol</span> with a <span class="highlight">symbol</span> denoting "18." <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span> Their invention of <span class="highlight">abstract</span> numerals and <span class="highlight">abstract</span> counting was one of the most <span class="highlight">revolutionary</span> advances in the <span class="highlight">history</span> of <span class="highlight">mathematics</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p>
          <p>What was the social <span class="highlight">status</span> of the anonymous accountants who produced this <span class="highlight">breakthrough</span>? The <span class="highlight">immense</span> <span class="highlight">volume</span> of <span class="highlight">clay</span> tablets <span class="question11">unearthed</span> in the ruins of the <span class="highlight">Sumerian</span> temples where the accounts were kept suggests a social <span class="highlight">differentiation</span> <span class="highlight">within</span> the scribal class, with a virtual army of lower-ranking tabulators performing the <span class="highlight">monotonous</span> job of tallying commodities. We can only <span class="highlight">speculate</span> as to how high or low the inventors of true numerals were in the scribal <span class="highlight">hierarchy</span>, but it stands to <span class="highlight">reason</span> that this laborsaving <span class="highlight">innovation</span> would have been the <span class="question12">brainchild</span> of the lower-ranking types whose drudgery it eased.</p>
