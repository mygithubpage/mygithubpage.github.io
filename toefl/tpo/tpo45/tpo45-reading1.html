          <h4 class="w3-center">Microscopes The Beringia Landscape</h4>
          <p>During the <span class="highlight">peak</span> of the last ice age, northeast Asia (Siberia) and Alaska were connected by a <span class="highlight">broad</span> land <span class="highlight">mass</span> called the Bering Land Bridge. This land bridge existed because so much of Earth's water was frozen in the great ice sheets that sea levels were over 100 meters <span class="highlight">lower</span> than they are today. Between 25,000 and 10,000 years ago, Siberia, the Bering Land Bridge, and Alaska shared many <span class="highlight">environmental</span> characteristics. These included a <span class="highlight">common</span> <span class="highlight">mammalian</span> <span class="highlight">fauna</span> of large mammals, a <span class="highlight">common</span> <span class="highlight">flora</span> composed of <span class="highlight">broad</span> grasslands as well as wind-swept dunes and <span class="highlight">tundra</span>, and a <span class="highlight">common</span> <span class="highlight">climate</span> with cold, dry winters and <span class="highlight">somewhat</span> warmer summers. The <span class="highlight">recognition</span> that many aspects of the modern <span class="highlight">flora</span> and <span class="highlight">fauna</span> were present on both sides of the Bering Sea as <span class="highlight question1">remnants</span> of the ice-age <span class="highlight">landscape</span> led to this <span class="highlight">region</span> being named Beringia.</p>
          <p>It is <span class="highlight">through</span> Beringia that small groups of large <span class="highlight">mammal</span> hunters, slowly expanding their hunting territories, <span class="highlight">eventually</span> colonized North and South America. On this archaeologists generally agree, but that is where the agreement stops. One <span class="highlight">broad</span> area of disagreement in explaining the peopling of the Americas is the <span class="highlight"><span class="question2">domain</span></span> of paleoecologists, but it is <span class="highlight">critical</span> to understanding human history: what was Beringia like?</p>
          <p>The Beringian <span class="highlight">landscape</span> was very different from what it is today. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> <span class="highlight">Broad</span>, <span class="highlight">windswept</span> valleys; <span class="highlight">glaciated</span> mountains; <span class="highlight">sparse</span> <span class="highlight">vegetation</span>; and less <span class="highlight">moisture</span> created a rather forbidding land <span class="highlight">mass</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>This land <span class="highlight">mass</span> supported herds of now-extinct <span class="highlight">species</span> of <span class="highlight">mammoth</span>, bison, and horse and <span class="highlight">somewhat</span> modern versions of <span class="highlight">caribou</span>, musk <span class="highlight">ox</span>, elk, and saiga <span class="highlight">antelope</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>These grazers supported in turn a number of <span class="highlight">impressive</span> carnivores, including the <span class="highlight">giant</span> short-faced <span class="highlight">bear</span>, the saber-tooth cat, and a large <span class="highlight">species</span> of lion. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p>
          <p><span class="question6">The presence of <span class="highlight">mammal</span> <span class="highlight">species</span> that <span class="highlight">require</span> grassland <span class="highlight">vegetation</span> has led <span class="highlight">Arctic</span> biologist Dale Guthrie to <span class="highlight">argue</span> that while cold and dry, there must have been <span class="highlight">broad</span> areas of <span class="highlight">dense</span> <span class="highlight">vegetation</span> to support herds of <span class="highlight">mammoth</span>, horse, and bison.</span> Further, nearly all of the ice-age <span class="highlight">fauna</span> had teeth that <span class="highlight">indicate</span> an <span class="highlight">adaptation</span> to grasses and sedges; they could not have been supported by a modern <span class="highlight">flora</span> of mosses and lichens. Guthrie has also demonstrated that the <span class="highlight">landscape</span> must have been <span class="highlight">subject</span> to <span class="highlight">intense</span> and <span class="highlight"><span class="question5">continuous</span></span> winds, especially in winter. He makes this <span class="highlight">argument</span> based on the <span class="highlight">anatomy</span> of horse and bison, which do not have the <span class="highlight">ability</span> to search for food <span class="highlight">through</span> deep snow cover. They need landscapes with strong winds that remove the winter snows, exposing the dry grasses <span class="highlight">beneath</span>. Guthrie applied the <span class="highlight">term</span> " <span class="highlight">mammoth</span> steppe" to <span class="highlight">characterize</span> this <span class="highlight">landscape</span>.</p>
          <p>In <span class="highlight">contrast</span>, Paul Colinvaux has offered a counterargument based on the <span class="highlight">analysis</span> of <span class="highlight">pollen</span> in lake sediments dating to the last ice age. He found that the <span class="highlight">amount</span> of <span class="highlight">pollen</span> recovered in these sediments is so low that the Beringian <span class="highlight">landscape</span> during the <span class="highlight">peak</span> of the last <span class="highlight">glaciation</span> was more likely to have been what he termed a "<span class="highlight">polar</span> <span class="highlight">desert</span>," with little or only <span class="highlight">sparse</span> <span class="highlight">vegetation</span>, in no way was it possible that this <span class="highlight">region</span> could have supported large herds of mammals and thus, human hunters. Guthrie has argued against this view by pointing out that <span class="highlight">radiocarbon</span> <span class="highlight">analysis</span> of <span class="highlight">mammoth</span>, horse, and bison bones from Beringian deposits revealed that the bones <span class="highlight">date</span> to the period of most <span class="highlight">intense</span> <span class="highlight">glaciation</span>.</p>
          <p>The <span class="highlight">argument</span> seemed to be at a standstill until a number of recent studies resulted in a <span class="highlight">spectacular</span> suite of new finds. The first was the discovery of a 1,000-square-kilometer preserved <span class="highlight">patch</span> of Beringian <span class="highlight">vegetation</span> dating to just over 17,000 years ago-the <span class="highlight">peak</span> of the last ice age. The plants were preserved under a thick ash fall from a <span class="highlight">volcanic</span> <span class="highlight">eruption</span>. Investigations of the plants found grasses, sedges, mosses, and many other varieties in a nearly <span class="highlight">continuous</span> cover, as was predicted by Guthrie. But this <span class="highlight">vegetation</span> had a thin <span class="highlight">root</span> <span class="highlight">mat</span> with no soil <span class="highlight">formation</span>, demonstrating that there was little long-term <span class="highlight">stability</span> in plant cover, a finding supporting some of the arguments of Colinvaux. A mixture of <span class="highlight">continuous</span> but thin <span class="highlight">vegetation</span> supporting herds of large mammals is one that seems <span class="highlight"><span class="question11">plausible</span></span> and <span class="highlight">realistic</span> with the <span class="highlight">available</span> <span class="highlight">data</span>.</p>
