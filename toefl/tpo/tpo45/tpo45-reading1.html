This land bridge existed because so much of Earth's water was frozen in the great ice sheets that sea levels were over 100 meters <span class="highlight">lower</span> than they are today. Between 25,000 and 10,000 years ago, Siberia, the Bering Land Bridge, and Alaska shared many <span class="highlight">environmental</span> characteristics. These included a <span class="highlight">common</span><span class="highlight">mammalian</span><span class="highlight">fauna</span> of large mammals, a <span class="highlight">common</span><span class="highlight">flora</span> composed of <span class="highlight">broad</span> grasslands as well as wind-swept dunes and <span class="highlight">tundra</span>, and a <span class="highlight">common</span><span class="highlight">climate</span> with cold, dry winters and <span class="highlight">somewhat</span> warmer summers. The <span class="highlight">recognition</span> that many aspects of the modern <span class="highlight">flora</span> and <span class="highlight">fauna</span> were present on both sides of the Bering Sea as <span class="highlight question1">remnants</span> of the ice-age <span class="highlight">landscape</span> led to this <span class="highlight">region</span> being named Beringia.</p><p>It is <span class="highlight">through</span> Beringia that small groups of large <span class="highlight">mammal</span> hunters, slowly expanding their hunting territories, <span class="highlight">eventually</span> colonized North and South America. On this archaeologists generally agree, but that is where the agreement stops. One <span class="highlight">broad</span> area of disagreement in explaining the peopling of the Americas is the <span class="highlight"><span class="question2">domain</span></span> of paleoecologists, but it is <span class="highlight">critical</span> to understanding human history: what was Beringia like?</p><p>The Beringian <span class="highlight">landscape</span> was very different from what it is today. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span><span class="highlight">Broad</span>, <span class="highlight">windswept</span> valleys; <span class="highlight">glaciated</span> mountains; <span class="highlight">sparse</span><span class="highlight">vegetation</span>; and less <span class="highlight">moisture</span> created a rather forbidding land <span class="highlight">mass</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>This land <span class="highlight">mass</span> supported herds of now-extinct <span class="highlight">species</span> of <span class="highlight">mammoth</span>, bison, and horse and <span class="highlight">somewhat</span> modern versions of <span class="highlight">caribou</span>, musk <span class="highlight">ox</span>, elk, and saiga <span class="highlight">antelope</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>These grazers supported in turn a number of <span class="highlight">impressive</span> carnivores, including the <span class="highlight">giant</span> short-faced <span class="highlight">bear</span>, the saber-tooth cat, and a large <span class="highlight">species</span> of lion. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p><p><span class="question6">The presence of <span class="highlight">mammal</span><span class="highlight">species</span> that <span class="highlight">require</span> grassland <span class="highlight">vegetation</span> has led <span class="highlight">Arctic</span> biologist Dale Guthrie to <span class="highlight">argue</span> that while cold and dry, there must have been <span class="highlight">broad</span> areas of <span class="highlight">dense</span><span class="highlight">vegetation</span> to support herds of <span class="highlight">mammoth</span>, horse, and bison.</span> Further, nearly all of the ice-age <span class="highlight">fauna</span> had teeth that <span class="highlight">indicate</span> an <span class="highlight">adaptation</span> to grasses and sedges; they could not have been supported by a modern <span class="highlight">flora</span> of mosses and lichens. Guthrie has also demonstrated that the <span class="highlight">landscape</span> must have been <span class="highlight">subject</span> to <span class="highlight">intense</span> and <span class="highlight"><span class="question5">continuous</span></span> winds, especially in winter. He makes this <span class="highlight">argument</span> based on the <span class="highlight">anatomy</span> of horse and bison, which do not have the <span class="highlight">ability</span> to search for food <span class="highlight">through</span> deep snow cover. They need landscapes with strong winds that remove the winter snows, exposing the dry grasses <span class="highlight">beneath</span>. Guthrie applied the <span class="highlight">term</span> " <span class="highlight">mammoth</span> steppe" to <span class="highlight">characterize</span> this <span class="highlight">landscape</span>.</p><p>In <span class="highlight">contrast</span>, Paul Colinvaux has offered a counterargument based on the <span class="highlight">analysis</span> of <span class="highlight">pollen</span> in lake sediments dating to the last ice age. He found that the <span class="highlight">amount</span> of <span class="highlight">pollen</span> recovered in these sediments is so low that the Beringian <span class="highlight">landscape</span> during the <span class="highlight">peak</span> of the last <span class="highlight">glaciation</span> was more likely to have been what he termed a "<span class="highlight">polar</span><span class="highlight">desert</span>," with little or only <span class="highlight">sparse</span><span class="highlight">vegetation</span>, in no way was it possible that this <span class="highlight">region</span> could have supported large herds of mammals and thus, human hunters. Guthrie has argued against this view by pointing out that <span class="highlight">radiocarbon</span><span class="highlight">analysis</span> of <span class="highlight">mammoth</span>, horse, and bison bones from Beringian deposits revealed that the bones <span class="highlight">date</span> to the period of most <span class="highlight">intense</span><span class="highlight">glaciation</span>.</p><p>The <span class="highlight">argument</span> seemed to be at a standstill until a number of recent studies resulted in a <span class="highlight">spectacular</span> suite of new finds. The first was the discovery of a 1,000-square-kilometer preserved <span class="highlight">patch</span> of Beringian <span class="highlight">vegetation</span> dating to just over 17,000 years ago-the <span class="highlight">peak</span> of the last ice age. The plants were preserved under a thick ash fall from a <span class="highlight">volcanic</span><span class="highlight">eruption</span>. Investigations of the plants found grasses, sedges, mosses, and many other varieties in a nearly <span class="highlight">continuous</span> cover, as was predicted by Guthrie. But this <span class="highlight">vegetation</span> had a thin <span class="highlight">root</span><span class="highlight">mat</span> with no soil <span class="highlight">formation</span>, demonstrating that there was little long-term <span class="highlight">stability</span> in plant cover, a finding supporting some of the arguments of Colinvaux. A mixture of <span class="highlight">continuous</span> but thin <span class="highlight">vegetation</span> supporting herds of large mammals is one that seems <span class="highlight"><span class="question11">plausible</span></span> and <span class="highlight">realistic</span> with the <span class="highlight">available</span><span class="highlight">data</span>.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">remnants</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. remains</p><p>B. evidence</p><p>C. results</p><p>D. reminders</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>Remnants remnants, residues.

Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. According to biologist Dale Guthrie, mammal species require broad areas of vegetation to survive.</p><p>B. Dale Guthrie is an Arctic biologist who argued that broad areas of dense vegetation were surely enough to attract mammals such as mammoth, horse, and bison to Beringia.</p><p>C. Dale Guthrie argued that Beringia, though cold and dry, must have had enough dense vegetation to support the herds of mammoth, horse, and bison that lived there.</p><p>D. As long as Beringia was cold and dry, argued Dale Guthrie, dense vegetation grew in order to support the herds of mammoth, horse, and bison-the mammal species present there.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The logic of the original sentence while expressing concessions, the core of the sentence: Dale believes that even if cold and dry, there must be vegetation support for those mammals. The C option sentence corresponds to the two cores of the original sentence, and the logical relationship of though is correct, so the C option is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, Guthrie believes that the teeth of ice-age fauna support which of the following conclusions?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Large mammals would not have been able to survive in the Beringian landscape.</p><p>B. Grasslands were part of the Beringian landscape.</p><p>C. Strong winds exposed dry grasses under the snow.</p><p>D. Horses and bison did not have the ability to search for food through deep snow cover.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>This question is based on the keyword teeth, ice-age fauna, which is located near the original all of the ice-age fauna had teeth that indicate an adaptation to grasses and sedges. An adaptation to grasses and sedges in the sentence. Therefore, the B option is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, which of the following statements is true of the relationship between ice-age Benngian animals and their environment?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. When present in sufficient quantities, lichens and mosses provide enough nutrients to satisfy the needs of herds of large mammals.</p><p>B. The anatomy of certain animals present in that environment provides information about the intensity of winds there at that time.</p><p>C. The structure of the teeth of most ice-age fauna indicates that they preyed on animals such as the mammoth, horse, and bison.</p><p>D. Horses and bison are large enough that their feet can easily penetrate deep snow and uncover areas where they can feed on plant material.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The expression of the A option was inconsistent with the original description of the modern flora of mosses and lichens. The B option corresponds to the original Guthrie has...the landscape must have been subject to intense and continuous winds, ...through deep snow cover. The C option corresponds to the original ...ice-age fauna had teeth that indicate..., but the contents of the options in the options Does not match. The D option's large enough... feet can easily penetrate the expression and the original do not have the ability...</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>In paragraph 5, the amount of pollen in Beringian lake sediments from the last ice age is used to explain</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. how long the ice age lasted</p><p>B. how important pollen is as a source of food</p><p>C. how many different kinds of plants produce pollen</p><p>D. how little vegetation must have been present at that time</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>According to paragraph 5 of the original text, Paul Colinvaux's analysis of the content of pollen is to explain that in the last ice age, vegetation is very small. Therefore, the D option is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 5, how did Dale Guthrie use the information about radiocarbon analysis of bones from Benngian deposits?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To suggest that Colinvaux should have used different methods to measure the amount of pollen in ice-age lake sediments</p><p>B. To argue that the large Beringian mammals must have eaten plants that produce little, if any, pollen</p><p>C. To show that the conclusions that Colinvaux drew from the analysis of pollen in ice-age lake sediments cannot be correct</p><p>D. To explain why so-called polar deserts are incapable of supporting such large animals as mammoth, horse, and bison</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>According to the original text, Dale Guthrie was against Paul Colinvaux's conclusion that in the possible that this region could have supported large herds of mammals. Because Dale Guthrie found from the analysis of some animals' radiocarbons that mammoth, horse and bison bones do exist during the period of intense glaciation, that is, he believes that Paul Colinvaux's conclusion is wrong, so the C option is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question11">plausible</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. preferable</p><p>B. practical</p><p>C. reasonable</p><p>D. advantageous</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" C"><p>Plausible means <span class="question11">plausible</span>, and the reasonability of the C option is reasonable and consistent with the context.</p><p>Preferred is more desirable and more desirable.
