            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.23" data-time="12.59">[00:12.59]</span>Student:Yes. You talked about T-cells, <span class="highlight">naive</span> T-cells. <span class="time" data-times="1.69" data-time="17.82">[00:17.82]</span>Can you go over that part again? <span class="time" data-times="2.98" data-time="19.51">[00:19.51]</span>And also why do we call them that anyway?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.02" data-time="22.49">[00:22.49]</span>Professor:All right. They're...they're known as T-cells because they develop in the thymus</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.04" data-time="27.51">[00:27.51]</span>Student:The what?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.25" data-time="28.55">[00:28.55]</span>Professor:<span class="highlight">Thymus</span>. That's T-H-Y-M-U-S. <span class="time" data-times="1.78" data-time="33.8">[00:33.80]</span>It's a small organ in the body. <span class="time" data-times="2.11" data-time="35.58">[00:35.58]</span>Anyway, that's why we call them that. <span class="time" data-times="1.36" data-time="37.69">[00:37.69]</span>They come from the <span class="highlight">thymus</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.35" data-time="39.05">[00:39.05]</span>And T-cells are a part of body's <span class="highlight">immune</span> system. <span class="time" data-times="5.06" data-time="42.4">[00:42.40]</span>They can <span class="highlight">recognize</span> and <span class="highlight">eliminate</span> cells from outside the body that might cause disease</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.04" data-time="47.46">[00:47.46]</span>Student:But why <span class="highlight">naive</span>? I mean, we might call people <span class="highlight">naive</span> if they don't have enough experience to know about the dangers of the world. <span class="time" data-times="2.14" data-time="56.5">[00:56.50]</span>But how can you call a <span class="highlight">cell</span> <span class="highlight">naive</span>?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.45" data-time="58.64">[00:58.64]</span>Professor: Well...when this type of <span class="highlight">immune</span> <span class="highlight">cell</span> encounters a <span class="highlight">cell</span> from outside the body, like maybe a bacterium. <span class="time" data-times="3.96" data-time="64.09">[01:04.09]</span>It interacts with that bacterium and learns to <span class="highlight">recognize</span> it. <span class="time" data-times="6.16" data-time="68.05">[01:08.05]</span>So whenever the <span class="highlight">immune</span> <span class="highlight">cell</span> runs into that kind of bacterium in the future, it'll attack and kill it. <span class="time" data-times="9.51" data-time="74.21">[01:14.21]</span>At that point we call it a memory T-cell because it's learned to <span class="highlight">recognize</span> a <span class="highlight">protein</span> marker that identifies this <span class="highlight">particular</span> kind of bacterium. <span class="time" data-times="7.21" data-time="83.72">[01:23.72]</span>But before it's learned to <span class="highlight">recognize</span> any <span class="highlight">particular</span> <span class="highlight">protein</span> from outside the body, we call it <span class="highlight">naive</span>. Okay?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.13" data-time="90.93">[01:30.93]</span>Student:Yeah, I get it.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.17" data-time="92.06">[01:32.06]</span>Professor:There is a lot of biochemistry involved that we'll get into in the next lecture. <span class="time" data-times="3.77" data-time="96.23">[01:36.23]</span>But your question reminds me about a study that some of my colleagues are doing. <span class="time" data-times="2.66" data-time="100">[01:40.00]</span>It relates to caloric restriction</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.55" data-time="102.66">[01:42.66]</span>Student:Caloric? Like calories in the food we eat.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.84" data-time="106.21">[01:46.21]</span>Professor:Exactly! We are talking about the sugars, carbohydrates, fats that our bodies burn to get energy which we <span class="highlight">measure</span> in calories.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.46" data-time="114.05">[01:54.05]</span>Okay, let's back up a little.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.74" data-time="116.51">[01:56.51]</span>Back in the 1930s, a nutritionist at Cornell University put <span class="highlight">mice</span> on a <span class="highlight">severely</span> <span class="highlight">restricted</span> <span class="highlight">diet</span>. <span class="time" data-times="10.44" data-time="123.25">[02:03.25]</span>He gave each mouse in one group thirty percent less food, or more precisely, thirty percent fewer calories than the <span class="highlight">mice</span> in the other group which ate a normal <span class="highlight">amount</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.86" data-time="133.69">[02:13.69]</span>And the result, the underfed <span class="highlight">mice</span> lived much longer than the <span class="highlight">normally</span> fed ones.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.76" data-time="139.55">[02:19.55]</span>Student:Wow! Does that just go for <span class="highlight">mice</span>?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.4" data-time="143.31">[02:23.31]</span>Professor:Apparently not. <span class="highlight">Similar</span> results have come from experiments on other animals from roundworms to most recently Rhesus monkeys.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.35" data-time="152.71">[02:32.71]</span>These monkeys, two groups of them, were <span class="highlight">given</span> all the vitamins and minerals and other nutrients they needed, except that one group got thirty percent fewer calories. <span class="time" data-times="12.59" data-time="162.06">[02:42.06]</span>And now after thirty years or so, about an <span class="highlight">average</span> lifetime for a monkey, it's <span class="highlight">clear</span> that the monkeys that have been on the <span class="highlight">calorie</span> <span class="highlight">restricted</span> <span class="highlight">diet</span> are doing a lot better than the ones on that we <span class="highlight">consider</span> a normal <span class="highlight">healthful</span> <span class="highlight">diet</span>. <span class="time" data-times="10.71" data-time="174.65">[02:54.65]</span>Like in terms of blood <span class="highlight">pressure</span> and lots of other measures, the <span class="highlight">calorie</span> <span class="highlight">restricted</span> monkeys are much healthier and they just look and act younger than the monkeys in the normal <span class="highlight">diet</span> group. <span class="time" data-times="2.67" data-time="185.36">[03:05.36]</span>And as a group, they are living longer.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.08" data-time="188.03">[03:08.03]</span>Student:Interesting. But what's the connection?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.73" data-time="191.11">[03:11.11]</span>Professor:Oh, with the <span class="highlight">immune</span> system? <span class="time" data-times="5.22" data-time="192.84">[03:12.84]</span>Well, it is been shown that the <span class="highlight">immune</span> system becomes much less <span class="highlight">effective</span> as animals age. <span class="time" data-times="1.72" data-time="198.06">[03:18.06]</span>That's true in humans too. <span class="time" data-times="3.71" data-time="199.78">[03:19.78]</span>We think those <span class="highlight">naive</span> T-cells just get used up.<span class="time" data-times="2.85" data-time="203.49">[03:23.49]</span> I mean it is not like the body's always making lots of new ones.<span class="time" data-times="10.14" data-time="206.34">[03:26.34]</span> And over the <span class="highlight">course</span> of a lifetime, as T-cells <span class="highlight">encounter</span> more and more strange <span class="highlight">bacteria</span> or whatever, the <span class="highlight">naive</span> T-cells get turned into memory T-cells. <span class="time" data-times="14.05" data-time="216.48">[03:36.48]</span>So later on in life, there are fewer and fewer of these <span class="highlight">naive</span> T-cells left to <span class="highlight">deal</span> with any new disease- causing organisms that might attack, which means less <span class="highlight">immunity</span>, and the animal or person is more likely to get sick.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="13.43" data-time="230.53">[03:50.53]</span>But caloric restriction, it kind of shocks the system, and one result is, well, those monkeys on the calorie-restricted <span class="highlight">diet</span> had lots more <span class="highlight">naive</span> T-cells left than you'd <span class="highlight">expect</span> in monkeys that old. <span class="time" data-times="8.62" data-time="243.96">[04:03.96]</span>The expected <span class="highlight">drop</span> in <span class="highlight">naive</span> T-cells, apparently the shock of getting thirty percent fewer calories really slows that down. <span class="time" data-times="11.86" data-time="252.58">[04:12.58]</span>And after many years, with so many more <span class="highlight">naive</span> T-cells still in <span class="highlight">reserve</span>, these monkeys are a lot better at fighting off new infections than <span class="highlight">normally</span> fed monkeys of the same <span class="highlight">advanced</span> age.</p>

              <span class="time" data-times="1.72" data-time="264.44">[04:24.44]</span>Student:And that's why they live longer?</p>

              <span class="time" data-times="2.4" data-time="272.17">[04:32.17]</span>Student:But are results the same for humans?</p>

              <span class="time" data-times="3.69" data-time="274.57">[04:34.57]</span>Professor:Hard to say. A good study would take decades. <span class="time" data-times="4.07" data-time="278.26">[04:38.26]</span>And it's not easy finding people who'd want to take part, would you?</p>
