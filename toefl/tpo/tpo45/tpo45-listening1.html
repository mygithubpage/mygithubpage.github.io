              <span class="time" data-times="1.72" data-time="4.86">[00:04.86]</span>Man:Sorry you had to wait. <span class="time" data-times="3.71" data-time="6.58">[00:06.58]</span>It's a busy time of year, lots of people mailing packages home.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.43" data-time="10.29">[00:10.29]</span>Girl:I <span class="underline">bet</span>. I'll have to come next week to do that. <span class="time" data-times="2.74" data-time="12.72">[00:12.72]</span>I'm moving out of my dorm and I'm sending some papers home.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.36" data-time="15.46">[00:15.46]</span>Man:Ok. We'll be here. <span class="time" data-times="1.62" data-time="16.82">[00:16.82]</span>What can I do for you today?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.74" data-time="18.44">[00:18.44]</span>Girl:Well, my roommate asked me to pick something up for her. <span class="time" data-times="1.78" data-time="21.18">[00:21.18]</span>I told her I was coming down here.<span class="time" data-times="2.33" data-time="22.96">[00:22.96]</span> She got this notice saying that there's a package to pick up. <span class="time" data-times="2.48" data-time="25.29">[00:25.29]</span>I guess it was too big to fit into our mailbox.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.86" data-time="27.77">[00:27.77]</span>Man:I am sorry. But I can only give packages to the person who they're addressed to. <span class="time" data-times="1.7" data-time="31.63">[00:31.63]</span>It's university <span class="underline">policy</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.25" data-time="33.33">[00:33.33]</span>Girl:Really? Could you make an <span class="underline">exception</span>? <span class="time" data-times="1.23" data-time="35.58">[00:35.58]</span>She is my roommate.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.21" data-time="36.81">[00:36.81]</span>Man:I wish I could, but she'll have to come and get it herself. <span class="time" data-times="3.34" data-time="40.02">[00:40.02]</span>And be sure to tell her to have her student ID card on her. <span class="time" data-times="2.01" data-time="43.36">[00:43.36]</span>We will need to see <span class="underline">identification</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.16" data-time="45.37">[00:45.37]</span>Oh, and she'll need that package notification too.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.36" data-time="48.53">[00:48.53]</span>Girl:Ok. I'll let her know. <span class="time" data-times="7.37" data-time="49.89">[00:49.89]</span>Also since I'm moving, I'll be able to receive my <span class="underline">mail</span> at my new <span class="underline">apartment</span>, so I don't really need my <span class="underline">campus</span> mailbox.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.57" data-time="57.26">[00:57.26]</span>Man:Oh, Ok. Although I should tell you that we do <span class="underline">recommend</span> that students use the <span class="underline">campus</span> mailbox service <span class="underline">even</span> if they are moving off <span class="underline">campus</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.04" data-time="65.83">[01:05.83]</span>Girl:Really? Why?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.89" data-time="66.87">[01:06.87]</span>Man:Well, if any of your professors want to <span class="underline">notify</span> you of changes to class schedules or get in touch with you for any <span class="underline">reason</span>...</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.3" data-time="74.76">[01:14.76]</span>Girl:My professors have my email <span class="underline">address</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.39" data-time="77.06">[01:17.06]</span>Man:Yes, that's true. <span class="time" data-times="10.34" data-time="78.45">[01:18.45]</span>But remember things like university newsletters, flyers from university clubs, notices about <span class="underline">special</span> events, they're only distributed to <span class="underline">campus</span> mailboxes. <span class="time" data-times="2.3" data-time="88.79">[01:28.79]</span>None of that is mailed off <span class="underline">campus</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.22" data-time="91.09">[01:31.09]</span>Girl:Well, I worked at the college newspaper, so I should be able to keep on top of what's going on. <span class="time" data-times="2.46" data-time="96.31">[01:36.31]</span>Plus there's a <span class="underline">bulletin</span> <span class="underline">board</span> outside the dining hall.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.89" data-time="98.77">[01:38.77]</span>Man:True. But you know if it's the <span class="underline">campus</span> mailbox fee, I might be able to <span class="underline">offer</span> you a less expensive <span class="underline">rate</span> for next year. <span class="time" data-times="2.92" data-time="106.66">[01:46.66]</span>We can do that in <span class="underline">special</span> circumstances</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.22" data-time="109.58">[01:49.58]</span>Girl:Thanks. But I mean I can <span class="underline">afford</span> the mailbox fee. <span class="time" data-times="5.69" data-time="112.8">[01:52.80]</span>It's just that between my off-campus <span class="underline">address</span>, my email <span class="underline">account</span> and the school newspaper, I don't think there will be a problem.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.85" data-time="118.49">[01:58.49]</span>Man:Ok. In that case, stop by the main desk on your way out of the building and pick up the form you'll need. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="124.34">[02:04.34]</span>And don't forget to include a forwarding <span class="underline">mail</span> <span class="underline">address</span> for anything that's addressed to your box from outside the university.</p>
