            <b>Feeding Strategies In The Ocean</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>In the open sea, animals can often find food <span class="underline">reliably</span> <span class="underline">available</span> in <span class="underline">particular</span> regions or seasons (e g., in coastal areas in springtime). In these circumstances, animals are neither constrained to get the last <span class="underline">calorie</span> out of their <span class="underline">diet</span> nor is energy <span class="underline">conservation</span> a high <span class="underline">priority</span>. In <span class="underline">contrast</span>, the food levels in the deeper layers of the ocean are greatly reduced, and the energy constraints on the animals are much more <span class="light"><span class="underline">severe</span></span> To <span class="underline">survive</span> at those levels, animals must maximize their energy input, finding and eating whatever <span class="underline">potential</span> food <span class="underline">source</span> may be present.</p>
          <p>In the near-surface layers, there are many large, fast carnivores as well as an <span class="underline">immense</span> <span class="underline">variety</span> of <span class="underline">planktonic</span> animals, which feed on <span class="underline">plankton</span> (small, free-floating plants or animals) by filtering them from currents of water that pass <span class="underline">through</span> a <span class="underline">specialized</span> <span class="underline">anatomical</span> structure. These filter-feeders <span class="underline">thrive</span> in the well-illuminated surface waters because oceans have so many very small organisms, from <span class="underline">bacteria</span> to large <span class="underline">algae</span> to <span class="underline">larval</span> crustaceans. <span class="underline">Even</span> fishes can become successful filter-feeders in some circumstances. Although the <span class="underline">vast</span> <span class="underline">majority</span> of <span class="underline">marine</span> fishes are carnivores, in near-surface regions of high <span class="underline">productivity</span> the concentrations of larger <span class="underline">phytoplankton</span> (the plant <span class="underline">component</span> of <span class="underline">plankton</span>) are <span class="underline">sufficient</span> to support huge populations of filter-feeding sardines and anchovies. These small fishes use their <span class="underline">gill</span> filaments to <span class="underline">strain</span> out the <span class="underline">algae</span> that <span class="underline">dominate</span> such areas. Sardines and anchovies provide the basis for huge <span class="underline">commercial</span> fisheries as well as a food <span class="underline">resource</span> for large numbers of <span class="underline">local</span> carnivores, particularly seabirds. At a much larger <span class="underline">scale</span>, baleen whales and whale sharks are also <span class="underline">efficient</span> filter-feeders in <span class="underline">productive</span> coastal or <span class="underline">polar</span> waters, although their filtered particles <span class="underline">comprise</span> small animals such as copepods and <span class="underline">krill</span> rather than <span class="underline">phytoplankton</span>.</p>
          <p>Filtering seawater for its particulate nutritional <span class="underline">content</span> can be an energetically <span class="underline">demanding</span> <span class="underline">method</span> of feeding, particularly when the <span class="underline">current</span> of water to be filtered has to be generated by the <span class="underline">organism</span> itself, as is the case for all <span class="underline">planktonic</span> animals. Particulate <span class="underline">organic</span> matter of at <span class="underline">least</span> 2.5 micrograms per cubic <span class="underline">liter</span> is required to provide a filter-feeding <span class="underline">planktonic</span> <span class="underline">organism</span> with a net energy gain. This value is easily exceeded in most coastal waters, but in the deep sea, the levels of <span class="underline">organic</span> matter <span class="underline">range</span> from next to nothing to around 7 micrograms per cubic <span class="underline">liter</span>. <span class="underline">Even</span> though mean levels may <span class="underline">mask</span> much higher <span class="underline">local</span> concentrations, it is still the case that many deep-sea animals are <span class="underline">exposed</span> to conditions in which a normal filter-feeder would starve.</p>
          <p>There are, <span class="underline">therefore</span>, fewer successful filter-feeders in deep water, and some of those that are there have larger filtering systems to cope with the <span class="underline">scarcity</span> of particles. Another <span class="underline">solution</span> for such animals is to <span class="underline">forage</span> in <span class="underline">particular</span> layers of water where the particles may be more concentrated. Many of the groups of animals that <span class="underline">typify</span> the filter-feeding lifestyle in <span class="underline">shallow</span> water have deep-sea representatives that have become <span class="underline">predatory</span>. Their filtering systems, which <span class="underline">reach</span> such a high <span class="underline">degree</span> of <span class="underline">development</span> in shallow- water <span class="underline">species</span>, are greatly reduced. <span class="underline">Alternative</span> methods of active or <span class="underline">passive</span> <span class="underline">prey</span> <span class="underline">capture</span> have been evolved, including trapping and seizing <span class="underline">prey</span>, entangling <span class="underline">prey</span>, and <span class="underline">sticky</span> tentacles.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A">
            </span>In the deeper waters of the oceans, there is a much greater <span class="underline">tendency</span> for animals to await the arrival of food particles or <span class="underline">prey</span> rather than to search them out actively (thus minimizing energy expenditure). <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>This has resulted in a more <span class="underline">stealthy</span> style of feeding, with the <span class="underline">consequent</span> emphasis on lures and/or the <span class="underline">evolution</span> of <span class="underline">elongated</span> appendages that increase the active <span class="underline">volume</span> of water controlled or monitored by the animal. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>Another <span class="underline">consequence</span> of the limited <span class="underline">availability</span> of <span class="underline">prey</span> is that many animals have developed ways of coping with much larger food particles, <span class="underline">relative</span> to their own body size, than the <span class="underline">equivalent</span> shallower <span class="underline">species</span> can <span class="underline">process</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>Among the fishes there is a <span class="underline">tendency</span> for the teeth and jaws to become <span class="underline">appreciably</span> enlarged. In such creatures, not only are the teeth hugely enlarged and/or the jaws <span class="underline">elongated</span> but the size of the mouth opening may be greatly increased by making the <span class="underline">jaw</span> articulations so <span class="underline">flexible</span> that they can be effectively dislocated. Very large or long teeth provide almost no room for cutting the <span class="underline">prey</span> into a <span class="underline">convenient</span> size for swallowing, the fish must <span class="underline">gulp</span> the <span class="underline">prey</span> down whole.</p>
