In these circumstances, animals are neither constrained to get the last <span class="highlight">calorie</span> out of their <span class="highlight">diet</span> nor is energy <span class="highlight">conservation</span> a high <span class="highlight">priority</span>. In <span class="highlight">contrast</span>, the food levels in the deeper layers of the ocean are greatly reduced, and the energy constraints on the animals are much more <span class="highlight question1">severe</span> To <span class="highlight">survive</span> at those levels, animals must maximize their energy input, finding and eating whatever <span class="highlight">potential</span> food <span class="highlight">source</span> may be present.</p><p>In the near-surface layers, there are many large, fast carnivores as well as an <span class="highlight">immense</span><span class="highlight">variety</span> of <span class="highlight">planktonic</span> animals, which feed on <span class="highlight">plankton</span> (small, free-floating plants or animals) by filtering them from currents of water that pass <span class="highlight">through</span> a <span class="highlight">specialized</span><span class="highlight">anatomical</span> structure. These filter-feeders <span class="highlight">thrive</span> in the well-illuminated surface waters because oceans have so many very small organisms, from <span class="highlight">bacteria</span> to large <span class="highlight">algae</span> to <span class="highlight">larval</span> crustaceans. <span class="highlight">Even</span> fishes can become successful filter-feeders in some circumstances. Although the <span class="highlight">vast</span><span class="highlight">majority</span> of <span class="highlight">marine</span> fishes are carnivores, in near-surface regions of high <span class="highlight">productivity</span> the concentrations of larger <span class="highlight">phytoplankton</span> (the plant <span class="highlight">component</span> of <span class="highlight">plankton</span>) are <span class="highlight">sufficient</span> to support huge populations of filter-feeding sardines and anchovies. These small fishes use their <span class="highlight">gill</span> filaments to <span class="highlight">strain</span> out the <span class="highlight">algae</span> that <span class="highlight">dominate</span> such areas. Sardines and anchovies provide the basis for huge <span class="highlight">commercial</span> fisheries as well as a food <span class="highlight">resource</span> for large numbers of <span class="highlight">local</span> carnivores, particularly seabirds. At a much larger <span class="highlight">scale</span>, baleen whales and whale sharks are also <span class="highlight">efficient</span> filter-feeders in <span class="highlight">productive</span> coastal or <span class="highlight">polar</span> waters, although their filtered particles <span class="highlight">comprise</span> small animals such as copepods and <span class="highlight">krill</span> rather than <span class="highlight">phytoplankton</span>.</p><p><span class="question6">Filtering seawater for its particulate nutritional <span class="highlight">content</span> can be an energetically <span class="highlight">demanding</span><span class="highlight">method</span> of feeding, particularly when the <span class="highlight">current</span> of water to be filtered has to be generated by the <span class="highlight">organism</span> itself, as is the case for all <span class="highlight">planktonic</span> animals.</span> Particulate <span class="highlight">organic</span> matter of at <span class="highlight">least</span> 2.5 micrograms per cubic <span class="highlight">liter</span> is required to provide a filter-feeding <span class="highlight">planktonic</span><span class="highlight">organism</span> with a net energy gain. This value is easily exceeded in most coastal waters, but in the deep sea, the levels of <span class="highlight">organic</span> matter <span class="highlight">range</span> from next to nothing to around 7 micrograms per cubic <span class="highlight">liter</span>. <span class="highlight">Even</span> though mean levels may <span class="highlight">mask</span> much higher <span class="highlight">local</span> concentrations, it is still the case that many deep-sea animals are <span class="highlight">exposed</span> to conditions in which a normal filter-feeder would starve.</p><p>There are, <span class="highlight">therefore</span>, fewer successful filter-feeders in deep water, and some of those that are there have larger filtering systems to cope with the <span class="highlight"><span class="question7">scarcity</span></span> of particles. Another <span class="highlight">solution</span> for such animals is to <span class="highlight">forage</span> in <span class="highlight">particular</span> layers of water where the particles may be more concentrated. Many of the groups of animals that <span class="highlight">typify</span> the filter-feeding lifestyle in <span class="highlight">shallow</span> water have deep-sea representatives that have become <span class="highlight">predatory</span>. Their filtering systems, which <span class="highlight">reach</span> such a high <span class="highlight">degree</span> of <span class="highlight">development</span> in shallow- water <span class="highlight">species</span>, are greatly reduced. <span class="highlight">Alternative</span> methods of active or <span class="highlight">passive</span><span class="highlight">prey</span><span class="highlight">capture</span> have been evolved, including trapping and seizing <span class="highlight">prey</span>, entangling <span class="highlight">prey</span>, and <span class="highlight">sticky</span> tentacles.</p><p><span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>In the deeper waters of the oceans, there is a much greater <span class="highlight">tendency</span> for animals to await the arrival of food particles or <span class="highlight">prey</span> rather than to search them out actively (thus minimizing energy expenditure). <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>This has resulted in a more <span class="highlight">stealthy</span> style of feeding, with the <span class="highlight">consequent</span> emphasis on lures and/or the <span class="highlight">evolution</span> of <span class="highlight">elongated</span> appendages that increase the active <span class="highlight">volume</span> of water controlled or monitored by the animal. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>Another <span class="highlight">consequence</span> of the limited <span class="highlight">availability</span> of <span class="highlight">prey</span> is that many animals have developed ways of <span class="question10">coping with</span> much larger food particles, <span class="highlight">relative</span> to their own body size, than the <span class="highlight">equivalent</span> shallower <span class="highlight">species</span> can <span class="highlight">process</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>Among the fishes there is a <span class="highlight">tendency</span> for the teeth and jaws to become <span class="highlight">appreciably</span> enlarged. In such creatures, not only are the teeth hugely enlarged and/or the jaws <span class="highlight">elongated</span> but the size of the mouth opening may be greatly increased by making the <span class="highlight">jaw</span> articulations so <span class="highlight"><span class="question11">flexible</span></span> that they can be effectively dislocated. Very large or long teeth provide almost no room for cutting the <span class="highlight">prey</span> into a <span class="highlight">convenient</span> size for swallowing, the fish must <span class="highlight">gulp</span> the <span class="highlight">prey</span> down whole.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">severe</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. extreme</p><p>B. complex</p><p>C. basic</p><p>D. immediate</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>Cui means "severe."

Few fish species are successful in the near-surface layers.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>According to the original Even fishes can become successful filter-feeders in some circumstances. It can be inferred that the majority of fish is not filter-feeders. Therefore, the C option is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 2, how do sardines and anchovies obtain food near the surface of the ocean?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They rely on the large quantities of food resources also available to local carnivores.</p><p>B. They capture the larvae of some crustaceans.</p><p>C. They feed on the organisms left over by commercial fisheries.</p><p>D. They obtain algae by using their gills as filters.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>According to the Source the vast majority of ... These small fishes use their gill filaments to strain out the algae that dominate such areas. It is known that sardines and anchovies obtain food through their cockroaches.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 2, in which of the following ways are baleen whales and whale sharks different from smaller fitter-feeders like sardines and anchovies?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

They are not carnivores.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>With baleen whales positioning to the last sentence, baleen whale and whale shark are also effective filter feeders, although they filter particles containing small animals (such as copepods, krill, rather than phytoplankton), which describes them and sardines ,anchoviesa difference. Correspond to C option. The C option is correct. [A] option also said that they will be in the coastal and polar waters, then the A option is wrong, and the original contradictory, [B option] does not mention the original [D option] did not say that they are not carnivores.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. An organism may obtain food particles from seawater when currents generated by the organism cause water to pass through its fitter</p><p>B. The nutritional content of the food particles in seawater is sufficient to meet the energy demands of most planktonic animals.</p><p>C. As planktonic animals require a lot of energy, they have to generate a current strong enough to bring them sufficient particles of food.</p><p>D. Organisms that filter seawater to meet their nutritional needs expend a lot of energy, especially those organisms that have to create their own currents.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The original sentence has two levels: 1. Filtering requires a lot of energy 2. Especially when the water flow may require the creature to generate itself. It is only the D option that expresses these two meanings.</p><p>[A option] does not express the meaning of the first layer at all, and the content behind the cause does not exist.</p><p>[B option] has nothing to do with the meaning of the original sentence.</p><p>[C options] strong enough and the original has nothing to do, the original instructions that they need their own generate flow, did not say strong enough.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question7">scarcity</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. speed</p><p>B. variety</p><p>C. lack</p><p>D. size</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" C"><p>Scarcity means "insufficient, lacking."

To argue against the view that animals in the deep ocean use more energy to find food than do animals in shallow waters</p><p>B. To emphasize the importance of an am mars ability to control a large volume of water</p><p>C. To identify some feeding strategies that animals have developed to minimize their energy expenditure</p><p>D. To give examples of body structures that help those animals move quickly in deep ocean waters</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>According to the original In the deeper waters of the oceans, there is a much greater tendency for animals to await the arrival of food particles or prey rather than search them out actively (thus minimizing energy expenditure). It can be seen that the purpose of deep sea animals is to do this. Minimizing energy expenditure. The information in parentheses also needs attention when solving problems.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The phrase "<span class="highlight"><span class="question10">coping with</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.
