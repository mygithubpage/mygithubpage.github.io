In these circumstances, animals are neither constrained to get the last <span class="highlight">calorie</span> out of their <span class="highlight">diet</span> nor is energy <span class="highlight">conservation</span> a high <span class="highlight">priority</span>. In <span class="highlight">contrast</span>, the food levels in the deeper layers of the ocean are greatly reduced, and the energy constraints on the animals are much more <span class="question1"><span class="highlight">severe</span></span> To <span class="highlight">survive</span> at those levels, animals must maximize their energy input, finding and eating whatever <span class="highlight">potential</span> food <span class="highlight">source</span> may be present.</p><p>In the near-surface layers, there are many large, fast carnivores as well as an <span class="highlight">immense</span><span class="highlight">variety</span> of <span class="highlight">planktonic</span> animals, which feed on <span class="highlight">plankton</span> (small, free-floating plants or animals) by filtering them from currents of water that pass <span class="highlight">through</span> a <span class="highlight">specialized</span><span class="highlight">anatomical</span> structure. These filter-feeders <span class="highlight">thrive</span> in the well-illuminated surface waters because oceans have so many very small organisms, from <span class="highlight">bacteria</span> to large <span class="highlight">algae</span> to <span class="highlight">larval</span> crustaceans. <span class="highlight">Even</span> fishes can become successful filter-feeders in some circumstances. Although the <span class="highlight">vast</span><span class="highlight">majority</span> of <span class="highlight">marine</span> fishes are carnivores, in near-surface regions of high <span class="highlight">productivity</span> the concentrations of larger <span class="highlight">phytoplankton</span> (the plant <span class="highlight">component</span> of <span class="highlight">plankton</span>) are <span class="highlight">sufficient</span> to support huge populations of filter-feeding sardines and anchovies. These small fishes use their <span class="highlight">gill</span> filaments to <span class="highlight">strain</span> out the <span class="highlight">algae</span> that <span class="highlight">dominate</span> such areas. Sardines and anchovies provide the basis for huge <span class="highlight">commercial</span> fisheries as well as a food <span class="highlight">resource</span> for large numbers of <span class="highlight">local</span> carnivores, particularly seabirds. At a much larger <span class="highlight">scale</span>, baleen whales and whale sharks are also <span class="highlight">efficient</span> filter-feeders in <span class="highlight">productive</span> coastal or <span class="highlight">polar</span> waters, although their filtered particles <span class="highlight">comprise</span> small animals such as copepods and <span class="highlight">krill</span> rather than <span class="highlight">phytoplankton</span>.</p><p><span class="question6">Filtering seawater for its particulate nutritional <span class="highlight">content</span> can be an energetically <span class="highlight">demanding</span><span class="highlight">method</span> of feeding, particularly when the <span class="highlight">current</span> of water to be filtered has to be generated by the <span class="highlight">organism</span> itself, as is the case for all <span class="highlight">planktonic</span> animals. </span>Particulate <span class="highlight">organic</span> matter of at <span class="highlight">least</span> 2.5 micrograms per cubic <span class="highlight">liter</span> is required to provide a filter-feeding <span class="highlight">planktonic</span><span class="highlight">organism</span> with a net energy gain. This value is easily exceeded in most coastal waters, but in the deep sea, the levels of <span class="highlight">organic</span> matter <span class="highlight">range</span> from next to nothing to around 7 micrograms per cubic <span class="highlight">liter</span>. <span class="highlight">Even</span> though mean levels may <span class="highlight">mask</span> much higher <span class="highlight">local</span> concentrations, it is still the case that many deep-sea animals are <span class="highlight">exposed</span> to conditions in which a normal filter-feeder would starve.</p><p>There are, <span class="highlight">therefore</span>, fewer successful filter-feeders in deep water, and some of those that are there have larger filtering systems to cope with the <span class="highlight"><span class="question7">scarcity</span></span>of particles. Another <span class="highlight">solution</span> for such animals is to <span class="highlight">forage</span> in <span class="highlight">particular</span> layers of water where the particles may be more concentrated. Many of the groups of animals that <span class="highlight">typify</span> the filter-feeding lifestyle in <span class="highlight">shallow</span> water have deep-sea representatives that have become <span class="highlight">predatory</span>. Their filtering systems, which <span class="highlight">reach</span> such a high <span class="highlight">degree</span> of <span class="highlight">development</span> in shallow- water <span class="highlight">species</span>, are greatly reduced. <span class="highlight">Alternative</span> methods of active or <span class="highlight">passive</span><span class="highlight">prey</span><span class="highlight">capture</span> have been evolved, including trapping and seizing <span class="highlight">prey</span>, entangling <span class="highlight">prey</span>, and <span class="highlight">sticky</span> tentacles.</p><p><span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>In the deeper waters of the oceans, there is a much greater <span class="highlight">tendency</span> for animals to await the arrival of food particles or <span class="highlight">prey</span> rather than to search them out actively (thus minimizing energy expenditure). <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>This has resulted in a more <span class="highlight">stealthy</span> style of feeding, with the <span class="highlight">consequent</span> emphasis on lures and/or the <span class="highlight">evolution</span> of <span class="highlight">elongated</span> appendages that increase the active <span class="highlight">volume</span> of water controlled or monitored by the animal. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>Another <span class="highlight">consequence</span> of the limited <span class="highlight">availability</span> of <span class="highlight">prey</span> is that many animals have developed ways of <span class="question10">coping with </span>much larger food particles, <span class="highlight">relative</span> to their own body size, than the <span class="highlight">equivalent</span> shallower <span class="highlight">species</span> can <span class="highlight">process</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>Among the fishes there is a <span class="highlight">tendency</span> for the teeth and jaws to become <span class="highlight">appreciably</span> enlarged. In such creatures, not only are the teeth hugely enlarged and/or the jaws <span class="highlight">elongated</span> but the size of the mouth opening may be greatly increased by making the <span class="highlight">jaw</span> articulations so <span class="highlight"><span class="question11">flexible</span></span>that they can be effectively dislocated. Very large or long teeth provide almost no room for cutting the <span class="highlight">prey</span> into a <span class="highlight">convenient</span> size for swallowing, the fish must <span class="highlight">gulp</span> the <span class="highlight">prey</span> down whole.</p></article></div><div id="question"><div id="question1"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">severe</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p><label class="my-label"><span>A. extreme</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><label class="my-label"><span>B. complex</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><label class="my-label"><span>C. basic</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><label class="my-label"><span>D. immediate</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><p><span>Answer: </span><span class="my-answer">A</span></p></div><div id="question2"><p>What can be inferred from paragraph 1 about why energy conservation is not a high priority for ocean animals in coastal waters during the spring?</p><label class="my-label"><span>A.
