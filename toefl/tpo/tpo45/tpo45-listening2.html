            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="12.22" data-time="3.71">[00:03.71]</span>As I was saying, the Renaissance period, which started in the 1400s in Europe, the Renaissance was still a <span class="highlight">pretty</span> <span class="highlight">religious</span> period, and that's reflected in the artwork of that time. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="11.39" data-time="15.93">[00:15.93]</span>But artists were starting to experiment with a more <span class="highlight">secular</span> point of view as well, a <span class="highlight">tendency</span> to also use the natural world as the <span class="highlight">subject</span> matter for their art. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.5" data-time="27.32">[00:27.32]</span>And there were different ways that these natural themes were explored. <span class="time" data-times="10.34" data-time="31.82">[00:31.82]</span>For <span class="highlight">instance</span>, many artists would paint portraits, while others, although this was more <span class="highlight">common</span> in Northern Europe, would make landscapes the <span class="highlight">subject</span> of their works. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="11.76" data-time="42.16">[00:42.16]</span>But today I'd like to <span class="highlight">consider</span> an <span class="highlight">influential</span> Italian Renaissance artist, Leon Battista Alberti, who took a <span class="highlight">slightly</span> different <span class="highlight">approach</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="16.92" data-time="53.92">[00:53.92]</span>Leon Battista Alberti was a painter, <span class="highlight">sculptor</span>, <span class="highlight">architect</span>, <span class="highlight">musician</span>, poet, very wide-ranging interests, like Da Vinci or Michelangelo , the <span class="highlight">sort</span> of guy for whom the <span class="highlight">term</span> "Renaissance Man" was in fact created. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.89" data-time="70.84">[01:10.84]</span>Alberti believed that the most important <span class="highlight">approach</span> for a painter was to <span class="highlight">capture</span> a story or <span class="highlight">narrative</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.68" data-time="78.73">[01:18.73]</span>Now, as I've indicated, this <span class="highlight">narrative</span> could be the <span class="highlight">religious</span> or <span class="highlight">secular</span>, depending on what the work of art was for. <span class="time" data-times="11.34" data-time="86.41">[01:26.41]</span>If the work was to be placed in a church, then <span class="highlight">obviously</span>, it'd have a <span class="highlight">religious</span> theme, whereas, if it was for someone's home, then it could <span class="highlight">deal</span> with a different <span class="highlight">subject</span> matter. <span class="time" data-times="9.3" data-time="97.75">[01:37.75]</span>The <span class="highlight">exact</span> <span class="highlight">narrative</span> didn't really matter, so long as it was one that captivated the <span class="highlight">audience</span>, that held the viewers' <span class="highlight">attention</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.28" data-time="107.05">[01:47.05]</span>So, what is actually needed to tell a story? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.5" data-time="111.33">[01:51.33]</span>Well, Alberti needed characters, right? <span class="time" data-times="1.2" data-time="114.83">[01:54.83]</span>Human figures.<span class="time" data-times="5.54" data-time="116.03">[01:56.03]</span> And he <span class="highlight">wanted</span> to <span class="highlight">represent</span> them as realistically as possible, to <span class="highlight">capture</span> the viewers' <span class="highlight">attention</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.64" data-time="121.57">[02:01.57]</span>One way he achieved this was to make use of what's known as "the contrapposto pose". </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.11" data-time="128.21">[02:08.21]</span>A contrapposto <span class="highlight">pose</span> basically entails showing a <span class="highlight">slight</span> <span class="highlight">twist</span> in the body.<span class="time" data-times="4.44" data-time="134.32">[02:14.32]</span>The shoulders and hips are usually bent in different directions. <span class="time" data-times="11.99" data-time="138.76">[02:18.76]</span>In other words, if the left shoulder is bent, so that it's <span class="highlight">slightly</span> higher than the right shoulder, then the hips will be bent, so that the left side will be <span class="highlight">slightly</span> <span class="highlight">lower</span> than the right side. <span class="time" data-times="11.97" data-time="150.75">[02:30.75]</span>Similarly, in sculptures, most of the weight seems to be on one foot, which also results in this slanted <span class="highlight">position</span>, making it <span class="highlight">seem</span> like the <span class="highlight">figure</span> is about to walk or move. <span class="time" data-times="3.44" data-time="162.72">[02:42.72]</span>This adds to the <span class="highlight">realistic</span> <span class="highlight">aspect</span> of the <span class="highlight">figure</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.9" data-time="166.16">[02:46.16]</span>But there are actually a lot of things that could go wrong in the <span class="highlight">attempt</span> to create such a <span class="highlight">pose</span>.<span class="time" data-times="5.7" data-time="173.06">[02:53.06]</span> You could make a <span class="highlight">figure</span>'s arms bigger than its legs, or the head too small for the body. <span class="time" data-times="6.11" data-time="178.76">[02:58.76]</span>Messing up the proportions can leave a <span class="highlight">figure</span> looking cartoon-like and unnatural. <span class="time" data-times="2.87" data-time="184.87">[03:04.87]</span>But Alberti had a <span class="highlight">solution</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.2" data-time="187.74">[03:07.74]</span>He encouraged artists to <span class="highlight">visualize</span> a figures' bones and structure. <span class="time" data-times="4.44" data-time="192.94">[03:12.94]</span>This would give the artist an idea of the proportions of the <span class="highlight">figure</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9.93" data-time="197.38">[03:17.38]</span>From there, Alberti suggested that the artists imagine attaching the tendons and muscles, then covering those with flesh and skin. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="17.76" data-time="207.31">[03:27.31]</span>Now, although this <span class="highlight">method</span> may <span class="highlight">seem</span> <span class="highlight">complicated</span>, artists since <span class="highlight">antiquity</span> have used <span class="highlight">anatomical</span> observations to try to get the proportions of the human <span class="highlight">figure</span> as <span class="highlight">accurate</span> as possible, though <span class="highlight">obviously</span> not to the <span class="highlight">degree</span> that Alberti was recommending. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.51" data-time="225.07">[03:45.07]</span>Now, in <span class="highlight">addition</span> to characters, the <span class="highlight">setting</span> is extremely important, especially when attempting to tell a story realistically. <span class="time" data-times="7.68" data-time="234.58">[03:54.58]</span>Renaissance artists <span class="highlight">essentially</span> needed to create a three- <span class="highlight">dimensional</span> <span class="highlight">scene</span> on a two-dimensional surface. <span class="time" data-times="6.89" data-time="242.26">[04:02.26]</span>They <span class="highlight">accomplished</span> this by the use of <span class="highlight">perspective</span>, a <span class="highlight">relatively</span> new idea for artists at the time. <span class="time" data-times="9.3" data-time="249.15">[04:09.15]</span>In <span class="highlight">particular</span>, the type of <span class="highlight">perspective</span> that Alberti advocated was called "<span class="highlight">Linear</span> One-point Perspective". <span class="time" data-times="8.08" data-time="258.45">[04:18.45]</span>In fact, Alberti was one of the artists who developed the <span class="highlight">geometry</span> behind <span class="highlight">linear</span> one-point <span class="highlight">perspective</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="18.86" data-time="266.53">[04:26.53]</span>
              <span class="highlight">Linear</span>
              <span class="highlight">perspective</span> basically consists of drawing straight lines that <span class="highlight">extend</span> from the <span class="highlight">forefront</span> of the painting into the background, lines that <span class="highlight">seem</span> to be paralleled to each other, but which actually <span class="highlight">converge</span> on a single point in the <span class="highlight">horizon</span>, called the vanishing point. <span class="time" data-times="10.13" data-time="285.39">[04:45.39]</span>By drawing figures and objects smaller and smaller, as the lines get closer together, the artist is able to create depth in a painting. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="295.52">[04:55.52]</span>This gives the <span class="highlight">illusion</span> of a third <span class="highlight">dimension</span>, and makes the work of art more <span class="highlight">realistic</span>. </p>
