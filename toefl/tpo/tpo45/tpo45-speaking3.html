          <h4 class="w3-center">Close the Coffeehouse</h4>
          <p>Like many people, I was happy when the university opened a coffeehouse. A good coffeehouse is a perfect place to meet people or to study while having a coffee. Unfortunately, our coffeehouse usually empty, so it's not a good place to meet people And the lighting there is very poor, so it's not a good place to study, either. A coffeehouse seemed like a great idea, but it just hasn't worked out, and the time has come for the university to close it.</p>
          <p>Sincerely,</p>
          <p>Marvin Baker</p>

          <p>Now listen to two students discussing the letter.</p>
          <p>Woman: I disagree with this idea.</p>
          <p>Man: Why?Â It doesn't sounds like it's doing very much business.</p>
          <p>Woman: It's probably because he goes during the day.Â But in the evening...</p>
          <p>Man: Oh, people go.</p>
          <p>Woman: A lot of people.Â Students are very busy during the day with classes, jobs, studying.Â But at night, the place is often pretty full.Â Students get together there all the time.</p>
          <p>Man: Really.</p>
          <p>Woman: Yeah, it's not until the night time that students actually have the time to sit down and relax.Â You know, enjoy hot drink and something to eat while hanging out or meeting for class.</p>
          <p>Man: So you can't read there.</p>
          <p>Woman: Yeah, I mean it's right.Â That used to be a problem.Â But recently they did some renovations and now I thing lighting is as good as in the library.</p>
          <p>Man: Really?</p>
          <p>Woman: Yeah, and not just a few tables, just about every table has got good lighting now.</p>
          <p>Man: Sounds like this guy doesn't know what he was talking about.</p>
          <p>Woman: Definitely not.</p>
          <p>Â </p>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>The student proposes that the university close the coffeehouse because it is usually very empty and the lighting there is very poor. However, the woman disagrees with the student's proposal for the following two reasons. Firstly, she says that only during daytime the coffeehouse is empty because students are busy with their classes, jobs and study but it is pretty full at night when students have time to sit down and relax. Secondly, the lighting in the coffeehouse is as good as it is in the library as they did some renovations recently.</p>
