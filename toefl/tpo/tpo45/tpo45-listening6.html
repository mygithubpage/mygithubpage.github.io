            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.97" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator:Listen to part of a lecture in an <span class="underline">anthropology</span> class.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.79" data-time="3.97">[00:03.97]</span>Professor:OK, today we are go to be moving on and we're going to be talking about early <span class="underline">pottery</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.85" data-time="8.76">[00:08.76]</span>But rather than me just giving you a <span class="underline">broad</span> <span class="underline">overview</span> of how pots or <span class="underline">ceramic</span> vessels were developed and used in different regions of the world, <span class="time" data-times="9.45" data-time="17.61">[00:17.61]</span>we're <span class="underline">gonna</span> <span class="underline">consider</span> a <span class="underline">specific</span> example, a case study. And we're going to <span class="underline">focus</span> on <span class="underline">ceramic</span> cooking vessels from just one part of the world.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9" data-time="27.06">[00:27.06]</span>So the question I want to look at today concerns the use of <span class="underline">ceramic</span> cooking vessels, <span class="underline">clay</span> pots, in the <span class="underline">Arctic</span> during <span class="underline">ancient</span> times. <span class="time" data-times="2.5" data-time="36.06">[00:36.06]</span>Why were they developed and used there?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.04" data-time="38.56">[00:38.56]</span>So, to begin with, we don't know for sure when human beings first started creating <span class="underline">pottery</span>, but we have <span class="underline">evidence</span> of it from over 15,000 years ago. <span class="time" data-times="6.6" data-time="48.6">[00:48.60]</span>And in the <span class="underline">Arctic</span>, <span class="underline">ceramic</span> cooking pots didn't <span class="underline">appear</span> there until some 2,500 years ago.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.1" data-time="55.2">[00:55.20]</span>Now, it's not surprising that they appeared <span class="underline">relatively</span> late there. <span class="time" data-times="6.75" data-time="59.3">[00:59.30]</span>In fact, what's been something of a mystery is why they were used at all, in the <span class="underline">Arctic</span>, I mean. Ken?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.88" data-time="66.05">[01:06.05]</span>Student:Why wouldn't they use <span class="underline">pottery</span>?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.54" data-time="67.93">[01:07.93]</span>Professor:Good question. What would some of the drawbacks of <span class="underline">ceramic</span> containers be for <span class="underline">ancient</span> people groups in the <span class="underline">Arctic</span>? <span class="time" data-times="3.34" data-time="75.47">[01:15.47]</span> <span class="underline">Ancient</span> <span class="underline">Arctic</span> societies were <span class="underline">nomadic</span>, right?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.18" data-time="78.81">[01:18.81]</span>Student:I get it! <span class="underline">Clay</span> pots are <span class="underline">fragile</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.45" data-time="80.99">[01:20.99]</span>So if people were moving around all the time, well, the pots would probably keep breaking.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.63" data-time="86.44">[01:26.44]</span>Professor:Precisely. <span class="underline">Ceramic</span> cooking vessels can't be transported easily. <span class="time" data-times="0.85000000000001" data-time="91.07">[01:31.07]</span>That's one thing.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.95" data-time="91.92">[01:31.92]</span>And think of how ceramics are produced. <span class="time" data-times="2.4" data-time="94.87">[01:34.87]</span>You need water and <span class="underline">clay</span> of <span class="underline">course</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.95" data-time="97.27">[01:37.27]</span>You need to make the pot, allow it to dry for a long time. <span class="time" data-times="6.25" data-time="101.22">[01:41.22]</span>Warm, dry locations work best for this of <span class="underline">course</span>. And then you need to fire it, <span class="underline">bake</span> it. <span class="time" data-times="7.97" data-time="107.47">[01:47.47]</span>So you can see the role that <span class="underline">climate</span> would play in whether or not <span class="underline">ancient</span> people created and used <span class="underline">ceramic</span> cooking pots. <span class="time" data-times="6.79" data-time="115.44">[01:55.44]</span>And that's why manufacturing <span class="underline">pottery</span> would have been a <span class="underline">challenge</span>, actually quite difficult for people in the <span class="underline">Arctic</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.12" data-time="122.23">[02:02.23]</span>Student:But you're saying they did make <span class="underline">ceramic</span> cooking pots.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="11.34" data-time="126.35">[02:06.35]</span>Professor:Yes. So the question is, <span class="underline">given</span> all these <span class="underline">clear</span> disadvantages, why would <span class="underline">Arctic</span> people choose to make and use <span class="underline">ceramic</span> cooking vessels? Sue?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="16.15" data-time="137.69">[02:17.69]</span>Student:I read somewhere that by cooking food in <span class="underline">clay</span> pots, people increase the...um...well, they made food easier to <span class="underline">digest</span>, something about making the nutritional components of foods more <span class="underline">accessible</span>?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.41" data-time="153.84">[02:33.84]</span>Professor:That's <span class="underline">definitely</span> true as far as many nutrients are concerned, but some nutrients, like vitamin C, are destroyed by cooking. <span class="time" data-times="9.61" data-time="162.25">[02:42.25]</span>But the <span class="underline">ancient</span> <span class="underline">Arctic</span> people ate a <span class="underline">diet</span> that consisted almost <span class="underline">entirely</span> of <span class="underline">raw</span> or only minimally cooked meat and fish or <span class="underline">shellfish</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.81" data-time="171.86">[02:51.86]</span>Student:I saw something on television once, a <span class="underline">documentary</span> that talked about how healthy the <span class="underline">diet</span> was, how it provided all of the nutrients they needed.<span class="time" data-times="7.68" data-time="179.67">[02:59.67]</span> I guess that would include vitamin C as well, but then what I don't understand is: why would they have cooked their food at all?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.9" data-time="187.35">[03:07.35]</span>Professor:Ah, here's where we need to look beyond <span class="underline">obvious</span> factors and <span class="underline">consider</span> things like culinary preferences. <span class="time" data-times="7.99" data-time="194.25">[03:14.25]</span>Although the <span class="underline">diet</span> of <span class="underline">ancient</span> <span class="underline">Arctic</span> people mainly consisted of <span class="underline">raw</span> and minimally cooked food, it was carefully prepared.<span class="time" data-times="7.21" data-time="202.24">[03:22.24]</span> It was based on an <span class="underline">interplay</span> of contrasts, um, different temperatures, or hard and <span class="underline">soft</span> textures. <span class="time" data-times="3.29" data-time="209.45">[03:29.45]</span>Sometimes meat was only <span class="underline">partially</span> defrosted.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.96" data-time="212.74">[03:32.74]</span>For example, one way of preparing meat was to boil it <span class="underline">briefly</span>, leaving the center frozen. <span class="time" data-times="8.15" data-time="218.7">[03:38.70]</span>So cooked food, or <span class="underline">partially</span> cooked food, for <span class="underline">ancient</span> <span class="underline">Arctic</span> people, was a matter of social <span class="underline">preference</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.85" data-time="226.85">[03:46.85]</span>So again, the question is - why did they use <span class="underline">ceramic</span> pots to cook their food? <span class="time" data-times="2.4" data-time="232.7">[03:52.70]</span>That's not the only way to cook food. <span class="time" data-times="3.66" data-time="235.1">[03:55.10]</span>And we've already looked at some disadvantages of <span class="underline">ceramic</span> pots.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.46" data-time="238.76">[03:58.76]</span>So why use them?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="11.18" data-time="240.22">[04:00.22]</span>Well, first of all, wood for cooking fires was in short <span class="underline">supply</span>. And because of the <span class="underline">extreme</span> <span class="underline">climate</span>, food had to be prepared inside, indoors most of the year. <span class="time" data-times="5.17" data-time="251.4">[04:11.40]</span> <span class="underline">Therefore</span>, fires had to be small, and cooking methods had to be <span class="underline">efficient</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="256.57">[04:16.57]</span>So in regions of the <span class="underline">Arctic</span> where wood was <span class="underline">scarce</span>, and where the houses could not <span class="underline">withstand</span> large fires and did not have good ventilation, we do find advantages <span class="underline">associated</span> with <span class="underline">ceramic</span> pots.</p>
