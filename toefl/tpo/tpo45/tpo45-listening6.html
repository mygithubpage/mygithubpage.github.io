What would some of the drawbacks of <span class="highlight">ceramic</span> containers be for <span class="highlight">ancient</span> people groups in the <span class="highlight">Arctic</span>? <span class="time" data-times="3.34" data-time="75.47">[01:15.47]</span><span class="highlight">Ancient</span><span class="highlight">Arctic</span> societies were <span class="highlight">nomadic</span>, right?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.18" data-time="78.81">[01:18.81]</span>Student:I get it! <span class="highlight">Clay</span> pots are <span class="highlight">fragile</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.45" data-time="80.99">[01:20.99]</span>So if people were moving around all the time, well, the pots would probably keep breaking.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.63" data-time="86.44">[01:26.44]</span>Professor:Precisely. <span class="highlight">Ceramic</span> cooking vessels can't be transported easily. <span class="time" data-times="0.85000000000001" data-time="91.07">[01:31.07]</span>That's one thing.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.95" data-time="91.92">[01:31.92]</span>And think of how ceramics are produced. <span class="time" data-times="2.4" data-time="94.87">[01:34.87]</span>You need water and <span class="highlight">clay</span> of <span class="highlight">course</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.95" data-time="97.27">[01:37.27]</span>You need to make the pot, allow it to dry for a long time. <span class="time" data-times="6.25" data-time="101.22">[01:41.22]</span>Warm, dry locations work best for this of <span class="highlight">course</span>.

So the question is, <span class="highlight">given</span> all these <span class="highlight">clear</span> disadvantages, why would <span class="highlight">Arctic</span> people choose to make and use <span class="highlight">ceramic</span> cooking vessels?
