Wind <span class="highlight">pollination</span> is often seen as being <span class="highlight">primitive</span> and wasteful in costly <span class="highlight">pollen</span> and yet it is surprisingly <span class="highlight">common</span>, especially in higher latitudes. Wind is very good at moving <span class="highlight">pollen</span> a long way; <span class="highlight">pollen</span> can be blown for hundreds of kilometers, and only birds can get <span class="highlight">pollen</span> anywhere near as far. The <span class="highlight question1">drawback</span> is that wind is <span class="highlight">obviously</span> unspecific as to where it takes the <span class="highlight">pollen</span>. It is like trying to get a letter to a friend at the other end of the village by climbing onto the roof and throwing an armful of letters into the <span class="highlight">air</span> and hoping that one will end up in the friend's garden. For the <span class="highlight">relatively</span> few <span class="highlight">dominant</span> tree <span class="highlight">species</span> that make up <span class="highlight">temperate</span> forests, where there are many individuals of the same <span class="highlight">species</span><span class="highlight">within</span><span class="highlight">pollen</span><span class="highlight">range</span>, this is quite a safe gamble. If a number of people in the village were throwing letters off roofs, your friend would be <span class="highlight">bound</span> to get one. By <span class="highlight">contrast</span>, in the tropics, where each tree <span class="highlight">species</span> has few, widely <span class="highlight">scattered</span> individuals, the <span class="highlight">chance</span> of wind blowing <span class="highlight">pollen</span> to another <span class="highlight">individual</span> is <span class="highlight">sufficiently</span> slim that animals are a safer <span class="highlight">bet</span> as transporters of <span class="highlight">pollen</span>. <span class="highlight">Even</span> tall trees in the tropics are usually not wind pollinated despite being in windy conditions. In a <span class="highlight">similar</span> way, trees in <span class="highlight">temperate</span> forests that are <span class="highlight">insect</span> pollinated <span class="highlight">tend</span> to grow as <span class="highlight">solitary</span>, widely <span class="highlight">spread</span> individuals.</p><p>Since wind-pollinated flowers have no need to <span class="highlight">attract</span> insects or other animals, they have dispensed with bright petals, <span class="highlight">nectar</span>, and <span class="highlight">scent</span>. These are at best a <span class="highlight">waste</span> and at worst an impediment to the <span class="highlight">transfer</span> of <span class="highlight">pollen</span> in the <span class="highlight">air</span>. The result is insignificant-looking flowers and catkins (<span class="highlight question1">dense</span> cylindrical clusters of small, petalless flowers).</p><p>Wind <span class="highlight">pollination</span> does, of <span class="highlight">course</span>, <span class="highlight">require</span> a lot of <span class="highlight">pollen</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>Birch and <span class="highlight">hazel</span> trees can produce 5.5 and 4 million grains per <span class="highlight">catkin</span>, <span class="highlight"><span class="question7">respectively</span></span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>There are various adaptations to help as much of the <span class="highlight">pollen</span> go as far as possible. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>Most <span class="highlight">deciduous</span> wind-pollinated trees (which <span class="highlight">shed</span> their leaves every fall) produce their <span class="highlight">pollen</span> in the <span class="highlight">spring</span> while the branches are <span class="highlight">bare</span> of leaves to reduce the surrounding surfaces that "compete" with the stigmas (the part of the flower that receives the <span class="highlight">pollen</span>) for <span class="highlight">pollen</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span><span class="highlight">Evergreen</span> conifers, which do not <span class="highlight">shed</span> their leaves, have less to gain from <span class="highlight">spring</span> flowering, and, indeed, some flower in the autumn or winter.</p><p><span class="highlight">Pollen</span> produced higher in the top branches is likely to go farther: it is windier (and gustier) and the <span class="highlight">pollen</span> can be blown farther before hitting the ground. Moreover, <span class="highlight">dangling</span> catkins like <span class="highlight">hazel</span> hold the <span class="highlight">pollen</span> in until the wind is strong enough to bend them, ensuring that <span class="highlight">pollen</span> is only <span class="highlight">shed</span> into the <span class="highlight">air</span> when the wind is blowing hard.Weather is also important. <span class="highlight">Pollen</span> is <span class="highlight">shed</span><span class="highlight">primarily</span> when the <span class="highlight">air</span> is dry to prevent too much sticking to wet surfaces or being knocked out of the <span class="highlight">air</span> by rain. Despite these adaptations, much of the <span class="highlight">pollen</span> fails to leave the top branches, and only between 0.5 percent and 40 percent gets more than 100 meters away from the parent. But once this far, <span class="highlight"><span class="question10">significant</span></span> quantities can go a kilometer or more. Indeed, <span class="highlight">pollen</span> can travel many thousands of kilometers at high altitudes. Since all this <span class="highlight">pollen</span> is floating around in the <span class="highlight">air</span>, it is <span class="question11">no <span class="highlight">wonder</span></span> that wind-pollinated trees are a <span class="highlight">major</span><span class="highlight">source</span> of allergies.</p><p>Once the <span class="highlight">pollen</span> has been snatched by the wind, the fate of the <span class="highlight">pollen</span> is <span class="highlight">obviously</span> up to the vagaries of the wind, but not everything is left to <span class="highlight">chance</span>. <span class="highlight">Windborne</span><span class="highlight">pollen</span> is dry, rounded, smooth, and generally smaller than that of insect-pollinated plants. But size is a two-edged sword. <span class="question12">Small grains may be blown farther but they are also more <span class="highlight">prone</span> to be whisked past the waiting <span class="highlight">stigma</span> because smaller particles <span class="highlight">tend</span> to stay trapped in the fast-moving <span class="highlight">air</span> that flows around the <span class="highlight">stigma</span>.</span> But stigmas create <span class="highlight">turbulence</span>, which slows the <span class="highlight">air</span> speed around them and may help <span class="highlight">pollen</span><span class="highlight">stick</span> to them.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">drawback</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. other side of the issue</p><p>B. objection</p><p>C. concern</p><p>D. problem</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>Disadvantage: disadvantageous conditions. The meaning in context is "adverse conditions." The problem of the D option means "problem, problem". It is consistent with the meaning of drawback here. Therefore, it is the correct answer. Another side of the issue of the other side. Objection objection, objection. Concern concern</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the following can be inferred from paragraph 1 about pollen production?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Pollen production requires a significant investment of energy and resources on the part of the plant.</p><p>B. The capacity to produce pollen in large quantities is a recent development in the evolutionary history of plants.</p><p>C. Plants in the tropics generally produce more pollen than those in temperate zones.</p><p>D. The highest levels of pollen production are found in plants that depend on insects or birds to carry their pollen.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>According to the original text of wind is good at moving pollen a long way, it can be inferred that pollen production requires energy. According to Pollen,.... is usually carried from plant to plant... It can be seen that pollen production requires a resource. Therefore, the A option is correct.</p><p>The statement of option B comes from nothing.</p><p>The comparison of C options cannot be found in the original text.</p><p>The D option is also groundless in the claim that high levels of pollen production are transmitted.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 1, wind-pollinated trees are most likely to be found</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. in temperate forests</p><p>B. at lower latitudes</p><p>C. in the tropics</p><p>D. surrounded by trees of many different species</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>According to the original For the relative few... temperate forests... this is quite a safe gamble. This in this sentence is known as "wind propagation", so wind-pollinated trees are likely to be found in the temperate forests.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Paragraph 1 supports which of the following as the reason animals are a safer bet than wind as pollinators when the individual trees of a species are widely separated?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Animals tend to carry pollen from a given flower further than the wind does.</p><p>B. Animals serve as pollinators even where there is little wind to disperse the pollen.</p><p>C. An animal that visits a flower is likely to deliberately visit other flowers of the same species and pollinate them.</p><p>D. Birds and insects fly in all directions, not just the direction the wind is blowing at a given moment.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The C option means that the animals that visit a flower type are likely to patronize and pollinate another flower of the same flower. This can constitute one of the reasons for the establishment of the point of view.</p><p>There is no basis for the further argument of the A option.</p><p>The B option does not indicate the reason for the dry safer.</p><p>The D option fly in all directions comes out of nothing.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>In paragraph 1, the author compares pollen moved by wind with letters thrown off roofs in order to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. explain why there are relatively few species of trees that depend on wind pollination</p><p>B. compare natural, biological processes with human social practices</p><p>C. make a point about the probability of wind-blown pollen reaching a tree of the same species</p><p>D. argue against the common assumption that the tallest trees are the most likely to employ wind pollination</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The example of the original It is like trying to get a letter.... is followed by Wind is very good at moving pollen a long... and only birds can get pollen anywhere near as far. That is, wind propagation is likely to give pollen to the same species. Therefore, the C option is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>Paragraph 2 suggests that wind-pollinated plants do not have bright petals, nectar, and scent for which TWO of the following reasons? To receive credit, you must select TWO answers.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They interfere with pollination by wind.</p><p>B. They are easily damaged by wind.</p><p>C. They are unnecessary.</p><p>D. They reduce the amount of pollen that can be produced</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="AC"><p>A option of interfere with corresponding impediment in the original text. The unnecessary of the C option corresponds to the original's insignificant-looking.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question7">respectively</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. over time</p><p>B. separately</p><p>C. in that order</p><p>D. consistently</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>Fully meant "<span class="question7">respectively</span>," and the B option separately means "separately" and separate is a synonym, so B is the correct choice.</p><p>Over time In that order in that order. Consistently consistently and consistently.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 3, why do most deciduous wind-pollinated trees produce their pollen in the spring?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To avoid competing with evergreen conifers, which flower in the fall or winter</p><p>B. So that the leaves of the trees receiving the pollen will not prevent the pollen from reaching the trees' stigmas</p><p>C. Because they do not have enough energy to produce new leaves and pollen at the same time</p><p>D. In order to take advantage of the windiest time of year</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Locate the original Most deciduous wind-pollinated. . .

Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Because smaller particles tend to stay trapped in the fast moving air, they are blown much farther than other grains.</p><p>B. Smaller particles are trapped by the stigma when fast-moving air flows past it.</p><p>C. Small particles that are whisked past the waiting stigma gain speed and are often trapped in the fast-moving air.</p><p>D.
