          <h4 class="w3-center">Wind Pollination</h4>
          <p>
            <span class="highlight">Pollen</span>, a <span class="highlight">powdery</span> <span class="highlight">substance</span>, which is produced by flowering plants and contains <span class="highlight">male</span> <span class="highlight">reproductive</span> cells, is usually carried from plant to plant by insects or birds, but some plants <span class="highlight">rely</span> on the wind to carry their <span class="highlight">pollen</span>. Wind <span class="highlight">pollination</span> is often seen as being <span class="highlight">primitive</span> and wasteful in costly <span class="highlight">pollen</span> and yet it is surprisingly <span class="highlight">common</span>, especially in higher latitudes. Wind is very good at moving <span class="highlight">pollen</span> a long way; <span class="highlight">pollen</span> can be blown for hundreds of kilometers, and only birds can get <span class="highlight">pollen</span> anywhere near as far. The <span class="highlight question1">drawback</span> is that wind is <span class="highlight">obviously</span> unspecific as to where it takes the <span class="highlight">pollen</span>. It is like trying to get a letter to a friend at the other end of the village by climbing onto the roof and throwing an armful of letters into the <span class="highlight">air</span> and hoping that one will end up in the friend's garden. For the <span class="highlight">relatively</span> few <span class="highlight">dominant</span> tree <span class="highlight">species</span> that make up <span class="highlight">temperate</span> forests, where there are many individuals of the same <span class="highlight">species</span> <span class="highlight">within</span> <span class="highlight">pollen</span> <span class="highlight">range</span>, this is quite a safe gamble. If a number of people in the village were throwing letters off roofs, your friend would be <span class="highlight">bound</span> to get one. By <span class="highlight">contrast</span>, in the tropics, where each tree <span class="highlight">species</span> has few, widely <span class="highlight">scattered</span> individuals, the <span class="highlight">chance</span> of wind blowing <span class="highlight">pollen</span> to another <span class="highlight">individual</span> is <span class="highlight">sufficiently</span> slim that animals are a safer <span class="highlight">bet</span> as transporters of <span class="highlight">pollen</span>. <span class="highlight">Even</span> tall trees in the tropics are usually not wind pollinated despite being in windy conditions. In a <span class="highlight">similar</span> way, trees in <span class="highlight">temperate</span> forests that are <span class="highlight">insect</span> pollinated <span class="highlight">tend</span> to grow as <span class="highlight">solitary</span>, widely <span class="highlight">spread</span> individuals.</p>
          <p>Since wind-pollinated flowers have no need to <span class="highlight">attract</span> insects or other animals, they have dispensed with bright petals, <span class="highlight">nectar</span>, and <span class="highlight">scent</span>. These are at best a <span class="highlight">waste</span> and at worst an impediment to the <span class="highlight">transfer</span> of <span class="highlight">pollen</span> in the <span class="highlight">air</span>. The result is insignificant-looking flowers and catkins (<span class="highlight question1">dense</span> cylindrical clusters of small, petalless flowers).</p>
          <p>Wind <span class="highlight">pollination</span> does, of <span class="highlight">course</span>, <span class="highlight">require</span> a lot of <span class="highlight">pollen</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>Birch and <span class="highlight">hazel</span> trees can produce 5.5 and 4 million grains per <span class="highlight">catkin</span>, <span class="highlight"><span class="question7">respectively</span></span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>There are various adaptations to help as much of the <span class="highlight">pollen</span> go as far as possible. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>Most <span class="highlight">deciduous</span> wind-pollinated trees (which <span class="highlight">shed</span> their leaves every fall) produce their <span class="highlight">pollen</span> in the <span class="highlight">spring</span> while the branches are <span class="highlight">bare</span> of leaves to reduce the surrounding surfaces that "compete" with the stigmas (the part of the flower that receives the <span class="highlight">pollen</span>) for <span class="highlight">pollen</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span> <span class="highlight">Evergreen</span> conifers, which do not <span class="highlight">shed</span> their leaves, have less to gain from <span class="highlight">spring</span> flowering, and, indeed, some flower in the autumn or winter.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="highlight">Pollen</span> produced higher in the top branches is likely to go farther: it is windier (and gustier) and the <span class="highlight">pollen</span> can be blown farther before hitting the ground. Moreover, <span class="highlight">dangling</span> catkins like <span class="highlight">hazel</span> hold the <span class="highlight">pollen</span> in until the wind is strong enough to bend them, ensuring that <span class="highlight">pollen</span> is only <span class="highlight">shed</span> into the <span class="highlight">air</span> when the wind is blowing hard.Weather is also important. <span class="highlight">Pollen</span> is <span class="highlight">shed</span> <span class="highlight">primarily</span> when the <span class="highlight">air</span> is dry to prevent too much sticking to wet surfaces or being knocked out of the <span class="highlight">air</span> by rain. Despite these adaptations, much of the <span class="highlight">pollen</span> fails to leave the top branches, and only between 0.5 percent and 40 percent gets more than 100 meters away from the parent. But once this far, <span class="highlight"><span class="question10">significant</span></span> quantities can go a kilometer or more. Indeed, <span class="highlight">pollen</span> can travel many thousands of kilometers at high altitudes. Since all this <span class="highlight">pollen</span> is floating around in the <span class="highlight">air</span>, it is <span class="question11">no <span class="highlight">wonder</span></span> that wind-pollinated trees are a <span class="highlight">major</span> <span class="highlight">source</span> of allergies.</p>
          <p>Once the <span class="highlight">pollen</span> has been snatched by the wind, the fate of the <span class="highlight">pollen</span> is <span class="highlight">obviously</span> up to the vagaries of the wind, but not everything is left to <span class="highlight">chance</span>. <span class="highlight">Windborne</span> <span class="highlight">pollen</span> is dry, rounded, smooth, and generally smaller than that of insect-pollinated plants. But size is a two-edged sword. <span class="question12">Small grains may be blown farther but they are also more <span class="highlight">prone</span> to be whisked past the waiting <span class="highlight">stigma</span> because smaller particles <span class="highlight">tend</span> to stay trapped in the fast-moving <span class="highlight">air</span> that flows around the <span class="highlight">stigma</span>.</span> But stigmas create <span class="highlight">turbulence</span>, which slows the <span class="highlight">air</span> speed around them and may help <span class="highlight">pollen</span> <span class="highlight">stick</span> to them.</p>
