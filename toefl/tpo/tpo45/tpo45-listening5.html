            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.75" data-time="3.81">[00:03.81]</span>Professor:So just to <span class="underline">sum</span> up, matter is anything that has <span class="underline">mass</span> and <span class="underline">volume</span>, right? <span class="time" data-times="1.96" data-time="9.56">[00:09.56]</span>Anything that takes up <span class="underline">space</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.93" data-time="11.52">[00:11.52]</span>And this includes solids, liquids and gases. <span class="time" data-times="4.85" data-time="14.45">[00:14.45]</span>And if we <span class="underline">combine</span> two portions of matter, we get a mixture.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.59" data-time="19.3">[00:19.30]</span>Now, there are two main kinds of mixtures: <span class="underline">homogeneous</span> and heterogeneous. <span class="time" data-times="2.66" data-time="24.89">[00:24.89]</span>Maybe I should put this on the <span class="underline">board</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.15" data-time="27.55">[00:27.55]</span>Whether a mixture is <span class="underline">homogeneous</span> or heterogeneous...well...this relates to the <span class="underline">notion</span> of <span class="underline">phase</span>. <span class="time" data-times="12.03" data-time="34.7">[00:34.70]</span>Remember we defined the word '<span class="underline">phase</span>' as being one <span class="underline">physical</span> <span class="underline">state</span>, whether <span class="underline">solid</span>, <span class="underline">liquid</span> or gas, that...well...that has <span class="underline">distinct</span> boundaries and <span class="underline">uniform</span> properties.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.14" data-time="46.73">[00:46.73]</span>So <span class="underline">homogeneous</span> mixtures...What are they?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.6" data-time="49.87">[00:49.87]</span>Okay. The prefix 'homo-' means 'same'. <span class="time" data-times="3.71" data-time="53.47">[00:53.47]</span>So a <span class="underline">homogeneous</span> mixture is the same <span class="underline">throughout</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.41" data-time="57.18">[00:57.18]</span>It contains only one <span class="underline">phase</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.65" data-time="59.59">[00:59.59]</span>So if you put <span class="underline">alcohol</span> in water, the two liquids <span class="underline">combine</span>. <span class="time" data-times="1.93" data-time="64.24">[01:04.24]</span>They <span class="underline">disperse</span> into each other. <span class="time" data-times="3.81" data-time="66.17">[01:06.17]</span>And you can't <span class="underline">perceive</span> any <span class="underline">boundary</span> between the two any longer. <span class="time" data-times="3.34" data-time="69.98">[01:09.98]</span>So the mixture contains only one <span class="underline">phase</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9.46" data-time="73.32">[01:13.32]</span> <span class="underline">Even</span> though two phases went into it, it now contains one <span class="underline">phase</span> and we can't <span class="underline">detect</span> any <span class="underline">boundary</span> between the water and the <span class="underline">alcohol</span> once they're mixed together. <span class="time" data-times="3.4" data-time="82.78">[01:22.78]</span>The two portions combined form a single <span class="underline">phase</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.19" data-time="86.18">[01:26.18]</span>Now, if <span class="underline">homogeneous</span> mixtures are ones that are the same <span class="underline">throughout</span>, then what do you <span class="underline">suppose</span> heterogeneous mixtures are? <span class="time" data-times="3.35" data-time="95.37">[01:35.37]</span>Right. Mixtures that are different <span class="underline">throughout</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.86" data-time="98.72">[01:38.72]</span>If you mix oil and water together, the mixture contains two <span class="underline">liquid</span> phases because the oil will <span class="underline">float</span> on top of the water because of the oil's <span class="underline">lower</span> <span class="underline">density</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.45" data-time="109.58">[01:49.58]</span>They are not going to mix together like <span class="underline">alcohol</span> and water do. <span class="time" data-times="5.07" data-time="113.03">[01:53.03]</span>You can see the <span class="underline">boundary</span> between them and in fact, they are mechanically separable.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.96" data-time="118.1">[01:58.10]</span>The same is true for soil, which is a mixture of <span class="underline">solid</span> materials. <span class="time" data-times="8.62" data-time="123.06">[02:03.06]</span>So if you look closely at a <span class="underline">sample</span> of soil, you are going to see bits of sand, some black matter, maybe <span class="underline">even</span> pieces of <span class="underline">vegetation</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.42" data-time="131.68">[02:11.68]</span>Since you can see all the different components, <span class="underline">detect</span> <span class="underline">distinct</span> boundaries, we've got <span class="underline">multiple</span> phases. <span class="time" data-times="2.61" data-time="139.1">[02:19.10]</span>And in fact, you can pick out the components. <span class="time" data-times="2.93" data-time="141.71">[02:21.71]</span>The various portions can be mechanically separated.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.63" data-time="144.64">[02:24.64]</span>Now, with some heterogeneous mixtures, you can see the different phases with the <span class="underline">naked</span> eye.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.4" data-time="151.27">[02:31.27]</span>But that's not so for all of them, like smoke. <span class="time" data-times="5.59" data-time="154.67">[02:34.67]</span>Actually, that's a good example because to the <span class="underline">naked</span> eye it looks <span class="underline">uniform</span>, like it's a single <span class="underline">phase</span>.<span class="time" data-times="6.74" data-time="160.26">[02:40.26]</span> But if you <span class="underline">magnify</span> it, you can see that there are tiny <span class="underline">solid</span> and <span class="underline">liquid</span> particles <span class="underline">suspended</span> in the <span class="underline">air</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9.88" data-time="167">[02:47.00]</span>So actually what you got in smoke are three phases: <span class="underline">solid</span>, <span class="underline">liquid</span>, and gas, which you can <span class="underline">separate</span> by a <span class="underline">process</span> of filtration.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.75" data-time="176.88">[02:56.88]</span>Another example, uh, dirty water. Okay?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.6" data-time="181.63">[03:01.63]</span>Dirty water is water that has <span class="underline">suspended</span> <span class="underline">solid</span> matter in it. <span class="time" data-times="1.52" data-time="186.23">[03:06.23]</span>That can be filtered too. <span class="time" data-times="5.69" data-time="187.75">[03:07.75]</span>Pass it <span class="underline">through</span> a <span class="underline">filter</span> and the dirt and whatever else is in there will stay behind in the <span class="underline">filter</span> paper. <span class="time" data-times="2.19" data-time="193.44">[03:13.44]</span>And the clean water will pass <span class="underline">through</span> it. <span class="time" data-times="5.69" data-time="195.63">[03:15.63]</span>Again, depending on the size of the particles in the water, you might need magnification to see them. <span class="time" data-times="2.3" data-time="201.32">[03:21.32]</span>But <span class="underline">even</span> so, they can be detected. <span class="time" data-times="1.73" data-time="203.62">[03:23.62]</span>The boundaries are <span class="underline">detectable</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.44" data-time="205.35">[03:25.35]</span>So <span class="underline">multiple</span> phases, okay?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.95" data-time="207.79">[03:27.79]</span>
              <span class="underline">Homogeneous</span> mixtures, on the other hand, well, no <span class="underline">amount</span> of magnification could <span class="underline">reveal</span> a <span class="underline">detectable</span> <span class="underline">boundary</span> between the components. <span class="time" data-times="4.71" data-time="215.74">[03:35.74]</span>Their mixing extends all the way to the <span class="underline">fundamental</span> <span class="underline">particle</span> <span class="underline">level</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.21" data-time="220.45">[03:40.45]</span>And we use the <span class="underline">term</span> '<span class="underline">solution</span>' to <span class="underline">refer</span> to the single <span class="underline">phase</span>, <span class="underline">homogeneous</span> mixtures.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.64" data-time="226.66">[03:46.66]</span>When salts <span class="underline">dissolve</span> in water, no <span class="underline">amount</span> of magnification is going to show you <span class="underline">separate</span> pieces of salt. <span class="time" data-times="3.34" data-time="233.3">[03:53.30]</span>There are no <span class="underline">detectable</span> boundaries between salt and water. <span class="time" data-times="1.88" data-time="236.64">[03:56.64]</span>So it's a <span class="underline">solution</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.37" data-time="238.52">[03:58.52]</span>
              <span class="underline">Even</span> so, what you can do with solutions is <span class="underline">separate</span> the parts by a <span class="underline">process</span> called distillation. <span class="time" data-times="7.26" data-time="245.89">[04:05.89]</span>If you <span class="underline">distill</span> salt water, water gets boiled away from the <span class="underline">solution</span> and only the salt remains behind. <span class="time" data-times="9.67" data-time="253.15">[04:13.15]</span>And in your next lab actually, we'll be using these processes, distillation and filtration, to show how we can <span class="underline">separate</span> the different parts of some mixtures.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.86" data-time="262.82">[04:22.82]</span>Now, there are other ways we can <span class="underline">describe</span> mixtures. <span class="time" data-times="4.03" data-time="266.68">[04:26.68]</span>And one of these is by properties, uh, <span class="underline">variable</span> properties.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.06" data-time="270.71">[04:30.71]</span>A real simple example of this is the <span class="underline">taste</span> and color of a cup of coffee. <span class="time" data-times="8.52" data-time="275.77">[04:35.77]</span>The more coffee that's dissolved in the water, the stronger the <span class="underline">taste</span> of the coffee, and the darker the color, the darker the <span class="underline">solution</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.39" data-time="284.29">[04:44.29]</span>So, color and <span class="underline">taste</span>, these are two <span class="underline">variable</span> properties. <span class="time" data-times="10.4" data-time="288.68">[04:48.68]</span>And these <span class="underline">variable</span> properties, they <span class="underline">vary</span> of <span class="underline">course</span>, because of the <span class="underline">relative</span> amounts of the components, and the <span class="underline">melting</span> or freezing points of liquids too. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="299.08">[04:59.08]</span>A <span class="underline">solution</span> of salt water, for example, will have a different freezing point depending on how much salt is dissolved in the water.</p>
