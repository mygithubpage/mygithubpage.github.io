        <h3>Listening Text</h3>
        <article>
          <p>Listen to a conversation between two students.</p>
          <p>Man:Hey. Sarah. How is it going?</p>
          <p>Woman:Not great. It's the student film I've been directing. You know, that project I've been working on for my film class?</p>
          <p>Man:Right. You said you were directing a film. So what's wrong?</p>
          <p>Woman:Well, the project is due in two days. We were supposed to film a final scene today, but it's raining. The scene is supposed to be set outside, with two characters talking in the park on a beautiful sunny day.</p>
          <p>Man:Oh no! What are you going to do?</p>
          <p>Woman:Well, I could rewrite the scene I guess, I could revise it so it takes place inside a building instead, maybe here in the student center somewhere.</p>
          <p>Man:Why don't you do that?</p>
          <p>Woman:I could, but I'm happy with the scene as it's written now. The film has an optimistic happy ending. That's why I wanted the last scene of the movie to be outside on a bright sunny day, because it sets a positive mood.</p>
          <p>Man:Oh...l see. Well, the weather is supposed to be better tomorrow, sunny and warm. Why don't you film that scene tomorrow instead?</p>
          <p>Woman:Thought of that too. But since the project is due the day after tomorrow, I was planning on using tomorrow to review the film and do any final ending, and...you know, all the last-minute details.</p>
          <p>Man:That's true. There wouldn't be much time for that.</p>
          <p>Woman:Yeah. Filming tomorrow might mean turning in a project to my professor that's not as polished, not as good as I'd like it to be.</p>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>The woman is directing a film project which is due in two days. She is supposed to film a scene today but it is raining. In the conversation, they talk about two solutions. The first solution is that she rewrites the scene, but she is happy with the scene as it's written now because it sets a positive mood. The second solution is that she films it tomorrow, when the weather is better. But she is just planning on using tomorrow to review the film and do any final ending. Well, I would recommend her to choose the second solution. She can tell her professor about the situation and ask for an extension, in this way, she can not only still use the scene that has been written but also have enough time to make the project polished.</p>
