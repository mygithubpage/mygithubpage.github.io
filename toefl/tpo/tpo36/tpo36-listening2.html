The role of fossil fuels as an energy source in the future.</p><p>B. Reasons for research into alternative energy sources.</p><p>C. The feasibility of using a potential energy source.</p><p>D. Causes of probable future energy problems.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The title of this question is: Now last week when we discussed the serious energy challenges we are going to face as the world's population continues to grow and we place more stress on our finite supply of fossil fuels, especially natural gas and oil, well, maybe It's not all doom and gloom. In a number of areas, scientists are thinking outside the box and trying to come up with unusual, novel solutions to the energy question. Not that a positive outcome is easy by any means, but well, let's take a look at one of these creative ideas involving a gas - helium-3. Through the professor's remark, we learned that they are talking about energy issues and mentioned that recently scientists have discovered a new kind of unusual energy that can come To solve the energy problem, it is a type of hydrogen-hydrogen-3. The meaning of Option C is mainly about the possibility of a potential source of energy, correct. The remaining three options do not meet the lecture. Select C.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor mention that the Moon lacks a magnetic field?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To point out the danger inherent in mining for helium-3 on the Moon.</p><p>B. To point out a flaw in the theory that helium-3 can be found on the Moon's surface.</p><p>C. To explain why it was difficult for astronauts to detect helium-3 on the Moon.</p><p>D. To explain why it is likely that there are large amounts of helium-3 on the Moon.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The question title is: Since the moon doesn't have a magnetic field, the solar wind must have been depositing helium-3 there for billions of years. This sentence is combined with the context that it is not easy to store hydrogen 3 on the earth because the solar wind Can't scrape on Earth. But the moon is different. The moon has no magnetic field. It has a lot of hydrogen on its area. Option D is consistent with the question. The other three options are not suitable. Select D.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor, what potential advantages does helium-3 have as an energy source? Click on 2 answers</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. A relatively small amount of it may provide very large amounts of energy.</p><p>B. It is less likely to cause environmental problems than other energy sources are.</p><p>C. It can be used in both nuclear fusion and nuclear fission reactors</p><p>D. The infrastructure required for it to be used as a fuel source is not complex.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="AB"><p>The question title is: And one ton is more than enough energy for a city often million people for a whole year. And Researchers have identified two isotopes of hydrogen as the most promising fuel sources for fusion power plants. However, there is a real The drawback. They both produce large amounts of radioactive material in the fusion reaction. But helium-3 fusion produces no radioactive material. In fact, one proponent stated you could safely build a helium-3 power plant in the middle of a city. The sentence tells us that a ton of hydrogen 3 can be used for a million people in a city for a full year. The second sentence tells us that other nuclear fusion facilities will release radioactive pollution while supplying energy, but hydrogen 3 does not, and as energy, it is cleaner. These two sentences correspond to Option A and Option B respectively. The other two options are not based on the original text. Double-select AB.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the professor's opinion of the potential of helium-3 as an energy source?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Mining helium-3 on the Moon will eventually be easy</p><p>B. Continuing to extract helium-3 from the Moon is not worthwhile.</p><p>C. Helium-3 will probably be a significant energy source within a few years.</p><p>D. Using helium-3 on a large scale will not be practical until nuclear fusion reactors are built.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The problem is that one often heard joke about fusion is that a nuclear fusion plant has been just decades away from being created Decades now. Nuclear fusion research is still ongoing, as strong as ever, in fact, but we still don't have a full-scale fusion plant to point to. To know that the problem has emerged, the general idea is that despite decades of research, we have not created a nuclear fusion reaction plant. There is a well-known joke that in just a few decades we can create nuclear fusion factories. The research on nuclear fusion continues and we continue to work hard. But now we cannot create a full-scale factory. Therefore, if we want to use hydrogen 3 energy, we must wait for nuclear fusion technology to mature. Option D meets the meaning of this paragraph. There is no basis for the original three options. Select D.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor mention digging a crater to find gold?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To explain why many scientists are interested in new missions to the Moon.</p><p>B. To explain why helium-3 is more common on Earth than helium-3.</p><p>C. To explain why extracting helium-3 from lunar soil may not be practical.</p><p>D. To explain why scientists have looked for helium-3 in unusual places.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The question is: How to get the helium 3 off the moon? Digging the stuff up is challenging because the distribution of helium-3 is so diffused across the lunar surface. One estimate is you'd need to heat a million tons of Lunar soil to about 800 degree Celsius to yield about 70 tons of helium-3 gas. It's kind of liking digging out a crater with a spoon to find the single nugget of gold Kind of ridiculous, right? How to extract hydrogen 3 from the moon, and then say that this material is distributed on the moon, there is a kind of idea is to rely on heating millions of tons of lunar soil to get 70 tons of hydrogen 3 gas. It is similar to picking a gold spoon in the crater. Explain that this method is not feasible. Option C is consistent with the question. There is no basis for the original three options. Select C.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor mean when he says this:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Scientists are skeptical about the likelihood of a nuclear fusion plant being built.</p><p>B. Scientists are aware that a nuclear fusion plant is about to be built.</p><p>C. Scientists have been reluctant to support the building of a nuclear fusion plant.</p><p>D. Scientists only started believing in the possibility of nuclear fusion in recent years.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The problem is that one often heard joke about fusion is that a nuclear fusion plant has been just decades away from being created Decades now. Nuclear fusion research is still ongoing, as strong as ever, in fact, but we still don't have a full-scale fusion plant to point to. Create a nuclear fusion reaction plant. There is a well-known joke that in just a few decades we can create nuclear fusion factories. The research on nuclear fusion continues and we continue to work hard. But now we cannot create a full-scale factory. The hard part is a joke. The contrast between just and several decades is a joke. This joke was created by scientists for a short time to study a nuclear fusion factory. Option A fits the question. There is no basis for the original three options. Select A.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
