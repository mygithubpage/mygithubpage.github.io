              <span class="time" data-times="4.96" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in an <span class="underline">environmental</span> science class. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="17.17" data-time="4.96">[00:04.96]</span>Professor: Now last week when we discussed the serious energy challenges we are going to face as the world's <span class="underline">population</span> continues to grow and we place more <span class="underline">stress</span> on our <span class="underline">finite</span> <span class="underline">supply</span> of <span class="underline">fossil</span> fuels, especially natural gas and oil, well, maybe it's not all doom and gloom. <span class="time" data-times="8.3" data-time="22.13">[00:22.13]</span>In a number of areas, scientists are thinking outside the box and trying to come up with unusual, <span class="underline">novel</span> solutions to the energy question. <span class="time" data-times="10.4" data-time="30.43">[00:30.43]</span>Not that a <span class="underline">positive</span> <span class="underline">outcome</span> is <span class="underline">inevitable</span> by any means, but well, let's take a look at one of these <span class="underline">creative</span> ideas involving a gas - helium-3. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.74" data-time="40.83">[00:40.83]</span>Helium-3 is an <span class="underline">isotope</span> of <span class="underline">helium</span> that has <span class="underline">tremendous</span> <span class="underline">potential</span> for use in <span class="underline">practical</span> energy applications. <span class="time" data-times="10.24" data-time="47.57">[00:47.57]</span>Remember, an <span class="underline">isotope</span> is a form of a chemical <span class="underline">element</span> that has the same number of protons in its <span class="underline">atomic</span> <span class="underline">nucleus</span> but a different number of neutrons. <span class="time" data-times="8.2" data-time="57.81">[00:57.81]</span>The most <span class="underline">common</span> <span class="underline">isotope</span> of <span class="underline">helium</span> on Earth is helium-4, which does not have any known or <span class="underline">potential</span> uses as an energy <span class="underline">source</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.98" data-time="66.01">[01:06.01]</span>Helium-3, in <span class="underline">comparison</span>, is extremely <span class="underline">rare</span>. <span class="time" data-times="1.98" data-time="68.99">[01:08.99]</span>There isn't very much of it on Earth. <span class="time" data-times="10.56" data-time="70.97">[01:10.97]</span>Plus, the, um, the main <span class="underline">source</span> of helium-3 in our <span class="underline">solar</span> system is <span class="underline">solar</span> wind, a <span class="underline">stream</span> of <span class="underline">lethal</span> <span class="underline">radiation</span> and particles pouring off of sun. <span class="time" data-times="4.13" data-time="81.53">[01:21.53]</span>And Earth's <span class="underline">magnetic</span> <span class="underline">field</span> fortunately prevents that wind from reaching us. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.29" data-time="85.66">[01:25.66]</span>So why is helium-3 so <span class="underline">exciting</span>? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.21" data-time="88.95">[01:28.95]</span>Well, it seems a sure <span class="underline">bet</span> that helium-3 is <span class="underline">available</span> in <span class="underline">abundant</span> quantities on the moon. <span class="time" data-times="7" data-time="96.16">[01:36.16]</span>Since the moon doesn't have a <span class="underline">magnetic</span> <span class="underline">field</span>, the <span class="underline">solar</span> wind must have been depositing helium-3 there for billions of years. <span class="time" data-times="3.5" data-time="103.16">[01:43.16]</span>In fact, Apollo astronauts have already discovered it in the moon's dust. <span class="time" data-times="5.85" data-time="106.66">[01:46.66]</span>Some estimates hold that there may be a million tons of helium-3 buried on the <span class="underline">lunar</span> surface. <span class="time" data-times="5.28" data-time="112.51">[01:52.51]</span>And one ton is more than enough energy for a city of ten million people for a whole year. <span class="time" data-times="4.49" data-time="117.79">[01:57.79]</span>So you can see this would certainly solve most of our energy problems. <span class="time" data-times="2.14" data-time="122.28">[02:02.28]</span>But how could this be possible? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.85" data-time="124.42">[02:04.42]</span>Well, we think helium-3 would have to be used in nuclear <span class="underline">fusion</span> reactors. <span class="time" data-times="6.43" data-time="130.27">[02:10.27]</span>Keep in <span class="underline">mind</span> that a nuclear <span class="underline">fusion</span> <span class="underline">reactor</span> is completely different from our existing nuclear <span class="underline">fission</span> reactors. <span class="time" data-times="7" data-time="136.7">[02:16.70]</span>Basically a nuclear plant powered by nuclear <span class="underline">fission</span> derives its energy from the splitting of atoms. <span class="time" data-times="6.79" data-time="143.7">[02:23.70]</span>While a plant based on nuclear <span class="underline">fusion</span> utilizes the energy produced when atoms are fused together. <span class="time" data-times="6.9" data-time="150.49">[02:30.49]</span> <span class="underline">Fusion</span> is the same nuclear <span class="underline">reaction</span> that fuels stars, which as you know, produces unfathomable amounts of energy. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.79" data-time="157.39">[02:37.39]</span>Researchers have identified two isotopes of <span class="underline">hydrogen</span> as the most <span class="underline">promising</span> <span class="underline">fuel</span> sources for <span class="underline">fusion</span> power plants. <span class="time" data-times="2.4" data-time="164.18">[02:44.18]</span>However, there is a real <span class="underline">drawback</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.5" data-time="166.58">[02:46.58]</span>They both produce large amounts of <span class="underline">radioactive</span> <span class="underline">material</span> in the <span class="underline">fusion</span> <span class="underline">reaction</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.44" data-time="171.08">[02:51.08]</span>But helium-3 <span class="underline">fusion</span> produces no <span class="underline">radioactive</span> <span class="underline">material</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.48" data-time="175.52">[02:55.52]</span>In fact, one <span class="underline">proponent</span> stated you could safely build a helium-3 power plant in the middle of a city. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.44" data-time="182">[03:02.00]</span>A clean, safe <span class="underline">source</span> of power almost sounds too good to be true, doesn't it? <span class="time" data-times="2.61" data-time="186.44">[03:06.44]</span>Well, of <span class="underline">course</span>, this is all very <span class="underline">theoretical</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.25" data-time="189.05">[03:09.05]</span>And there are issues that have to be addressed. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.42" data-time="191.3">[03:11.30]</span>For one thing, we still haven't created a single nuclear <span class="underline">fusion</span> plant despite decades of research and <span class="underline">development</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9.14" data-time="197.72">[03:17.72]</span>An often heard joke about <span class="underline">fusion</span> is that a nuclear <span class="underline">fusion</span> plant has been just decades away from being created for several decades now. <span class="time" data-times="8.1" data-time="206.86">[03:26.86]</span>Nuclear <span class="underline">fusion</span> research is still <span class="underline">ongoing</span>, as strong as ever, in fact, but we still don't have a full- <span class="underline">scale</span> <span class="underline">fusion</span> plant to point to. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.45" data-time="214.96">[03:34.96]</span>And there's a rather big logistical problem as well. <span class="time" data-times="2.56" data-time="218.41">[03:38.41]</span>How to get the <span class="underline">helium</span> 3 off the moon? <span class="time" data-times="6.69" data-time="220.97">[03:40.97]</span>Digging the <span class="underline">stuff</span> up is challenging because the <span class="underline">distribution</span> of helium-3 is so diffused <span class="underline">across</span> the <span class="underline">lunar</span> surface. <span class="time" data-times="9.66" data-time="227.66">[03:47.66]</span>One <span class="underline">estimate</span> is you'd need to heat a million tons of <span class="underline">lunar</span> soil to about 800 <span class="underline">degree</span> Celsius to <span class="underline">yield</span> about 70 tons of helium-3 gas. <span class="time" data-times="6.53" data-time="237.32">[03:57.32]</span>It's kind of liking digging out a <span class="underline">crater</span> with a spoon to find the single nugget of gold. Kind of <span class="underline">ridiculous</span>, right? <span class="time" data-times="6.43" data-time="243.85">[04:03.85]</span>There's a camp that believes it'll take more energy to <span class="underline">extract</span> helium-3 gas than the gas itself would provide. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="12.54" data-time="250.28">[04:10.28]</span>So there are concerns, but <span class="underline">given</span> the <span class="underline">lure</span> of the possibilities and the pressing nature of our energy difficulties, it's possible that helium-3 could be a <span class="underline">significant</span> driver of future <span class="underline">exploration</span> of the moon. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="262.82">[04:22.82]</span>And it certainly could <span class="underline">ease</span> the <span class="underline">pressure</span> on the demand for <span class="underline">fossil</span> fuels if and when the <span class="underline">numerous</span> challenges, and not just the ones we've talked about, are solved. </p>
