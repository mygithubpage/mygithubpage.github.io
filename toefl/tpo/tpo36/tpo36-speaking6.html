          <p>Listen to part of a lecture in a Biology class</p>
          <p>So, we know animals in many climates have to develop strategies; ways to protect themselves when the weather becomes especially hot and dry in the summers. Lets start talking about how one small creature, a snail, can do this. Now, as you know, a snail is a very small creature with a soft, moist body, most of which is protected by a hard shell. A snail is a good example of an animal that has developed certain strategies for coping with high temperatures and draught, or lack of water. First, to avoid the heat when the sun comes out, snails move into the shelter of vegetation ... you know, plants or leaves, to get out of the sun and into the shade. Now, of course the ground can become very hot in the sun. It absorbs and radiates heat, so snails will move up off of the ground to places where it is cooler. They may attach themselves to a wall or a tree where it is cooler than on the ground. Now, it's not just heat that snails need to worry about. They also need to avoid drying out due to lack of water, so during a really warm, dry day or during the summer months , snails secrete a sticky, slimy substance made up of calcium and it covers the opening of their shell; covers and closes it up . This keeps the moisture inside the shell and prevents the snail from drying out. Snails can stay inside their shells closed up like this for a long time, even several months if it's a really dry summer. Their bodies, well everything slows down and so they don't need food. They can survive on what food they've stored up, but when it rains and water is available again, the snail opens up its shell to get some.</p>

        <article>
          <p>In the lecture, the female professor talks about how can a snail survive in hot and dry climate. The snail has developed two main strategies. The aim of the first strategy is to avoid the heat. Snails will move up to a shelter which covered by vegetation. Thus will make them get away from the sun and prevent the heat. Because the ground is hotter exposed to sunlight, snails will attach to a wall or a tree to get colder. The second strategy is about to keep themselves moisture. When it becomes dry, snails will begin to produce a kind of substance to seal its shell. This can keep it moisture inside its shell. They live on the food stored in its shell. After several month when there are more water, snails will come out of the shell again.</p>
