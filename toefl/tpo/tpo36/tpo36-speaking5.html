I heard there is a big ski trip camp for this weekend.</p><p>Woman: Right. The ski club's going to mountain Henderson this weekend.</p><p>Man: That'll be fun.Woman: I know. But I kind of have a problem. My cousin called and she's coming here this weekend. She has some kind of conference in town on Saturday and anyway, she wants to get together for dinner Saturday night.</p><p>Man: So what did you tell her?</p><p>Woman: Of course I couldn't really say no. And anyway I'm looking forward to seeing her. She's a lot of fun. It's just that...</p><p>Man: Now you have to figure out how to see her and go on the ski trip.</p><p>Woman: Exactly. How can I do both? Got any ideas?</p><p>Man: Well, you could explain to her that you already made plans to go on this ski trip. Ask her if she would come to town on Fri instead of Saturday. That way you two can get together before her conference starts.</p><p>Woman: Hmm. I'm sure she'd be willing to come on Fri if I ask her to. Then we can go on a dinner Friday night instead of Saturday night.</p><p>Man: And you could go skiing on Saturday like you planned.</p><p>Woman: Yeah. The only problem is that I'm a little worried about offending her. You know, asking her to come early so I don't have to change my plans.</p><p>Man: Well, you did make plans to go skiing first.</p><p>Woman: True.Man: But I do have another idea. You could just go for part of the ski trip.Woman: What do you mean?</p><p>Man: Well, instead of going on Saturday with the rest of the group, why don't you just drive up to Henderson on Sunday? That way you get to spend Saturday night with your cousin and you could meet the group and go skiing on Sunday.</p><p>Woman: Wow, that's another good idea. It's just that... I'm not sure it's worth it to go on Sunday. I'd only get couple of hours for skiing and then it'll be time to come back.</p></article></section><section id="question"><h4>Question</h4><p>Briefly summarize the woman's problem. Then state which solution you would recommend. Explain the reasons for your recommendation. </p></section><section id="sample-response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><article><p>In the conversation, the woman is facing a problem that her cousin will come on Saturday and this will collided with her ski trip. The man comes up with two solutions. One solution is she can ask her cousin to come in Friday evening. But the woman is afraid to offend her cousin. And the second solution is she could go just part of ski trip on Sunday after she has dinner with her cousin in Saturday. However, the woman thinks if she goes to the ski trip for only several hours on Sunday, she probably will not be willing to go. I suppose the first solution is better. Because she decided to go to skiing before her cousin told her to have dinner together. If she explains the fact to her cousin, her cousin will understand her.</p></article></section></main></body></html>
