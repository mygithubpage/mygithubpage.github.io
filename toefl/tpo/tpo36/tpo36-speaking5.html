        <article>
          <p>Listen to a conversation between two students discussing plans for the weekend.</p>
          <p>Man: Hey Samantha I heard there's a big ski trip planned for this weekend.</p>
          <p>Woman: Right this ski clubs going up to mount Henderson this weekend.</p>
          <p>Man: That'll be fun.</p>
          <p>Woman: I know but I kinda have a problem my cousin called and she's coming here this weekend she is some kind of conference in town on Saturday and anyway she wants to get together for dinner Saturday night.</p>
          <p>Man: So what you're telling.</p>
          <p>Woman: Of course I couldn't really say no and anyway I'm looking forward to seeing her she's a lot of fun it's just that.</p>
          <p>Man: Now you have to figure out how to see her and go on the ski trip.</p>
          <p>Woman: Exactly how can I do both got any ideas.</p>
          <p>Man: Well you could explain to her that you already made plans to go on a ski trip.</p>
          <p>Man: Ask your she be willing to come to town on Friday instead of Saturday that way you two could get together before her conference starts.</p>
          <p>Woman: Whom I'm sure she'd be willing to come on Friday if I asked her to then we could go out for dinner Friday night instead of Saturday night.</p>
          <p>Man: And you could go skiing on Saturday like you planned.</p>
          <p>Woman: Yeah the only problem is that I'm a little worried about offending her you know asking her to come early so I don't have to change my plans.</p>
          <p>Man: Well you did make plans to go skiing first.</p>
          <p>Woman: True.</p>
          <p>Man: But I do have another idea.</p>
          <p>Man: You could just go for part of the ski trip.</p>
          <p>Woman: What do you mean.</p>
          <p>Man: Well instead of going on Saturday with the rest of the group why don't you just drive up to Matt Henderson on Sunday.</p>
          <p>Man: That way you get to spend Saturday night with your cousin and you could meet the group and go skiing on Sunday.</p>
          <p>Woman: Wow that's another good idea it's just that I'm not sure it's worth it to go up on Sunday I only had a couple of hours of skiing in and that it be time to come back.</p>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>In the conversation, the woman is facing a problem that her cousin will come on Saturday and this will collided with her ski trip. The man comes up with two solutions. One solution is she can ask her cousin to come in Friday evening. But the woman is afraid to offend her cousin. And the second solution is she could go just part of ski trip on Sunday after she has dinner with her cousin in Saturday. However, the woman thinks if she goes to the ski trip for only several hours on Sunday, she probably will not be willing to go. I suppose the first solution is better. Because she decided to go to skiing before her cousin told her to have dinner together. If she explains the fact to her cousin, her cousin will understand her.</p>
