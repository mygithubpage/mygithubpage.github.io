            <b>Early Ideas About Deep-sea Biology</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>In 1841 Edward Forbes was offered the <span class="highlight">chance</span> to serve as <span class="highlight">naturalist</span> aboard HMS Beacon, an English Royal <span class="highlight">Navy</span> ship assigned to <span class="highlight">survey</span> the <span class="highlight">Aegean</span> Sea. For a year and a half the Beacon crisscrossed the <span class="highlight">Aegean</span> waters. During that time Forbes was able to <span class="highlight">drag</span> this small, triangular dregdge - a tool with a <span class="highlight">leather</span> net for capturing creatures <span class="highlight">along</span> the sea bottom - at a hundred locations, at depths ranging from 6 to 1380 feet. <span class="question2">He collected hundreds of different <span class="highlight">species</span> of animals, and he saw that they were distributed in eight different depth zones, each containing its own <span class="highlight">distinct</span> assemblage of animal life, the way zones of <span class="highlight">elevation</span> on the side of a mountain are populated by <span class="highlight">distinct</span> sets of plants.</span></p>
          <p>Forbes also thought he saw, as he later told the British Association, that "the number of <span class="highlight">species</span> and individuals diminishes as we <span class="highlight">descend</span>, pointing to a zero in the <span class="highlight">distribution</span> of animal life as yet unvisited." This zero, Forbes casually speculated-he <span class="highlight">simply</span> <span class="question3">extended a <span class="highlight">line</span> on his <span class="highlight">graph</span> of animal number <span class="highlight">versus</span> depth</span>-probably began at a depth of 1,800 feet. Below that was the final <span class="highlight">zone</span> in Forbes's <span class="highlight">scheme</span>, <span class="highlight">zone</span> nine, a <span class="highlight">zone</span> that covered most of the ocean floor and thus most of the <span class="highlight">solid</span> surface of Earth: Forbes called this the azoic <span class="highlight">zone</span>, where no animal, to say nothing of plants, could <span class="highlight">survive</span>.</p>
          <p>Forbes's azoic <span class="highlight">zone</span> was <span class="highlight">entirely</span> <span class="highlight">plausible</span> at the time, and it was certainly far from the strangest idea that was then entertained about the deep sea. In the first <span class="highlight">decade</span> of the nineteenth <span class="highlight">century</span>, a French <span class="highlight">naturalist</span> named Francois Peron had sailed around the world measuring the <span class="highlight">temperature</span> of the ocean. He found that the deeper the water, the colder it got, and he concluded that the seafloor was covered with a thick <span class="highlight">layer</span> of ice. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> Peron ignored the fact that water expands when it freezes and that ice <span class="highlight">therefore</span> floats. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> A more <span class="highlight">popular</span> belief at the time was that water at great depth would be compressed to such a <span class="highlight">density</span> that nothing could sink <span class="highlight">through</span> it. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span> This ignored the fact that water is all but incompressible. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span> But <span class="highlight">even</span> the more <span class="highlight"><span class="question6">sensible</span> </span>naturalists of the day were <span class="highlight">guilty</span> of a <span class="highlight">similar</span> misconception. They imagined the deep sea as being filled with an unmoving and undisturbable pool of cold, <span class="highlight"><span class="highlight">dense</span></span> water. In reality the deep is always being refreshed by cold water sinking from above.</p>
          <p>The central <span class="highlight">implication</span> of all these misconceptions was that nothing could live in the abyss (deep), just as Forbes's observations seemed to <span class="highlight">indicate</span>. But Forbes erred in two ways. One was the <span class="highlight">particular</span> study site he happened to use as a springboard for his <span class="highlight">sweeping</span> <span class="highlight">postulate</span> of a lifeless abyss. Although the <span class="highlight">Aegean</span> had been the birthplace of <span class="highlight">marine</span> <span class="highlight">biology</span>, its depths are now known to be <span class="question7">exceptionally </span>lacking in animal <span class="highlight">diversity</span>. Moreover, <span class="highlight">through</span> no <span class="highlight">fault</span> of his own, Forbes was not particularly successful at sampling such life as did exist at the bottom of the <span class="highlight">Aegean</span>. It was his dredge that was inadequate. Its opening was so small and the holes in the net so large that the dredge <span class="highlight"><span class="question11">inevitably</span> </span>missed animals. Many of those it did catch must have poured out of its open mouth when Forbes reeled it in. His azoic <span class="highlight">zone</span>, then, was a <span class="highlight">plausible</span> but wild extrapolation from <span class="highlight">pioneering</span> but <span class="highlight">feeble</span> <span class="highlight">data</span>.</p>
          <p>As it turned out, the <span class="highlight">existence</span> of the azoic <span class="highlight">zone</span> had been disproved <span class="highlight">even</span> before Forbes suggested it, and the <span class="highlight">theory</span> continued to be contradicted regularly <span class="highlight">throughout</span> its long and <span class="highlight">influential</span> life. Searching for the Northwest <span class="highlight">Passage</span> from the Atlantic to the <span class="highlight">Pacific</span> in 1818, Sir John Ross had lowered his "deep-sea clam"-a <span class="highlight">sort</span> of bivalved <span class="highlight">sediment</span> scoop-into the water of Baffin Bay ( an inlet between the Atlantic and <span class="highlight">Arctic</span> oceans), which the <span class="highlight">determined</span> to be more than a thousand fathoms deep in some places. Modern soundings <span class="highlight">indicate</span> he overestimated his depths by several hundred fathoms, but in any case Ross's <span class="highlight">clam</span> dove several times deeper than Forbes's dredge. It brought back mud laced with worms, and starfish that dad entangled themselves in the <span class="highlight">line</span> at depths well below the supposed <span class="highlight">boundary</span> of the azoic <span class="highlight">zone</span>.</p>
