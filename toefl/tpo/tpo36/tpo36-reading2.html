For a year and a half the Beacon crisscrossed the <span class="highlight">Aegean</span> waters. During that time Forbes was able to <span class="highlight">drag</span> this small, triangular dregdge - a tool with a <span class="highlight">leather</span> net for capturing creatures <span class="highlight">along</span> the sea bottom - at a hundred locations, at depths ranging from 6 to 1380 feet. <span class="question2">He collected hundreds of different <span class="highlight">species</span> of animals, and he saw that they were distributed in eight different depth zones, each containing its own <span class="highlight">distinct</span> assemblage of animal life, the way zones of <span class="highlight">elevation</span> on the side of a mountain are populated by <span class="highlight">distinct</span> sets of plants.</span></p><p>Forbes also thought he saw, as he later told the British Association, that "the number of <span class="highlight">species</span> and individuals diminishes as we <span class="highlight">descend</span>, pointing to a zero in the <span class="highlight">distribution</span> of animal life as yet unvisited." This zero, Forbes casually speculated-he <span class="highlight">simply</span><span class="question3">extended a <span class="highlight">line</span> on his <span class="highlight">graph</span> of animal number <span class="highlight">versus</span> depth</span>-probably began at a depth of 1,800 feet. Below that was the final <span class="highlight">zone</span> in Forbes's <span class="highlight">scheme</span>, <span class="highlight">zone</span> nine, a <span class="highlight">zone</span> that covered most of the ocean floor and thus most of the <span class="highlight">solid</span> surface of Earth: Forbes called this the azoic <span class="highlight">zone</span>, where no animal, to say nothing of plants, could <span class="highlight">survive</span>.</p><p>Forbes's azoic <span class="highlight">zone</span> was <span class="highlight">entirely</span><span class="highlight">plausible</span> at the time, and it was certainly far from the strangest idea that was then entertained about the deep sea. In the first <span class="highlight">decade</span> of the nineteenth <span class="highlight">century</span>, a French <span class="highlight">naturalist</span> named Francois Peron had sailed around the world measuring the <span class="highlight">temperature</span> of the ocean. He found that the deeper the water, the colder it got, and he concluded that the seafloor was covered with a thick <span class="highlight">layer</span> of ice. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> Peron ignored the fact that water expands when it freezes and that ice <span class="highlight">therefore</span> floats. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> A more <span class="highlight">popular</span> belief at the time was that water at great depth would be compressed to such a <span class="highlight">density</span> that nothing could sink <span class="highlight">through</span> it. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span> This ignored the fact that water is all but incompressible. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span> But <span class="highlight">even</span> the more <span class="highlight"><span class="question6">sensible</span></span> naturalists of the day were <span class="highlight">guilty</span> of a <span class="highlight">similar</span> misconception. They imagined the deep sea as being filled with an unmoving and undisturbable pool of cold, <span class="highlight"><span class="highlight">dense</span></span> water. In reality the deep is always being refreshed by cold water sinking from above.</p><p>The central <span class="highlight">implication</span> of all these misconceptions was that nothing could live in the abyss (deep), just as Forbes's observations seemed to <span class="highlight">indicate</span>. But Forbes erred in two ways. One was the <span class="highlight">particular</span> study site he happened to use as a springboard for his <span class="highlight">sweeping</span><span class="highlight">postulate</span> of a lifeless abyss. Although the <span class="highlight">Aegean</span> had been the birthplace of <span class="highlight">marine</span><span class="highlight">biology</span>, its depths are now known to be <span class="question7">exceptionally</span> lacking in animal <span class="highlight">diversity</span>. Moreover, <span class="highlight">through</span> no <span class="highlight">fault</span> of his own, Forbes was not particularly successful at sampling such life as did exist at the bottom of the <span class="highlight">Aegean</span>. It was his dredge that was inadequate. Its opening was so small and the holes in the net so large that the dredge <span class="highlight"><span class="question11">inevitably</span></span> missed animals. Many of those it did catch must have poured out of its open mouth when Forbes reeled it in. His azoic <span class="highlight">zone</span>, then, was a <span class="highlight">plausible</span> but wild extrapolation from <span class="highlight">pioneering</span> but <span class="highlight">feeble</span><span class="highlight">data</span>.</p><p>As it turned out, the <span class="highlight">existence</span> of the azoic <span class="highlight">zone</span> had been disproved <span class="highlight">even</span> before Forbes suggested it, and the <span class="highlight">theory</span> continued to be contradicted regularly <span class="highlight">throughout</span> its long and <span class="highlight">influential</span> life. Searching for the Northwest <span class="highlight">Passage</span> from the Atlantic to the <span class="highlight">Pacific</span> in 1818, Sir John Ross had lowered his "deep-sea clam"-a <span class="highlight">sort</span> of bivalved <span class="highlight">sediment</span> scoop-into the water of Baffin Bay ( an inlet between the Atlantic and <span class="highlight">Arctic</span> oceans), which the <span class="highlight">determined</span> to be more than a thousand fathoms deep in some places. Modern soundings <span class="highlight">indicate</span> he overestimated his depths by several hundred fathoms, but in any case Ross's <span class="highlight">clam</span> dove several times deeper than Forbes's dredge. It brought back mud laced with worms, and starfish that dad entangled themselves in the <span class="highlight">line</span> at depths well below the supposed <span class="highlight">boundary</span> of the azoic <span class="highlight">zone</span>.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 1, why was the HMS Beacon in the Aegean Sea?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To capture creatures along the sea bottom.</p><p>B. To provide Forbes with transportation back and forth across the Aegean.</p><p>C. To test the effectiveness of a new type of dredge.</p><p>D. To carry out a survey of the Aegean Sea.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The keywords in this question are HMS Beacon and Aegean Sea, locate back to the original text and find the sentence: In 1841 Edward Forbes was providing the chance to serve as naturalist aboard HMS Beacon, an English Royal Navy ship assigned to survey the Aegean Sea. The answer lies in this attributive clause. In: HMS Beacon, an English Royal Navy ship assigned to survey the Aegean Sea. The HMS Beacon is a boat that goes to investigate the Aegean Sea. Option D meets the meaning of this sentence. The other three options are not related to this sentence.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways for leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The hundreds of different species of animals Forbes collected fell into eight distinct groups, each associated with a different depth zone.</p><p>B. Forbes realized that depth zones, like elevation zones, contain hundreds of different species.</p><p>C. By collecting hundreds of different animals on land and sea, Forbes discovered that there were eight elevation zones and eight depth zones.</p><p>D. In addition to collecting different species of animals in eight ocean zones, Forbes collected different species of plants in eight mountain zones.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The sentence highlighted in this question is: He collected hundreds of different species of animals, and he saw that they were distributed in eight different depth zones, each containing its own distinct assemblage of animal life, the way zones of elevation on the side of a Mountain are populated by distinct sets of plants. He collected hundreds of animals, and he thought they were distributed in eight different depths of space. Each space contained its own unique creatures, just like in different height regions of the mountains. The different vegetation types are the same. Option A repeats the main content and can be selected; Option B says that Forbes, a person of different heights, contains hundreds of species, missing a lot of key information, and does not choose; Option C says Forbes has also discovered eight different depth regions and In eight areas of different heights, no, he only discovered the zones of depth. The zones of elevations were used to compare the zones of depth. They were not discovered together. Option D said that Forbes not only collected marine life but also collected plants. , but he did not collect the plants and did not choose. Select A.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the author mention that Forbes "<span class="highlight">extended a line on his graph of animal number versus depth</span>"?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To indicate how Forbes concluded that some forms of animal life in the depths of the ocean had never been seen before.</p><p>B. To help explain how Forbes arrived at his theory of the azoic zone.</p><p>C. To make the point that Forbes was a well-trained professional.</p><p>D. To show how naturalists of Forbes's time carried out their research.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="extended a line on his graph of animal number versus depth B"><p>According to the key phrase extended a line on his graph of animal number versus depth to the second paragraph, the second paragraph mainly focuses on the fact that Forbes believes that the deeper the sea, the less the biological species, so he painted a line by himself. Below is the area where there is no life, called the azoic zone. Option B said that it was correct to help explain how Forbes came to the conclusion of the azoic zone; Option A said that he had discovered a species that had not been discovered; Option C stated that he was very professional; Option D said that he exhibited the researchers of that era. How to do research has nothing to do with the original. Select B.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 2, what did Forbes believe about the possibility of life on the ocean floor deeper than 1,800 feet deep?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. No plants or animals could live there.</p><p>B. Only plants could live there.</p><p>C. Only animals could live there.</p><p>D. It was not possible to say whether any plants or animals could live there.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The key word for this question is 1800 feet deep. According to this number, the second segment of This zero, Forbes casually speculated-he simply extended a line on his graph of animal number versus depth-probably initially at a depth of 1,800 feet. This means that there is no living creature below this line. Option A meets. The remaining three options are not consistent.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 3, what was wrong with Francois Peron's conclusion?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It was based on inaccurate temperature measurements.</p><p>B. It assumed that the deeper the water, the colder it got.</p><p>C. It did not take into account the fact that ice floats.</p><p>D. It overlooked the fact that the sea is deeper in some places than in others.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>This question is based on the Peron ignored the fact that water expands when it freezes and that ice thereby floats. In fact, from the second sentence of this paragraph, they are talking about Peron's theory. He thinks that the Going deeper, the colder the sea, so to the deepest sea, the sea will freeze. However, he ignored the fact that if the real seawater is frozen, ice will not stay on the bottom of the sea and it will float. Option C is consistent with the question. The remaining three options are not mentioned in the original. Select C.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question6">sensible</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. famous</p><p>B. highly trained</p><p>C. reasonable</p><p>D. experienced</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" C"><p>This question is based on the word <span class="question6">sensible</span> in the survey and returns to the original sentence: But even the more <span class="question6">sensible</span> naturalists of the day were guilty of a similar misconception. The meaning of this sentence was: But even the more <span class="question6">sensible</span> naturalist was a similar misconception. Feeling embarrassed. Sensible means <span class="question6">sensible</span>. Option A is famous, Option B is strictly trained, Option C is reasonable, and Option D is experienced. Choosing C is the closest to <span class="question6">sensible</span>.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question7">exceptionally</span></span>" in the passage is closet in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. surprisingly</p><p>B. extraordinarily</p><p>C. frequently</p><p>D. specifically</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>This question is based on the words examined except for the sentence: "Although the Aegean had been the birthplace of marine biology, its depths are now known to be <span class="question7">exceptionally</span> lacking in animal diversity." The birthplace of learning, but now knows its depth is very limited in animal diversity. The <span class="question7">exceptionally</span> meaning is very, extremely, with an emphasis on the degree of the table. Option A is surprising, Option B is very much, Option C is frequently, and Option D is specifically. Option B best fits the meaning of <span class="question7">exceptionally</span>.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, what did all the ideas about the deep sea discussed in paragraph 3 have in common?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They were all based on Forbes's observations.</p><p>B. They all challenged Forbes's theory.</p><p>C. They all presented the deep sea as lifeless.</p><p>D. They all underestimated the depth of the sea.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>This question reads the fourth paragraph according to the title instruction. The first sentence is the answer: The central implication of all these misconceptions was that nothing could live in the abyss (deep), just as Forbes's observations seemed to indicate. The common thread of misconceptions is that there is nothing that can survive in the depths of the sea. According to Option C, the deep sea is lifeless. The other three options are all out of nothing and there is no basis for the original text. Select C.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, what was one mistake that Forbes made?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. He assumed that Aegean's depths and other oceans' depths had comparable animal diversity.</p><p>B. He placed too much importance on the fact the Aegean had been the birthplace of marine biology.</p><p>C. He failed to notice that his samples of marine life mostly came from the sea bottom and were not typical of life-forms at higher levels.</p><p>D. He did not realize that the seafloor in many parts of Earth is much deeper than it is in Aegean.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>This topic is based on Forbe and mistake to locate this sentence: But For erred in two ways. One was the particular study site he happened to use as a springboard for his sweeping postulate of a lifeless abyss. Although the Aegean had been the birthplace of marine biology, Forbes had made two mistakes. The first one was that he assumed that the diversity of animals in the ocean he sampled was the same as in other seas. However, in fact, he has sampled animals in less sea than in other places. Option A is true in the original language. There is no mention of the other three options.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, Forbes's dredge had each of the following problems EXCEPT:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It opening was too small to collect certain kinds of animals.</p><p>B. The holes in its net were so large that animals could escape through them.</p><p>C. It could not get all the way down to the Aegean seafloor to sample the animals there.</p><p>D. Many animals were lost out of its open mouth when it was pulled up.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>This question was targeted here according to Forbes and dredge: It was his dredge that was inadequate. Its opening was so small and the holes in the net so large that the dredge <span class="question11">inevitably</span> missed animals. Many of those it did catch must have poured out of its open Mouth when Forbes reeled it in. His azoic zone, then, was a plausible but wild extrapolation from pioneering but feeble data. Option A corresponds to the original opening in so original in the original, option B corresponds to the holes in the net so large , Option D corresponds to Many of those it did catch must have poured out of its open mouth when Forbes reeled it in. Only Option C has no corresponding evidence in the original text. Select C.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question11">inevitably</span></span>" in the passage is closet in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. frequently</p><p>B. necessarily</p><p>C. unpredictably</p><p>D. unfortunately</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>According to the word in question, locate it back in the original sentence: It was his dredge that was inadequate. Its opening was so small and the holes in the net so large that the dredge <span class="question11">inevitably</span> missed animals. The main idea of this sentence is: his sampling is not enough. of. Because the dredge of the tool he used was too small, and the hole on the net was too big, this thing would surely miss the animal. Inevitably meaning is inevitable. Option A is frequently, Option B is mandatory, Option C is unpredictable, and Option D is unfortunately Option B best fits invitably. Select B.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Paragraph 5 strongly suggests which of the following about Forbes and Ross?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Forbes got the idea for his dredge from Ross's deep-sea clam.</p><p>B. Forbes did not know about the discoveries Ross had made in Baffin Bay with help of his deep-sea clam.</p><p>C. Forbes carried out his investigations in the Aegean partly to disprove Ross's theory about the possibility of life in a abyss.</p><p>D. Forbes overestimated the depths of the seas and oceans he studied while Ross's calculations were as accurate as those provided by modern soundings.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>This question turns back to the original paragraph 5 according to the title directive: As it turned out, the existence of the azoic zone had been disproved even before Forbes suggested it, and the theory continued to be contradicted formula throughout its long and influential life. Tell us the answer: Forbes did not know that before he proposed the azoic zone, the existence of this thing has been proved to be wrong. Later, the article tells us that it does not exist Ross. So in fact, Forbes knew nothing about Ross's research. If he knew that he would not propose a theory that has been rejected. Option B is appropriate. The other three options are contrary to the original meaning.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Thus, many people in the early nineteenth century thought that when a ship sank, it never reached bottom, but instead floated on this layer of dense water..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>First look carefully at the sentence to be inserted: Many people in the early nineteenth century thought that when a ship sank, it never reached bottom, but instead floated on this layer of dense water. The sentence begins with thus, indicating that this is a The sentence of the subsequent result, then the previous sentence must be to explain the reason or the previous process. Then we look at the four places that can be inserted one by one, and find that the freezing of the deep sea water that the third location said before can be logically linked to the fact that the ship that inserts the sentence will float on the tightly packed water. And this at the beginning of the sentence after this position also makes a logical relationship between the two sentences. Option C is the most suitable location.</p></div></div><div id="question14" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>Throughout the first half of the nineteenth century, most naturalists mistakenly believed that no life could survive in the deep sea.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.Edward Forbes developed the view, based on research in the Aegean, that both the number and variety of life-forms decline with ocean depth and disappear entirely below 1,800 feet.</p><p>B.Before Forbes conducted his research in the Aegean, most naturalists believed that the deep sea was filled with a pool of cold, dense water that had gradually sunk to the depths from above.</p><p>C.The existence of an azoic zone in the Atlantic Ocean had earlier been established by Sir John Ross, who used a scoop to sample sediment located thousands of feet deep in Baffin Bay.</p><p>D.Forbes carried out his research using a small dredge that invented during the time that he spent working on the HMS Beacon, conducting a survey of the Aegean for the English Royal Navy.</p><p>E.Frobes's data was misleading because it was limited to the Aegean, where animal diversity at depths is unusually low, and because his collecting tool was unable to capture much animal life that did exist.</p><p>F.Life-forms collected in Baffin Bay at depths far greater than 1,800 feet provided evidence as early as 1818 that the azoic zone later proposed by Forbes did not exist.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="AEF"><p>This question needs to analyze each option in turn. Option A means that Forbes found a study conclusion that the number of creatures and biodiversity goes further and further, summing up the content of the second paragraph, which can be selected; Option B tells the researchers before Forbes that the deep sea was cold It is right to occupy the dense water, but it is in the details, but it is not selected; Option C talks about Ross's research helping to establish the research of the azoic zone. It is contrary to the original text and should be overturned; option D is about the use of Forbes. The dredge to detect marine life was invented when he explored the Aegean Sea. The original text did not say that it was not selected. Option E talks about the limitations of Forbes's research conclusions. It summarizes the main contents of the fourth paragraph and can be selected; Option F talks about the theory of overthrowing the azoic zone and summarizes the main content of the fifth paragraph. Taken together, choose A, E, F.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
