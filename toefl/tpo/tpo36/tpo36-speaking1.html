One reason is reading can help a kid to develop good comprehension skill. Especially some thesis on particular subjects. They will be good for young students to acquire the skill of logic thinking. Another reason is it will give a child big potential benefits if he has good reading habits. With every day's knowledge intake, he will own profound knowledge storage when he grow up. Reading has so much good influence on a child's future development so I strongly urge young students to read more. </p></article></div></main></body></html>
