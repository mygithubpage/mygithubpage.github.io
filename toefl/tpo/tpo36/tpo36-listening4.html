              <span class="time" data-times="3.89" data-time="7.63">[00:07.63]</span>Student: Hi I'm Jim, the guy who's trying to get a new show.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.07" data-time="11.52">[00:11.52]</span>Manager: Right. Jim.</p>

            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.46" data-time="18.81">[00:18.81]</span>Manager: I'm glad you came in, Jim. <span class="time" data-times="3.14" data-time="20.27">[00:20.27]</span>I was actually quite impressed with your <span class="highlight">application</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="0.81" data-time="23.41">[00:23.41]</span>Student: Okay.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.49" data-time="24.22">[00:24.22]</span>Manager: But the thing is, we run a music <span class="highlight">station</span> here, not a talk <span class="highlight">station</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.02" data-time="28.71">[00:28.71]</span>We've been a music <span class="highlight">station</span> since the beginning, since the <span class="highlight">station</span>'s <span class="highlight">inception</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.46" data-time="32.73">[00:32.73]</span>Student: This is where I get <span class="highlight">confused</span> because of the article in last month's <span class="highlight">campus</span> newspaper about the <span class="highlight">poll</span>...</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.99" data-time="38.19">[00:38.19]</span>Manager: Yes. The <span class="highlight">survey</span>...</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.72" data-time="40.18">[00:40.18]</span>Student: I mean, a <span class="highlight">majority</span> of students said they felt the <span class="highlight">station</span> was stale, that it needed a breath of fresh <span class="highlight">air</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.66" data-time="45.9">[00:45.90]</span>Well, um, how are we supposed to get fresh <span class="highlight">air</span> if you keep all the windows closed? <span class="time" data-times="3.24" data-time="51.56">[00:51.56]</span>I was just trying to open some windows for people.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.16" data-time="54.8">[00:54.80]</span>Manager: I can tell you have a lot of <span class="highlight">passion</span> for this, but I'm really not convinced it's a good idea. Okay.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.65" data-time="62.96">[01:02.96]</span>The first thing is, again, this is a music <span class="highlight">station</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.44" data-time="66.61">[01:06.61]</span>If we just have that one calling show, it just doesn't fit in with what we are doing. <span class="time" data-times="4.49" data-time="72.05">[01:12.05]</span>And studies have showed that mixed <span class="highlight">format</span> stations just aren't as successful as...<span class="time" data-times="4.8" data-time="76.54">[01:16.54]</span>Look. We do want to innovate, but <span class="highlight">within</span> the <span class="highlight">format</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.76" data-time="81.34">[01:21.34]</span>And with a live calling show, for one thing, you have no idea what the caller is going to say, no idea what you could end up broadcasting.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.96" data-time="89.1">[01:29.10]</span>Student: I understand, but that seems like a small risk to take in <span class="highlight">exchange</span> for giving students a <span class="highlight">chance</span> to talk publicly, interactively about issues they <span class="highlight">care</span> about. <span class="time" data-times="6.27" data-time="98.06">[01:38.06]</span>I really think they'd like to have a place where they can <span class="highlight">air</span> their views about <span class="highlight">current</span> events, about the university.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.25" data-time="104.33">[01:44.33]</span>Manager: But the university already has that. <span class="time" data-times="6.06" data-time="106.58">[01:46.58]</span>There's a monthly meeting open to all students to discuss issues like the ones you mentioned in your <span class="highlight">application</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.18" data-time="112.64">[01:52.64]</span>And there are several student clubs on <span class="highlight">campus</span> that discuss <span class="highlight">current</span> events. <span class="time" data-times="3.81" data-time="116.82">[01:56.82]</span>But either way we have no plans to change the <span class="highlight">format</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.21" data-time="120.63">[02:00.63]</span>Now, if you had an <span class="highlight">innovative</span> idea for a new music program...</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.12" data-time="124.84">[02:04.84]</span>Student: Well...how about a music program that includes taking calls from listeners?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.87" data-time="129.96">[02:09.96]</span>Manager: You really are <span class="highlight">determined</span> to have a calling show, huh?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.85" data-time="132.83">[02:12.83]</span>Student: Well, I'm a communications <span class="highlight">major</span>, and I'm hoping to get an <span class="highlight">internship</span> at a <span class="highlight">professional</span> talk radio show in the city next year. <span class="time" data-times="3.08" data-time="139.68">[02:19.68]</span>I thought a little experience with the college <span class="highlight">station</span> might help.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.7" data-time="142.76">[02:22.76]</span>Manager: Tell you what, there's still some time before the <span class="highlight">application</span> <span class="highlight">deadline</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.81" data-time="147.46">[02:27.46]</span>Why don't you <span class="highlight">submit</span> a new <span class="highlight">application</span> with the music show idea that you just proposed? <span class="time" data-times="2.24" data-time="152.27">[02:32.27]</span>Then we will see if we can work something out.</p>
            <p>
