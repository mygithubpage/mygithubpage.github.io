              <p>This dialogue tells us that the reason why boys came to the teacher was because their resumes for school radio stations were rejected and he was not convinced. Option C is consistent with the question. The remaining three were not mentioned in the original text. Select C.</p>

              <p>The question is: The first thing is, again, this is a music station. If we just have that one calling show, it just doesn't fit in with what we are doing.

And with a live calling show, for one thing, you have no idea what the caller is going to say, no idea what you could End up broadcasting. When this question is heard first, we must realize that the question appears. The teacher mainly expressed two meanings in this passage. One is that radio stations only broadcast music, and the other is that if you join a call from a listener, uncontrollable factors will increase and you will not be sure how to end. Options B and D correspond to these two points. The other two options have nothing to do with the content of the dialogue. Double-select BD.</p>

              <p>The problem of this question is:</p>
              <p>Manager:</p>
              <p>Tell you what, there's still some time before the application deadline. Why don't you submit a new application with the music show idea that you just proposed? Then we will see if we can work something out.</p>
              <p>Because of the persistent insistence of the boys, the teacher finally stated that because there was still some time before the submission of the application, if the boys were willing to give an application for a talk show, she could consider it again. So option A meets. The other three options are not in line with the original text. Select A.</p>
