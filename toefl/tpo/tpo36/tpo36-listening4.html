I was actually quite impressed with your application.</p><p>Student:</p><p>Okay.</p><p>Manager:</p><p>But the thing is, we run a music station here, not a talk station. We've been a music station since the beginning, since the station's inception.</p><p>This dialogue tells us that the reason why boys came to the teacher was because their resumes for school radio stations were rejected and he was not convinced. Option C is consistent with the question. The remaining three were not mentioned in the original text. Select C.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>What are the woman's objections to a call-in radio show? Click on 2 answers</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. She does not like to call-in shows.</p><p>B. The radio stations broadcasts only music shows.</p><p>C. The radio station does not have the necessary equipment to broadcast a call-in show.</p><p>D. It is difficult to predict what people might say when they call.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="BD"><p>The question is: The first thing is, again, this is a music station. If we just have that one calling show, it just doesn't fit in with what we are doing. And studies have showed that mixed format stations just Aren't as successful as...Look. We do want to innovate, but within the format. And with a live calling show, for one thing, you have no idea what the caller is going to say, no idea what you could End up broadcasting. When this question is heard first, we must realize that the question appears. The teacher mainly expressed two meanings in this passage. One is that radio stations only broadcast music, and the other is that if you join a call from a listener, uncontrollable factors will increase and you will not be sure how to end. Options B and D correspond to these two points. The other two options have nothing to do with the content of the dialogue. Double-select BD.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the woman mention the university's monthly meetings?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

To explain the process of s approval for new radio shows.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The problem of this question is:</p><p>Student:</p><p>I understand, but that seems like a small risk to take in exchange for giving students a chance to talk publicly, interactively about issues they care about. I really think they'd like to have a place where they can air their views about current events , about the university.</p><p>Manager:</p><p>But the way we already have students to discuss issues like the ones you mentioned in your application. And there are several student clubs on campus that discuss current events. But either way we have no plans to change the Format.</p><p>The main idea of ​​this dialogue is that the boys think that the broadcasting station needs to give students the opportunity to talk about things in the next school, but the teacher said that there is already a meeting once a month to talk about this issue, and there are other associations. Therefore, it is to tell the boys that the students have the means to discuss the campus affairs. No radio stations are required to open a new project for this purpose. Option A fits the question. The remaining three options are not accurately understood. Select A.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the student mention an internship at a professional radio station?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

To suggest that he will submit his idea to that radio station.</p><p>D. To explain why he wants his own radio show at the university radio station.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The problem of this question is:</p><p>Student:</p><p>Well, I'm a communications major, and I'm hoping to get an internship at a professional talk radio show in the city next year. I thought a little experience with the college station might help.</p><p>The effect of this paragraph is that boys say that they are professional in communications, and in the next year they want to find an intern at a professional chat radio station. He feels that if this university radio wants him, this experience can help him achieve the goals of the next year. Option D explains why he wants to enter the school radio station and is correct. The remaining three options are not suitable. Select D.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the woman imply about the student's idea to mix a music show with a call-in show</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

She thinks that it would improve the student's chances of getting an internship.</p><p>D. She does not think that there is room for that type of show in the program calendar.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The problem of this question is:</p><p>Manager:</p><p>Tell you what, there's still some time before the application deadline. Why don't you submit a new application with the music show idea that you just proposed? Then we will see if we can work something out.</p><p>Because of the persistent insistence of the boys, the teacher finally stated that because there was still some time before the submission of the application, if the boys were willing to give an application for a talk show, she could consider it again. So option A meets. The other three options are not in line with the original text. Select A.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
