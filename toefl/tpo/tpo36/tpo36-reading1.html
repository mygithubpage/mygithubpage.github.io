            <b>Soil Formation</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>Living organisms play an <span class="underline">essential</span> role in soil <span class="underline">formation</span>. The <span class="underline">numerous</span> plants and animals living in the soil <span class="underline">release</span> minerals from the parent <span class="underline">material</span> from which soil is formed, <span class="underline">supply</span> <span class="underline">organic</span> matter, aid in the translocation (movement) and aeration of the soil, and help protect the soil from <span class="underline">erosion</span>. The types of organisms growing or living in the soil greatly influence the soil's <span class="underline">physical</span> and chemical characteristics. In fact, for <span class="underline">mature</span> soils in many parts of the world, the <span class="underline">predominant</span> type of natural <span class="underline">vegetation</span> is considered the most important direct influence on soil characteristics. For this <span class="underline">reason</span>, a soil scientist can tell a great <span class="underline">deal</span> about the <span class="light">attributes</span> of the soil in any <span class="underline">given</span> area <span class="underline">simply</span> form knowing what kind of <span class="underline">flora</span> the soil supports. Thus prairies and <span class="underline">tundra</span> regions, which have <span class="underline">characteristic</span> vegetations, also have <span class="underline">characteristic</span> soils.</p>
          <p>The <span class="underline">quantity</span> and total weight of soil <span class="underline">flora</span> generally <span class="underline">exceed</span> that of soil <span class="underline">fauna</span>. By far the most <span class="underline">numerous</span> and smallest of the plants living in soil are <span class="underline">bacteria</span>. Under <span class="underline">favorable</span> conditions, a million or more of these tiny, single-celled plants can <span class="underline">inhabit</span> each cubic centimeter of soil. It is the <span class="underline">bacteria</span>, more than any other organisms, that enable rock or other parent <span class="underline">material</span> to <span class="underline">undergo</span> the <span class="underline">gradual</span> <span class="underline">transformation</span> to soil. Some <span class="underline">bacteria</span> produce <span class="underline">organic</span> acids that directly attack parent <span class="underline">material</span>, breaking it down and releasing plant nutrients. Others <span class="underline">decompose</span> <span class="underline">organic</span> <span class="underline">litter</span> (<span class="underline">debris</span>) to form <span class="underline">humus</span> (nutrient-rich <span class="underline">organic</span> matter). A third group of <span class="underline">bacteria</span> inhabits the <span class="underline">root</span> systems of plants called legumes. These include many important agricultural crops, such as <span class="underline">alfalfa</span>, clover, soybeans, peas, and peanuts. The <span class="underline">bacteria</span> that legumes <span class="underline">host</span> <span class="underline">within</span> their <span class="underline">root</span> nodules (small swellings on the <span class="underline">root</span>) change <span class="underline">nitrogen</span> gas from the <span class="underline">atmosphere</span> into <span class="underline">nitrogen</span> compounds that plants are able to metabolize, a <span class="underline">process</span>, known as <span class="underline">nitrogen</span> fixation, that makes the soil more <span class="underline">fertile</span>. Other <span class="underline">microscopic</span> plants also are important in soil <span class="underline">development</span>. For example, in highly <span class="underline">acidic</span> soils where few <span class="underline">bacteria</span> can <span class="underline">survive</span>, <span class="underline">fungi</span> frequently become the <span class="underline">chief</span> decomposers of <span class="underline">organic</span> matter.</p>
          <p>More <span class="underline">complex</span> forms of <span class="underline">vegetation</span> play several <span class="underline">vital</span> roles with <span class="underline">respect</span> to the soil. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> Tress, grass, and other large plants <span class="underline">supply</span> the <span class="underline">bulk</span> of the soil's <span class="underline">humus</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> The minerals released as these plants <span class="underline">decompose</span> on the surface <span class="underline">constitute</span> an important <span class="underline">nutrient</span> <span class="underline">source</span> for succeeding generations of plants as well as for other soil organisms. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span> In <span class="underline">addition</span>, trees can <span class="underline">extend</span> their roots deep <span class="underline">within</span> the soil and bring up nutrients from far below the surface. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span> These nutrients <span class="underline">eventually</span> <span class="underline">enrich</span> the surface soil when the tree drops its leaves or when it dies and decomposes. Finally, trees <span class="underline">perform</span> the <span class="underline">vital</span> <span class="underline">function</span> of slowing water <span class="underline">runoff</span> and holding the soil in place with their <span class="underline">root</span> systems, thus combating <span class="underline">erosion</span>. The increased <span class="underline">erosion</span> that often accompanies agricultural use of sloping land is <span class="underline">principally</span> caused by the <span class="underline">removal</span> of its protective cover of natural <span class="underline">vegetation</span>.</p>
          <p>Animals also influence soil <span class="underline">composition</span>. The faunal counterparts of <span class="underline">bacteria</span> are protozoa. These single-celled organisms are the most <span class="underline">numerous</span> representatives of the animal <span class="underline">kingdom</span>, and, like <span class="underline">bacteria</span>, a million or more can sometimes <span class="underline">inhabit</span> each cubic centimeter of soil. Protozoa feed on <span class="underline">organic</span> matter and <span class="underline">hasten</span> its <span class="underline">decomposition</span>. Among other soil-dwelling animals, the earthworm is probably the most important. Under exceptionally <span class="underline">favorable</span> conditions, up to a million earthworms (with a total body weight exceeding 450 kilograms) may <span class="underline">inhabit</span> an <span class="underline">acre</span> of soil. Earthworms <span class="underline">ingest</span> large quantities of soil, chemically <span class="underline">alter</span> it, and excrete it as <span class="underline">organic</span> matter called casts. The casts form a high-quality natural <span class="underline">fertilizer</span>. In <span class="underline">addition</span>, earthworms mix of soil both <span class="underline">vertically</span> and horizontally, improving aeration and <span class="underline">drainage</span>.</p>
          <p>Insects such as ants and termites also can be <span class="underline">exceedingly</span> <span class="underline">numerous</span> under <span class="underline">favorable</span> <span class="underline">climatic</span> and soil conditions. In <span class="underline">addition</span>, mammals such as moles, <span class="underline">field</span> <span class="underline">mice</span>, gophers, and <span class="underline">prairie</span> dogs sometimes are present in <span class="underline">sufficient</span> numbers to have <span class="underline">significant</span> <span class="underline">impact</span> on the soil. These animals <span class="underline">primarily</span> work the soil mechanically. As a result, the soil is aerated broken up, <span class="underline">fertilized</span>, and brought to the surface, hastening soil <span class="underline">development</span>.</p>
