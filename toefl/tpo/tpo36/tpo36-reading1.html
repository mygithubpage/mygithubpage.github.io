          <h4 class="w3-center">Soil Formation</h4>
          <p>Living organisms play an <span class="highlight">essential</span> role in soil <span class="highlight">formation</span>. The <span class="highlight">numerous</span> plants and animals living in the soil <span class="highlight">release</span> minerals from the parent <span class="highlight">material</span> from which soil is formed, <span class="highlight">supply</span> <span class="highlight">organic</span> matter, aid in the translocation (movement) and aeration of the soil, and help protect the soil from <span class="highlight">erosion</span>. The types of organisms growing or living in the soil greatly influence the soil's <span class="highlight">physical</span> and chemical characteristics. In fact, for <span class="highlight">mature</span> soils in many parts of the world, the <span class="highlight">predominant</span> type of natural <span class="highlight">vegetation</span> is considered the most important direct influence on soil characteristics. For this <span class="highlight">reason</span>, a soil scientist can tell a great <span class="highlight">deal</span> about the <span class="highlight question1">attributes</span> of the soil in any <span class="highlight">given</span> area <span class="highlight">simply</span> form knowing what kind of <span class="highlight">flora</span> the soil supports. Thus prairies and <span class="highlight">tundra</span> regions, which have <span class="highlight">characteristic</span> vegetations, also have <span class="highlight">characteristic</span> soils.</p>
          <p>The <span class="highlight">quantity</span> and total weight of soil <span class="highlight">flora</span> generally <span class="highlight">exceed</span> that of soil <span class="highlight">fauna</span>. By far the most <span class="highlight">numerous</span> and smallest of the plants living in soil are <span class="highlight">bacteria</span>. Under <span class="highlight">favorable</span> conditions, a million or more of these tiny, single-celled plants can <span class="highlight">inhabit</span> each cubic centimeter of soil. It is the <span class="highlight">bacteria</span>, more than any other organisms, that enable rock or other parent <span class="highlight">material</span> to <span class="highlight">undergo</span> the <span class="highlight">gradual</span> <span class="highlight">transformation</span> to soil. Some <span class="highlight">bacteria</span> produce <span class="highlight">organic</span> acids that directly attack parent <span class="highlight">material</span>, breaking it down and releasing plant nutrients. Others <span class="highlight">decompose</span> <span class="highlight">organic</span> <span class="highlight">litter</span> (<span class="highlight">debris</span>) to form <span class="highlight">humus</span> (nutrient-rich <span class="highlight">organic</span> matter). A third group of <span class="highlight">bacteria</span> inhabits the <span class="highlight">root</span> systems of plants called legumes. These include many important agricultural crops, such as <span class="highlight">alfalfa</span>, clover, soybeans, peas, and peanuts. <span class="question3">The <span class="highlight">bacteria</span> that legumes <span class="highlight">host</span> <span class="highlight">within</span> their <span class="highlight">root</span> nodules (small swellings on the <span class="highlight">root</span>) change <span class="highlight">nitrogen</span> gas from the <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span> into <span class="highlight">nitrogen</span> compounds that plants are able to metabolize, a <span class="highlight">process</span>, known as <span class="highlight">nitrogen</span> fixation, that makes the soil more <span class="highlight">fertile</span>.</span> Other <span class="highlight">microscopic</span> plants also are important in soil <span class="highlight">development</span>. For example, in highly <span class="highlight">acidic</span> soils where few <span class="highlight">bacteria</span> can <span class="highlight">survive</span>, <span class="highlight">fungi</span> frequently become the <span class="highlight">chief</span> decomposers of <span class="highlight">organic</span> matter.</p>
          <p>More <span class="highlight">complex</span> forms of <span class="highlight">vegetation</span> play several <span class="highlight">vital</span> roles with <span class="highlight">respect</span> to the soil. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> Tress, grass, and other large plants <span class="highlight">supply</span> the <span class="highlight"><span class="question6">bulk</span></span> of the soil's <span class="highlight">humus</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> The minerals released as these plants <span class="highlight">decompose</span> on the surface <span class="highlight">constitute</span> an important <span class="highlight">nutrient</span> <span class="highlight">source</span> for succeeding generations of plants as well as for other soil organisms. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span> In <span class="highlight">addition</span>, trees can <span class="highlight">extend</span> their roots deep <span class="highlight">within</span> the soil and bring up nutrients from far below the surface. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span> These nutrients <span class="highlight">eventually</span> <span class="highlight">enrich</span> the surface soil when the tree drops its leaves or when it dies and decomposes. Finally, trees <span class="highlight">perform</span> the <span class="highlight">vital</span> <span class="highlight">function</span> of slowing water <span class="highlight">runoff</span> and holding the soil in place with their <span class="highlight">root</span> systems, thus combating <span class="highlight">erosion</span>. The increased <span class="highlight">erosion</span> that often accompanies agricultural use of sloping land is <span class="highlight">principally</span> caused by the <span class="highlight">removal</span> of its protective cover of natural <span class="highlight">vegetation</span>.</p>
          <p>Animals also influence soil <span class="highlight">composition</span>. The faunal counterparts of <span class="highlight">bacteria</span> are protozoa. These single-celled organisms are the most <span class="highlight">numerous</span> representatives of the animal <span class="highlight">kingdom</span>, and, like <span class="highlight">bacteria</span>, a million or more can sometimes <span class="highlight">inhabit</span> each cubic centimeter of soil. Protozoa feed on <span class="highlight">organic</span> matter and <span class="highlight"><span class="question9">hasten</span></span> its <span class="highlight">decomposition</span>. Among other soil-dwelling animals, the earthworm is probably the most important. Under exceptionally <span class="highlight">favorable</span> conditions, up to a million earthworms (with a total body weight exceeding 450 kilograms) may <span class="highlight">inhabit</span> an <span class="highlight">acre</span> of soil. Earthworms <span class="highlight">ingest</span> large quantities of soil, chemically <span class="highlight">alter</span> it, and excrete it as <span class="highlight">organic</span> matter called casts. The casts form a high-quality natural <span class="highlight">fertilizer</span>. In <span class="highlight">addition</span>, earthworms mix of soil both <span class="highlight">vertically</span> and horizontally, improving aeration and <span class="highlight">drainage</span>.</p>
          <p>Insects such as ants and termites also can be <span class="highlight"><span class="question11">exceedingly</span></span> <span class="highlight">numerous</span> under <span class="highlight">favorable</span> <span class="highlight">climatic</span> and soil conditions. In <span class="highlight">addition</span>, mammals such as moles, <span class="highlight">field</span> <span class="highlight">mice</span>, gophers, and <span class="highlight">prairie</span> dogs sometimes are present in <span class="highlight">sufficient</span> numbers to have <span class="highlight">significant</span> <span class="highlight">impact</span> on the soil. These animals <span class="highlight">primarily</span> work the soil mechanically. As a result, the soil is aerated broken up, <span class="highlight">fertilized</span>, and brought to the surface, hastening soil <span class="highlight">development</span>.</p>

              <p>The keywords in this question are trees and beneficial other plants. Based on these two words, the original text is found out. From the More complex forms of vegetation, several vital roles with respect to the soil are begun. The first point is the minerals that are decomposed. To provide nutrition, the second point is that the roots can bring the deep underground nutrients to the surface, and the third point is to slow down the flow rate of the water and prevent soil erosion. There are in addition and finally instructions in the original text, very clear. This question A option meets the second point, correct. Option B contradicts the second point and does not send nutrition to the ground; Option C is not mentioned here; Option D says that after the trees have died, they can make room for the later trees, and there is no mention of it.</p>

            <div class="explanation">
              <p>According to the effect of vegetation on soil, the problem is: The increased erosion that often accompanies agricultural use of sloping land is principally caused by the removal of its protective cover of natural vegetation. The slope of the crop that removed the vegetation protection layer is very Easily eroded. This shows that only plants can help prevent the slope from collapsing. Option A says that the roots of most crops cannot stop water and soil loss. It is in accordance with the original text. Option B says that without the root of the tree, the water flow disappears, and it is not right; Option C says that the root will remove surface water and allow the soil to dry out, which is not stated in the original text; Option D says that there is no vegetation and the arable land from which vegetation has been removed. It is easier to be eroded than it is. There is no mention in this original and no comparison is possible.</p>

              <p>Look at the sentences that need to be inserted and look for potential references that may be present before and after. Nutrients obtained by these deep roots nourish the trees and are preserved within them. The main effect of this sentence is that the nutrients developed into the depths of the ground provide nutrients to the trees and are preserved in the trees. First of all, we can find that the word deep roots is used to indicate that deep roots should be mentioned in the previous sentence. Then this sentence is a general conclusion sentence, which is likely to continue to talk about nuttrients and trees. Based on these two points, we tried every insertion position and found that the last position was the best. Not only do you have deep roots in front of you, but you can also echo them at the beginning or after the nutrients. Select D.</p>
