The <span class="highlight">numerous</span> plants and animals living in the soil <span class="highlight">release</span> minerals from the parent <span class="highlight">material</span> from which soil is formed, <span class="highlight">supply</span><span class="highlight">organic</span> matter, aid in the translocation (movement) and aeration of the soil, and help protect the soil from <span class="highlight">erosion</span>. The types of organisms growing or living in the soil greatly influence the soil's <span class="highlight">physical</span> and chemical characteristics. In fact, for <span class="highlight">mature</span> soils in many parts of the world, the <span class="highlight">predominant</span> type of natural <span class="highlight">vegetation</span> is considered the most important direct influence on soil characteristics. For this <span class="highlight">reason</span>, a soil scientist can tell a great <span class="highlight">deal</span> about the <span class="highlight question1">attributes</span> of the soil in any <span class="highlight">given</span> area <span class="highlight">simply</span> form knowing what kind of <span class="highlight">flora</span> the soil supports. Thus prairies and <span class="highlight">tundra</span> regions, which have <span class="highlight">characteristic</span> vegetations, also have <span class="highlight">characteristic</span> soils.</p><p>The <span class="highlight">quantity</span> and total weight of soil <span class="highlight">flora</span> generally <span class="highlight">exceed</span> that of soil <span class="highlight">fauna</span>. By far the most <span class="highlight">numerous</span> and smallest of the plants living in soil are <span class="highlight">bacteria</span>. Under <span class="highlight">favorable</span> conditions, a million or more of these tiny, single-celled plants can <span class="highlight">inhabit</span> each cubic centimeter of soil. It is the <span class="highlight">bacteria</span>, more than any other organisms, that enable rock or other parent <span class="highlight">material</span> to <span class="highlight">undergo</span> the <span class="highlight">gradual</span><span class="highlight">transformation</span> to soil. Some <span class="highlight">bacteria</span> produce <span class="highlight">organic</span> acids that directly attack parent <span class="highlight">material</span>, breaking it down and releasing plant nutrients. Others <span class="highlight">decompose</span><span class="highlight">organic</span><span class="highlight">litter</span> (<span class="highlight">debris</span>) to form <span class="highlight">humus</span> (nutrient-rich <span class="highlight">organic</span> matter). A third group of <span class="highlight">bacteria</span> inhabits the <span class="highlight">root</span> systems of plants called legumes. These include many important agricultural crops, such as <span class="highlight">alfalfa</span>, clover, soybeans, peas, and peanuts. <span class="question3">The <span class="highlight">bacteria</span> that legumes <span class="highlight">host</span><span class="highlight">within</span> their <span class="highlight">root</span> nodules (small swellings on the <span class="highlight">root</span>) change <span class="highlight">nitrogen</span> gas from the <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span> into <span class="highlight">nitrogen</span> compounds that plants are able to metabolize, a <span class="highlight">process</span>, known as <span class="highlight">nitrogen</span> fixation, that makes the soil more <span class="highlight">fertile</span>.</span> Other <span class="highlight">microscopic</span> plants also are important in soil <span class="highlight">development</span>. For example, in highly <span class="highlight">acidic</span> soils where few <span class="highlight">bacteria</span> can <span class="highlight">survive</span>, <span class="highlight">fungi</span> frequently become the <span class="highlight">chief</span> decomposers of <span class="highlight">organic</span> matter.</p><p>More <span class="highlight">complex</span> forms of <span class="highlight">vegetation</span> play several <span class="highlight">vital</span> roles with <span class="highlight">respect</span> to the soil. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> Tress, grass, and other large plants <span class="highlight">supply</span> the <span class="highlight"><span class="question6">bulk</span></span> of the soil's <span class="highlight">humus</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> The minerals released as these plants <span class="highlight">decompose</span> on the surface <span class="highlight">constitute</span> an important <span class="highlight">nutrient</span><span class="highlight">source</span> for succeeding generations of plants as well as for other soil organisms. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span> In <span class="highlight">addition</span>, trees can <span class="highlight">extend</span> their roots deep <span class="highlight">within</span> the soil and bring up nutrients from far below the surface. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span> These nutrients <span class="highlight">eventually</span><span class="highlight">enrich</span> the surface soil when the tree drops its leaves or when it dies and decomposes. Finally, trees <span class="highlight">perform</span> the <span class="highlight">vital</span><span class="highlight">function</span> of slowing water <span class="highlight">runoff</span> and holding the soil in place with their <span class="highlight">root</span> systems, thus combating <span class="highlight">erosion</span>. The increased <span class="highlight">erosion</span> that often accompanies agricultural use of sloping land is <span class="highlight">principally</span> caused by the <span class="highlight">removal</span> of its protective cover of natural <span class="highlight">vegetation</span>.</p><p>Animals also influence soil <span class="highlight">composition</span>. The faunal counterparts of <span class="highlight">bacteria</span> are protozoa. These single-celled organisms are the most <span class="highlight">numerous</span> representatives of the animal <span class="highlight">kingdom</span>, and, like <span class="highlight">bacteria</span>, a million or more can sometimes <span class="highlight">inhabit</span> each cubic centimeter of soil. Protozoa feed on <span class="highlight">organic</span> matter and <span class="highlight"><span class="question9">hasten</span></span> its <span class="highlight">decomposition</span>. Among other soil-dwelling animals, the earthworm is probably the most important. Under exceptionally <span class="highlight">favorable</span> conditions, up to a million earthworms (with a total body weight exceeding 450 kilograms) may <span class="highlight">inhabit</span> an <span class="highlight">acre</span> of soil. Earthworms <span class="highlight">ingest</span> large quantities of soil, chemically <span class="highlight">alter</span> it, and excrete it as <span class="highlight">organic</span> matter called casts. The casts form a high-quality natural <span class="highlight">fertilizer</span>. In <span class="highlight">addition</span>, earthworms mix of soil both <span class="highlight">vertically</span> and horizontally, improving aeration and <span class="highlight">drainage</span>.</p><p>Insects such as ants and termites also can be <span class="highlight"><span class="question11">exceedingly</span></span><span class="highlight">numerous</span> under <span class="highlight">favorable</span><span class="highlight">climatic</span> and soil conditions. In <span class="highlight">addition</span>, mammals such as moles, <span class="highlight">field</span><span class="highlight">mice</span>, gophers, and <span class="highlight">prairie</span> dogs sometimes are present in <span class="highlight">sufficient</span> numbers to have <span class="highlight">significant</span><span class="highlight">impact</span> on the soil. These animals <span class="highlight">primarily</span> work the soil mechanically. As a result, the soil is aerated broken up, <span class="highlight">fertilized</span>, and brought to the surface, hastening soil <span class="highlight">development</span>.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">attributes</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. properties</p><p>B. surrounding</p><p>C. sources</p><p>D. nutrients</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>For this reason, a soil scientist can tell a great deal about the attributes of the soil in any given area simply form knowing what kind of flora the soil supports. The scientist can tell a lot about the soil composition in any area, simply relying on the vegetation above it.

The kind of vegetation associated with the soil.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The key words of this question are: most important and in determining the characteristics of a mature soil, according to the phrase positioning back to the original sentence: In fact, for mature soils in many parts of the world, the predominant type of natural vegetation is considered the most The main implication of this sentence is: In fact, for mature soils in many places, the dominant species in natural vegetation are considered to exert the most direct and direct impact on soil characteristics. Option D says that the soil-related plants are correct; the minerals of option A, the erosion of the surrounding land of option B, and the amount of air of option C have nothing to do with the original text.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways of leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Legumes make the soil more fertile by hosting bacteria in their root nodules.</p><p>B. Nitrogen fixation makes compounds that plants and bacteria in legumes can metabolize.</p><p>C. Bacteria living in the roots of legumes makes the soil more fertile by producing nitrogen compounds that plants can metabolize.</p><p>D. The root nodules of legumes contain bacteria, nitrogen gas from the atmosphere, and nitrogen compounds that plants can metabolize.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Targeting the highlighted sentence in this article: The bacteria that legumes host within their root nodules (small swellings on the root) change nitrogen gas from the atmosphere into nitrogen compounds that plants are able to metabolize, a process, known as nitrogen fixation, that Makes the soil more fertile. This sentence is about the nitrogen fixation of a bacterium that is symbiotic with legumes. This bacteria can turn nitrogen in the air into nitrogenous compounds that allow plants to be metabolized. Option C is synonymous, correct. Option A says that the beans make the soil more nutritious and wrong by raising bacteria in the root lumps; option B says that the nutrients produced by the nitrogen fixation can be used by both plants and bacteria, but it is only possible that plants, that is, beans, can be used; D said that there were bacteria, air and nitrogen compounds in the lump of the roots of the beans. The original did not say that there was air, and it was wrong. Select C.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 2, which of the following statements about soil creation is true?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

Trees make deep-lying nutrients available to plants whose roots do not extend very far into the soil.</p><p>B. When trees decompose, they release nutrients minerals deep into the soil.</p><p>C. Humus from trees provides nutrients for plants with roots that extend deep within the soil.</p><p>D. When trees die and decompose, they make available a large space for generations of other plants to grow.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The keywords in this question are trees and beneficial other plants. Based on these two words, the original text is found out. From the More complex forms of vegetation, several vital roles with respect to the soil are begun. The first point is the minerals that are decomposed. To provide nutrition, the second point is that the roots can bring the deep underground nutrients to the surface, and the third point is to slow down the flow rate of the water and prevent soil erosion. There are in addition and finally instructions in the original text, very clear. This question A option meets the second point, correct. Option B contradicts the second point and does not send nutrition to the ground; Option C is not mentioned here; Option D says that after the trees have died, they can make room for the later trees, and there is no mention of it.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Paragraph 3 supports which of the following inferences about the effect of vegetation on soil?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The root systems of most crops are unable to prevent erosion on sloping ground.</p><p>B. Without a cover of vegetation, fast running water is likely to disappear from the ground surface before it can erode much of the soil.</p><p>C. The roots of trees and other large plants remove much water from the ground, making the soil dry and likely to be eroded by the wind.</p><p>D. Areas that naturally have little vegetation, such as deserts, are more easily eroded than is agricultural land that has been cleared of its natural vegetation.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>According to the effect of vegetation on soil, the problem is: The increased erosion that often accompanies agricultural use of sloping land is principally caused by the removal of its protective cover of natural vegetation. The slope of the crop that removed the vegetation protection layer is very Easily eroded. This shows that only plants can help prevent the slope from collapsing. Option A says that the roots of most crops cannot stop water and soil loss. It is in accordance with the original text. Option B says that without the root of the tree, the water flow disappears, and it is not right; Option C says that the root will remove surface water and allow the soil to dry out, which is not stated in the original text; Option D says that there is no vegetation and the arable land from which vegetation has been removed. It is easier to be eroded than it is.
