            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.24" data-time="5.07">[00:05.07]</span>Student: Hi. Professor Jones. Thanks for seeing me.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.61" data-time="8.31">[00:08.31]</span>Professor: No problem, Laura. How was your summer <span class="highlight">break</span>?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.48" data-time="10.92">[00:10.92]</span>Student: It was great! But the fact is it's made me reconsider my <span class="highlight">academic</span> plans.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.9" data-time="17.4">[00:17.40]</span>Professor: Oh, really? Nothing too <span class="highlight">dramatic</span>, I hope.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.58" data-time="20.3">[00:20.30]</span>Student: No, no. At <span class="highlight">least</span> I hope not.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.32" data-time="23.88">[00:23.88]</span>Professor: What do you mean exactly?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.97" data-time="26.2">[00:26.20]</span>Student: Well, I just spent the summer working on a Native American <span class="highlight">reservation</span>, a Navajo <span class="highlight">reservation</span> in Arizona. <span class="time" data-times="6.74" data-time="33.17">[00:33.17]</span>And I was fascinated, so now I want to study the Navajo language, uh, their <span class="highlight">history</span>, <span class="highlight">religion</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.2" data-time="39.91">[00:39.91]</span>I want to go back next summer too. <span class="time" data-times="5.43" data-time="42.11">[00:42.11]</span>And maybe <span class="highlight">even</span> spend a <span class="highlight">semester</span> there, some kind of <span class="highlight">internship</span> or <span class="highlight">independent</span> study?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.37" data-time="47.54">[00:47.54]</span>Professor: Wow! Sounds like you are really enthusiastic, but you were majoring in <span class="highlight">sociology</span>, and I <span class="highlight">seem</span> to <span class="highlight">recall</span> that for your <span class="highlight">senior</span> <span class="highlight">project</span>, you were doing something with education?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="12.65" data-time="57.91">[00:57.91]</span>Student: Right. I have done some research on the public schools in the northeastern states, how they've been affected by changes in <span class="highlight">population</span>, uh, immigration trends, during the past fifty years. <span class="time" data-times="4.7" data-time="70.56">[01:10.56]</span>But now I really want to study the <span class="highlight">culture</span> of the Navajo people.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.33" data-time="75.26">[01:15.26]</span>Professor: Well, there are a <span class="highlight">couple</span> of options depending on your priorities. <span class="time" data-times="3.76" data-time="80.59">[01:20.59]</span>Say, how did you end up on a <span class="highlight">reservation</span> in Arizona anyway?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.26" data-time="84.35">[01:24.35]</span>Student: Well, a friend of <span class="highlight">mine</span> took a job there, in a summer school program. <span class="time" data-times="1.93" data-time="88.61">[01:28.61]</span>And they had another opening. <span class="time" data-times="1.88" data-time="90.54">[01:30.54]</span>Someone cancelled at the last <span class="highlight">minute</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.12" data-time="92.42">[01:32.42]</span>I thought it would be just a big <span class="highlight">adventure</span>, but it turned out to be much more than that.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.51" data-time="97.54">[01:37.54]</span>Professor: I see. Well, anyway...as I am saying, your options <span class="highlight">depend</span> on what your priorities are and on exactly what you want to study.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.45" data-time="107.05">[01:47.05]</span>Student: Uh, like I said...Navajo <span class="highlight">culture</span>?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.3" data-time="110.5">[01:50.50]</span>Professor: Well, let's see if we can be more <span class="highlight">specific</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.2" data-time="112.8">[01:52.80]</span>If you want to study the Navajo language, learn about their <span class="highlight">religion</span>, their <span class="highlight">history</span>, that's part of cultural <span class="highlight">anthropology</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.59" data-time="120">[02:00.00]</span>Student: No. I really don't want to change majors at this point. <span class="time" data-times="4.1" data-time="123.59">[02:03.59]</span>I love <span class="highlight">sociology</span> and I really want to graduate in four years.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.26" data-time="127.69">[02:07.69]</span>Professor: Okay. Now I see what your priorities are. <span class="time" data-times="13.48" data-time="130.95">[02:10.95]</span>So from a sociological <span class="highlight">perspective</span>, since you are interested in education, you can stay with that, change your research topic to the Native American experience with public education, the effect it had. <span class="time" data-times="8.31" data-time="144.43">[02:24.43]</span>And you could take <span class="highlight">sociology</span> courses on <span class="highlight">religion</span> or the role of minorities in society, again, focusing your research on the Navajo.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.77" data-time="152.74">[02:32.74]</span>Student: Um...l hadn't thought about that <span class="highlight">angle</span>. <span class="time" data-times="1.81" data-time="155.51">[02:35.51]</span>Sounds <span class="highlight">intriguing</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.98" data-time="157.32">[02:37.32]</span>And all the courses I have already taken would still <span class="highlight">count</span> toward my <span class="highlight">degree</span>?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.38" data-time="162.3">[02:42.30]</span>Professor: I have to <span class="highlight">check</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.48" data-time="163.68">[02:43.68]</span>And <span class="highlight">remind</span> me to plan carefully to make sure all your <span class="highlight">degree</span> requirements are met, but I don't see any problems.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="170.16">[02:50.16]</span>Student: Great! And then I can pick up the language and <span class="highlight">culture</span> courses as electives.</p>
