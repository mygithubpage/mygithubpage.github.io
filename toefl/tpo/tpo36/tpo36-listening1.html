Now I see what your priorities are. <span class="time" data-times="13.48" data-time="130.95">[02:10.95]</span>So from a sociological <span class="highlight">perspective</span>, since you are interested in education, you can stay with that, change your research topic to the Native American experience with public education, the effect it had. <span class="time" data-times="8.31" data-time="144.43">[02:24.43]</span>And you could take <span class="highlight">sociology</span> courses on <span class="highlight">religion</span> or the role of minorities in society, again, focusing your research on the Navajo.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.77" data-time="152.74">[02:32.74]</span>Student: Um...l hadn't thought about that <span class="highlight">angle</span>. <span class="time" data-times="1.81" data-time="155.51">[02:35.51]</span>Sounds <span class="highlight">intriguing</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.98" data-time="157.32">[02:37.32]</span>And all the courses I have already taken would still <span class="highlight">count</span> toward my <span class="highlight">degree</span>?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="1.38" data-time="162.3">[02:42.30]</span>Professor: I have to <span class="highlight">check</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.48" data-time="163.68">[02:43.68]</span>And <span class="highlight">remind</span> me to plan carefully to make sure all your <span class="highlight">degree</span> requirements are met, but I don't see any problems.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="170.16">[02:50.16]</span>Student: Great!

To compare requirements in the sociology and anthropology departments.</p><p>B. To get advice about changing her major.</p><p>C. To find out how to incorporate a new interest into her academic program.</p><p>D. To discuss the possibility of doing research on a Navajo reservation.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The questions are here: Well, I just spent the summer working on a Native American reservation, a Navajo reservation in Arizona. And I was fascinated, so now I want to study the Navajo language, uh, their history, religion. I Want to go back next summer too. And maybe even spend a semester there, some kind of internship or independent study? The topic of the question asked, the girl's remarks indicated that she worked in a local US sanctuary for the summer vacation, to the local Navajo The language has developed interest, so I would like to have an internship or study during the summer vacation the following year. Option C says that girls want to add a new interest in the learning project. From the following we know that girls do not want to change their majors, nor do they want to discuss doing research in Navajo. Options B and D are incorrect; Option A does not mention them at all. Select C.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the woman say about her summer experience?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. She spent a semester preparing for it.</p><p>B. She did not expect it to be very important to her.</p><p>C. It was her first job as a teacher.</p><p>D. It required her to use her knowledge of the Navajo language and culture.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The title of the question lies here: No. I really don't want to change majors at this point. I love sociology and I really want to graduate in four years. The girls don't want to change their profession because she's just talking to Navajo's language. A little interest in history and culture is not enough to replace the sociology she is currently learning. So Option B she did not expect how important this interest was to her and was correct. The other three options did not appear in the dialogue. Select B.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the woman mention her friend?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To explain how she got her summer job.</p><p>B. To emphasize how many people she met on the Navajo reservation.</p><p>C. To point out that her friend is studying the Navajo language and culture.</p><p>D. It required her to use her knowledge of the Navajo language and culture anthropology department.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The issue of the ontology is: Well, a friend of mine took a job there, in a summer school program. And they had another opening. Someone cancelled at the last minute. I thought it would be just a big adventure, but it turned Out to be much more than that. From here you can see that it was the girl who had a friend working there and someone had withdrawn at the last minute before she entered. So Option A explains how girls find the job. The other three options do not match the meaning of the dialogue. Option A.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor mention the effect of education on Native American societies?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To indicate the content of a course he thinks the woman should take.</p><p>B. To learn more about the woman's experiences over the summer.</p><p>C. To describe a research project he thinks the woman would find interesting.</p><p>D. To show his approval of the woman's career goals.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The question title for this question is: So from a sociological perspective, since you are interested in education, you can stay with that, change your research topic to the Native American experience with public education, the effect it had. The girl's tutor put forward her opinion on her next summer program. According to her new interests and she didn't want to abandon her major, she proposed the subject of public education and its effect. So Option C he put forward a research topic that he thinks women are interested in is correct. The other three options do not meet the original meaning. Select C.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the woman imply when she says this:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. She has completed most of the research that was required for her project.</p><p>B. She has not done much research yet and so does not mind changing the focus of her project.</p><p>C. She is disappointed that the professor is unfamiliar with her research topic.</p><p>D. She believes public schools in the northeastern states were only slightly changed due to immigration.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The problem of this question is:</p><p>Professor:</p><p>Wow! Sounds like you are really enthusiastic, but you were majoring in sociology, and I seem to recall that for your senior project, you were doing something with education?</p><p>Student:</p><p>Right now. I have done some research on the public schools in the northeastern states, how they've been affected by changes in population, uh, immigration trends, during the past fifty years. But now I really want to study the culture of the Navajo People.</p><p>The general meaning of this dialogue is: The teacher knows that after all, the girl majored in sociology, she asked her how much research she has done on pedagogy. The girl answered that she did some research, but now she really wants to study the culture of Navajo people. Option B did not do much research, so she didn't mind changing the topic. The other three options do not match the original. Select B.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
