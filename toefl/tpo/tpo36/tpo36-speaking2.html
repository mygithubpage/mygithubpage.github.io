Other people buy fresh food and prepare meals themselves. Which do you prefer? Explain why, using details and examples in your answer.</p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>I would rather buy fresh food and prepare it myself. First, food which is already prepared will be much more expensive than raw material because labor cost keeps increasing nowadays. And prepare those food material won't cost us too much time. Second, sometimes food material prepared by others can be unhealthy or even harmful to our health, because addictive and preservative will be added into food during the process. These substance are used to make food look like it is still in good conditions. If we buy raw material and handle it ourselves, we can avoid this kind of bad things. So prepare food ourselves is better compared with getting processed food.</p></article></div></main></body></html>
