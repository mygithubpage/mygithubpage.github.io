Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. </p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>Along with the rapid development of our society, people tend to attach more and more importance to education. The government also consider to increase the budget in education area while they come across a problem: which stage of education should be given more money, primary education or college education? Frankly speaking, I suppose that college students need more investment than pupils. My arguments are stated below:</p><p>First of all, college education requires much more expensive equipment than primary schools. Fundamental education only involves in the teaching of basic knowledge. Take physics as an example, elementary physics classes about force of friction only need several small sliders and a long wooden board. This won't cost too much. Plus, the task of fundamental education aims largely on helping kids form good life and learning habits as well as cooperation and communication. In college, students will focus on cultivating professional knowledge and skills in order to make themselves qualified in future jobs. Take physics again. Different from fundamental physics, college physics involves advanced techniques which need precise instrument as well as expensive experimental material. Laser device or electron emission instrument in laboratory will cost a large sum of money let alone those consumables. Therefore, objectively college education has a big demand in budget.</p><p>In addition, parents typically are more willing to spend money on little kids rather than on their adult ones. Domestic education investment more frequently flow to the younger due to the widespread conviction that parents should never let their kids lose at the beginning. However, a large proportion of college students still need further financial support because their major owns a long-term cultivating circle. Surgeons and attorneys may be able to earn their living after they get doctor's degree. So it can be tough for these students if the government offers little help.</p><p>Last but not least, investing money into universities can get quicker returns because the interval between university students get trained and get jobs is shorter than primary students. More specifically, if the government pays for a group of college students to learn accounting, four years later they can serve as skilled accountants; however, if the government put these money into the math tutoring for primary students, it will cost longer than one decade for them to get outstanding math talents, let alone not all of these pupils will choose math-related major in their future.</p><p>Indeed, both fundamental education and college education are important for a country. But considering various factors including demands and returns, universities rather than primary schools actually require more investment. (426 words)</p></article></div></main></body></html>
