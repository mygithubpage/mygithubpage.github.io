              <span class="time" data-times="4.34" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in a <span class="underline">biology</span> class.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.61" data-time="4.34">[00:04.34]</span>Professor: OK. Back in the 1930's, a biologist named G.F. Gause first proposed what's known as "Gause's hypothesis".</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="18.49" data-time="13.95">[00:13.95]</span>Gause said that whenever you've got two <span class="underline">similar</span> <span class="underline">species</span> <span class="underline">competing</span> for the <span class="underline">exact</span> same limited resources, one of them will have some <span class="underline">sort</span> of <span class="underline">advantage</span>, however <span class="underline">slight</span> that'll <span class="underline">eventually</span> enable this <span class="underline">species</span> to <span class="underline">dominate</span> and <span class="underline">ultimately</span> <span class="underline">exclude</span> the other one, <span class="underline">even</span> cause it to become <span class="underline">extinct</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.22" data-time="32.44">[00:32.44]</span>That's why Gause's <span class="underline">hypothesis</span> came to be called "The <span class="underline">competitive</span> exclusion principle".</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.33" data-time="38.66">[00:38.66]</span>Gause did some lab experiments like placing two Paramecium <span class="underline">species</span> in the same environment where they would have to <span class="underline">compete</span> for the same food. <span class="time" data-times="11.08" data-time="46.99">[00:46.99]</span>He found that, over time, one <span class="underline">species</span> was <span class="underline">consistently</span> able to <span class="underline">drive</span> out the other, to <span class="underline">eliminate</span> it from the <span class="underline">habitat</span>, just as his <span class="underline">hypothesis</span> predicted.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="18.02" data-time="58.07">[00:58.07]</span>Now, one of the early criticisms of Gause's <span class="underline">hypothesis</span> was that: "sure, it works in simple lab experiments where you have just two <span class="underline">competing</span> <span class="underline">species</span> in a controlled environment, but the <span class="underline">hypothesis</span> falls apart when applied to natural ecosystems where things are more complex".</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.54" data-time="76.09">[01:16.09]</span>Now, it's true that in the real world there are lots of examples that <span class="underline">seem</span> to <span class="underline">contradict</span> the <span class="underline">hypothesis</span>. <span class="time" data-times="19.43" data-time="82.63">[01:22.63]</span>For example, in the forest of New England, in the northeastern United States, there are some small songbirds called wobblers and right in the same area you've got five <span class="underline">species</span> of wobbler, all about the same size and all having <span class="underline">similar</span> diets of insects, uh, insects that are found on and around trees. <span class="time" data-times="4.02" data-time="102.06">[01:42.06]</span>Yet, these five wobbler <span class="underline">species</span> all managed to <span class="underline">coexist</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.81" data-time="106.08">[01:46.08]</span>There is no dominance, no exclusion of one <span class="underline">species</span> by another.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.78" data-time="110.89">[01:50.89]</span>How is this possible?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.45" data-time="112.67">[01:52.67]</span>Well, turns out that one wobbler <span class="underline">species</span> feeds in the <span class="underline">uppermost</span> branches, while others <span class="underline">favor</span> the middle branches and others feed toward the bottom of the tree. <span class="time" data-times="5.53" data-time="123.12">[02:03.12]</span>Also, each wobbler <span class="underline">species</span> breeds at a different time of year. <span class="time" data-times="9.56" data-time="128.65">[02:08.65]</span>This way the period of <span class="underline">peak</span> food requirement, um, when the birds are feeding their chicks, varies from one <span class="underline">species</span> to the next.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.57" data-time="138.21">[02:18.21]</span>Yes, Mark?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.97" data-time="139.78">[02:19.78]</span>Student: But does that really <span class="underline">contradict</span> Gause's <span class="underline">hypothesis</span>? <span class="time" data-times="5.17" data-time="143.75">[02:23.75]</span>Because, I mean, are those different wobbler <span class="underline">species</span> really <span class="underline">competing</span> for the same food? <span class="time" data-times="1.36" data-time="148.92">[02:28.92]</span>I don't think so. <span class="time" data-times="5.96" data-time="150.28">[02:30.28]</span>I think they're more like, you know, almost cooperating so that they don't have to <span class="underline">compete</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.82" data-time="156.24">[02:36.24]</span>Professor: Excellent! To the <span class="underline">casual</span> observer, the wobblers do <span class="underline">seem</span> to <span class="underline">contradict</span> Gause's <span class="underline">hypothesis</span> since they all live in the same place and eat the same types of insects.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="15.02" data-time="166.06">[02:46.06]</span>But if you <span class="underline">observe</span> these birds more closely, the wobbler <span class="underline">species</span> are not really <span class="underline">competing</span> with one another for the <span class="underline">exact</span> same food at the <span class="underline">exact</span> same time, which brings us to a really important <span class="underline">concept</span> in ecology: the <span class="underline">niche</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.13" data-time="181.08">[03:01.08]</span>Mark, can you tell us what an <span class="underline">ecological</span> <span class="underline">niche</span> is?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.1" data-time="185.21">[03:05.21]</span>Student: The place where the plant or animal lives, you know, its <span class="underline">habitat</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.46" data-time="189.31">[03:09.31]</span>Professor: For example?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.08" data-time="191.77">[03:11.77]</span>Student: Like the <span class="underline">polar</span> <span class="underline">bear</span> living in the <span class="underline">Arctic</span> on the ice sheet. <span class="time" data-times="3.92" data-time="194.85">[03:14.85]</span>The Artie is its <span class="underline">niche</span>, the <span class="underline">habitat</span> it's adapted to <span class="underline">survive</span> in.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.03" data-time="198.77">[03:18.77]</span>Professor: Okay. That's what most people think of.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="14.05" data-time="201.8">[03:21.80]</span>But for biologists, the <span class="underline">concept</span> of a <span class="underline">niche</span> also includes the way an <span class="underline">organism</span> functions in its <span class="underline">habitat</span>, how it interacts with other plant and animal <span class="underline">species</span>, with the soil, the <span class="underline">air</span>, the water and so on.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.19" data-time="215.85">[03:35.85]</span>Okay. Now let's put it all together.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.68" data-time="219.04">[03:39.04]</span>If you have two <span class="underline">similar</span> <span class="underline">species</span> <span class="underline">competing</span> in the same <span class="underline">niche</span>, what's going to happen? Susan?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.08" data-time="225.72">[03:45.72]</span>Student: One will <span class="underline">dominate</span> the other and <span class="underline">eventually</span> <span class="underline">eliminate</span> it.</p>

              <span class="time" data-times="4.64" data-time="230.7">[03:50.70]</span>So what could the weaker <span class="underline">species</span> do to <span class="underline">improve</span> its chances of <span class="underline">survival</span>?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.65" data-time="235.34">[03:55.34]</span>Student: Maybe just move to some other area, you know, away from the competitor.</p>
