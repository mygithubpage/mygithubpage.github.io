To explain why a species of warbler might become extinct.</p><p>B. To discuss the evidence that led Gause to formulate his hypothesis.</p><p>C. To examine a hypothesis about what happens when species compete.</p><p>D. To identify factors that allow some species to dominate others.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The subject of this question is: Gause said that whenever you've got two similar species competing for the exact same limited resources, one of them will have some sort of advantage, then slight that'll eventually enable this species to dominant and as The other one, even cause it to become extinct. That's why Gause's hypothesis came to be called 'The obligation exclusion principle.' The general meaning of this long paragraph is: Gause makes a hypothesis that it is in the same ecological environment. Two similar species that would compete for the same resources would compete with each other, regardless of the slight differences between them, and in the end there would be one species that killed another relatively weak one, and even led to its extinction. The verification experiment we can see that the main idea of the lecture is to verify the hypothesis of this species' competition, Option C is correct, and there is no basis for the other three options.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to Gause's hypothesis, what happens when two similar species compete for limited resources in the same habitat?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Both species will develop new nutritional requirements.</p><p>B. Both species will change their behaviors.</p><p>C. One of the species will eliminate the other from the habitat.</p><p>D. One of the species will spread into a new habitat.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The question is: Gause did some lab experiments like placing two Paramecium species in the same environment where they would have compete for the same food. He found that, over time, one species was named able to drive out the other, To eliminate it from the habitat, just as his hypothesis predicted. In fact, this question can also be made based on the first question. Gause's hypothesis is that two similar species compete and one squeezes the other. The outcome is what Option C says. The other three options are not in line with the original text. Select C.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>How do the five species of warbler described by the professor manage to coexist?

By eating different kinds of insects.</p><p>D. By breeding at different times of the year</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="BD"><p>The subject of this question is: Well, turns out that one wobbler species feeds in the uppermost branches, while others favor the middle branches and others feed toward the bottom of the tree. Also, each wobbler species breeds at a different time of year. This way the period of peak food requirement, um, when the birds are feeding their chicks, varies from one species to the next. The main idea of this paragraph is: There is no competition between these two wobblers, because one kind of eating is a bush. The top layer, one is to eat the middle or the lower tree. And each wobbler's breeding time is staggered, so the time they need to feed their children is also staggered. Both of these make no actual competition between the two wobblers. Option B and Option D summarize these two points, and the other two options are not based on the original text. Double-select BD</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the professor's opinion about Gause's hypothesis?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. She thinks that it has not been disproved.</p><p>B. She thinks it is contradicted by basic laboratory experiments.</p><p>C. She thinks that it cannot be adequately investigated.</p><p>D. She believes that it is contradicted by the competitive exclusion principle.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The subject of this question is: Excellent! To the casual observer, the wobblers do seem to contradict Gause's hypothesis since they all live in the same place and eat the same types of insects. But if you observe these birds more closely, the wobbler species Are not really competing with one another for the exact same food at the exact same time, which brings us to a really important concept in ecology: the niche. The effect of this paragraph is that on the surface the two wobblers are indeed refuting Gause's The competition assumes that they seem to eat the same insects and live in the same place. But if you look closely, wobbler does not compete with the same food at the same time. This requires us to consider a concept: niche. Option A says that professor thinks Gause's theory has not been proved wrong and correct. The remaining three options are not based on the original text. Select A.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor imply about the relationship between an organism's niche and its habitat?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. An organism's niche is exactly the same as its habitat.</p><p>B. An organism's niche is only partly defined by its habitat.</p><p>C. An organism's habitat is almost always more complex than its niche.</p><p>D. An organism can change its habitat but cannot change its niche.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The subject of this question is: But for biologists, the concept of a niche also includes the way an organism functions in its habitat, how it interacts with other plant and animal species, with the soil, the air, the water and so on. The general meaning of this sentence is that the concept of niche is not only to include the habitat of an organism, but also to include its role in habitat, how it interacts with other plant animals, and how to interact with soil. Air and water interact with each other. The content included is more than a simple habitat. Option B says that the habitat can only partially locate the niche of an organic material and it is correct. The other three options have no basis in the original text. Select B.</p></div></div><div class="replay" id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor says this:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To encourage other students to participate in the discussion.</p><p>B. To correct an error in the student's statement.</p><p>C. To encourage the student to answer more specifically.</p><p>D. To confirm that the student's answer is correct.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The problem of this question is: Student:</p><p>If the dominant species needs a lot of water you develop the ability to survive on very little water.</p><p>Professor:</p><p>You survive on what's left over: water, food, nesting or breeding sites, whatever.</p><p>The teacher's answer after the student's answer means that he did exactly what the professor had not mentioned. The intention of survival is to survive. Here, on behalf of the students, they correctly understand what the teacher wants to teach. They are surviving in this issue. So Option D confirms that the student's answer is correct and correct. The remaining three options are not based on the original text. Select D.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
