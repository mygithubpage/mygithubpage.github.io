            <span class="time" data-times="3.71" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in an <span class="highlight">architecture</span> class. <span class="time" data-times="3.97" data-time="3.71">[00:03.71]</span>The professor has been discussing housing designs.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.84" data-time="7.68">[00:07.68]</span>Professor: Alright, in our last class we began our discussion of housing designs in the United States from the 1940's. <span class="time" data-times="6.27" data-time="14.52">[00:14.52]</span>You'll remember, for example, that we looked at some photos and discussed <span class="highlight">apartment</span> <span class="highlight">complex</span> in Chicago from that <span class="highlight">decade</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.08" data-time="20.79">[00:20.79]</span>Now, today, let's talk about housing design in the suburbs. <span class="time" data-times="15.93" data-time="24.87">[00:24.87]</span>The demand for low-cost housing outside the cities increased in the late 1940's after World War II as a whole <span class="highlight">generation</span> of young families needed <span class="highlight">affordable</span> housing, and a <span class="highlight">firm</span> called Levitt and Sons strove to meet this demand in some <span class="highlight">pretty</span> <span class="highlight">innovative</span> ways.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="12.44" data-time="40.8">[00:40.80]</span>They designed buildings based on the demands of the public, not so much their own <span class="highlight">artistic</span> <span class="highlight">vision</span>, and created a <span class="highlight">residential</span> <span class="highlight">community</span> in the <span class="highlight">state</span> of New York that became known as Levittown.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.22" data-time="53.24">[00:53.24]</span>Levittown was the first <span class="highlight">suburb</span> of its kind and it started out with 2,000 homes. <span class="time" data-times="9.72" data-time="58.46">[00:58.46]</span>They were called "<span class="highlight">Cape</span> Cod houses", the "<span class="highlight">Cape</span> Cod model", and they were designed to look like the historical cottages in the New England states in the northeastern United States.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.72" data-time="68.18">[01:08.18]</span>The <span class="highlight">original</span> floor plan was very simple. <span class="time" data-times="4.28" data-time="70.9">[01:10.90]</span>The living room was in the front of the house with windows looking out towards the street. <span class="time" data-times="4.44" data-time="75.18">[01:15.18]</span>You also had two bedrooms, um, a bathroom and a kitchen. <span class="time" data-times="2.2" data-time="79.62">[01:19.62]</span>Everything was on one floor. <span class="time" data-times="8.3" data-time="81.82">[01:21.82]</span>The bathroom was right next to the kitchen, which was a way of keeping building costs down since the two rooms could <span class="highlight">rely</span> on just one plumbing system.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.69" data-time="90.12">[01:30.12]</span>Another feature of this <span class="highlight">Cape</span> Cod house is that it could be expanded as families grew and needed more <span class="highlight">space</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.96" data-time="96.81">[01:36.81]</span>You had the downstairs but up the stairs the house actually had unfinished attic <span class="highlight">space</span> as well. <span class="time" data-times="13.68" data-time="102.77">[01:42.77]</span>Levitt and Sons promoted their houses saying this attic <span class="highlight">space</span> could easily be <span class="highlight">converted</span> into another bedroom or <span class="highlight">even</span> two, and then there was always the possibility of building <span class="highlight">additional</span> rooms onto the house later.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.5" data-time="116.45">[01:56.45]</span>Each house was built the same way and with the same materials. <span class="time" data-times="3.92" data-time="120.95">[02:00.95]</span>All parts were standardized so houses could be built <span class="highlight">economically</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.42" data-time="124.87">[02:04.87]</span>This was important because it meant that they were <span class="highlight">affordable</span> for young families who <span class="highlight">wanted</span> to live outside of the city. <span class="time" data-times="9.09" data-time="131.29">[02:11.29]</span>As a result, what you had was a whole <span class="highlight">community</span> of houses that, except for the color of their roof and walls, were <span class="highlight">identical</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.17" data-time="140.38">[02:20.38]</span>So <span class="highlight">eventually</span> there's going to be a demand for some <span class="highlight">variety</span>, right?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.55" data-time="145.55">[02:25.55]</span>After a <span class="highlight">couple</span> of years, Levitt and Sons came up with a <span class="highlight">second</span> design. <span class="time" data-times="5.59" data-time="150.1">[02:30.10]</span>Well, they called it a <span class="highlight">second</span> design because it had a <span class="highlight">slightly</span> different roof. <span class="time" data-times="2.98" data-time="155.69">[02:35.69]</span>Plus, the <span class="highlight">exterior</span> had a more modern look.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.61" data-time="158.67">[02:38.67]</span>This model was called a <span class="highlight">ranch</span> house.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="9.2" data-time="161.28">[02:41.28]</span>Now, I'm guessing it wasn't too expensive or time-consuming for Levitt to come up with this idea, but it was certainly <span class="highlight">efficient</span> and hugely <span class="highlight">popular</span> with families. <span class="time" data-times="12.53" data-time="170.48">[02:50.48]</span>The <span class="highlight">Ranch</span> is like the <span class="highlight">Cape</span> Cod except that the living room is in the back of the house <span class="highlight">instead</span> of the front, and on this <span class="highlight">Ranch</span> model there is one more important feature that is not present in the <span class="highlight">Cape</span> Cod. <span class="time" data-times="8.15" data-time="183.01">[03:03.01]</span>It has a large window in the living room called a "picture window", which gives you a kind of "framed view" of the outside. <span class="time" data-times="8" data-time="191.16">[03:11.16]</span>The way the <span class="highlight">Ranch</span> is set up when you look out this picture window from the living room you're looking out from the back of the house <span class="highlight">instead</span> of from the front. <span class="time" data-times="7" data-time="199.16">[03:19.16]</span>Parents could watch the children playing in the backyard, the grassy area behind the house rather than a view of the street. <span class="time" data-times="23.77" data-time="206.16">[03:26.16]</span>So here was a way for families to disconnect their home, their house, their private lives from the outside world, which was represented by the street that led to work and school, which really seems like the thing they had been looking for all <span class="highlight">along</span>, but the floor plan was just like the <span class="highlight">Cape</span> Cod only, you know, turned 90 degrees.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.55" data-time="229.93">[03:49.93]</span>Levitt and Sons offered their <span class="highlight">ranch</span> houses for sales at a low price. <span class="time" data-times="5.32" data-time="234.48">[03:54.48]</span>They could do that because they were using the simple and <span class="highlight">therefore</span> cost-saving building methods. <span class="time" data-times="9.04" data-time="239.8">[03:59.80]</span>Another way they kept <span class="highlight">construction</span> prices down was to train workers who went from house to house doing a <span class="highlight">specific</span> task, <span class="highlight">sort</span> of like an <span class="highlight">assembly</span> <span class="highlight">line</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9.56" data-time="248.84">[04:08.84]</span>For example, you might have a painter whose job was to paint the doors of each house and then it would be someone else's job to <span class="highlight">install</span> the doors. <span class="time" data-times="3.45" data-time="258.4">[04:18.40]</span>This way houses went up quickly, <span class="highlight">saving</span> time and money. <span class="time" data-times="2.4" data-time="261.85">[04:21.85]</span>And the Levitt's ideas caught on. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="264.25">[04:24.25]</span>In the early 1950's, their designs became a model for <span class="highlight">suburb</span> <span class="highlight">construction</span> <span class="highlight">throughout</span> the country.</p>

Parents could watch the children playing in the backyard, the grassy area behind the house rather than a view of the street. Yes: This kind of picture window can be seen from the back of the house, so parents can see the children playing in the backyard and the grass behind the house, instead of just seeing the street from the front.
