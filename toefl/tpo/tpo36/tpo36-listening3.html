Sometimes we do just <span class="highlight">stumble</span> onto an important find when doing <span class="highlight">field</span> research, but usually we've got at <span class="highlight">least</span> a <span class="highlight">vague</span> idea of where to look. <span class="time" data-times="3.19" data-time="14.68">[00:14.68]</span>And with new technology...uh...Okay.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.51" data-time="17.87">[00:17.87]</span>Here's a story that illustrates what I mean.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="10" data-time="20.38">[00:20.38]</span>It's about the Mayans, who, as you remember, flourished in Central America and had a <span class="highlight">culture</span> that was quite <span class="highlight">advanced</span> in art, <span class="highlight">architecture</span>, <span class="highlight">astronomy</span>...<span class="time" data-times="14.52" data-time="30.38">[00:30.38]</span>We know that despite <span class="highlight">regular</span> droughts and poor soil, their numbers grew into the millions over the centuries until about 1,200 years ago when their entire <span class="highlight">civilization</span> just seemed to disappear, and we are not sure why.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="0.92" data-time="44.9">[00:44.90]</span>Okay</p><p><span class="time" data-times="9.77" data-time="45.82">[00:45.82]</span>So an archaeologist named William Saturno1 goes looking for <span class="highlight">ancient</span> Mayan ruins in Guatemala near a town called San Bartolo. <span class="time" data-times="15.78" data-time="55.59">[00:55.59]</span>And after several days of extremely difficult hiking <span class="highlight">through</span> the thick rainforest, Saturno stops to rest in the <span class="highlight">shade</span> and finds himself sitting in what turns out to be an <span class="highlight">ancient</span> Mayan <span class="highlight">temple</span>, a <span class="highlight">pyramid</span> 25 meters high. <span class="time" data-times="12.43" data-time="71.37">[01:11.37]</span>And inside, on the walls of this <span class="highlight">temple</span>, Saturno finds some <span class="highlight">ancient</span> writing and also this <span class="highlight">enormous</span><span class="highlight">mural</span> with <span class="highlight">elegant</span> figures depicting a Mayan <span class="highlight">myth</span> of the creation of the world. <span class="time" data-times="17.45" data-time="83.8">[01:23.80]</span>And it's all painted on <span class="highlight">plaster</span> that's over 2,000 years old, which makes it the oldest Mayan artwork ever found, at <span class="highlight">least</span> in good condition, and in fact, one of the most perfectly preserved and extremely important find.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.4" data-time="101.25">[01:41.25]</span>Student: Wow! Do you have a picture of it?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="1.15" data-time="103.65">[01:43.65]</span>Professor: Now...hang on. <span class="time" data-times="4.44"

United States <span class="highlight">Space</span><span class="highlight">Agency</span>, reads about Saturno's discovery and gets very excited 'cause the <span class="highlight">space</span><span class="highlight">agency</span> has just produced some images of this area using a <span class="highlight">technique</span> called <span class="highlight">remote</span> sensing. <span class="time" data-times="4.94" data-time="124.97">[02:04.97]</span>That's when instruments on planes and satellites <span class="highlight">survey</span> areas on the ground. <span class="time" data-times="5.61" data-time="129.91">[02:09.91]</span>And the newest <span class="highlight">twist</span> on <span class="highlight">remote</span> sensing, quite new, is <span class="highlight">infrared</span> imaging. <span class="time" data-times="13.95" data-time="135.52">[02:15.52]</span><span class="highlight">Instead</span> of taking <span class="highlight">regular</span> photographs, the <span

<span class="highlight">process</span> these images so our eyes can see them.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="18.71" data-time="149.47">[02:29.47]</span>Using <span class="highlight">infrared</span> imaging, the satellite-based <span class="highlight">remote</span> sensing instruments revealed what turned out to be traces of water <span class="highlight">storage</span> systems and canals, canals that the Mayans built to <span class="highlight">irrigate</span> their parched soil, which helps explain how the Mayans could feed such a large <span class="highlight">population</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.27" data-time="168.18">[02:48.18]</span>The <span class="highlight">infrared</span> images also revealed <span class="highlight">ancient</span> roadways that had tied Mayan cities together. <span class="time" data-times="11.59" data-time="174.45">[02:54.45]</span>So people at the <span class="highlight">space</span><span class="highlight">agency</span> figured Saturno would be interested and they sent him this <span class="highlight">infrared</span><span class="highlight">image</span> of the area near San Bartolo where the <span class="highlight">pyramid</span><span class="highlight">temple</span> was found.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.26" data-time="186.04">[03:06.04]</span>Now, this is a false color <span class="highlight">image</span> based on an <span class="highlight">infrared</span> photo. <span class="time" data-times="8.68"

data-time="205.4">[03:25.40]</span>And Saturno notices that some of that discolorations located in exactly the <span class="highlight">spot</span> where he found the <span

spots are <span class="highlight">worth</span> investigating. <span class="time" data-times="12.23" data-time="218.72">[03:38.72]</span>Well, long story short, he checks out three different spots where the photo shows discoloration and finds an <span class="highlight">ancient</span> Mayan site overgrown with <span class="highlight">vegetation</span> at every single one. <span class="time" data-times="8.57" data-time="230.95">[03:50.95]</span>Further <span class="highlight">exploration</span> shows a <span class="highlight">perfect</span> correlation between yellow spots on the <span

what caused those spots to look different?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.27" data-time="242.13">[04:02.13]</span>Professor: Well, Saturno believes the <span class="highlight">limestone</span> and <span class="highlight">lime</span> plasters that the Mayans used to build their structures...<span class="time" data-times="7.1" data-time="248.4">[04:08.40]</span>Over time, uh, this <span class="highlight">limestone</span><span class="highlight">decayed</span> and seeped into the soil and changed the soil's chemistry. <span class="time" data-times="14.21" data-time="255.5">[04:15.50]</span>Then <span class="highlight">calcium</span><span class="highlight">carbonate</span> from the decaying <span class="highlight">lime</span><span class="highlight">plaster</span> might have been taken out by the roots of the trees growing there, uh, up into their leaves, and made them give off <span class="highlight">infrared</span> light much more brightly than the surrounding <span class="highlight">vegetation</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.39" data-time="269.71">[04:29.71]</span>And <span class="highlight">infrared</span> sensing technology can <span class="highlight">detect</span> this.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.09" data-time="274.1">[04:34.10]</span>Student: So...like...is Guatemala the only place where archaeologists have used <span class="highlight">remote</span> sensing?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.19" data-time="280.19">[04:40.19]</span>Professor: No. This <span

data-time="287.38">[04:47.38]</span>It can be used anywhere the rainforest has obscured <span class="highlight">ancient</span> ruins.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="292.05">[04:52.05]</span>And the results can be amazing! Like another Mayan <span class="highlight">temple</span> that Saturno found, thanks to <span class="highlight">remote</span> sensing, he had walked right by it every day for five years and had no idea it was there, until he saw an <span class="highlight">infrared</span><span class="highlight">image</span> of the area!</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the lecture mainly about?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The history of Mayan culture in Central America.</p><p>B. A new study comparing field-research methods used in Guatemala.</p><p>C. A new approach to archaeological research.</p><p>D. Sites where important ancient Mayan art had been discovered.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The title of this question is:</p><p>Professor:</p><p>Sure. Sometimes we do just stumble onto an important find when doing field research, but usually we've got at least a vague idea of where to look. And with new technology...uh...Okay.</p><p>These few sentences indicate that professors think that sometimes we have some important discoveries in the field study, but sometimes we just have a vague idea about where to study. So through a new technology... We can know that teaching this lesson is to introduce a new approach to archaeology, choose C. The remaining three options do not fit the question.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor, what is the most significant aspect of the mural that William Saturno found near San Bartolo, Guatemala?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It includes writing as well as human figures.</p><p>B. It is very old but still in excellent condition.</p><p>C. It was painted on limestone.</p><p>D. It corrects a mistaken belief about Mayan culture.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The questions are: And inside, on the walls of this temple, Saturno finds some ancient writing and also this enormous mural with elegant figures depicting a Mayan myth of the creation of the world. And it's all painted on plaster that's over 2,000 years Old, which makes it the the oldest Mayan artwork ever found, at least in good condition, and in fact, one of the most perfectly preserved, extremely important find. The main idea of this paragraph is that Saturno found a lot of ancient writing and there is a huge The murals above are painted about the elegant portraits depicting the Mayan genesis. The next few sentences stress how good these things are preserved and Option B is consistent with the questions. The lack of evidence in the original three remaining options. Select B.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor mention roads and canals?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To describe the difficulties of hiking in the rain forest.</p><p>B. To indicate the kind of ruins initially revealed by the infrared images.</p><p>C. To point out what Saturno was initially searching for.</p><p>D. To emphasize recent improvement in transportation near San Bartolo.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The problem is: Using infrared imaging, the satellite-based remote sensing instruments revealed what turned out to be traces of water storage systems and canals, canals that the Mayans built to irrigate their parched soil, which explain how the Mayans could feed Such a large population. roads and canals appear here. The main idea of this paragraph is: through infrared, this satellite-based remote sensing device can reveal what proved to be a water storage system and a canal for irrigation. This helps to expose how the Maya can feed their huge population. So the usefulness of infrared imaging here is to show that it can shine out ancient monuments. Option B is correct. The remaining three options lack the basis in the original text. Select B.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>After Saturno found the pyramid temple near San Bartolo, what guided his search for other ancient Mayan sites?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. His theory about why the ancient Mayan civilization disappeared.</p><p>B. Clues found in the ancient writing at the pyramid temple.</p><p>C. Information from people who live in the region.</p><p>D. The location of light-colored spots in satellite photos.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The question title is: There are significant discoloration in the vegetation, at least as it appears to infrared cameras. And Saturno notices that some of that discolorations located in exactly the spot where he found the pyramid temple. So he figures, hey, maybe Some of those other yellow spots are worth investigating. Well, long story short, he checks out three different spots where the photo shows discoloration and finds an ancient Mayan site overgrown with vegetation at every single one. The fading, at least this fading to the infrared camera shows up. Saturno noticed that sometimes the distribution of this discolored vegetation is the same as the distribution of pyramid remains. So he thinks that some of the places where the display is yellow are worth investigating. With this guess, he discovered new Mayan ruins in three places. Option D is consistent with the question. The lack of evidence in the original three remaining options. Select D.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor mention limestone?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To support a theory about why most Mayan structure are well preserved.</p><p>B. To point out a difference between Mayan structure in Guatemala and those in other areas.</p><p>C. To suggest a reason why certain vegetation stands out in infrared images.</p><p>D. To explain why it is difficult to locate ancient buildings in jungles.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The questions are: Well, Saturno believes the limestone and lime plasters that the Mayans used to build their structures...Over time, uh, this limestone decayed and seeped into the soil and changed the soil's chemistry. Then calcium carbonate from the Decaying lime plaster might have been taken out by the roots of the trees growing there, uh, up into their leaves, and made them give off infrared light much more brightly than the surrounding vegetation. And infrared sensing technology can detect this. The general idea is: Mayans take limestone to build their own buildings. As time passes, limestone is eroded away and penetrates into the soil, changing the chemical composition of the soil. The trees absorb these substances and their roots and leaves emit stronger infrared light than the surrounding vegetation. Infrared sensing instruments can detect them. Option C explains why vegetation with existing remains is different from the surrounding vegetation and is consistent with the question. The remaining three options have no basis in the original text. Select C.</p></div></div><div class="replay" id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor say this:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. She does not want the student to distract her from telling a story</p><p>B. She is trying to recall if she has a picture of the artwork.</p><p>C. She wants the student to be patient while she looks for a picture.</p><p>D. She cannot remember the point she was about to make.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The title of this question is:</p><p>Student:</p><p>Wow! Do you have a picture of it?</p><p>Professor:</p><p>Now...hang on. I don't...there's a point I want to make here.</p><p>The meaning of these two dialogues is: Students want to ask teachers if they have related photos, but teachers do not want to leave their current topic, so I would like to say that I still have a point to talk about.
