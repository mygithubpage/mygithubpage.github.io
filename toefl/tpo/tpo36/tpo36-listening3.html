              <span class="time" data-times="4.08" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Listen to part of a lecture in an <span class="highlight">archaeology</span> class.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.6" data-time="4.08">[00:04.08]</span>Professor: Sure. Sometimes we do just <span class="highlight">stumble</span> onto an important find when doing <span class="highlight">field</span> research, but usually we've got at <span class="highlight">least</span> a <span class="highlight">vague</span> idea of where to look. <span class="time" data-times="3.19" data-time="14.68">[00:14.68]</span>And with new technology...uh...Okay.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.51" data-time="17.87">[00:17.87]</span>Here's a story that illustrates what I mean.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10" data-time="20.38">[00:20.38]</span>It's about the Mayans, who, as you remember, flourished in Central America and had a <span class="highlight">culture</span> that was quite <span class="highlight">advanced</span> in art, <span class="highlight">architecture</span>, <span class="highlight">astronomy</span>...<span class="time" data-times="14.52" data-time="30.38">[00:30.38]</span>We know that despite <span class="highlight">regular</span> droughts and poor soil, their numbers grew into the millions over the centuries until about 1,200 years ago when their entire <span class="highlight">civilization</span> just seemed to disappear, and we are not sure why.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="0.92" data-time="44.9">[00:44.90]</span>Okay</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.77" data-time="45.82">[00:45.82]</span>So an archaeologist named William Saturno1 goes looking for <span class="highlight">ancient</span> Mayan ruins in Guatemala near a town called San Bartolo. <span class="time" data-times="15.78" data-time="55.59">[00:55.59]</span>And after several days of extremely difficult hiking <span class="highlight">through</span> the thick rainforest, Saturno stops to rest in the <span class="highlight">shade</span> and finds himself sitting in what turns out to be an <span class="highlight">ancient</span> Mayan <span class="highlight">temple</span>, a <span class="highlight">pyramid</span> 25 meters high. <span class="time" data-times="12.43" data-time="71.37">[01:11.37]</span>And inside, on the walls of this <span class="highlight">temple</span>, Saturno finds some <span class="highlight">ancient</span> writing and also this <span class="highlight">enormous</span> <span class="highlight">mural</span> with <span class="highlight">elegant</span> figures depicting a Mayan <span class="highlight">myth</span> of the creation of the world. <span class="time" data-times="17.45" data-time="83.8">[01:23.80]</span>And it's all painted on <span class="highlight">plaster</span> that's over 2,000 years old, which makes it the oldest Mayan artwork ever found, at <span class="highlight">least</span> in good condition, and in fact, one of the most perfectly preserved and extremely important find.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.4" data-time="101.25">[01:41.25]</span>Student: Wow! Do you have a picture of it?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.15" data-time="103.65">[01:43.65]</span>Professor: Now...hang on. <span class="time" data-times="4.44" data-time="104.8">[01:44.80]</span>I don't...there's a point I want to make here.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="15.73" data-time="109.24">[01:49.24]</span>It happens that someone at NASA, the United States <span class="highlight">Space</span> <span class="highlight">Agency</span>, reads about Saturno's discovery and gets very excited 'cause the <span class="highlight">space</span> <span class="highlight">agency</span> has just produced some images of this area using a <span class="highlight">technique</span> called <span class="highlight">remote</span> sensing. <span class="time" data-times="4.94" data-time="124.97">[02:04.97]</span>That's when instruments on planes and satellites <span class="highlight">survey</span> areas on the ground. <span class="time" data-times="5.61" data-time="129.91">[02:09.91]</span>And the newest <span class="highlight">twist</span> on <span class="highlight">remote</span> sensing, quite new, is <span class="highlight">infrared</span> imaging. <span class="time" data-times="13.95" data-time="135.52">[02:15.52]</span> <span class="highlight">Instead</span> of taking <span class="highlight">regular</span> photographs, the <span class="highlight">satellite</span> cameras take pictures using <span class="highlight">infrared</span> light, which is <span class="highlight">invisible</span> to the human eye, but computers can then <span class="highlight">process</span> these images so our eyes can see them.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="18.71" data-time="149.47">[02:29.47]</span>Using <span class="highlight">infrared</span> imaging, the satellite-based <span class="highlight">remote</span> sensing instruments revealed what turned out to be traces of water <span class="highlight">storage</span> systems and canals, canals that the Mayans built to <span class="highlight">irrigate</span> their parched soil, which helps explain how the Mayans could feed such a large <span class="highlight">population</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.27" data-time="168.18">[02:48.18]</span>The <span class="highlight">infrared</span> images also revealed <span class="highlight">ancient</span> roadways that had tied Mayan cities together. <span class="time" data-times="11.59" data-time="174.45">[02:54.45]</span>So people at the <span class="highlight">space</span> <span class="highlight">agency</span> figured Saturno would be interested and they sent him this <span class="highlight">infrared</span> <span class="highlight">image</span> of the area near San Bartolo where the <span class="highlight">pyramid</span> <span class="highlight">temple</span> was found.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.26" data-time="186.04">[03:06.04]</span>Now, this is a false color <span class="highlight">image</span> based on an <span class="highlight">infrared</span> photo. <span class="time" data-times="8.68" data-time="190.3">[03:10.30]</span>So the greens of the jungle are shown mostly as blue and red, but notice also the spots of greenish yellow <span class="highlight">scattered</span> here and there. <span class="time" data-times="6.42" data-time="198.98">[03:18.98]</span>These <span class="highlight">indicate</span> <span class="highlight">significant</span> discoloration in the <span class="highlight">vegetation</span>, at <span class="highlight">least</span> as it appears to <span class="highlight">infrared</span> cameras. <span class="time" data-times="7.92" data-time="205.4">[03:25.40]</span>And Saturno notices that some of that discolorations located in exactly the <span class="highlight">spot</span> where he found the <span class="highlight">pyramid</span> <span class="highlight">temple</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.4" data-time="213.32">[03:33.32]</span>So he figures, hey, maybe some of those other yellow spots are <span class="highlight">worth</span> investigating. <span class="time" data-times="12.23" data-time="218.72">[03:38.72]</span>Well, long story short, he checks out three different spots where the photo shows discoloration and finds an <span class="highlight">ancient</span> Mayan site overgrown with <span class="highlight">vegetation</span> at every single one. <span class="time" data-times="8.57" data-time="230.95">[03:50.95]</span>Further <span class="highlight">exploration</span> shows a <span class="highlight">perfect</span> correlation between yellow spots on the <span class="highlight">infrared</span> <span class="highlight">image</span> and Mayan ruins hidden in the jungle.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.61" data-time="239.52">[03:59.52]</span>Student: So what caused those spots to look different?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.27" data-time="242.13">[04:02.13]</span>Professor: Well, Saturno believes the <span class="highlight">limestone</span> and <span class="highlight">lime</span> plasters that the Mayans used to build their structures...<span class="time" data-times="7.1" data-time="248.4">[04:08.40]</span>Over time, uh, this <span class="highlight">limestone</span> <span class="highlight">decayed</span> and seeped into the soil and changed the soil's chemistry. <span class="time" data-times="14.21" data-time="255.5">[04:15.50]</span>Then <span class="highlight">calcium</span> <span class="highlight">carbonate</span> from the decaying <span class="highlight">lime</span> <span class="highlight">plaster</span> might have been taken out by the roots of the trees growing there, uh, up into their leaves, and made them give off <span class="highlight">infrared</span> light much more brightly than the surrounding <span class="highlight">vegetation</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.39" data-time="269.71">[04:29.71]</span>And <span class="highlight">infrared</span> sensing technology can <span class="highlight">detect</span> this.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.09" data-time="274.1">[04:34.10]</span>Student: So...like...is Guatemala the only place where archaeologists have used <span class="highlight">remote</span> sensing?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.19" data-time="280.19">[04:40.19]</span>Professor: No. This <span class="highlight">technique</span> has been used in other parts of Central America too, and also in Brazil, Bolivia, Cambodia. <span class="time" data-times="4.67" data-time="287.38">[04:47.38]</span>It can be used anywhere the rainforest has obscured <span class="highlight">ancient</span> ruins.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="292.05">[04:52.05]</span>And the results can be amazing! Like another Mayan <span class="highlight">temple</span> that Saturno found, thanks to <span class="highlight">remote</span> sensing, he had walked right by it every day for five years and had no idea it was there, until he saw an <span class="highlight">infrared</span> <span class="highlight">image</span> of the area!</p>
