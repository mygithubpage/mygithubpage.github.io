Originally moths were <span class="highlight">uniformly</span><span class="highlight">pale</span> gray or whitish in color; dark-colored (melanic) individuals were <span class="highlight">rare</span> and made up less than 2 percent of the <span class="highlight">population</span>. <span class="question1">Over a period of decades, dark-colored forms became an increasingly large <span class="highlight">fraction</span> of some populations and <span class="highlight">eventually</span> came to <span class="highlight">dominate</span> peppered <span class="highlight">moth</span> populations in certain areas -especially those of <span class="highlight">extreme</span><span class="highlight">industrialization</span> such as the Ruhr <span class="highlight">Valley</span> of Germany and the Midlands of England.</span><span class="highlight">Coal</span> from <span class="highlight">industry</span> released large amounts of black <span class="highlight">soot</span> into the environment, but <span class="question2">the increase of the dark-colored forms was not <span class="highlight">due</span> to <span class="highlight">genetic</span> mutations caused by <span class="highlight">industrial</span> pollution.</span> For example, caterpillars that feed on soot-covered leaves did not <span class="question3">give rise to</span> dark- colored adults. Rather, pollution promoted the <span class="highlight">survival</span> of dark forms on soot-covered trees. Melanics were <span class="highlight">normally</span> quickly eliminated in nonindustrial areas by <span class="highlight">adverse</span><span class="highlight">selection</span>; birds spotted them easily. This <span class="highlight">phenomenon</span>, an increase in the <span class="highlight">frequency</span> of dark-colored mutants in polluted areas, is known as <span class="highlight">industrial</span> melanism. The North American <span class="highlight">equivalent</span> of this story is another <span class="highlight">moth</span>, <span class="question4">the swettaria form of Biston cognataria</span>, first noticed in industrialized areas such as Chicago and New York City in the early 1900s. By 1961 it constituted over 90 percent of the <span class="highlight">population</span> in parts of Michigan.</p><p>The idea that natural <span class="highlight">selection</span> was <span class="highlight">responsible</span> for the changing <span class="highlight">ratio</span> of dark- to light-colored peppered moths was developed in the 1950s by H. B. D. Kettlewell of Oxford University. If natural <span class="highlight">selection</span> was the explanation, then there should be different <span class="highlight">survival</span> rates for dark- and light- colored moths. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> To <span class="highlight">determine</span> whether this was true, Kettlewell released thousands of light and dark moths (each <span class="highlight">marked</span> with a paint <span class="highlight">spot</span>) into <span class="highlight">rural</span> and industrialized areas. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> In the nonindustrial area of Dorset, he recaptured 14.6 percent of the <span class="highlight">pale</span> forms but only 4.7 percent of the dark forms. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span> In the <span class="highlight">industrial</span> area of Birmingham, the situation was reversed: 13 percent of <span class="highlight">pale</span> forms but 27.5 percent of dark forms were recaptured. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p><p>Clearly some <span class="highlight">environmental</span><span class="highlight">factor</span> was <span class="highlight">responsible</span> for the greater <span class="highlight">survival</span> rates of dark moths. Birds were predators of peppered moths. Kettlewell hypothesized that the normal <span class="highlight">pale</span> forms are difficult to see when resting on lichen-covered trees, whereas dark forms are <span class="highlight"><span class="question6">conspicuous</span></span>. In industrialized areas, lichens are destroyed by pollution, tree barks become darker, and dark moths are the ones birds have difficulty <span class="question8">detecting</span>. As a test, Kettlewell set up hidden <span class="highlight">observation</span> positions and watched birds <span class="highlight">voraciously</span> eat moths placed |on tree trunks of a contrasting color. The <span class="highlight">action</span> of natural <span class="highlight">selection</span> in producing a small but highly <span class="highlight">significant</span> step of <span class="highlight">evolution</span> was seemingly demonstrated, with birds as the selecting force.</p><p>Not every researcher has been <span class="question9">convinced</span> that natural <span class="highlight">selection</span> by birds is the only explanation of the observed frequencies of dark and light peppered moths. More recent <span class="highlight">data</span>, however, provide <span class="highlight">additional</span> support for Kettleweir's ideas about natural <span class="highlight">selection</span>. The light-colored form of the peppered <span class="highlight">moth</span> is making a strong comeback. In Britain, a Clean <span class="highlight">Air</span> Act was passed in 1965. Sir Cyril Clarke has been trapping moths at his home in Liverpool, Merseyside, since 1959. Before about 1975, 90 percent of the moths were dark, but since then there has been a <span class="highlight">steep</span><span class="highlight">decline</span> in melanic forms, and in 1989 only 29.6 percent of the moths caught were melanic. The mean <span class="highlight">concentration</span> of sulphur <span class="highlight">dioxide</span> pollution fell from about 300 micrograms per cubic meter in 1970 to less than 50 micrograms per cubic meter in 1975 and has remained <span class="highlight">fairly</span><span class="highlight">constant</span> since then. If the <span class="highlight">spread</span> of the light-colored form of the <span class="highlight">moth</span> continues at the same speed as the melanic form <span class="highlight">spread</span> .in the last <span class="highlight">century</span>, soon the melanic form will again be only an <span class="highlight">occasional</span><span class="highlight">resident</span> of the Liverpool area.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Peppered moth populations gradually increased in size, with dark-colored moths increasing their numbers fastest in the industrialized areas of Germany and England.</p><p>B. Over a period of decades, dark-colored peppered moths came to certain areas of the Ruhr Valley and the Midlands and became the dominant forms there.</p><p>C. In Germany and England, dark-colored peppered moths forced most light-colored moths out of their territories.</p><p>D. While they also increased elsewhere, dark-colored peppered moths gradually became the dominant form in areas of extreme industrialization.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The highlights of this topic are located here: Over a period of decades, dark-colored forms become an gradually large fraction of some populations and eventually came to guided peppered moth populations in certain areas -especially those of extreme industrialization such as the Ruhr Valley Of Germany and the Midlands of England. The general idea of these words is that the proportion of black moths in all moths has gradually increased, which in turn has become a dominant species in some areas, especially in areas with large industries. Option D is a synonym for this sentence, choice; Option A is that the number of black moths in the British and German industrial regions has grown fastest, the original text did not mention, wrong; option B is that the black moth came to two Industrial areas, and rapid breeding, occupy a dominant position, cause and effect relationship is wrong; Option C is that the black moth to drive away the light moth, the original did not say. Select D.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>In the passage, why does the author mention that "<span class="highlight">the increase of the dark-colored forms was not due to genetic mutations caused by industrial pollution</span>"?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To suggest that the rate of genetic change in peppered moths actually decreased.</p><p>B. To emphasize that pollution in industrial areas had no role in the increase of dark peppered moths.</p><p>C. To introduce the information about the soot-covered trees that caterpillars fed on as the correct explanation for the increase in dark peppered moths.</p><p>D. To reject a view of the role of pollution in the increase of dark peppered moths that would not involve natural selection.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="the increase of the dark-colored forms was not due to genetic mutations caused by industrial pollution D"><p>According to the sentence given to the stem, the sentence is located in the original sentence: Coal from industry released large amounts of black soot into the environment, but the increase of dark-colored forms was not due to genetic mutations caused by industrial pollution. Yes, coal that is burned in industrial production does indeed pollute the country with black emissions. However, the increase in black moths is not a genetic mutation caused by this large amount of pollution. The latter half of the sentence aims to refute the theory proposed in the first half of the sentence, that is, the content of option D. Option A says that the frequency of genetic changes in moths has dropped. Option B says that pollution has nothing to do with moth variations. This is too absolute. The article does not mention it and it is not selected. Option C is about contaminated trees and using them as There are no moths born in this original text. Select D.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The phrase "<span class="highlight"><span class="question3">give rise to</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. live longer than</p><p>B. associate with</p><p>C. produce</p><p>D. compete with</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" C"><p>According to the vocabulary that was given, for example, caterpillars that feed on soot-covered leaves did not <span class="question3">give rise to</span> dark- colored adults. The general idea of this sentence is: For example, the leaves covered with soot are Food caterpillars do not grow into black adults. Here <span class="question3">give rise to</span> is the growth, become meaning. Option A is living longer than... Option B is related to... Option C is generated, Option D is competing with... Option C is the closest to <span class="question3">give rise to</span>. Select C.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The passage suggests which of the following about "<span class="highlight"><span class="question4">the swettaria form of Biston cognataria</span></span>"?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It was a dark-colored moth form.</p><p>B. It is now extinct in industrialized areas.</p><p>C. It did not exist before the early 1900s.</p><p>D. It came to North America from Europe.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" A"><p>According to <span class="question4">the swettaria form of Biston cognataria</span> given in the title, the North American equivalent of this story is another moth, <span class="question4">the swettaria form of Biston cognataria</span>, first noticed in industrialized areas such as Chicago and New York City. In the early 1900s. The general idea of this sentence is that there is another moth in North America, <span class="question4">the swettaria form of Biston cognataria</span>, which was also first discovered in industrialized areas such as Chicago and New York in the early 20th century. By using the equivalent of this sentence, that is, the equivalent, we can know that this sentence is about the same phenomenon as the black moth of the previous article. So the two moths are black and the A option is correct. As for the other three options, there is no mention in the original.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Paragraph 3 answers all of the following questions about Kettlewell's experiment EXCEPT:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. How was it determined whether a recaptured moth was one of those that Kettlewell released?</p><p>B. Were equal numbers of dark-and light-colored moths released?</p><p>C. What hypothesis was Kettlewell trying to test with the experiment?</p><p>D. What were the results of the experiment?</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The keywords for this question are Kettlewell and experiment. According to the keyword positioning back to the third paragraph, after reading this paragraph we found that Kettlewell's experiment was like this: he first marked the same number of black moths and light moths, and then released them in industrial areas and non-industrial areas respectively. After a while, capture them and count the number of two moths. Option A says how to determine that the captured moth was previously released. This can be identified by a marker. Option B asks whether the number of released moths of the two colors is the same. This experiment did not explain it. It just said that thousands of moths were released. The moth, but the specific kind did not say how much; option C said to want to prove what hypothesis, the first sentence of this paragraph is to say this to prove the hypothesis, correct; Option D is to say the results of the experiment, this at the end of this paragraph Also given. Select B.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question6">conspicuous</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. easily eaten</p><p>B. clearly visible</p><p>C. poorly adapted</p><p>D. rarely present</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>According to the vocabulary examined in this question, this sentence: Kettlewell hypothesized that the normal pale forms are difficult to see when resting on lichen-covered trees, then dark forms are <span class="question6">conspicuous</span>. The meaning of this sentence is Kettlewell hypothesis that the normal white moth meaningIt is hard to find on moss-covered tree trunks, but black moths are specifically noticeable. The meaning of <span class="question6">conspicuous</span> is obvious. Option A is said to be easily eaten, Option B is clearly seen, Option C is not improved, and Option D is rarely seen. Option B best fits the <span class="question6">conspicuous</span> meaning. Select B.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Paragraph 4 suggests which of the following about the survival of peppered moths?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Light forms of the moth are more likely to survive in polluted rather than unpolluted areas.</p><p>B. Birds are more likely to determine the survival rates of moths in rural rather than industrial areas.</p><p>C. Environment determines whether dark or light forms of the moth survive.</p><p>D. The presence of lichen on tree trunks encourages birds to prey on both dark and light forms of the moth with the same frequency.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The key word for this question is the survival of peppered moths. Looking back at the fourth paragraph, I found that the whole paragraph is talking about the survival of peppered moths. The main content of this paragraph is: Birds help moths to evolve, because birds are more likely to eat moths that are prominent on the trunk. Therefore, the black moths on the moss and the white moths smoked on the coal are easy to be eaten. On the contrary, they are easy to survive. So it is the environment that determines the color of moths that are easy to live with. Option C is consistent with the question. Option A says that light-colored moths are more likely to survive in industrially contaminated areas, contrary to the original; Option B says that birds are more likely to determine the survival of rural moths than in industrialized areas. This is not mentioned in the original text; option D says moss at the same time Promoting the birds to prey on light-colored moths and black moths is a mistake that only encourages birds to prey on black moths. Select C.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question8">detecting</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. discovering</p><p>B. capturing</p><p>C. eating</p><p>D. hiding</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" A"><p>According to the vocabulary examined in this question, the phrase "In industrialized areas, lichens are destroyed by pollution, tree barks become darker, and dark moths are the ones birds have difficulty <span class="question8">detecting</span>." This sentence is intended to mean that in the industrialized areas, the moss was destroyed, The tree was blackened by soot, and the black moth became a kind of moth that could not be easily found. Detecting here is meant to be discovered. The meaning of option A is found, the meaning of option B is captured, the meaning of option C is eaten, and the meaning of option D is hidden. Option A best fits the meaning of <span class="question8">detecting</span>. Select A.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question9">convinced</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. persuaded</p><p>B. concerned</p><p>C. informed</p><p>D. pleased</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" A"><p>According to the vocabulary examined in this question, this sentence is addressed: Not every researcher has been <span class="question9">convinced</span> that natural selection by birds is the only explanation of the observed frequencies of dark and light peppered moths. This sentence is intended to mean: Not every investigator believes Natural selection by birds is the only explanation for the change in the number of black moths and light moths. The meaning of convince here is to make it believe. Option A means to persuade, Option B means to care, Option C means to notify, and Option D means to please. Option A best fits the meaning of convince. Select A.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the purpose of paragraph 5 in the passage?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To explain why Kettlewell's view has been widely misunderstood.</p><p>B. To present a view that various researchers have criticized.</p><p>C. To suggest why new developments seem to confirm Kettlewell's view.</p><p>D. To state one of the proposed alternatives to Kettlewell's view.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>In general, the first sentence of a TOEFL article is the main sentence of this paragraph. This question can be concluded by reading the first sentence of the fifth paragraph. More every data, however, provides additional support for Kettleweir's ideas The researchers believe that the natural selection of birds is the only explanation for the change in the number of moth species, and there are more recent data supporting Kettleweir's theory. In other words, the following will explain in detail how these data prove Kettleweir's theory. Option A says that in order to explain why K's theory can be misunderstood, Option B says that in order to illustrate a theory that the researchers criticized, Option C said that in order to explain why the new discovery would support K's theory, Option D said to explain K's theory. One of the changes. Only C most conforms to the fifth paragraph. Select C.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 5, which of the following is true of melanic forms in Liverpool?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Increased sulphur dioxide pollution decreased their numbers after 1975.</p><p>B. Their population slowly increased from 1975 to 1989.</p><p>C. From 1950 on, they have seldom been seen in the Liverpool area.</p><p>D. Before 1975 their population was higher than that of light-colored moths.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>This question is based on the keyword keyword Liverpool: In Britain, a Clean Air Act was passed in 1965. Sir Cyril Clarke has been trapping moths at his home in Liverpool, Merseyside, since 1959. This sentence and the following sentences are related to this topic. The general idea of this part is that 90 percent of the moths were black at the beginning, but as time went by, the black moths became less and less, less than 30 percent. At the same time, the sulfur content of this area is also declining. Option A is to say that the increased sulfur dioxide leads to a reduction in black moths, which is not mentioned in this article; Option B is that the number of these moths is increasing from 1975 to 1989, which is wrong and should be reduced; Option C is said to have started from 1950. Black moths are rarely seen. This is not true. The black moths are not reduced so little. Option D is that black moths were more moths than light moths before 1975. It was right that black moths accounted for 90% before 1975. Shallow moths account for 10%, black more than white. Select D.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>In paragraph 5 the change in the frequency of melanic forms is attributed to which of the following?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. New kinds of pollution in Liverpool</p><p>B. The passage of the Clean Air Act in 1965</p><p>C. Changes in rates of genetic mutation</p><p>D. Changes in populations of moth predators</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>This question asks what caused the change in the number of black moths. Based on the analysis of the previous question, we know that because the passage of the a Clean Air Act led to the reduction of sulfur in the air, there was a decrease in the number of black moths and an increase in the number of light-colored moths. So it can be inferred that the author should be trying to explain the amount of moth species affected by industrial pollution. Option B is consistent with the question. Option A is about new contamination, not mentioned in this article; Option C is about the rate of mutation, not mentioned; Option D is about the change in the number of predators in the moth, nor is it mentioned. Select B.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>These contrasting numbers of pale and dark forms recaptured must reflect different survival rates..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>This question first looks at the sentence to be inserted: These contrasting numbers of pale and dark forms recaptured must reflect different survival rates. The sentence at the beginning of these contrasting numbers indicates that the sentence in front of the sentence definitely mentions the contrasting numbers. Based on this feature, we went to try four pluggable locations one by one and found that the last insertion point was OK. Because this position is just in front of the comparison of the number of black moths and light moths in the two environments. Select the D position to insert.</p></div></div><div id="question14" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>The industrial melanism in peppered moth populations that has occurred over the past 100 years provides an example of natural selection.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.Over time, peppered moth populations in Germany and England migrated from nonindustrialized areas to those that were industrialized.</p><p>B.Kettlewell's experiments showed that birds were acting as a selecting force by eating light-colored moths on dark trees in polluted areas.</p><p>C.According to Kettlewell's theory, natural selection produced birds that were better able to detect moths even when areas were polluted.</p><p>D.Originally most peppered moths were pale in color, but especially in areas of extreme industrialization, dark-colored moths began to dominate.</p><p>E.The recent increase of pale forms as pollution decreases supports the importance of natural selection by birds as a factor affecting peppered moth populations.</p><p>F.Recent research indicates that when adult moths fail to choose appropriate backgrounds, they are usually eaten by birds.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="BDE"><p>This question needs to analyze each option in turn. Option A is about the German and British moths migrating from an industrialized area in an industrialized area. There is no mention in this article. The option B says that Kettlewell's experiment shows that birds in the polluted area are more likely to eat white moths. As a choice for their strength, summed up the contents of the third paragraph, correct; Option C said that natural selection will produce a bird that can identify moths in contaminated areas. It is wrong to say that the text does not say that such birds will be produced, but only says pollution. It will lead to a change in the identification of the black moths of the moths; option D said that the white moths predominated at the beginning, but as the industrialized black moths began to occupy a dominant position, it correctly summed up the contents of the fourth paragraph; Option E said recently The study supports the doctrine of selecting species of moths for birds, correctly and summarizing the contents of the fifth paragraph; Option F says that when moths failed to select suitable backgrounds, they were eaten. There is no indication that moths will have a The process of autonomously selecting the background is wrong. Comprehensively choose B, D, E.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
