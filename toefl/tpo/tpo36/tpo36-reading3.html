Originally moths were <span class="highlight">uniformly</span><span class="highlight">pale</span> gray or whitish in color; dark-colored (melanic) individuals were <span class="highlight">rare</span> and made up less than 2 percent of the <span class="highlight">population</span>. <span class="light">Over a period of decades, dark-colored forms became an increasingly large <span class="highlight">fraction</span> of some populations and <span class="highlight">eventually</span> came to <span class="highlight">dominate</span> peppered <span class="highlight">moth</span> populations in certain areas -especially those of <span class="highlight">extreme</span><span class="highlight">industrialization</span> such as the Ruhr <span class="highlight">Valley</span> of Germany and the Midlands of England.</span><span class="highlight">Coal</span> from <span class="highlight">industry</span> released large amounts of black <span class="highlight">soot</span> into the environment, but <span class="question2">the increase of the dark-colored forms was not <span class="highlight">due</span> to <span class="highlight">genetic</span> mutations caused by <span class="highlight">industrial</span> pollution. </span>For example, caterpillars that feed on soot-covered leaves did not <span class="question3">give rise to </span>dark- colored adults. Rather, pollution promoted the <span class="highlight">survival</span> of dark forms on soot-covered trees. Melanics were <span class="highlight">normally</span> quickly eliminated in nonindustrial areas by <span class="highlight">adverse</span><span class="highlight">selection</span>; birds spotted them easily. This <span class="highlight">phenomenon</span>, an increase in the <span class="highlight">frequency</span> of dark-colored mutants in polluted areas, is known as <span class="highlight">industrial</span> melanism. The North American <span class="highlight">equivalent</span> of this story is another <span class="highlight">moth</span>, <span class="question4">the swettaria form of Biston cognataria, </span>first noticed in industrialized areas such as Chicago and New York City in the early 1900s. By 1961 it constituted over 90 percent of the <span class="highlight">population</span> in parts of Michigan.</p><p>The idea that natural <span class="highlight">selection</span> was <span class="highlight">responsible</span> for the changing <span class="highlight">ratio</span> of dark- to light-colored peppered moths was developed in the 1950s by H. B. D. Kettlewell of Oxford University. If natural <span class="highlight">selection</span> was the explanation, then there should be different <span class="highlight">survival</span> rates for dark- and light- colored moths. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> To <span class="highlight">determine</span> whether this was true, Kettlewell released thousands of light and dark moths (each <span class="highlight">marked</span> with a paint <span class="highlight">spot</span>) into <span class="highlight">rural</span> and industrialized areas. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> In the nonindustrial area of Dorset, he recaptured 14.6 percent of the <span class="highlight">pale</span> forms but only 4.7 percent of the dark forms. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span> In the <span class="highlight">industrial</span> area of Birmingham, the situation was reversed: 13 percent of <span class="highlight">pale</span> forms but 27.5 percent of dark forms were recaptured. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p><p>Clearly some <span class="highlight">environmental</span><span class="highlight">factor</span> was <span class="highlight">responsible</span> for the greater <span class="highlight">survival</span> rates of dark moths. Birds were predators of peppered moths. Kettlewell hypothesized that the normal <span class="highlight">pale</span> forms are difficult to see when resting on lichen-covered trees, whereas dark forms are <span class="highlight"><span class="question6">conspicuous</span>. </span>In industrialized areas, lichens are destroyed by pollution, tree barks become darker, and dark moths are the ones birds have difficulty <span class="question8">detecting. </span>As a test, Kettlewell set up hidden <span class="highlight">observation</span> positions and watched birds <span class="highlight">voraciously</span> eat moths placed |on tree trunks of a contrasting color. The <span class="highlight">action</span> of natural <span class="highlight">selection</span> in producing a small but highly <span class="highlight">significant</span> step of <span class="highlight">evolution</span> was seemingly demonstrated, with birds as the selecting force.</p><p>Not every researcher has been <span class="question9">convinced </span>that natural <span class="highlight">selection</span> by birds is the only explanation of the observed frequencies of dark and light peppered moths. More recent <span class="highlight">data</span>, however, provide <span class="highlight">additional</span> support for Kettleweir's ideas about natural <span class="highlight">selection</span>. The light-colored form of the peppered <span class="highlight">moth</span> is making a strong comeback. In Britain, a Clean <span class="highlight">Air</span> Act was passed in 1965. Sir Cyril Clarke has been trapping moths at his home in Liverpool, Merseyside, since 1959. Before about 1975, 90 percent of the moths were dark, but since then there has been a <span class="highlight">steep</span><span class="highlight">decline</span> in melanic forms, and in 1989 only 29.6 percent of the moths caught were melanic. The mean <span class="highlight">concentration</span> of sulphur <span class="highlight">dioxide</span> pollution fell from about 300 micrograms per cubic meter in 1970 to less than 50 micrograms per cubic meter in 1975 and has remained <span class="highlight">fairly</span><span class="highlight">constant</span> since then. If the <span class="highlight">spread</span> of the light-colored form of the <span class="highlight">moth</span> continues at the same speed as the melanic form <span class="highlight">spread</span> .in the last <span class="highlight">century</span>, soon the melanic form will again be only an <span class="highlight">occasional</span><span class="highlight">resident</span> of the Liverpool area.</p></article></div><div id="question"><div id="question1"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage?
