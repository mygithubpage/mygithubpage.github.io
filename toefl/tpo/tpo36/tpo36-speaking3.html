            <b>Allow Laptops in Class</b>
          </h4>
          <p>Though most of us own laptop computer, we are currently not allowed to use them during class. I think this policy should be changed. Since most of us type faster than we write by hand, taking notes on a computer would be quicker and easier, so we could pay more attention to professor's lectures. Also, since laptop computers have internet access, professors could direct students to view Web sites with useful information while lectures are going on. They could look up useful facts and background information on a topic or view different photographs or illustrations of something the professor is describing. This would help students gain a more complete understanding of lecture topics.

        <h3>Listening Text</h3>
        <article>
          <p>Now listen to two students discussing the letter.</p>
          <p>Woman: Did you see this letter in the paper?</p>
          <p>Man: Yeah but I don't think it's a good idea.</p>
          <p>Woman: Why not?</p>
          <p>Man: 'Cause I think students will pay even less attention to the professor, not more. I think it'd be too much distraction.</p>
          <p>Woman: How so?</p>
          <p>Man: Well maybe some students would actually use laptops to take notes.</p>
          <p>Woman: I would.</p>
          <p>Man: OK, you would. But a lot of people, most people would be too busy playing around instead. You know, surfing the internet, emailing friends, playing computer games, that kind of stuff.</p>
          <p>Woman: Huh, so you really think they pay less attention.</p>
          <p>Man: Yeah, I think that's what would happen.</p>
          <p>Woman: Alright, but what about her second point? Don't you think if students have them in class, the professor would be able to use the internet as a teaching tool?</p>
          <p>Man: Well the problem with that is that not everyone has a laptop computer, only some people have one.</p>
          <p>Woman: True.</p>
          <p>Man: So you see, not everyone would be able to follow along. It wouldn't be useful as a teaching tool if only some students could follow along but not others.</p>
          <p>Woman: I see what you mean.</p>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>The letter supposes that students should be allowed to use laptops in class. One reason it gives is students can type faster than write by hand when they need to take notes, so they can put more attention on what professor is teaching. The second reason in the letter is students can look for multimedia information in class with a laptop and gain a more comprehensive understanding of their topic. But the man in the track disagree with this letter. He thinks that on the one hand, most students will use laptops to email friends, surf the Internet or play games instead of taking notes. Thus will lead to their distraction. On the other hand, he proposes that not everyone has a laptop, so if it becomes necessary for students to look at pictures on their computer, some students will not be able to do it. It is not fair to them.</p>
