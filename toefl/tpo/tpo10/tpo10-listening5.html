To discuss environment phenomena that have changed the phosphorus cycle.</p><p>B. To illustrate how interrupting the phosphorus cycle can affect the environment.</p><p>C. To describe how phosphorus ends up in the atmosphere.</p><p>D. To explain how phosphorus gets recycled in the environment.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>At the beginning of lecture, the professor mentioned that some nutrients do not have much in the natural world. They rely mainly on circulation to make full use of it. This leads to the concept of the nutrient cycle, and the whole text is followed by this content. So the answer should be D. .</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>Which human activities that influence the phosphorus cycle does the professor mention?Click on 2 answers.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Fishing.</p><p>B. Building dams on rivers.</p><p>C. Polluting the oceans.</p><p>D. marking and using fertilizer.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="AD"><p>The professor mentioned that the two human behaviors interfere with the cycle of nutrients. The first is to make and use fertilizers, humans can play a role in a first part of the Phosphorus cycle -- the breaking down of rocks and the spreading Phosphorus into the soil by speeding up the rate at which this natural process occurs; The species is fishing. The fishing industry brings the Phosphorus back to land. It can be seen that answers A and D are correct answers.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor discuss underwater volcanoes?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To describe the location of most of the phosphorus on Earth.</p><p>B. To point out the difficulty of studying the phosphorus cycle.</p><p>C. To describe a step in the phosphorus cycle.</p><p>D. To illustrate the differences between two phases in the phosphorus cycle.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>As the professor described the operating mechanism of the phosphorus cycle, it was mentioned that the phosphorus on the sea floor came to the surface of the ocean through the explosion of a submarine volcano, which is a step to complete the phosphorus cycle. So the answer should be C.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What can be inferred about the professor 's view on phosphorus getting washed into rivers?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. She is unconcerned because phosphorus is a beneficial nutrient.</p><p>B. She is concerned about the quantity of phosphorus entering the waterways.</p><p>C. She thinks that the amount of research conducted on the topic is excessive.</p><p>D. She is frustrated that most of her students are unaware of the phenomenon.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The professor mentioned that if a large amount of phosphorus enters the river, it will cause changes in water flow. She hopes that relevant research can find a solution as soon as possible. Therefore, this question should be selected B. She is worried about the phenomenon of large quantities of phosphorus entering the river.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What comparison does the professor make involving phosphorus and nitrogen?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Sediment on the ocean floor contains more nitrogen than phosphorus.</p><p>B. The atmosphere contains more nitrogen than phosphorus.</p><p>C. Nitrogen requires more time to get recycled than phosphorus does.</p><p>D. Phosphorus is more important than nitrogen to the development of fish.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The professor said there is indeed phosphorus in the atmosphere, but there's just not substantial substantial of it there, like there is nitrogen, it's a very minimal quantity, ie the amount of phosphorus is very rare in the atmosphere, while nitrogen is more, so the answer should be Select B.</p></div></div><div class="replay" id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor mean when she says this?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. She realizes that the students are struggling with the concept.</p><p>B. She is surprised that the student knew the answer to her question.</p><p>C. She thinks that the answer to the question is obvious.</p><p>D. She thinks that this phase of the cycle has an unusual name.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>This question only looks at what the professor says, but it may mistakenly choose the answer. B thinks that the professor thinks this problem is difficult and he is surprised that the student can answer. However, for this type of question, the meaning of the context is more important than the sentence itself. It is clear that Nancy's inference is very straightforward and simple, so the meaning of teaching this sentence is "this question is Only with this difficulty, the answer should be C. The question raised by the professor is very simple and the answer is obvious.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
