            <span class="time" data-times="9.73" data-time="8.5">[00:08.50]</span>Professor: So we've been talking about nutrients, the elements in the environment that are <span class="highlight">essential</span> for living organisms to develop, live a healthy life and <span class="highlight">reproduce</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.24" data-time="18.23">[00:18.23]</span>Some nutrients are quite <span class="highlight">scarce</span>; there just isn't much of them in the environment. <span class="time" data-times="2.39" data-time="23.47">[00:23.47]</span>But fortunately they get recycled. <span class="time" data-times="5.07" data-time="25.86">[00:25.86]</span>When nutrients are used over and over in the environment, we call that a <span class="highlight">nutrient</span> <span class="highlight">cycle</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9.97" data-time="30.93">[00:30.93]</span>Because of the importance of nutrients and their <span class="highlight">scarcity</span>, <span class="highlight">nutrient</span> recycling is one of the most <span class="highlight">significant</span> eco-system processes that we'll cover in this <span class="highlight">course</span>. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="10.69" data-time="40.9">[00:40.90]</span>The three most important <span class="highlight">nutrient</span> cycles are the <span class="highlight">nitrogen</span> <span class="highlight">cycle</span>, the <span class="highlight">carbon</span> <span class="highlight">cycle</span> and the one we are going to talk about today, the Phosphorus <span class="highlight">cycle</span>. <span class="time" data-times="10.5" data-time="51.59">[00:51.59]</span>So the Phosphorus <span class="highlight">cycle</span> has been studied a lot by ecologists because like I said, Phosphorus is an important <span class="highlight">nutrient</span> and it's not so <span class="highlight">abundant</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.24" data-time="62.09">[01:02.09]</span>The largest quantities are found in rocks and at the bottom of the ocean. </p>

            <span class="time" data-times="2.08" data-time="66.33">[01:06.33]</span>How does Phosphorus get there? <span class="time" data-times="2.72" data-time="68.41">[01:08.41]</span>Well, let's start with the Phosphorus in rocks. <span class="time" data-times="4.6" data-time="71.13">[01:11.13]</span>The rocks get broken down into smaller and smaller particles as they are weathered. <span class="time" data-times="4.34" data-time="75.73">[01:15.73]</span>They are weathered slowly by rain and wind over long periods of time. <span class="time" data-times="5.85" data-time="80.07">[01:20.07]</span>Phosphorus is slowly released as the rocks are broken down and it gets <span class="highlight">spread</span> around into the soil. <span class="time" data-times="4.65" data-time="85.92">[01:25.92]</span>Once it's in the soil, plants <span class="highlight">absorb</span> it <span class="highlight">through</span> their roots. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.4" data-time="90.57">[01:30.57]</span>Student: So that's the <span class="highlight">reason</span> people <span class="highlight">mine</span> rocks that <span class="highlight">contain</span> a lot of Phosphorus to help with <span class="highlight">agriculture</span>? </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.63" data-time="96.97">[01:36.97]</span>Professor: Uh-huh, they <span class="highlight">mine</span> the rock, artificially <span class="highlight">break</span> it down and put the Phosphorus into agricultural fertilizers. <span class="time" data-times="12.33" data-time="103.6">[01:43.60]</span>So humans can play a role in the first part of the Phosphorus <span class="highlight">cycle</span> – the breaking down of rocks and the spreading of Phosphorus into the soil by speeding up the <span class="highlight">rate</span> at which this natural <span class="highlight">process</span> occurs.

          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.7" data-time="115.93">[01:55.93]</span>Now after the Phosphorus is in the soil, plants grow. <span class="time" data-times="2.46" data-time="120.63">[02:00.63]</span>They use Phosphorus from the soil to grow. <span class="time" data-times="3" data-time="123.09">[02:03.09]</span>And when they die, they <span class="highlight">decompose</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9.41" data-time="126.09">[02:06.09]</span>And the Phosphorus is recycled back into the soil; same thing with the animals that eat those plants, or eat other animals that have eaten those plants. <span class="time" data-times="4.11" data-time="135.5">[02:15.50]</span>We call all of this – the land <span class="highlight">phase</span> of the Phosphorus <span class="highlight">cycle</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.75" data-time="139.61">[02:19.61]</span>But a lot of the Phosphorus in soil gets washed away into rivers by rain and <span class="highlight">melting</span> snow. <span class="time" data-times="3.64" data-time="146.36">[02:26.36]</span>And so begins another <span class="highlight">phase</span> of the <span class="highlight">cycle</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.55" data-time="150">[02:30.00]</span>Can anyone guess what it is called?

            <span class="time" data-times="3.66" data-time="159.45">[02:39.45]</span>Professor: Yes, that's such a difficult point, isn't it? <span class="time" data-times="9.04" data-time="163.11">[02:43.11]</span>In a normal water <span class="highlight">phase</span>, rivers <span class="highlight">eventually</span> empty into oceans, and once in the oceans, the Phosphorus gets absorbed by water plants like <span class="highlight">algae</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.33" data-time="172.15">[02:52.15]</span>Then fish eats the <span class="highlight">algae</span> or eat other fish that have eaten those plants. <span class="time" data-times="5.23" data-time="177.48">[02:57.48]</span>But the water <span class="highlight">phase</span> is sometimes affected by <span class="highlight">excessive</span> fertilizers. </p>

            <span class="time" data-times="15.53" data-time="182.71">[03:02.71]</span>If not all of Phosphorus gets used by the crops and large amounts of Phosphorus gets into the rivers, this could cause rapid growth of water plants in the river, which can <span class="highlight">lead</span> to the water ways getting clogged with organisms, which can change the flow of the water. <span class="time" data-times="10.45" data-time="198.24">[03:18.24]</span>Several <span class="highlight">current</span> studies are looking at these effects and I really do hope we can find a way to <span class="highlight">deal</span> with this <span class="highlight">issue</span> before these ecosystems are <span class="highlight">adversely</span> affected.

            <span class="time" data-times="5.12" data-time="208.69">[03:28.69]</span>Of <span class="highlight">course</span>, another way that humans can <span class="highlight">interrupt</span> the normal <span class="highlight">process</span> is fishing. <span class="time" data-times="4.09" data-time="213.81">[03:33.81]</span>The fishing <span class="highlight">industry</span> helps bring Phosphorus back to land. <span class="time" data-times="8.79" data-time="217.9">[03:37.90]</span>In the normal water <span class="highlight">phase</span> the <span class="highlight">remaining</span> Phosphorus makes its way, settles to the bottom of the ocean and gets mixed into ocean sediments. </p>

            <span class="time" data-times="2.35" data-time="226.69">[03:46.69]</span>But remember, this is a <span class="highlight">cycle</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9.25" data-time="229.04">[03:49.04]</span>The Phosphorus at the bottom of the ocean has to somehow make its way back to the surface, to complete the <span class="highlight">cycle</span>, to begin the <span class="highlight">cycle</span> all over again. <span class="time" data-times="9.84" data-time="238.29">[03:58.29]</span>After millions of years, powerful geological forces, like underwater volcanoes, lift up the ocean sediments to form new land. <span class="time" data-times="7.24" data-time="248.13">[04:08.13]</span>When an underwater <span class="highlight">volcano</span> pushes submerged rock to the surface, a new island is created. <span class="time" data-times="9.93" data-time="255.37">[04:15.37]</span>Then over many more years the Phosphorus-rich rocks of the new land begin to <span class="highlight">erode</span> and the <span class="highlight">cycle</span> continues. </p>

The first is to make and use fertilizers, humans can play a role in a first part of the Phosphorus cycle -- the breaking down of rocks and the spreading Phosphorus into the soil by speeding up the rate at which this natural process occurs; The species is fishing. The fishing industry brings the Phosphorus back to land. It can be seen that answers A and D are correct answers.</p>
