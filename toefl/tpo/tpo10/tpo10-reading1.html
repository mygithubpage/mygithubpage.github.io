The ceramics fall into three <span class="highlight">broad</span> types-earthenware, stoneware, and <span class="highlight">porcelain</span>-for vessels, architectural items such as roof tiles, and modeled objects and figures. In <span class="highlight">addition</span>, there was an important group of sculptures made for <span class="highlight">religious</span> use, the <span class="highlight">majority</span> of which were produced in earthenware.</p><p>The earliest ceramics were fired to earthenware temperatures, but as early as the fifteenth <span class="highlight">century</span> B.C., high-temperature stonewares were being made with glazed surfaces. During the Six Dynasties period (AD 265-589), kilns in north China were producing high-fired ceramics of good <span class="highlight">quality</span>. Whitewares produced in Hebei and Henan provinces from the seventh to the tenth centuries <span class="question3">evolved </span>into the highly prized porcelains of the Song dynasty (AD. 960-1279), long regarded as one of the high points in the <span class="highlight">history</span> of China's <span class="highlight">ceramic</span><span class="highlight">industry</span>. <span class="question4">The tradition of <span class="highlight">religious</span><span class="highlight">sculpture</span> extends over most historical periods but is less clearly delineated than that of stonewares or porcelains, for it embraces the old <span class="highlight">custom</span> of earthenware <span class="highlight">burial</span> ceramics with later <span class="highlight">religious</span> images and architectural <span class="highlight">ornament</span>. <span class="highlight"></span>Ceramic</span> products also include lead-glazed tomb models of the Han dynasty, three-color lead-glazed vessels and figures of the Tang dynasty, and Ming three-color <span class="highlight">temple</span> ornaments, in which the motifs were outlined in a raised <span class="highlight">trail</span> of <span class="highlight">slip</span>-as well as the many <span class="highlight">burial</span> ceramics produced in <span class="highlight">imitation</span> of vessels made in materials of higher <span class="highlight">intrinsic</span> value.</p><p><span class="highlight">Trade</span> between the West and the settled and <span class="highlight">prosperous</span> Chinese dynasties introduced new forms and different technologies. 
 One of the most far-reaching examples is the <span class="highlight">impact</span> of the fine ninth-century AD. Chinese <span class="highlight">porcelain</span> wares imported into the Arab world.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>
So admired were these pieces that they encouraged the <span class="highlight">development</span> of earthenware made in <span class="highlight">imitation</span> of <span class="highlight">porcelain</span> and <span class="question6">instigated </span>research into the <span class="highlight">method</span> of their <span class="highlight">manufacture</span>.
  <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>
From the Middle East the Chinese acquired a blue <span class="highlight">pigment</span>-a purified form of cobalt <span class="highlight">oxide</span> unobtainable at that time in China-that contained only a low <span class="highlight">level</span> of manganese. Cobalt ores found in China have a high manganese <span class="highlight">content</span>, which produces a more muted blue-gray color.  <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span> In the seventeenth <span class="highlight">century</span>, the trading activities of the Dutch East India <span class="highlight">Company</span> 
 resulted in <span class="highlight">vast</span> quantities of decorated Chinese <span class="highlight">porcelain</span> being brought to Europe, which <span class="highlight">stimulated</span> and influenced the work of a wide <span class="highlight">variety</span> of wares, <span class="highlight">notably</span> Delft.
  <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>The Chinese themselves adapted many <span class="highlight">specific</span><span class="highlight">vessel</span> forms from the West, such as bottles with long spouts, and designed a <span class="highlight">range</span> of <span class="highlight">decorative</span> patterns especially for the European <span class="highlight">market</span>.</p><p>Just as painted designs on Greek pots may <span class="highlight">seem</span> today to be purely <span class="highlight">decorative</span>, <span class="question8">whereas </span>in fact they were carefully and precisely worked out so that at the time, their meaning was <span class="highlight">clear</span>, so it is with Chinese pots. To twentieth-century eyes, Chinese <span class="highlight">pottery</span> may <span class="highlight">appear</span> merely <span class="highlight">decorative</span>, yet to the Chinese the form of each object and its <span class="highlight">adornment</span> had meaning and <span class="highlight">significance</span>. The dragon represented the <span class="highlight">emperor</span>, and the phoenix, the empress; the pomegranate indicated <span class="highlight">fertility</span>, and a pair of fish, happiness; mandarin ducks stood for wedded <span class="highlight">bliss</span>; the <span class="highlight">pine</span> tree, peach, and <span class="highlight">crane</span> are emblems of long life; and fish leaping from waves indicated success in the <span class="highlight">civil</span> service examinations. Only when European <span class="highlight">decorative</span> themes were introduced did these meanings become obscured or <span class="highlight">even</span> lost.</p><p>From early times pots were used in both <span class="highlight">religious</span> and <span class="highlight">secular</span> contexts. The <span class="highlight">imperial</span><span class="highlight">court</span> commissioned work and in the Yuan dynasty (A.D. 1279-1368) an <span class="highlight">imperial</span><span class="highlight">ceramic</span> factory was established at Jingdezhen. Pots played an important part in some <span class="highlight">religious</span> ceremonies. Long and often lyrical descriptions of the different types of <span class="highlight">ware</span> exist that assist in classifying pots, although <span class="question12">these</span> sometimes confuse an already large and <span class="highlight">complicated</span> picture.</p></article></div><div id="question"><div id="question1"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">status</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p><label class="my-label"><span>A. origin</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><label class="my-label"><span>B. importance</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><label class="my-label"><span>C. quality</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><label class="my-label"><span>D. design</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><p><span>Answer: </span><span class="my-answer">B</span></p></div><div id="question2"><p>According to paragraph 2, which of the following is true of Chinese ceramics?</p><label class="my-label"><span>A.
