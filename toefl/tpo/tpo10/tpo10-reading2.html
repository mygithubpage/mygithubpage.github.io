We know that over the past <span class="highlight">millennia</span> the <span class="highlight">climate</span> has undergone <span class="highlight">major</span> changes without any <span class="highlight">significant</span> human intervention. We also know that the global <span class="highlight">climate</span> system is immensely <span class="highlight">complicated</span> and that everything is in some way connected, and so the system is <span class="highlight">capable</span> of fluctuating in unexpected ways. We need <span class="highlight">therefore</span> to know how much the <span class="highlight">climate</span> can <span class="highlight">vary</span> of its own <span class="highlight">accord</span> in order to <span class="highlight">interpret</span> with <span class="highlight">confidence</span> the <span class="highlight">extent</span> to which recent changes are natural as <span class="highlight">opposed</span> to being the result of human activities.</p><p><span class="highlight">Instrumental</span> records do not go back far enough to provide us with <span class="highlight">reliable</span> measurements of global <span class="highlight">climatic</span><span class="highlight">variability</span> on timescales longer than a <span class="highlight">century</span>. What we do know is that as we include longer time intervals, the <span class="highlight">record</span> shows increasing <span class="highlight">evidence</span> of slow swings in <span class="highlight">climate</span> between different regimes. To build up a better picture of fluctuations <span class="highlight">appreciably</span> further back in time requires us to use proxy records.</p><p><span class="question3">Over long periods of time, substances whose <span class="highlight">physical</span> and chemical properties change with the <span class="highlight">ambient</span><span class="highlight">climate</span> at the time can be deposited in a <span class="highlight">systematic</span> way to provide a <span class="highlight">continuous</span><span class="highlight">record</span> of changes in those properties <span class="highlight">overtime</span>, sometimes for hundreds or thousands of years.</span> Generally, the layering occurs on an <span class="highlight">annual</span> basis, hence the observed changes in the records can be <span class="highlight">dated</span>. Information on <span class="highlight">temperature</span>, <span class="highlight">rainfall</span>, and other aspects of the <span class="highlight">climate</span> that can be inferred from the <span class="highlight">systematic</span> changes in properties is usually referred to as proxy <span class="highlight">data</span>. Proxy <span class="highlight">temperature</span> records have been reconstructed from ice <span class="highlight">core</span> drilled out of the central Greenland ice cap, calcite shells embedded in layered lake sediments in Western Europe, ocean floor <span class="highlight">sediment</span> cores from the <span class="highlight">tropical</span> Atlantic Ocean, ice cores from <span class="highlight">Peruvian</span> glaciers, and ice cores from eastern <span class="highlight">Antarctica</span>. While these records provide broadly <span class="highlight">consistent</span> indications that <span class="highlight">temperature</span> variations can <span class="highlight">occur</span> on a global <span class="highlight">scale</span>, there are <span class="highlight">nonetheless</span> some <span class="highlight">intriguing</span> differences, which suggest that the <span class="highlight">pattern</span> of <span class="highlight">temperature</span> variations in regional climates can also differ <span class="highlight">significantly</span> from each other.</p><p>What the proxy records make abundantly <span class="highlight">clear</span> is that there have been <span class="highlight">significant</span> natural changes in the <span class="highlight">climate</span> over timescales longer than a few thousand years. Equally <span class="highlight"><span class="question5">striking</span></span>, however, is the <span class="highlight">relative</span><span class="highlight">stability</span> of the <span class="highlight">climate</span> in the past 10.000 years (the Holocene period).</p><p>To the <span class="highlight">extent</span> that the <span class="highlight">coverage</span> of the global <span class="highlight">climate</span> from these records can provide a <span class="highlight">measure</span> of its true <span class="highlight">variability</span>, it should at <span class="highlight">least</span><span class="highlight">indicate</span> how all the natural causes of <span class="highlight">climate</span> change have combined. These include the <span class="highlight">chaotic</span> fluctuations of the <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span>, the slower but equally <span class="highlight"><span class="question7">erratic</span></span><span class="highlight">behavior</span> of the oceans, changes in the land surfaces, and the <span class="highlight">extent</span> of ice and snow. Also included will be any variations that have arisen from <span class="highlight">volcanic</span><span class="highlight">activity</span>, <span class="highlight">solar</span><span class="highlight">activity</span>, and, possibly, human activities.</p><p>One way to <span class="highlight">estimate</span> how all the various processes <span class="highlight">leading</span> to <span class="highlight">climate</span><span class="highlight">variability</span> will <span class="highlight">combine</span> is by using computer models of the global <span class="highlight">climate</span>. They can do only so much to <span class="highlight">represent</span> the full <span class="highlight">complexity</span> of the global <span class="highlight">climate</span> and hence may give only limited information about natural <span class="highlight">variability</span>. Studies suggest that to <span class="highlight">date</span> the <span class="highlight">variability</span> in computer simulations is <span class="highlight">considerably</span> smaller than in <span class="highlight">data</span> obtained from the proxy records.</p><p>In <span class="highlight">addition</span> to the <span class="highlight">internal</span><span class="highlight">variability</span> of the global <span class="highlight">climate</span> system itself, there is the added <span class="highlight">factor</span> of <span class="highlight">external</span> influences, 
such as volcanoes and <span class="highlight">solar</span><span class="highlight">activity</span>.  <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>There is a growing body of opinion that both these <span class="highlight">physical</span> variations have a measurable <span class="highlight">impact</span> on the <span class="highlight">climate</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>Thus we need to be able to include these in our <span class="question10">deliberations</span>.  <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>Some <span class="highlight">current</span> analyses <span class="highlight">conclude</span> that volcanoes and <span class="highlight">solar</span><span class="highlight">activity</span> explain quite a <span class="highlight">considerable</span><span class="highlight">amount</span> of
the observed <span class="highlight">variability</span> in the period from the seventeenth to the early twentieth centuries, but that they cannot be <span class="question11">invoked</span> to explain the rapid warming in recent decades. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 1, which of the following must we find out in order to determine the impact of human activities upon climate?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The major changes in climate over the past millennia</p><p>B. The degree to which the climate varies naturally</p><p>C. The best method for measuring climatic change</p><p>D. The millennium when humans began to interfere with the climate</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B. With human activities as the key word, go to the first sentence and say that B must be determined before determining the impact of humans on the climate. So B is correct. Both A and D mentioned millenium. This is not what the sentence says, so both are wrong. C's best method did not say either.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 2, an advantage of proxy records over instrumental records is that</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. they are more-reliable measures of climatic variability in the past century</p><p>B. they provide more-accurate measures of local temperatures</p><p>C. they provide information on climate fluctuations further back in time</p><p>D. they reveal information about the human impact on the climate</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C. Using proxy records as a keyword to locate the last sentence, a better picture of fluctuations further back in time, referring to the time is longer, so the answer is C, this is relatively simple, exactly the same as the article.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Because physical and chemical properties of substances are unchanging, they are useful records of climate fluctuations over time.</p><p>B. For hundreds or thousands of years, people have been observing changes in the chemical and physical properties of substances in order to infer climate change.</p><p>C. Because it takes long periods of time for the climate to change, systematic changes in the properties of substances are difficult to observe.</p><p>D. Changes in systematically deposited substances that are affected by climate can indicate climate variations over time.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D, after removing the attributive clause, the original text becomes substance can be deposited to record blabla. The causal relations between A and C are hard, the original is not, and wrong; and A is unchanging, the original is change, A is antithetical; B Is record, not infer, B wrong; and C said difficult to observe, the original did not say, wrong; D correct.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 3, scientists are able to reconstruct proxy temperature records by</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. studying regional differences in temperature variations</p><p>B. studying and dating changes in the properties of substances</p><p>C. observing changes in present day climate conditions</p><p>D. inferring past climate shifts from observations of current climatic changes</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B. Use the word "peoxy temperature records" to locate the key word in the fourth sentence. This sentence says that many methods for reconstructing temperature, whether it is glaciers, sediments, or carbonates, belong to substance, so B is correct and others have not said.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question5">striking</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. noticeable</p><p>B. confusing</p><p>C. true</p><p>D. unlikely</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" A"><p>Striking: Significant and attractive. A is significant and worth noting; B is confusing; C is correct; D is impossible. So noticeable is rightly noticeable. Corresponding to the original sentence: Equally <span class="question5">striking</span>, however, is the relative stability of the climate in the past 10,000 years (the Holocene period). The sentence begins with the same stricking, indicating that there must be a very <span class="question5">striking</span> thing before. The previous sentence says there are significant natural changes, so the synonyms for significant are streking.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraphs 3 and 4, proxy data have suggested all of the following about the climate EXCEPT:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Regional climates may change overtime.</p><p>B. The climate has changed very little in the past 10,000 years.</p><p>C. Global temperatures vary more than regional temperatures.</p><p>D. Important natural changes in climate have occurred over large timescales.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The fourth paragraph is very short and I finished it quickly. A and D correspond to the fourth sentence of the first sentence: What the proxy records make abundantly clear is that there have been significant natural changes in the climate over timescales longer than a few thousand years. The climate will change in a period of time; the second sentence The stability in B corresponds to changed little:Evenly <span class="question5">striking</span>, however, is the relative stability of the climate in the past 10.000 years (the Holocene period). So this B option is correct, not selected; only the comparison of C is in the original Did not say so C is the answer.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question7">erratic</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. dramatic</p><p>B. important</p><p>C. unpredictable</p><p>D. common</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" C"><p>Erratic: Weird, unstable, <span class="question7">erratic</span>. A is dramatic and attracts attention; B is important; C is unpredictable; D is common and common. So C, unpredictable is correct. Corresponding to the original: These include the chaotic fluctuations of the atmosphere, the slower but equally <span class="question7">erratic</span> behavior of the oceans, changes in the land surfaces, and the extent of ice and snow. The original sentence is equal to <span class="question7">erratic</span>, so before there must be one with <span class="question7">erratic</span> Words with similar meaning have chaotic fluctuations before, so <span class="question7">erratic</span> and chaotic are synonyms, chaotic chaos, and the only unpredictable option in the alternative is reliable. ABD is not right.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>All of the following are mentioned in paragraph 5 as natural causes of climate change EXCEPT</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. atmospheric changes</p><p>B. the slow movement of landmasses</p><p>C. fluctuations in the amount of ice and snow</p><p>D. changes in ocean activity</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B EXCEPT questions, exclusion method. A corresponds to the second sentence of the fluctuation of the atmosphere, correct, not selected; B and the original changes in land surface there is a clear distinction, wrong, election; C corresponds to the original text of the extent of ice and snow, correct, not selected; D corresponds to the original Erratic behavior of the ocean, correct, not selected.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 6, which of the following is true of computer models of the global climate?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The information they produce is still limited.</p><p>B. They are currently most useful in understanding past climatic behaviors.</p><p>C. They allow researchers to interpret the data obtained from proxy records.</p><p>D. They do not provide information about regional climates.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A. Use computer models as the key word to locate the first sentence, but this sentence is just a matter of repeating the problem. Say the computer model can give the climate complexity and give limited info, only A answer says limited info, so A is correct. Did not say anything else.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question10">deliberations</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. records</p><p>B. discussions</p><p>C. results</p><p>D. variations</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>Deliberation: Thoughtful deliberation. A is a record; B is a discussion; C is a result; D is a change. So B's discussions are correct. Corresponding to the original text: Thus we need to be able to include these in our <span class="question10">deliberations</span>. This sentence begins with thus, indicating that this sentence is a result. The reason for the result is that more and more people think that these physical changes are The impact is computable, so we must include it in what we do. A record and C result can't be covered by subjective things, so it's wrong; our change is completely insensitive.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question11">invoked</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. demonstrated</p><p>B. called upon</p><p>C. supported</p><p>D. expected</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>Invoke: cause, help. In indicates internal, voke indicates sound, so B's call upon causes correct. A is an exhibition; C is a support; D is an expectation. Corresponding to the original: Some current analyses precipitate that volcanoes and solar activity explain quite a substantial amount of the observed variability in the period from the seventeenth to the early twentieth centuries, but that they cannot be <span class="question11">invoked</span> to explain the rapid warming in recent decades. The analysis can lead to some conclusions, but these conclusions cannot explain the rapid climate warming. Demonstration and support are wrong. Even if it is correct to support interpretation and display of explanations, it cannot be used dynamically; expecting substitution is correct, so we must rely on understanding.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the author's purpose in presenting the information in paragraph 7?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To compare the influence of volcanoes and solar activity on climate variability with the influence of factors external to the global climate system</p><p>B. To indicate that there are other types of influences on climate variability in addition to those previously discussed</p><p>C. To explain how external influences on climate variability differ from internal influences</p><p>D. To argue that the rapid warming of Earth in recent decades cannot be explained</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B. Asked the first sentence of the entire paragraph. This sentence says that in addition to the internal, there is an external, a typical sentence. The first part is what is to be said, which is the part of the external, so the answer It is B. Both A and C say that they are compared, and the original text has no comparison at all; D is wrong because the original text does not have an argument.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Indeed, the contribution of volcanoes and solar activity would more likely have been to actually reduce the rate of warming slightly..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D three transition points, nouns volcanoes and solar activity, warming and adverbs indeed, according to the volcanoes and solar activity to determine the correct C or D; indefinite turning meaning, the previous saying fast warming, followed by the turning point should be to reduce the warming, so The correct answer is D.</p></div></div><div id="question14" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>A number of different and complex factors influence changes in the global climate over long periods of time.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.In the absence of instrumental records, proxy data allow scientists to infer information about past climates.</p><p>B.Scientists see a consistent pattern in the global temperature variations that have occurred in the past.</p><p>C.Computer models are used to estimate how the different causes of climate variability combine to account for the climate variability that occurs.</p><p>D.Scientists have successfully separated natural climate variation from changes related to human activities.</p><p>E.Scientists believe that activities outside the global climate system, such as volcanoes and solar activity may have significant effects on the system.</p><p>F.Scientists have concluded that human activity accounts for the rapid global warming in recent decades.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="ACE"><p>A.C.E In the absence of options corresponds to the first and last sentence of the second paragraph of the original text, correct. The Scientists see option is the opposite of the third sentence, wrong, not selected. The Computers option corresponds to the sixth paragraph of the original text, correct. The Scientists have successfully option is the opposite of the first sentence of the first paragraph. The Scientists believe option corresponds to the first sentence of the original paragraph, correct. The Scientists have concluded the option did not say, do not choose.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
