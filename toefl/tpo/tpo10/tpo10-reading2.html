            <b>Variations in the Climate</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>One of the most difficult aspects of deciding whether <span class="underline">current</span> <span class="underline">climatic</span> events <span class="underline">reveal</span> <span class="underline">evidence</span> of the <span class="underline">impact</span> of human activities is that it is hard to get a <span class="underline">measure</span> of what constitutes the natural <span class="underline">variability</span> of the <span class="underline">climate</span>. We know that over the past <span class="underline">millennia</span> the <span class="underline">climate</span> has undergone <span class="underline">major</span> changes without any <span class="underline">significant</span> human intervention. We also know that the global <span class="underline">climate</span> system is immensely <span class="underline">complicated</span> and that everything is in some way connected, and so the system is <span class="underline">capable</span> of fluctuating in unexpected ways. We need <span class="underline">therefore</span> to know how much the <span class="underline">climate</span> can <span class="underline">vary</span> of its own <span class="underline">accord</span> in order to <span class="underline">interpret</span> with <span class="underline">confidence</span> the <span class="underline">extent</span> to which recent changes are natural as <span class="underline">opposed</span> to being the result of human activities.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="underline">Instrumental</span> records do not go back far enough to provide us with <span class="underline">reliable</span> measurements of global <span class="underline">climatic</span> <span class="underline">variability</span> on timescales longer than a <span class="underline">century</span>. What we do know is that as we include longer time intervals, the <span class="underline">record</span> shows increasing <span class="underline">evidence</span> of slow swings in <span class="underline">climate</span> between different regimes. To build up a better picture of fluctuations <span class="underline">appreciably</span> further back in time requires us to use proxy records.</p>
          <p>Over long periods of time, substances whose <span class="underline">physical</span> and chemical properties change with the <span class="underline">ambient</span> <span class="underline">climate</span> at the time can be deposited in a <span class="underline">systematic</span> way to provide a <span class="underline">continuous</span> <span class="underline">record</span> of changes in those properties <span class="underline">overtime</span>, sometimes for hundreds or thousands of years. Generally, the layering occurs on an <span class="underline">annual</span> basis, hence the observed changes in the records can be <span class="underline">dated</span>. Information on <span class="underline">temperature</span>, <span class="underline">rainfall</span>, and other aspects of the <span class="underline">climate</span> that can be inferred from the <span class="underline">systematic</span> changes in properties is usually referred to as proxy <span class="underline">data</span>. Proxy <span class="underline">temperature</span> records have been reconstructed from ice <span class="underline">core</span> drilled out of the central Greenland ice cap, calcite shells embedded in layered lake sediments in Western Europe, ocean floor <span class="underline">sediment</span> cores from the <span class="underline">tropical</span> Atlantic Ocean, ice cores from <span class="underline">Peruvian</span> glaciers, and ice cores from eastern <span class="underline">Antarctica</span>. While these records provide broadly <span class="underline">consistent</span> indications that <span class="underline">temperature</span> variations can <span class="underline">occur</span> on a global <span class="underline">scale</span>, there are <span class="underline">nonetheless</span> some <span class="underline">intriguing</span> differences, which suggest that the <span class="underline">pattern</span> of <span class="underline">temperature</span> variations in regional climates can also differ <span class="underline">significantly</span> from each other.</p>
          <p>What the proxy records make abundantly <span class="underline">clear</span> is that there have been <span class="underline">significant</span> natural changes in the <span class="underline">climate</span> over timescales longer than a few thousand years. Equally <span class="underline">striking</span>, however, is the <span class="underline">relative</span> <span class="underline">stability</span> of the <span class="underline">climate</span> in the past 10.000 years (the Holocene period).</p>
          <p>To the <span class="underline">extent</span> that the <span class="underline">coverage</span> of the global <span class="underline">climate</span> from these records can provide a <span class="underline">measure</span> of its true <span class="underline">variability</span>, it should at <span class="underline">least</span> <span class="underline">indicate</span> how all the natural causes of <span class="underline">climate</span> change have combined. These include the <span class="underline">chaotic</span> fluctuations of the <span class="underline">atmosphere</span>, the slower but equally <span class="underline">erratic</span> <span class="underline">behavior</span> of the oceans, changes in the land surfaces, and the <span class="underline">extent</span> of ice and snow. Also included will be any variations that have arisen from <span class="underline">volcanic</span> <span class="underline">activity</span>, <span class="underline">solar</span> <span class="underline">activity</span>, and, possibly, human activities.</p>
          <p>One way to <span class="underline">estimate</span> how all the various processes <span class="underline">leading</span> to <span class="underline">climate</span> <span class="underline">variability</span> will <span class="underline">combine</span> is by using computer models of the global <span class="underline">climate</span>. They can do only so much to <span class="underline">represent</span> the full <span class="underline">complexity</span> of the global <span class="underline">climate</span> and hence may give only limited information about natural <span class="underline">variability</span>. Studies suggest that to <span class="underline">date</span> the <span class="underline">variability</span> in computer simulations is <span class="underline">considerably</span> smaller than in <span class="underline">data</span> obtained from the proxy records.</p>
          <p>In <span class="underline">addition</span> to the <span class="underline">internal</span> <span class="underline">variability</span> of the global <span class="underline">climate</span> system itself, there is the added <span class="underline">factor</span> of <span class="underline">external</span> influences, 
such as volcanoes and <span class="underline">solar</span> <span class="underline">activity</span>.  <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>There is a growing body of opinion that both these <span class="underline">physical</span> variations have a measurable <span class="underline">impact</span> on the <span class="underline">climate</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>Thus we need to be able to include these in our deliberations.  <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>Some <span class="underline">current</span> analyses <span class="underline">conclude</span> that volcanoes and <span class="underline">solar</span> <span class="underline">activity</span> explain quite a <span class="underline">considerable</span> <span class="underline">amount</span> of
the observed <span class="underline">variability</span> in the period from the seventeenth to the early twentieth centuries, but that they cannot be invoked to explain the rapid warming in recent decades. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p>
