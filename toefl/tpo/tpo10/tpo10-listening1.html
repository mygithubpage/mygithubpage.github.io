              <span class="time" data-times="6.45" data-time="10.92">[00:10.92]</span>Student: Remember last week, you told us that it's really important to get our <span class="underline">photography</span> into a show, basically as soon as we can? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.56" data-time="17.37">[00:17.37]</span>Professor: Yup, it's a big step, no question. </p>

              <span class="time" data-times="7.26" data-time="90.72">[01:30.72]</span>Professor: OK, just remember that is one thing to create work that you really want to create when it's in the classroom. <span class="time" data-times="2.46" data-time="97.98">[01:37.98]</span>The only thing at <span class="underline">stake</span> is your grade. <span class="time" data-times="3.21" data-time="100.44">[01:40.44]</span>But work created outside the classroom? <span class="time" data-times="1.91" data-time="103.65">[01:43.65]</span>That can be in a different story. <span class="time" data-times="3.16" data-time="105.56">[01:45.56]</span>I'm not talking about <span class="underline">technique</span> or things like that. <span class="time" data-times="5.07" data-time="108.72">[01:48.72]</span>It's just that there is so much more at <span class="underline">stake</span> when you are out there making art for a living. <span class="time" data-times="6.32" data-time="113.79">[01:53.79]</span>There's a lot of <span class="underline">pressure</span> to become something you are not, and people often <span class="underline">surrender</span> to that <span class="underline">pressure</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.78" data-time="120.11">[02:00.11]</span>Student: But to get <span class="underline">stuff</span> exhibited... </p>
