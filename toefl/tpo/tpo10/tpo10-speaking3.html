          <h4 class="w3-center">Student Art Display</h4>
          <p>The university is currently considering possible locations on campus for displaying paintings and other artwork by students. I think the lobby at the entrance to the student center would be a great location. Since many students pass through the student center every day, artwork displayed in the lobby would be viewed by hundreds of people. Also, because the whole front of the building is made of glass window, the lobby is filled with natural light. This makes it perfect for displaying artwork, which should have plenty of light to be seen and appreciated.</p>
          <p>Sincerely,</p>
          <p>Paul Sands</p>

          <p>Now listen to two students discussing the letter.</p>
          <p>(man) Mary, you're an art student. What do you think of this letter? (woman) I don't like the idea.</p>
          <p>(man) Why not?</p>
          <p>(woman) Well, first of all, his first point about a lot of people passing through the student center, that's true, but..</p>
          <p>(man) But?</p>
          <p>(woman) But it's always crowded with people coming and going. It's not good for showing artwork. Imagine you're standing there, trying to look at the painting, it's gonna be like a million people walking through. People walking in front of you, blocking your view, distracting you. (man) Hmmm. Yeah, I haven't thought of it.</p>
          <p>(woman) You won't be able to appreciate the artwork or get a good look at anything with so much going on, with so many people moving around.</p>
          <p>(man) Yeah, I see what you mean.</p>
          <p>(woman) Plus, he's wrong about the windows.</p>
          <p>(man) But isn't it true that it's good for art to have lots of light?</p>
          <p>(woman) In a sense, yeah, but that kind of light, all that natural light from windows, that's actually not good, because if it's really sunny out it will be way too bright, if it's cloudy, it will be way too dark.</p>
          <p>(man) Oh!</p>
          <p>(woman) What you want is controlled light, consistent light, the kind you get from electrical light bulb. Think about in an art museum. In an art museum, you've got electric lighting and the light is always carefully controlled, always at the same level</p>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>Well according to the proposal, the student's suggesting that the university should display the students' paintings and other artworks at the entrance to the students' center. However the woman disagrees with that proposal for two main reasons. First of all, she thinks the entrance of the students' center is crowded with people coming and going, which will block the views of the displays and is very distracting. Secondly, she believes that the displays need controlled lights like art museum to keep the light always at the same level instead of the natural light from windows which is changing all the time, either too bright or too dark. So based on the reasons given above the woman disagrees with the proposal. (126 words)</p>
