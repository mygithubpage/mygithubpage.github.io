All children should be required to learn a second language in school.</p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>I don't think all children should be required to learn a second language in school. Some children don't even like to learn language. They are more interested in playing basketball, football and other sports. Even if they are required to learn a second language, they won't treat it seriously. I had many friends in junior high who didn't learn language at all. But they could play basketball very well and maybe some of them can become professional players. There is no need to learn a second language to achieve their goal. Also, many of the children won't have chance to use the second language they learned at school, because when they grow up their job doesn't need any foreign language skills. For example, many of my high school classmates now work as clerks in banks and they don't need to use foreign language in their work. Still, they can do just fine.</p></article></div></main></body></html>
