However, some new research's suggesting that babies may be able to feel concern for others, to have empathy for others.Now, empathy is a complex emotion. It involves a baby relating to someone else's emotions, not just reacting to things happening directly to them. Let's talk about an experiment that may show that babies could be capable of feeling empathy.Ok, for the first part of the experiment, well, um, we've always known that babies start to cry when they hear other babies crying, right? One baby in a room starts crying and all the rest join in. We've always assumed that the other babies cry because they were reacting to the noise of crying, that the noise itself was distressing. So, in the experiment researchers play tape recording, a tape of baby's crying, to another baby. And sure enough, the baby started crying when he heard the sound of other baby's crying. This was no surprise, of course. An d the researchers assumed that the baby cried because of the noise. But the next part of the experiment was surprising. The researchers played the baby a tape of his own crying. Now it was just as noisy, so the researchers expected him to cry. However, this time the baby did not cry. He wasn't upset b y the sound of his own crying. Why not? Well, maybe it wasn't the noise that made him cry before when he heard other baby's crying.In fact, maybe noise has nothing to do with it. It could be that the baby felt empathy for the other babies. And that was why he got upset when he heard them crying. Researchers concluded that it is indeed possible that babies feel empathy, concern for others."</p></article></section><section id="question"><h4>Question</h4><p>Using the points from the lecture explain why researchers think that babies may feel empathy. </p></section><section id="sample-response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><article><p>Babies were assumed to react only to themselves, but there're experiments that show that babies actually have emotion of higher level, that is empathy, which means they can relate and react to the feelings of the others. In the first part of the experiment, the researcher played to the baby some other babies' cry, and the baby cried when it heard the recording. So at this stage, the researchers assumed that baby cried because of the noise, which was distressing itself. However, they realized later that they were wrong when they did the second part of the experiment, in which they played the tape of the baby's own cry and surprisingly found that the baby didn't cry. The second part of the experiment suggests that the baby was probably not upset by the noise of cry as it didn't cry for his own cry, but that it felt the empathy for the babies whose cry was recorded in the tape.
