Among the <span class="question2">key </span>factors behind this growth were increased agricultural <span class="highlight">productivity</span> and an <span class="highlight">expansion</span> of <span class="highlight">trade</span>.</p><p>Populations cannot grow unless the <span class="highlight">rural</span><span class="highlight">economy</span> can produce enough <span class="highlight">additional</span> food to feed more people. During the sixteenth <span class="highlight">century</span>, farmers brought more land into <span class="highlight">cultivation</span> at the expense of forests and fens (<span class="highlight">low-lying</span> wetlands). Dutch land <span class="highlight">reclamation</span> in the Netherlands in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries provides the most <span class="highlight">spectacular</span> example of the <span class="highlight">expansion</span> of farmland: the Dutch reclaimed more than 36.000 acres from 1590 to 1615 alone.</p><p>Much of the <span class="highlight">potential</span> for European <span class="highlight">economic</span><span class="highlight">development</span><span class="highlight">lay</span> in what at first <span class="highlight">glance</span> would <span class="highlight">seem</span> to have been only sleepy villages. Such villages, however, generally <span class="highlight">lay</span> in regions of <span class="highlight">relatively</span><span class="highlight">advanced</span> agricultural production, permitting not only the <span class="highlight">survival</span> of peasants but also the <span class="highlight">accumulation</span> of an agricultural <span class="highlight">surplus</span> for investment. They had <span class="highlight">access</span> to <span class="highlight">urban</span> merchants, markets, and <span class="highlight">trade</span> routes.</p><p>Increased agricultural production in turn facilitated <span class="highlight">rural</span><span class="highlight">industry</span>, an <span class="highlight">intrinsic</span> part of the <span class="highlight">expansion</span> of <span class="highlight">industry</span>. Woolens and <span class="highlight">textile</span> manufacturers, in <span class="highlight">particular</span>, utilized <span class="highlight">rural</span> cottage (in-home) production, which took <span class="highlight">advantage</span> of cheap and <span class="highlight">plentiful</span><span class="highlight">rural</span> labor. In the German states, the ravages of the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648) further moved <span class="highlight">textile</span> production into the countryside. Members of poor peasant families spun or wove cloth and linens at home for scant remuneration in an <span class="highlight">attempt</span> to <span class="highlight">supplement</span><span class="highlight"><span class="question6">meager</span></span>family income.</p><p>More extended trading networks also helped develop Europe's <span class="highlight">economy</span> in this period. <span class="question7">English and Dutch ships carrying <span class="highlight">rye</span> from the Baltic states reached Spain and Portugal. <span class="highlight"></span>Population</span> growth generated an <span class="highlight">expansion</span> of small-scale manufacturing, particularly of handicrafts, textiles, and metal production in England, Flanders, parts of northern Italy, the southwestern German states, and parts of Spain. Only iron <span class="highlight">smelting</span> and <span class="highlight">mining</span> required marshaling a <span class="highlight">significant</span><span class="highlight">amount</span> of capital (wealth invested to create more wealth).</p><p>The <span class="highlight">development</span> of banking and other <span class="highlight">financial</span> services contributed to the <span class="highlight">expansion</span> of <span class="highlight">trade</span>. By the middle of the sixteenth <span class="highlight">century</span>, 
 financiers and traders commonly accepted bills of <span class="highlight">exchange</span> in place of gold or silver for other goods. Bills of <span class="highlight">exchange</span>, which had their origins in <span class="highlight">medieval</span> Italy, 
 were promissory notes (written promises to <span class="highlight">pay</span> a <span class="highlight">specified</span><span class="highlight">amount</span> of money by a certain <span class="highlight">date</span>) that could be sold to third parties. In this way, they provided <span class="highlight">credit</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>At mid-century, 
 an Antwerp financier only <span class="highlight">slightly</span> exaggerated when he claimed, "0ne can no more <span class="highlight">trade</span> without bills of <span class="highlight">exchange</span> than sail without water."  <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>Merchants no longer had to carry gold and 
 silver over long, dangerous journeys. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>An Amsterdam <span class="highlight">merchant</span> purchasing soap from a <span class="highlight">merchant</span> in Marseille could go to an exchanger and <span class="highlight">pay</span> the exchanger the <span class="highlight">equivalent</span><span class="highlight">sum</span> in guilders, 
 the Dutch <span class="highlight">currency</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>The exchanger would then send a <span class="highlight">bill</span> of <span class="highlight">exchange</span> to a <span class="highlight">colleague</span> in Marseille, authorizing the <span class="highlight">colleague</span> to <span class="highlight">pay</span> the Marseille <span class="highlight">merchant</span> in the <span class="highlight">merchant</span>'s own <span class="highlight">currency</span> 
 after the actual <span class="highlight">exchange</span> of goods had taken place.</p><p>Bills of <span class="highlight">exchange</span> contributed to the <span class="highlight">development</span> of banks, as exchangers began to provide loans. Not until the eighteenth <span class="highlight">century</span>, however, did such banks as the Bank of Amsterdam and the Bank of England begin to provide capital for business investment. Their <span class="highlight">principal</span><span class="highlight">function</span> was to provide funds for the <span class="highlight">state</span>.</p><p>The rapid <span class="highlight">expansion</span> in international <span class="highlight">trade</span> also benefitted from an infusion of capital, stemming largely from gold and silver brought by Spanish vessels from the Americas. This capital financed the production of goods, <span class="highlight">storage</span>, <span class="highlight">trade</span>, and <span class="highlight">even</span><span class="highlight">credit</span><span class="highlight">across</span> Europe and <span class="highlight">overseas</span>. Moreover an increased <span class="highlight">credit</span><span class="highlight">supply</span> was generated by investments and loans by bankers and wealthy merchants to states and by joint-stock partnerships-<span class="question11">an English <span class="highlight">innovation</span> (</span>the first <span class="highlight">major</span><span class="highlight">company</span> began in 1600). Unlike short-term <span class="highlight">financial</span><span class="highlight">cooperation</span> between investors for a single <span class="highlight">commercial</span><span class="highlight">undertaking</span>, joint-stock companies provided <span class="highlight">permanent</span><span class="highlight">funding</span> of capital by drawing on the investments of merchants and other investors who purchased shares in the <span class="highlight">company</span>.</p></article></div><div id="question"><div id="question1"><p>According to paragraph 1, what was true of Europe during the medieval period?</p><label class="my-label"><span>A.
