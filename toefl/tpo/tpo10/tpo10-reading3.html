            <b>Seventeenth-Century European Economic Growth</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>In the late sixteenth <span class="underline">century</span> and into the seventeenth, Europe continued the growth that had lifted it out of the <span class="underline">relatively</span> less <span class="underline">prosperous</span> <span class="underline">medieval</span> period (from the mid 400s to the late 1400s). Among the key factors behind this growth were increased agricultural <span class="underline">productivity</span> and an <span class="underline">expansion</span> of <span class="underline">trade</span>.</p>
          <p>Populations cannot grow unless the <span class="underline">rural</span> <span class="underline">economy</span> can produce enough <span class="underline">additional</span> food to feed more people. During the sixteenth <span class="underline">century</span>, farmers brought more land into <span class="underline">cultivation</span> at the expense of forests and fens (<span class="underline">low-lying</span> wetlands). Dutch land <span class="underline">reclamation</span> in the Netherlands in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries provides the most <span class="underline">spectacular</span> example of the <span class="underline">expansion</span> of farmland: the Dutch reclaimed more than 36.000 acres from 1590 to 1615 alone.</p>
          <p>Much of the <span class="underline">potential</span> for European <span class="underline">economic</span> <span class="underline">development</span> <span class="underline">lay</span> in what at first <span class="underline">glance</span> would <span class="underline">seem</span> to have been only sleepy villages. Such villages, however, generally <span class="underline">lay</span> in regions of <span class="underline">relatively</span> <span class="underline">advanced</span> agricultural production, permitting not only the <span class="underline">survival</span> of peasants but also the <span class="underline">accumulation</span> of an agricultural <span class="underline">surplus</span> for investment. They had <span class="underline">access</span> to <span class="underline">urban</span> merchants, markets, and <span class="underline">trade</span> routes.</p>
          <p>Increased agricultural production in turn facilitated <span class="underline">rural</span> <span class="underline">industry</span>, an <span class="underline">intrinsic</span> part of the <span class="underline">expansion</span> of <span class="underline">industry</span>. Woolens and <span class="underline">textile</span> manufacturers, in <span class="underline">particular</span>, utilized <span class="underline">rural</span> cottage (in-home) production, which took <span class="underline">advantage</span> of cheap and <span class="underline">plentiful</span> <span class="underline">rural</span> labor. In the German states, the ravages of the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648) further moved <span class="underline">textile</span> production into the countryside. Members of poor peasant families spun or wove cloth and linens at home for scant remuneration in an <span class="underline">attempt</span> to <span class="underline">supplement</span> <span class="underline">meager</span> family income.</p>
          <p>More extended trading networks also helped develop Europe's <span class="underline">economy</span> in this period. English and Dutch ships carrying <span class="underline">rye</span> from the Baltic states reached Spain and Portugal. <span class="underline">Population</span> growth generated an <span class="underline">expansion</span> of small-scale manufacturing, particularly of handicrafts, textiles, and metal production in England, Flanders, parts of northern Italy, the southwestern German states, and parts of Spain. Only iron <span class="underline">smelting</span> and <span class="underline">mining</span> required marshaling a <span class="underline">significant</span> <span class="underline">amount</span> of capital (wealth invested to create more wealth).</p>
          <p>The <span class="underline">development</span> of banking and other <span class="underline">financial</span> services contributed to the <span class="underline">expansion</span> of <span class="underline">trade</span>. By the middle of the sixteenth <span class="underline">century</span>, 
 financiers and traders commonly accepted bills of <span class="underline">exchange</span> in place of gold or silver for other goods. Bills of <span class="underline">exchange</span>, which had their origins in <span class="underline">medieval</span> Italy, 
 were promissory notes (written promises to <span class="underline">pay</span> a <span class="underline">specified</span> <span class="underline">amount</span> of money by a certain <span class="underline">date</span>) that could be sold to third parties. In this way, they provided <span class="underline">credit</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>At mid-century, 
 an Antwerp financier only <span class="underline">slightly</span> exaggerated when he claimed, "0ne can no more <span class="underline">trade</span> without bills of <span class="underline">exchange</span> than sail without water."  <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>Merchants no longer had to carry gold and 
 silver over long, dangerous journeys. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>An Amsterdam <span class="underline">merchant</span> purchasing soap from a <span class="underline">merchant</span> in Marseille could go to an exchanger and <span class="underline">pay</span> the exchanger the <span class="underline">equivalent</span> <span class="underline">sum</span> in guilders, 
 the Dutch <span class="underline">currency</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>The exchanger would then send a <span class="underline">bill</span> of <span class="underline">exchange</span> to a <span class="underline">colleague</span> in Marseille, authorizing the <span class="underline">colleague</span> to <span class="underline">pay</span> the Marseille <span class="underline">merchant</span> in the <span class="underline">merchant</span>'s own <span class="underline">currency</span> 
 after the actual <span class="underline">exchange</span> of goods had taken place.</p>
          <p>Bills of <span class="underline">exchange</span> contributed to the <span class="underline">development</span> of banks, as exchangers began to provide loans. Not until the eighteenth <span class="underline">century</span>, however, did such banks as the Bank of Amsterdam and the Bank of England begin to provide capital for business investment. Their <span class="underline">principal</span> <span class="underline">function</span> was to provide funds for the <span class="underline">state</span>.</p>
          <p>The rapid <span class="underline">expansion</span> in international <span class="underline">trade</span> also benefitted from an infusion of capital, stemming largely from gold and silver brought by Spanish vessels from the Americas. This capital financed the production of goods, <span class="underline">storage</span>, <span class="underline">trade</span>, and <span class="underline">even</span> <span class="underline">credit</span> <span class="underline">across</span> Europe and <span class="underline">overseas</span>. Moreover an increased <span class="underline">credit</span> <span class="underline">supply</span> was generated by investments and loans by bankers and wealthy merchants to states and by joint-stock partnerships-an English <span class="underline">innovation</span> (the first <span class="underline">major</span> <span class="underline">company</span> began in 1600). Unlike short-term <span class="underline">financial</span> <span class="underline">cooperation</span> between investors for a single <span class="underline">commercial</span> <span class="underline">undertaking</span>, joint-stock companies provided <span class="underline">permanent</span> <span class="underline">funding</span> of capital by drawing on the investments of merchants and other investors who purchased shares in the <span class="underline">company</span>.</p>
