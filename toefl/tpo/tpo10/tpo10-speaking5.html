          <p>Listen to a conversation between two students.</p>
          <p>(woman) Is there a problem with the electricity?</p>
          <p>(man) Yeah, this storm knocked out power all over the city. And they're saying it might be several hours before we have electricity again.</p>
          <p>(woman) Oh, no! I have a history paper due tomorrow and I've been writing it on my lap top computer and the battery's running low. I am going to need electricity soon. (man) Well, you know, Jefferson City still has electricity. And there's a library there where you can plug in lap top. You could go over there to work on your paper. It's only about a twenty-minute drive.</p>
          <p>(woman) That's a good idea. Of course I'd have to pack up all my stuff and it is raining outside.</p>
          <p>(man) Yeah, that's true. Well, why don't you just ask the professor for an extension? You know, tomorrow when you go to class just ask him if he would give you an extra day to get the paper done. I'm pretty sure he'd agree. You know, with the storm and all.</p>
          <p>(woman) Yeah, that should be a lot easier. But then he did tell us when he gave us the assignment that he wouldn't grant any extension. (man) You don't think he'd grant an exception in this case?</p>
          <p>(woman) I'm not sure. It's a little risky. He might just say that we shouldn't have waited until the last minute.</p>
          <p>(man) Yeah, but, maybe if other students have the same problem you might be able to convince him.</p>
          <p>(woman) Yeah, I mean, it's not our fault that the electricity went out. Hmmm...</p>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>Well, the woman's problem is that she has a history paper due tomorrow and her laptop's battery is running out but there's no electricity in her room to charge because of the storm. Accordingly, there are two solutions from the man: the first one is that she could go to a library in another city where she could get her lap top plugged in to continue her paper; second, she could ask her professor for an extension. Well, I guess the first solution is a better idea for some reasons. First of all, the library is not far away from the woman, and if she hurries, she could get the paper done and go home before the library close just in time. A library is a perfect place for study, and all she needs is to pack her computer and go driving, which surly beats staying home praying for the extension. Secondly, asking for an extension would be a bad idea. I think, after all there must be students going to the library or finding possible ways to get the paper done just on time, letting alone those who don't have electricity at home. So I think the woman should go to the library to finish her paper. (206 words)</p>
