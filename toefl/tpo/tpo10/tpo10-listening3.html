I mean I knew potatoes were from where, South America? </p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.61" data-time="50.23">[00:50.23]</span>Professor: South America. Right, the Andes Mountains. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="1.99" data-time="52.84">[00:52.84]</span>Student: But you are saying tomatoes, too? <span class="time" data-times="3.5" data-time="54.83">[00:54.83]</span>I just <span class="highlight">assume</span> since they're used in so many Italian dishes. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.89" data-time="58.33">[00:58.33]</span>Professor: No, like potatoes, Tomatoes grew wild in the Andes, although unlike potatoes, they weren't originally <span class="highlight">cultivated</span> there. <span class="time" data-times="3.24" data-time="66.22">[01:06.22]</span>That seems to have occurred first in Central America. <span class="time" data-times="6.95" data-time="69.46">[01:09.46]</span>And <span class="highlight">even</span> then, the tomato doesn't <span class="highlight">appear</span> to have been very important as a food plant until the Europeans came on the <span class="highlight">scene</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.55" data-time="76.41">[01:16.41]</span>They took it back to Europe with them around 1550. <span class="time" data-times="5.38" data-time="79.96">[01:19.96]</span>And Italy was indeed the first place where it was widely grown as a food crop. <span class="time" data-times="4.34" data-time="85.34">[01:25.34]</span>So in a <span class="highlight">sense</span>, it really is more Italian than American. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.49" data-time="89.68">[01:29.68]</span>And another thing and this is true of both potato and tomato. <span class="time" data-times="5.02" data-time="94.17">[01:34.17]</span>Both of these plants are members of the Nightshade family. <span class="time" data-times="13.06" data-time="99.19">[01:39.19]</span>The Nightshade family is a <span class="highlight">category</span> of plants which also includes many that you wouldn't want to eat, like mandrake, belladonna, and <span class="highlight">even</span> tobacco. <span class="time" data-times="6.79" data-time="112.25">[01:52.25]</span>So it's no <span class="highlight">wonder</span> that people once considered potatoes and tomatoes to be inedible too, <span class="highlight">even</span><span class="highlight">poisonous</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.04" data-time="119.04">[01:59.04]</span>And in fact, the leaves of the potato plant are quite <span class="highlight">toxic</span>. <span class="time" data-times="10.24" data-time="124.08">[02:04.08]</span>So it took both plants quite a while to catch on in Europe. And <span class="highlight">even</span> longer before they made the return <span class="highlight">trip</span> to North America and became <span class="highlight">popular</span> food items here. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="11.02" data-time="134.32">[02:14.32]</span>Student: Yeah, you know, I remember, I remember my grandmother telling me that when her mother was a little girl, a lot of people still thought that tomatoes were <span class="highlight">poisonous</span>. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.92" data-time="145.34">[02:25.34]</span>Professor: Oh, sure. People didn't really start eating them here until the mid-eighteen hundreds. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.74" data-time="150.26">[02:30.26]</span>Student: But seems like I heard... didn't Thomas Jefferson grow them or something? </p><p><span class="time" data-times="11.08" data-time="156">[02:36.00]</span>Professor: Well, that's true. But then Jefferson is known not only as the third <span class="highlight">president</span> of the United States, but also as a <span class="highlight">scholar</span> who was way ahead of his time in many ways. <span class="time" data-times="6.11" data-time="167.08">[02:47.08]</span>He didn't let the <span class="highlight">conventional</span> thinking of his day restrain his ideas. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="8.95" data-time="173.19">[02:53.19]</span>Now, potatoes went <span class="highlight">through</span> a <span class="highlight">similar</span><span class="highlight">sort</span> of ...uh... of a rejection <span class="highlight">process</span>, especially when they were first introduced in Europe. <span class="time" data-times="3.96" data-time="182.14">[03:02.14]</span>You know how potatoes can turn green if they are left in the light too long? <span class="time" data-times="4.86" data-time="186.1">[03:06.10]</span>And that greenish skin can make the potatoes tastes bitter; <span class="highlight">even</span> make you ill. <span class="time" data-times="5.35" data-time="190.96">[03:10.96]</span>So that was enough to put people off for over 200 years. Yes, <span class="highlight">Bill</span>? </p><p><span class="time" data-times="1.54" data-time="196.31">[03:16.31]</span>Student: I'm sorry, professor Jones. <span class="time" data-times="1.67" data-time="197.85">[03:17.85]</span>But I mean yeah ok. <span class="time" data-times="4.94" data-time="199.52">[03:19.52]</span>American crops have probably contributed a lot to European cooking over the years. But... </p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.22" data-time="204.46">[03:24.46]</span>Professor: But have they really played any kind of important role in European <span class="highlight">history</span>? <span class="time" data-times="3.71" data-time="209.68">[03:29.68]</span>Well, as a matter of fact, yes. I was just coming to that. <span class="time" data-times="6.33" data-time="213.39">[03:33.39]</span>Let's start with North American corn or <span class="highlight">maize</span>, as it's often called. <span class="time" data-times="8.83" data-time="219.72">[03:39.72]</span>Now before the Europeans made <span class="highlight">contact</span> with the Americas, they subsisted mainly on grains, grains that often suffered from crop failures. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="11.18" data-time="228.55">[03:48.55]</span>And it's largely for this <span class="highlight">reason</span> that <span class="highlight">political</span> power in Europe was centered for centuries in the South, around the <span class="highlight">Mediterranean</span> Sea, which was where they could grow these grains with more reliability. <span class="time" data-times="12.85" data-time="239.73">[03:59.73]</span>But when corn came to Europe from Mexico, well, now they had a much hardier crop that could be grown easily in more northerly climates and the centers of power began to <span class="highlight">shift</span> accordingly. <span class="time" data-times="5.03" data-time="252.58">[04:12.58]</span>And then, well, as I said potatoes weren't really <span class="highlight">popular</span> at first. <span class="time" data-times="5.86" data-time="257.61">[04:17.61]</span>But when they finally did catch on which they did first in Ireland around 1780. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.3" data-time="263.47">[04:23.47]</span>Well, why do you <span class="highlight">suppose</span> it happened? <span class="time" data-times="12.59" data-time="265.77">[04:25.77]</span>Because potatoes have the <span class="highlight">ability</span> to provide an <span class="highlight">abundant</span> and extremely nutritious food crop, no other crop grown in North Europe at the time had anything like the number of vitamins contained in potatoes. <span class="time" data-times="9.04" data-time="278.36">[04:38.36]</span>Plus, potatoes grown on the single <span class="highlight">acre</span> of land could feed many more people than say, wheat grown on the same land. <span class="time" data-times="4.44" data-time="287.4">[04:47.40]</span>Potatoes soon <span class="highlight">spread</span> to France and other Northern European countries. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="291.84">[04:51.84]</span>And as a result, the <span class="highlight">nutrition</span> of the general <span class="highlight">population</span> improved tremendously and <span class="highlight">population</span> soared in the early 1800s and so the <span class="highlight">shift</span> of power from southern to northern Europe continued. </p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the main purpose of the lecture?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.
