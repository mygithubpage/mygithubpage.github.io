              <span class="time" data-times="7.1" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in a <span class="underline">Psychology</span> Class. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.4" data-time="7.1">[00:07.10]</span>Professor: OK. If I ask about the earliest thing you can remember, I will <span class="underline">bet</span> for most of you, your earliest memory would be from about age 3, right? <span class="time" data-times="2.61" data-time="17.5">[00:17.50]</span>Well, that's true for most adults. <span class="time" data-times="3.66" data-time="20.11">[00:20.11]</span>We can't remember anything that happened before the age of 3. <span class="time" data-times="3.97" data-time="23.77">[00:23.77]</span>And this <span class="underline">phenomenon</span> is so <span class="underline">widespread</span> and well-documented. <span class="time" data-times="1.05" data-time="27.74">[00:27.74]</span>It has a name. <span class="time" data-times="6.44" data-time="28.79">[00:28.79]</span>It's called childhood <span class="underline">amnesia</span> and was first documented in 1893. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.39" data-time="35.23">[00:35.23]</span>As I said, this <span class="underline">phenomenon</span> refers to adults not being able to remember childhood incidents. <span class="time" data-times="6.01" data-time="44.62">[00:44.62]</span>It's not children trying to remember events from last month or last year. <span class="time" data-times="7.9" data-time="50.63">[00:50.63]</span>Of <span class="underline">course</span> it follows that if you can't remember an <span class="underline">incident</span> as a child, you probably won't remember it as an adult. <span class="time" data-times="3.38" data-time="58.53">[00:58.53]</span>OK. So ... why is this? <span class="time" data-times="3.4" data-time="61.91">[01:01.91]</span>What are the reasons for childhood <span class="underline">amnesia</span>? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="11.26" data-time="65.31">[01:05.31]</span>Well, once a <span class="underline">popular</span> explanation was that childhood memories are repressed... uh, the memories are disturbing so that as adults we keep them buried. <span class="time" data-times="10.76" data-time="76.57">[01:16.57]</span>And so we can't <span class="underline">recall</span> them and this is based on...well it's not based on, on, on... the kind of <span class="underline">solid</span> research and lab testing I want to talk about today. <span class="time" data-times="7.83" data-time="87.33">[01:27.33]</span>So let's put that explanation aside and <span class="underline">concentrate</span> on just two. OK? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.97" data-time="95.16">[01:35.16]</span>It could be that as children we do form memories of things <span class="underline">prior</span> to age of 3, but forget them as we grow older. <span class="time" data-times="2.35" data-time="103.13">[01:43.13]</span>That's one explanation. <span class="time" data-times="8" data-time="105.48">[01:45.48]</span>Another possibility is that children younger than 3 <span class="underline">lack</span> some <span class="underline">cognitive</span> <span class="underline">capacity</span> for memory. <span class="time" data-times="10.34" data-time="113.48">[01:53.48]</span>And that idea, that children are unable to form memories, that's been the <span class="underline">dominant</span> belief in <span class="underline">psychology</span> for the past 100 years. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.59" data-time="123.82">[02:03.82]</span>And this idea is very much tied two things, the theories of Jean Piaget and also to language <span class="underline">development</span> in children. <span class="time" data-times="16.68" data-time="134.41">[02:14.41]</span>So Piaget's <span class="underline">theory</span> of <span class="underline">cognitive</span> <span class="underline">development</span> – Piaget suggested that because they don't have language, children younger than 18-24 months leave in the here and now. <span class="time" data-times="8.08" data-time="151.09">[02:31.09]</span>That is, they <span class="underline">lack</span> the means to symbolically <span class="underline">represent</span> objects, and events that are not physically present. <span class="time" data-times="1.2" data-time="159.17">[02:39.17]</span>Everybody get that? <span class="time" data-times="9.66" data-time="160.37">[02:40.37]</span>Piaget proposed that young children don't have a way to <span class="underline">represent</span> things that aren't right in front of them. <span class="time" data-times="2.82" data-time="170.03">[02:50.03]</span>That's what language does, right? <span class="time" data-times="3.5" data-time="172.85">[02:52.85]</span>Words <span class="underline">represent</span> things, ideas. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="14.95" data-time="176.35">[02:56.35]</span>Once language starts to develop from about age 2, they do have a system for <span class="underline">symbolic</span> representation and can talk about things which are not in their <span class="underline">immediate</span> environment including the past. <span class="time" data-times="9.45" data-time="191.3">[03:11.30]</span>Of <span class="underline">course</span> he didn't <span class="underline">claim</span> that infants don't have any <span class="underline">sort</span> of memory, it is acknowledged that they can <span class="underline">recognize</span> some stimuli, like faces. <span class="time" data-times="10.93" data-time="200.75">[03:20.75]</span>And for many years this model was very much in <span class="underline">favor</span> in <span class="underline">psychology</span>, <span class="underline">even</span> though memory tests were never performed on young children. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.04" data-time="211.68">[03:31.68]</span>Well, finally in the 1980s, a study was done. <span class="time" data-times="7.68" data-time="219.72">[03:39.72]</span>And this study showed that very young children under the age of 2 do have the <span class="underline">capacity</span> for <span class="underline">recall</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.72" data-time="227.4">[03:47.40]</span>Now if the children can't talk, how was <span class="underline">recall</span> tested? <span class="time" data-times="7.42" data-time="232.12">[03:52.12]</span>Well, that is a good question, since the <span class="underline">capacity</span> for <span class="underline">recall</span> has always been linked with the <span class="underline">ability</span> to talk. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.38" data-time="239.54">[03:59.54]</span>So the researcher set up an experiment using imitation-based tasks. <span class="time" data-times="7.21" data-time="245.92">[04:05.92]</span>Adults used props, uh, toys or other objects to <span class="underline">demonstrate</span> an <span class="underline">action</span> that had 2 steps. <span class="time" data-times="23.77" data-time="253.13">[04:13.13]</span>The children were asked to <span class="underline">imitate</span> the steps immediately and then again after delays of one or more months, and <span class="underline">even</span> after a <span class="underline">delay</span>, the children could...could <span class="underline">recall</span> or <span class="underline">replicate</span> the <span class="underline">action</span>, the objects used, the steps involved and the order of the steps, <span class="underline">even</span> children as young as 9 months! </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="14.68" data-time="276.9">[04:36.90]</span>Now, tests showed that there was a faster <span class="underline">rate</span> of forgetting among the youngest children, but most importantly, it showed that the <span class="underline">development</span> of <span class="underline">recall</span> did not <span class="underline">depend</span> on language <span class="underline">development</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.5" data-time="291.58">[04:51.58]</span>And that was an importance finding. <span class="time" data-times="9.27" data-time="295.08">[04:55.08]</span>I guess I should add that the findings: Don't say that there was no connection between the <span class="underline">development</span> of language and memory. <span class="time" data-times="7.74" data-time="304.35">[05:04.35]</span>There are some <span class="underline">evidence</span> that being able to talk about an event does <span class="underline">lead</span> to having a stronger memory of that event. <span class="time" data-times="3.13" data-time="312.09">[05:12.09]</span>But that does not <span class="underline">seem</span> the real <span class="underline">issue</span> here. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.81" data-time="315.22">[05:15.22]</span>So, back to our question about the cause of childhood <span class="underline">amnesia</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.85" data-time="320.03">[05:20.03]</span>Well, there is something called the <span class="underline">rate</span> of forgetting. <span class="time" data-times="12.69" data-time="325.88">[05:25.88]</span>And childhood <span class="underline">amnesia</span> may <span class="underline">reflect</span> a high <span class="underline">rate</span> of forgetting; in other words, children under the age of 3 do form memories and do so without language. <span class="time" data-times="6.06" data-time="338.57">[05:38.57]</span>But they forget the memories at a fast <span class="underline">rate</span>, probably faster than adults do. <span class="time" data-times="11.5" data-time="344.63">[05:44.63]</span>Researchers have set a <span class="underline">standard</span>....<span class="underline">sort</span> of an expected <span class="underline">rate</span> of forgetting, but that expected <span class="underline">rate</span> was set based on tests done on the adults. <span class="time" data-times="4.33" data-time="356.13">[05:56.13]</span>So what is the <span class="underline">rate</span> of forgetting for children under the age of 3? <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="360.46">[06:00.46]</span>We <span class="underline">expect</span> it to be high, but the tests to prove this really <span class="underline">haven</span>'t been done yet. </p>
