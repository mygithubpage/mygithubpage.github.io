If I ask about the earliest thing you can remember, I will <span class="highlight">bet</span> for most of you, your earliest memory would be from about age 3, right? <span class="time" data-times="2.61" data-time="17.5">[00:17.50]</span>Well, that's true for most adults. <span class="time" data-times="3.66" data-time="20.11">[00:20.11]</span>We can't remember anything that happened before the age of 3. <span class="time" data-times="3.97" data-time="23.77">[00:23.77]</span>And this <span class="highlight">phenomenon</span> is so <span class="highlight">widespread</span> and well-documented. <span class="time" data-times="1.05" data-time="27.74">[00:27.74]</span>It has a name. <span class="time" data-times="6.44" data-time="28.79">[00:28.79]</span>It's called childhood <span class="highlight">amnesia</span> and was first documented in 1893. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="9.39" data-time="35.23">[00:35.23]</span>As I said, this <span class="highlight">phenomenon</span> refers to adults not being able to remember childhood incidents. <span class="time" data-times="6.01" data-time="44.62">[00:44.62]</span>It's not children trying to remember events from last month or last year. <span class="time" data-times="7.9" data-time="50.63">[00:50.63]</span>Of <span class="highlight">course</span> it follows that if you can't remember an <span class="highlight">incident</span> as a child, you probably won't remember it as an adult. <span class="time" data-times="3.38" data-time="58.53">[00:58.53]</span>OK. So ... why is this? <span class="time" data-times="3.4" data-time="61.91">[01:01.91]</span>What are the reasons for childhood <span class="highlight">amnesia</span>? </p><p><span class="time" data-times="11.26" data-time="65.31">[01:05.31]</span>Well, once a <span class="highlight">popular</span> explanation was that childhood memories are repressed... uh, the memories are disturbing so that as adults we keep them buried. <span class="time" data-times="10.76" data-time="76.57">[01:16.57]</span>And so we can't <span class="highlight">recall</span> them and this is based on...well it's not based on, on, on... the kind of <span class="highlight">solid</span> research and lab testing I want to talk about today. <span class="time" data-times="7.83" data-time="87.33">[01:27.33]</span>So let's put that explanation aside and <span class="highlight">concentrate</span> on just two. OK? </p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.97" data-time="95.16">[01:35.16]</span>It could be that as children we do form memories of things <span class="highlight">prior</span> to age of 3, but forget them as we grow older. <span class="time" data-times="2.35" data-time="103.13">[01:43.13]</span>That's one explanation. <span class="time" data-times="8" data-time="105.48">[01:45.48]</span>Another possibility is that children younger than 3 <span class="highlight">lack</span> some <span class="highlight">cognitive</span><span class="highlight">capacity</span> for memory. <span class="time" data-times="10.34" data-time="113.48">[01:53.48]</span>And that idea, that children are unable to form memories, that's been the <span class="highlight">dominant</span> belief in <span class="highlight">psychology</span> for the past 100 years. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="10.59" data-time="123.82">[02:03.82]</span>And this idea is very much tied two things, the theories of Jean Piaget and also to language <span class="highlight">development</span> in children. <span class="time" data-times="16.68" data-time="134.41">[02:14.41]</span>So Piaget's <span class="highlight">theory</span> of <span class="highlight">cognitive</span><span class="highlight">development</span> – Piaget suggested that because they don't have language, children younger than 18-24 months leave in the here and now. <span class="time" data-times="8.08" data-time="151.09">[02:31.09]</span>That is, they <span class="highlight">lack</span> the means to symbolically <span class="highlight">represent</span> objects, and events that are not physically present. <span class="time" data-times="1.2" data-time="159.17">[02:39.17]</span>Everybody get that? <span class="time" data-times="9.66" data-time="160.37">[02:40.37]</span>Piaget proposed that young children don't have a way to <span class="highlight">represent</span> things that aren't right in front of them. <span class="time" data-times="2.82" data-time="170.03">[02:50.03]</span>That's what language does, right?

<span class="time" data-times="7.42" data-time="232.12">[03:52.12]</span>Well, that is a good question, since the <span class="highlight">capacity</span> for <span class="highlight">recall</span> has always been linked with the <span class="highlight">ability</span> to talk. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.38" data-time="239.54">[03:59.54]</span>So the researcher set up an experiment using imitation-based tasks. <span class="time" data-times="7.21" data-time="245.92">[04:05.92]</span>Adults used props, uh, toys or other objects to <span class="highlight">demonstrate</span> an <span class="highlight">action</span> that had 2 steps. <span class="time" data-times="23.77" data-time="253.13">[04:13.13]</span>The children were asked to <span class="highlight">imitate</span> the steps immediately and then again after delays of one or more months, and <span class="highlight">even</span> after a <span class="highlight">delay</span>, the children could...could <span class="highlight">recall</span> or <span class="highlight">replicate</span> the <span class="highlight">action</span>, the objects used, the steps involved and the order of the steps, <span class="highlight">even</span> children as young as 9 months! </p><p><span class="time" data-times="14.68" data-time="276.9">[04:36.90]</span>Now, tests showed that there was a faster <span class="highlight">rate</span> of forgetting among the youngest children, but most importantly, it showed that the <span class="highlight">development</span> of <span class="highlight">recall</span> did not <span class="highlight">depend</span> on language <span class="highlight">development</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.5" data-time="291.58">[04:51.58]</span>And that was an importance finding. <span class="time" data-times="9.27" data-time="295.08">[04:55.08]</span>I guess I should add that the findings: Don't say that there was no connection between the <span class="highlight">development</span> of language and memory. <span class="time" data-times="7.74" data-time="304.35">[05:04.35]</span>There are some <span class="highlight">evidence</span> that being able to talk about an event does <span class="highlight">lead</span> to having a stronger memory of that event. <span class="time" data-times="3.13" data-time="312.09">[05:12.09]</span>But that does not <span class="highlight">seem</span> the real <span class="highlight">issue</span> here. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.81" data-time="315.22">[05:15.22]</span>So, back to our question about the cause of childhood <span class="highlight">amnesia</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.85" data-time="320.03">[05:20.03]</span>Well, there is something called the <span class="highlight">rate</span> of forgetting. <span class="time" data-times="12.69" data-time="325.88">[05:25.88]</span>And childhood <span class="highlight">amnesia</span> may <span class="highlight">reflect</span> a high <span class="highlight">rate</span> of forgetting; in other words, children under the age of 3 do form memories and do so without language. <span class="time" data-times="6.06" data-time="338.57">[05:38.57]</span>But they forget the memories at a fast <span class="highlight">rate</span>, probably faster than adults do. <span class="time" data-times="11.5" data-time="344.63">[05:44.63]</span>Researchers have set a <span class="highlight">standard</span>....<span class="highlight">sort</span> of an expected <span class="highlight">rate</span> of forgetting, but that expected <span class="highlight">rate</span> was set based on tests done on the adults. <span class="time" data-times="4.33" data-time="356.13">[05:56.13]</span>So what is the <span class="highlight">rate</span> of forgetting for children under the age of 3?

Now that (1) the option is correct; children we do form memories of things prior to age of 3, but forget as we get grew older, let's one explanation, the child can remember as adults, but will quickly forget that (4) The option is correct; Another possibility is that children younger than 3 lack some cognitive capacity for memory, the child lacks knowledge of memory, ie (3) the option is correct. (2), (5) The options are not mentioned in the hearing materials.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>How was recall tested in children without language ability?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

The formation of memories is dependent upon language development</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The professor mentioned that the result of the study done in the 1980s was study show that very young children under age of 2 do have capacity for recall, while Piaget thinks that because children cannot speak, there is no way to create memories. So the results of the research prove that Piaget's theory is wrong, so the answer is B.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
