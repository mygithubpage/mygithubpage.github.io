          <p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.5" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in a <span class="underline">Marine</span> <span class="underline">Biology</span> Class.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.04" data-time="10.5">[00:10.50]</span>Professor: We know whales are mammals and that they evolved from land creatures. <span class="time" data-times="4.91" data-time="15.54">[00:15.54]</span>So the mystery is figuring out how they became ocean dwellers. <span class="time" data-times="11.92" data-time="20.45">[00:20.45]</span>Because until recently there was no <span class="underline">fossil</span> <span class="underline">record</span> of what we call "the missing link" – that is <span class="underline">evidence</span> of <span class="underline">species</span> that show the <span class="underline">transition</span> between land-dwelling mammals and today's whales. <span class="time" data-times="5.79" data-time="32.37">[00:32.37]</span>Fortunately, some recent <span class="underline">fossil</span> discoveries have made the picture a little bit clearer.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.54" data-time="38.16">[00:38.16]</span>For example, a few years back in Pakistan, they found the <span class="underline">skull</span> of a wolf-like creature. <span class="time" data-times="2.24" data-time="44.7">[00:44.70]</span>It was about 50 million years old. <span class="time" data-times="5.55" data-time="46.94">[00:46.94]</span>Scientists had seen this wolf-like creature before, but this <span class="underline">skull</span> was different. <span class="time" data-times="7.51" data-time="52.49">[00:52.49]</span>The ear area of the <span class="underline">skull</span> had characteristics seen only in <span class="underline">aquatic</span> mammals, <span class="underline">specifically</span> whales.<span class="time" data-times="10.14" data-time="60">[01:00.00]</span>Uh, well, then also in Pakistan, they found a <span class="underline">fossil</span> of another creature, which we call Ambulocetus Natans.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.92" data-time="70.14">[01:10.14]</span>That's a mouthful, eh? <span class="time" data-times="8.42" data-time="73.06">[01:13.06]</span>The name Ambulocetus natans comes from <span class="underline">Latin</span> of <span class="underline">course</span>, and means "walking whale that swims". <span class="time" data-times="4.36" data-time="81.48">[01:21.48]</span>It clearly had four limbs that could have been used for walking. <span class="time" data-times="7.08" data-time="85.84">[01:25.84]</span>It also had a long thin tail, <span class="underline">typical</span> of mammals, something we don't see in today's whales. <span class="time" data-times="3.9" data-time="92.92">[01:32.92]</span>But, it also had a long <span class="underline">skeletal</span> structure. <span class="time" data-times="4.87" data-time="96.82">[01:36.82]</span>And that long <span class="underline">skeletal</span> structure suggests that it was <span class="underline">aquatic</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.99" data-time="101.69">[01:41.69]</span>And very recently in Egypt, they found a <span class="underline">skeleton</span> of Basilosaurus. <span class="time" data-times="5.61" data-time="108.68">[01:48.68]</span>Basilosaurus was a creature that we had already known about for over a hundred years. <span class="time" data-times="4.65" data-time="114.29">[01:54.29]</span>And it has been linked to modern whales because of its long whale-like body. <span class="time" data-times="6.68" data-time="118.94">[01:58.94]</span>But this new <span class="underline">fossil</span> find showed a full set of leg bones, something we didn't have before.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.3" data-time="125.62">[02:05.62]</span>The legs were too small to be useful. <span class="time" data-times="4.29" data-time="127.92">[02:07.92]</span>They weren't <span class="underline">even</span> connected to its <span class="underline">pelvis</span> and couldn't have supported its weight. <span class="time" data-times="4.31" data-time="132.21">[02:12.21]</span>But it clearly shows Basilosaurus's <span class="underline">evolution</span> from land creatures. <span class="time" data-times="2.71" data-time="136.52">[02:16.52]</span>So that's a <span class="underline">giant</span> step in the right direction. <span class="time" data-times="7.58" data-time="139.23">[02:19.23]</span> <span class="underline">Even</span> better, it establishes Ambulocetus as a <span class="underline">clear</span> link between the wolf-like creature and Basilosaurus.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.93" data-time="146.81">[02:26.81]</span>Now these discoveries don't completely solve the mystery. <span class="time" data-times="6.46" data-time="150.74">[02:30.74]</span>I mean, Ambulocetus is a <span class="underline">mammal</span> that shows a <span class="underline">sort</span> of bridge between walking on land and swimming. <span class="time" data-times="3.9" data-time="157.2">[02:37.20]</span>But it also is very different from the whales who know today. <span class="time" data-times="5.91" data-time="161.1">[02:41.10]</span>So really we are working with just a few pieces of a big <span class="underline">puzzle</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.37" data-time="167.01">[02:47.01]</span>Um...a related <span class="underline">debate</span> involved some recent DNA studies. <span class="time" data-times="3.44" data-time="173.38">[02:53.38]</span>Remember, DNA is the <span class="underline">genetic</span> <span class="underline">code</span> for any <span class="underline">organism</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.53" data-time="176.82">[02:56.82]</span>And when the DNA from two different <span class="underline">species</span> is <span class="underline">similar</span>, it suggests that those two <span class="underline">species</span> are related. <span class="time" data-times="7.53" data-time="183.35">[03:03.35]</span>And when we compared some whale DNA with DNA from some other <span class="underline">species</span>, we got quite a surprise. <span class="time" data-times="4.96" data-time="190.88">[03:10.88]</span>The DNA suggests that whales are descendants of the <span class="underline">hippopotamus</span>. <span class="time" data-times="1.72" data-time="195.84">[03:15.84]</span>Yes, the <span class="underline">hippopotamus</span>!</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.68" data-time="197.56">[03:17.56]</span>Well, it came as a bit of a shock. <span class="time" data-times="9.45" data-time="199.24">[03:19.24]</span>I mean, that a four-legged land and river <span class="underline">dweller</span> could be the <span class="underline">evolutionary</span> <span class="underline">source</span> of a completely <span class="underline">aquatic</span> creature up to 25 times its size? <span class="time" data-times="13.12" data-time="208.69">[03:28.69]</span> <span class="underline">Unfortunately</span>, this revelation about the <span class="underline">hippopotamus</span> apparently contradicts the <span class="underline">fossil</span> <span class="underline">record</span>, which suggests that the <span class="underline">hippopotamus</span> is only a very <span class="underline">distant</span> <span class="underline">relative</span> of the whale, not an <span class="underline">ancestor</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.96" data-time="221.81">[03:41.81]</span>And of <span class="underline">course</span> as I mentioned, that whales are descended not from hippos but from that <span class="underline">distant</span> wolf-like creature.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.86" data-time="228.77">[03:48.77]</span>So we have <span class="underline">contradictory</span> <span class="underline">evidence</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.07" data-time="231.63">[03:51.63]</span>And more research might just <span class="underline">raise</span> more questions and create more controversies. <span class="time" data-times="2.02" data-time="236.7">[03:56.70]</span>At any <span class="underline">rate</span>, we have a choice. <span class="time" data-times="9.77" data-time="238.72">[03:58.72]</span>We can believe the molecular <span class="underline">data</span>, the DNA, or we can believe the <span class="underline">skeleton</span> <span class="underline">trail</span>, but <span class="underline">unfortunately</span>, probably not both.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.39" data-time="248.49">[04:08.49]</span>Um... and there have been some other interesting findings from DNA research. <span class="time" data-times="8.57" data-time="254.88">[04:14.88]</span>For a long time, we assumed that all whales that had teeth including <span class="underline">sperm</span> whales and killer whales were closely related to one another. <span class="time" data-times="7.68" data-time="263.45">[04:23.45]</span>And the same for the toothless whales, like the blue whale and other baleen whales, we assumed that they be closely related.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.86" data-time="271.13">[04:31.13]</span>But recent DNA studies suggest that that's not the case at all. <span class="time" data-times="7.58" data-time="274.99">[04:34.99]</span>The <span class="underline">sperm</span> whale is actually closely related to the baleen whale, and it's only distantly related to the toothed-whales. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="282.57">[04:42.57]</span>So that was a real surprise to all of us.</p>
