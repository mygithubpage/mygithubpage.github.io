I got 8.5 in Listening section which is almost the full mark,9. Originally, I didn't think I could get above 7 because I couldn't really follow the speakers' speed and my vocabulary wasn't big. So I wasn't confident. But I knew that my weak point was in listening section, so I listened to the IELTS recordings whenever I had time. When I was walking along the street, I listened to the recordings. When I was relaxing, I listened to the recordings. When I was taking a nap, I listened to the recordings. Besides, I bought a book to enlarge my vocabulary. I think it were these efforts I paid that helped me get 8.5.</p></article></div></main></body></html>
