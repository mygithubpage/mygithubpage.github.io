            <b>The Mystery of Yawning</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>
            <span class="light">According to <span class="underline">conventional</span> <span class="underline">theory</span>, yawning takes place when people are bored or sleepy and serves the <span class="underline">function</span> of increasing alertness by reversing, <span class="underline">through</span> deeper <span class="underline">breathing</span>, the <span class="underline">drop</span> in blood <span class="underline">oxygen</span> levels that are caused by the <span class="underline">shallow</span> <span class="underline">breathing</span> that accompanies <span class="underline">lack</span> of sleep or boredom</span>
            <span class="underline">Unfortunately</span>, the few <span class="underline">scientific</span> investigations of yawning have failed to find any connection between how often someone yawns and how much sleep they have had or how tired they are. About the closest any research has come to supporting the tiredness <span class="underline">theory</span> is to <span class="underline">confirm</span> that adults yawn more often on weekdays than at weekends, and that school children yawn more frequently in their first year at <span class="underline">primary</span> school than they do in kindergarten.</p>
          <p>Another <span class="underline">flaw</span> of the tiredness <span class="underline">theory</span> is that yawning does not <span class="underline">raise</span> alertness or <span class="underline">physiological</span> <span class="underline">activity</span>, as the <span class="underline">theory</span> would <span class="underline">predict</span>. When researchers measured the heart <span class="underline">rate</span>, <span class="underline">muscle</span> <span class="underline">tension</span> and skin <span class="underline">conductance</span> of people before, during and after yawning, they did <span class="underline">detect</span> some changes in skin <span class="underline">conductance</span> following yawning, indicating a <span class="underline">slight</span> increase in <span class="underline">physiological</span> <span class="underline">activity</span>. However, <span class="underline">similar</span> changes occurred when the subjects were asked <span class="underline">simply</span> to open their mouths or to breathe deeply. Yawning did nothing <span class="underline">special</span> to their <span class="underline">state</span> of <span class="underline">physiological</span> <span class="underline">activity</span>. Experiments have also <span class="underline">cast</span> serious <span class="underline">doubt</span> on the belief that yawning is triggered by a <span class="underline">drop</span> in blood <span class="underline">oxygen</span> or a rise in blood <span class="underline">carbon</span> <span class="underline">dioxide</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> Volunteers were told to think about yawning while they breathed either normal <span class="underline">air</span>, <span class="underline">pure</span> <span class="underline">oxygen</span>, or an <span class="underline">air</span> mixture with an above-normal <span class="underline">level</span> of <span class="underline">carbon</span> <span class="underline">dioxide</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>If the <span class="underline">theory</span> was correct, <span class="underline">breathing</span> <span class="underline">air</span> with <span class="underline">extra</span> <span class="underline">carbon</span> <span class="underline">dioxide</span> should have triggered yawning, while <span class="underline">breathing</span> <span class="underline">pure</span> <span class="underline">oxygen</span> should have suppressed yawning. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>In fact, neither condition made any <span class="underline">difference</span> to the <span class="underline">frequency</span> of yawning, which remained <span class="underline">constant</span> at about 24 yawns per hour. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>Another experiment demonstrated that <span class="underline">physical</span> <span class="underline">exercise</span>, which was <span class="underline">sufficiently</span> <span class="underline">vigorous</span> to double the <span class="underline">rate</span> of <span class="underline">breathing</span>, had no effect on the <span class="underline">frequency</span> of yawning. Again the <span class="underline">implication</span> is that yawning has little or nothing to do with <span class="underline">oxygen</span>.</p>
          <p>A completely different <span class="underline">theory</span> holds that yawning assists in the <span class="underline">physical</span> <span class="underline">development</span> of the lungs early in life, but has no <span class="underline">remaining</span> biological <span class="underline">function</span> in adults. It has been suggested that yawning and hiccupping might serve to <span class="underline">clear</span> out the fetuses airways. The lungs of a <span class="underline">fetus</span> <span class="underline">secrete</span> a <span class="underline">liquid</span> that mixes with its mother's amniotic <span class="underline">fluid</span>. Babies with <span class="underline">congenital</span> blockages that prevent this <span class="underline">fluid</span> from escaping from their lungs are sometimes born with deformed lungs. It might be that yawning helps to <span class="underline">clear</span> out the lungs by <span class="underline">periodically</span> lowering the <span class="underline">pressure</span> in them. According to this <span class="underline">theory</span>, yawning in adults is just a developmental <span class="underline">fossil</span> with no biological <span class="underline">function</span>. But, while accepting that not everything in life can be explained by Darwinian <span class="underline">evolution</span>, there are <span class="underline">sound</span> reasons for being <span class="underline">skeptical</span> of theories like this one, which <span class="underline">avoid</span> the <span class="underline">issue</span> of what yawning does for adults. Yawning is distracting, consumes energy and takes time. It is almost certainly doing something <span class="underline">significant</span> in adults as well as in fetuses. What could it be?</p>
          <p>The <span class="underline">empirical</span> <span class="underline">evidence</span>, such as it is, suggests an <span class="underline">altogether</span> different <span class="underline">function</span> for yawning-namely, that yawning prepares us for a change in <span class="underline">activity</span> <span class="underline">level</span>. Support for this <span class="underline">theory</span> came from a study of yawning <span class="underline">behavior</span> in everyday life. Volunteers wore wrist-mounted devices that automatically recorded their <span class="underline">physical</span> <span class="underline">activity</span> for up to two weeks: the volunteers also recorded their yawns by pressing a button on the <span class="underline">device</span> each time they yawned. The <span class="underline">data</span> showed that yawning tended to <span class="underline">occur</span> about 15 minutes before a period of increased <span class="underline">behavioral</span> <span class="underline">activity</span>. Yawning bore no relationship to sleep patterns, however. This accords with <span class="underline">anecdotal</span> <span class="underline">evidence</span> that people often yawn in situations where they are neither tired nor bored, but are preparing for <span class="underline">impending</span> <span class="underline">mental</span> and <span class="underline">physical</span> <span class="underline">activity</span>. Such yawning is often referred to as "incongruous" because it seems out of place, at <span class="underline">least</span> on the tiredness view: soldiers yawning before <span class="underline">combat</span>, musicians yawning before performing, and athletes yawning before <span class="underline">competing</span>. Their yawning seems to have nothing to do with sleepiness or boredom-quite the <span class="underline">reverse</span>-but it does <span class="underline">precede</span> a change in <span class="underline">activity</span> <span class="underline">level</span>.</p>
