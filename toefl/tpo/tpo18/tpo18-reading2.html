About the closest any research has come to supporting the tiredness <span class="highlight">theory</span> is to <span class="highlight">confirm</span> that adults yawn more often on weekdays than at weekends, and that school children yawn more frequently in their first year at <span class="highlight">primary</span> school than they do in kindergarten.</p><p>Another <span class="highlight"><span class="question3">flaw</span></span>of the tiredness <span class="highlight">theory</span> is that yawning does not <span class="highlight">raise</span> alertness or <span class="highlight">physiological</span><span class="highlight">activity</span>, as the <span class="highlight">theory</span> would <span class="highlight">predict</span>. When researchers measured the heart <span class="highlight">rate</span>, <span class="highlight">muscle</span><span class="highlight">tension</span> and skin <span class="highlight">conductance</span> of people before, during and after yawning, they did <span class="highlight">detect</span> some changes in skin <span class="highlight">conductance</span> following yawning, indicating a <span class="highlight">slight</span> increase in <span class="highlight">physiological</span><span class="highlight">activity</span>. However, <span class="highlight">similar</span> changes occurred when the subjects were asked <span class="highlight">simply</span> to open their mouths or to breathe deeply. Yawning did nothing <span class="highlight">special</span> to their <span class="highlight">state</span> of <span class="highlight">physiological</span><span class="highlight">activity</span>. Experiments have also <span class="highlight">cast</span> serious <span class="highlight">doubt</span> on the belief that yawning is triggered by a <span class="highlight">drop</span> in blood <span class="highlight">oxygen</span> or a rise in blood <span class="highlight">carbon</span><span class="highlight">dioxide</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> Volunteers were told to think about yawning while they breathed either normal <span class="highlight">air</span>, <span class="highlight">pure</span><span class="highlight">oxygen</span>, or an <span class="highlight">air</span> mixture with an above-normal <span class="highlight">level</span> of <span class="highlight">carbon</span><span class="highlight">dioxide</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>If the <span class="highlight">theory</span> was correct, <span class="highlight">breathing</span><span class="highlight">air</span> with <span class="highlight">extra</span><span class="highlight">carbon</span><span class="highlight">dioxide</span> should have <span class="question5">triggered</span> yawning, while <span class="highlight">breathing</span><span class="highlight">pure</span><span class="highlight">oxygen</span> should have suppressed yawning. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>In fact, neither condition made any <span class="highlight">difference</span> to the <span class="highlight">frequency</span> of yawning, which remained <span class="highlight">constant</span> at about 24 yawns per hour. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>Another experiment demonstrated that <span class="highlight">physical</span><span class="highlight">exercise</span>, which was <span class="highlight">sufficiently</span><span class="highlight">vigorous</span> to double the <span class="highlight">rate</span> of <span class="highlight">breathing</span>, had no effect on the <span class="highlight">frequency</span> of yawning. Again the <span class="highlight">implication</span> is that yawning has little or nothing to do with <span class="highlight">oxygen</span>.</p><p>A completely different <span class="highlight">theory</span> holds that yawning assists in the <span class="highlight">physical</span><span class="highlight">development</span> of the lungs early in life, but has no <span class="highlight">remaining</span> biological <span class="highlight">function</span> in adults. It has been suggested that yawning and hiccupping might serve to <span class="highlight">clear</span> out the fetuses airways. The lungs of a <span class="highlight">fetus</span><span class="highlight">secrete</span> a <span class="highlight">liquid</span> that mixes with its mother's amniotic <span class="highlight">fluid</span>. Babies with <span class="highlight">congenital</span> blockages that prevent this <span class="highlight">fluid</span> from escaping from their lungs are sometimes born with deformed lungs. It might be that yawning helps to <span class="highlight">clear</span> out the lungs by <span class="highlight"><span class="question7">periodically</span></span>lowering the <span class="highlight">pressure</span> in them. According to this <span class="highlight">theory</span>, yawning in adults is just a developmental <span class="highlight">fossil</span> with no biological <span class="highlight">function</span>. But, while accepting that not everything in life can be explained by Darwinian <span class="highlight">evolution</span>, there are <span class="highlight">sound</span> reasons for being <span class="highlight">skeptical</span> of theories like this one, which <span class="highlight">avoid</span> the <span class="highlight">issue</span> of what yawning does for adults. Yawning is distracting, consumes energy and takes time. It is almost certainly doing something <span class="highlight">significant</span> in adults as well as in fetuses. What could it be?</p><p>The <span class="highlight"><span class="question10">empirical</span><span class="highlight"></span>evidence</span>, such as it is, suggests an <span class="highlight">altogether</span> different <span class="highlight">function</span> for yawning-namely, that yawning prepares us for a change in <span class="highlight">activity</span><span class="highlight">level</span>. Support for this <span class="highlight">theory</span> came from a study of yawning <span class="highlight">behavior</span> in everyday life. Volunteers wore wrist-mounted devices that automatically recorded their <span class="highlight">physical</span><span class="highlight">activity</span> for up to two weeks: the volunteers also recorded their yawns by pressing a button on the <span class="highlight">device</span> each time they yawned. The <span class="highlight">data</span> showed that yawning tended to <span class="highlight">occur</span> about 15 minutes before a period of increased <span class="highlight">behavioral</span><span class="highlight">activity</span>. Yawning bore no relationship to sleep patterns, however. This accords with <span class="highlight">anecdotal</span><span class="highlight">evidence</span> that people often yawn in situations where they are neither tired nor bored, but are preparing for <span class="highlight">impending</span><span class="highlight">mental</span> and <span class="highlight">physical</span><span class="highlight">activity</span>. Such yawning is often referred to as "incongruous" because it seems out of place, at <span class="highlight">least</span> on the tiredness view: <span class="question12">soldiers yawning before <span class="highlight">combat</span>, musicians yawning before performing, and athletes yawning before <span class="highlight">competing</span>. </span>Their yawning seems to have nothing to do with sleepiness or boredom-quite the <span class="highlight">reverse</span>-but it does <span class="highlight">precede</span> a change in <span class="highlight">activity</span><span class="highlight">level</span>.</p></article></div><div id="question"><div id="question1"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage?
