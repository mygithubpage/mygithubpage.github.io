About the closest any research has come to supporting the tiredness <span class="highlight">theory</span> is to <span class="highlight">confirm</span> that adults yawn more often on weekdays than at weekends, and that school children yawn more frequently in their first year at <span class="highlight">primary</span> school than they do in kindergarten.</p><p>Another <span class="highlight"><span class="question3">flaw</span></span> of the tiredness <span class="highlight">theory</span> is that yawning does not <span class="highlight">raise</span> alertness or <span class="highlight">physiological</span><span class="highlight">activity</span>, as the <span class="highlight">theory</span> would <span class="highlight">predict</span>. When researchers measured the heart <span class="highlight">rate</span>, <span class="highlight">muscle</span><span class="highlight">tension</span> and skin <span class="highlight">conductance</span> of people before, during and after yawning, they did <span class="highlight">detect</span> some changes in skin <span class="highlight">conductance</span> following yawning, indicating a <span class="highlight">slight</span> increase in <span class="highlight">physiological</span><span class="highlight">activity</span>. However, <span class="highlight">similar</span> changes occurred when the subjects were asked <span class="highlight">simply</span> to open their mouths or to breathe deeply. Yawning did nothing <span class="highlight">special</span> to their <span class="highlight">state</span> of <span class="highlight">physiological</span><span class="highlight">activity</span>. Experiments have also <span class="highlight">cast</span> serious <span class="highlight">doubt</span> on the belief that yawning is triggered by a <span class="highlight">drop</span> in blood <span class="highlight">oxygen</span> or a rise in blood <span class="highlight">carbon</span><span class="highlight">dioxide</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> Volunteers were told to think about yawning while they breathed either normal <span class="highlight">air</span>, <span class="highlight">pure</span><span class="highlight">oxygen</span>, or an <span class="highlight">air</span> mixture with an above-normal <span class="highlight">level</span> of <span class="highlight">carbon</span><span class="highlight">dioxide</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>If the <span class="highlight">theory</span> was correct, <span class="highlight">breathing</span><span class="highlight">air</span> with <span class="highlight">extra</span><span class="highlight">carbon</span><span class="highlight">dioxide</span> should have <span class="question5">triggered</span> yawning, while <span class="highlight">breathing</span><span class="highlight">pure</span><span class="highlight">oxygen</span> should have suppressed yawning. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>In fact, neither condition made any <span class="highlight">difference</span> to the <span class="highlight">frequency</span> of yawning, which remained <span class="highlight">constant</span> at about 24 yawns per hour. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>Another experiment demonstrated that <span class="highlight">physical</span><span class="highlight">exercise</span>, which was <span class="highlight">sufficiently</span><span class="highlight">vigorous</span> to double the <span class="highlight">rate</span> of <span class="highlight">breathing</span>, had no effect on the <span class="highlight">frequency</span> of yawning. Again the <span class="highlight">implication</span> is that yawning has little or nothing to do with <span class="highlight">oxygen</span>.</p><p>A completely different <span class="highlight">theory</span> holds that yawning assists in the <span class="highlight">physical</span><span class="highlight">development</span> of the lungs early in life, but has no <span class="highlight">remaining</span> biological <span class="highlight">function</span> in adults. It has been suggested that yawning and hiccupping might serve to <span class="highlight">clear</span> out the fetuses airways. The lungs of a <span class="highlight">fetus</span><span class="highlight">secrete</span> a <span class="highlight">liquid</span> that mixes with its mother's amniotic <span class="highlight">fluid</span>. Babies with <span class="highlight">congenital</span> blockages that prevent this <span class="highlight">fluid</span> from escaping from their lungs are sometimes born with deformed lungs. It might be that yawning helps to <span class="highlight">clear</span> out the lungs by <span class="highlight"><span class="question7">periodically</span></span> lowering the <span class="highlight">pressure</span> in them. According to this <span class="highlight">theory</span>, yawning in adults is just a developmental <span class="highlight">fossil</span> with no biological <span class="highlight">function</span>. But, while accepting that not everything in life can be explained by Darwinian <span class="highlight">evolution</span>, there are <span class="highlight">sound</span> reasons for being <span class="highlight">skeptical</span> of theories like this one, which <span class="highlight">avoid</span> the <span class="highlight">issue</span> of what yawning does for adults. Yawning is distracting, consumes energy and takes time. It is almost certainly doing something <span class="highlight">significant</span> in adults as well as in fetuses. What could it be?</p><p>The <span class="highlight"><span class="question10">empirical</span></span><span class="highlight">evidence</span>, such as it is, suggests an <span class="highlight">altogether</span> different <span class="highlight">function</span> for yawning-namely, that yawning prepares us for a change in <span class="highlight">activity</span><span class="highlight">level</span>. Support for this <span class="highlight">theory</span> came from a study of yawning <span class="highlight">behavior</span> in everyday life. Volunteers wore wrist-mounted devices that automatically recorded their <span class="highlight">physical</span><span class="highlight">activity</span> for up to two weeks: the volunteers also recorded their yawns by pressing a button on the <span class="highlight">device</span> each time they yawned. The <span class="highlight">data</span> showed that yawning tended to <span class="highlight">occur</span> about 15 minutes before a period of increased <span class="highlight">behavioral</span><span class="highlight">activity</span>. Yawning bore no relationship to sleep patterns, however. This accords with <span class="highlight">anecdotal</span><span class="highlight">evidence</span> that people often yawn in situations where they are neither tired nor bored, but are preparing for <span class="highlight">impending</span><span class="highlight">mental</span> and <span class="highlight">physical</span><span class="highlight">activity</span>. Such yawning is often referred to as "incongruous" because it seems out of place, at <span class="highlight">least</span> on the tiredness view: <span class="question12">soldiers yawning before <span class="highlight">combat</span>, musicians yawning before performing, and athletes yawning before <span class="highlight">competing</span>.</span> Their yawning seems to have nothing to do with sleepiness or boredom-quite the <span class="highlight">reverse</span>-but it does <span class="highlight">precede</span> a change in <span class="highlight">activity</span><span class="highlight">level</span>.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It is the conventional theory that when people are bored or sleepy, they often experience a drop in blood oxygen levels due to their shallow breathing.</p><p>B. The conventional theory is that people yawn when bored or sleepy because yawning raises blood oxygen levels, which in turn raises alertness.</p><p>C. According to conventional theory, yawning is more likely to occur when people are bored or sleepy than when they are alert and breathing deeply.</p><p>D. Yawning, according to the conventional theory, is caused by boredom or lack of sleep and can be avoided through deeper breathing.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The main logic of B's original text is juxtaposition, which expresses two meanings: 1) yawn is because of bored or sleepy; 2) it can play a refreshing role. So B is correct. A is missing the second meaning; C's comparison is not the original; D's can be inevitable did not say.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>In paragragh1, what point does the author make about the evidence for the tiredness theory of yawning?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. There is no scientific evidence linking yawning with tiredness.</p><p>B. The evidence is wide-ranging because it covers multiple age-groups.</p><p>C. The evidence is reliable because it was collected over a long period of time.</p><p>D. The evidence is questionable because the yawning patterns of children and adults should be different.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A. The first sentence says that the traditional theory that yawning is related to tiredness and boring. This is the tiredness theory of this question. In the past, the next sentence said that there is no evidence to prove this theory, so the answer is A. Say no evidence, BCD said that there is evidence, wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question3">flaw</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. fault</p><p>B. aspect</p><p>C. confusion</p><p>D. mystery</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" A"><p>A, <span class="question3">flaw</span>: <span class="question3">flaw</span>, fault, fault. A is an error; B is an aspect; C is a confusion; D is a secret. So A's fault is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>In the paragraph 2, why does the author note that there were physiological changes when subjects opened their mouths or breathed deeply?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To present an argument in support of the tiredness theory</p><p>B. To cast doubt on the reliability of the tests that measured heart rate, muscle tension and skin conductance</p><p>C. To argue against the hypothesis that yawning provides a special way to improve alertness or raise physiological activity</p><p>D. To support the idea that opening the mouth or breathing deeply can affect blood oxygen levels</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C. The topic of rhetoric, first find the third sentence where the rhetorical point is located. This sentence is just repeating this example. There is no point of view. Look forward. The preceding sentence stated that some physiological changes were detected, or was an example. Therefore, the central sentence, that is, the first sentence, says that yawning will not increase the degree of sobriety, so the answer is C. A and D reversed, B said that questioning the reliability of the experiment, the author does not question the experiment itself, but question the conclusion and use the experiment to support this challenge.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "triggered" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. removed</p><p>B. followed</p><p>C. increased</p><p>D. caused</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D trigger: cause, inspire. A is removed; B is followed; C is increased; D is caused. So D's cause is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Paragraph 2 answers all of the following questions about yawning EXCEPT</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Does yawning increase alertness or physiological activity?</p><p>B. Does thinking about yawning increase yawning over not thinking about yawning?</p><p>C. Does the amount of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the air affect the rate at which people yawn?</p><p>D. Does the rate of breathing affect the rate at which people yawn?</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B EXCEPT questions, exclusions, A's alertness or physiological activity do keyword positioning to the first sentence, correct, not selected; B's thinking about yawning do keyword positioning to the penultimate sentence, did not say whether increase, so B did not Say, choose; C's rate of yawning do keyword positioning to the penultimate sentence, correct, not selected; D's rate of breathing do keyword positioning to the last sentence, D correct, not selected.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question7">periodically</span></span>" in the passage is closest in the meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. continuously</p><p>B. quickly</p><p>C. regularly</p><p>D. carefully</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" C"><p>C <span class="question7">periodically</span>: Periodically. A is continuous; B is fast; C is regular, regular; D is serious. So C's are regularly correct.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the developmental theory of yawning presented in paragraph 3, what is the role of yawning?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It caused hiccups, which aid in the development of the lungs.</p><p>B. It controls the amount of pressure the lungs place on other developing organs.</p><p>C. It prevents amniotic fluid from entering the lungs.</p><p>D. It removes a potentially harmful fluid from the lungs.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D. Use developmental theory as the key word to locate the first sentence. It is useful to say that yawning is in the early stages of life, but it is useless for adults. However, this sentence is merely to say theory and look down. The next sentence says that snoring and yawning can help the fetus clear the airway, so the answer is D. A obviously did not say; B's other developing organ did not say; C's prevent did not say.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Paragraph 3 supports which of the following statements about the development theory of yawning?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The theory is attractive because it explains yawning from the perspective of Darwinian evolution.</p><p>B. The theory is unsatisfactory because it cannot explain the lung deformities of infants.</p><p>C. The theory is questionable because it does not explain why a useless and inconvenient behavior would continue into adulthood.</p><p>D. The theory is incomplete because it does not explain all the evolutionary stages in the development of yawning.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C This method of elimination is easier to solve. The reason is that the entire sentence can be seen by the first sentence, but the first sentence we just saw has no use. B's lung deformity was targeted to the fourth sentence, but did not say whether or not to explain it; D's evolutionary stage did not say anything at all.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question10">empirical</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. reliable</p><p>B. based on common sense</p><p>C. relevant</p><p>D. based on observation</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" D"><p>D <span class="question10">empirical</span>: Positive. A is reliable; B is based on common sense; C is related; D is based on observation (obtained). So the answer is D based on observation.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The study of yawning behavior discussed in paragraph 4 supports which of the following conclusions?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Yawning is associated with an expectation of increased physical activity.</p><p>B. Yawning occurs more frequently when people are asked to record their yawning.</p><p>C. People tend to yawn about fifteen minutes before they become tired or bored.</p><p>D. Mental or physical stress tends to make people yawn.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A. Ask the conclusion of the whole paragraph. Look at the opening sentence and say that the facts prove that the effect of yawning is the change of surface activity level, so the answer is A, increased activity; BCD does not say anything at all, and it is not the whole conclusion.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the author mention "<span class="highlight">soldiers yawning before combat, musicians yawning before performing, and athletes yawning before competing</span>"?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To argue that just the expectation of physical activity can make some people feel tired</p><p>B. To explain how the view that people yawn because they are tired accounts for yawning before stressful situations</p><p>C. To support the view that yawning helps prepare a person for mental or physical exertion</p><p>D. To provide anecdotal evidence that conflicts with the experience of the volunteers in the study</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="soldiers yawning before combat, musicians yawning before performing, and athletes yawning before competing C"><p>C. The topic of rhetoric, first looking at the sentence where the rhetorical point is located, finds that it is simply to state an example and continue to look ahead. The above sentence states that people yawn are neither because of difficulties nor because of tiredness, but because they are mentally physically active. Prepare, so the answer is C. A's expectation, B's stressful situation and D's conflict didn't say anything.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>This, however, was not the case..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C. Two transition points, the transitional conjunctions often and the pronouns this, the assumptions after point B make assumptions, and the in fact after point C gives a transition, so the answer is C. Substitution, said before if blabla, followed by that is not the case, then in fact give an explanation.</p></div></div><div id="question14" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>The tiredness theory of yawning does not seem to explain why yawning occurs.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.Although earlier scientific studies strongly supported the tiredness theory, new evidence has cast doubt on these findings.</p><p>B.Some have proposed that yawning plays a role in the development of lungs before birth but that it serves no purpose in adults.</p><p>C.New studies, along with anecdotal evidence, have shown that the frequency of yawning increases during extended periods of inactivity.</p><p>D.Evidence has shown that yawning is almost completely unrelated to amount of oxygen in the blood and is unrelated to sleep behavior.</p><p>E.Fluids in the lungs of the prevent yawning from occurring, which disproves the developmental theory of yawning.</p><p>F.There is some evidence that suggests that yawning prepares the body and mind for a change in activity level.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="BDF"><p>The original analysis studies in the BDF options do not say, do not select. The "Some" option corresponds to the first sentence of the third paragraph of the original text. The correct .New option does not say the original, not selected. The Evidence option corresponds to the first sentence and the last sentence of the second paragraph of the original text. In one sentence, the correct .Fluid option MS corresponds to the third paragraph of the original text, but the original does not say, do not select. The option corresponds to the first sentence of the last paragraph of the original text, correct.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
