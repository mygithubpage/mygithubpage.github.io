My life will be different in one way from now that I don't have to be tied to a job. I can travel around the world, go anywhere, see different things, meet different people, broaden my horizon and thus feel the world. I don't have to confine myself to just one place. I can go to France, South Africa, South America and Islands in the Pacific. In addition, I can be a freelancer, live on my royalties. I will have plenty of time to write novels and read all the masterpieces. This is what I imagine my life will be in ten years.</p></article></div></main></body></html>
