        <article>
          <p>Listen to a conversation between two students.</p>
          <p>(woman) Hey, Matt, you got your paper done for class today?</p>
          <p>(man) No, I just realized it's sitting on my desk. I wrote it last night, but I forgot to bring it us me.</p>
          <p>(woman) Uh-oh, so what are you gonna do?</p>
          <p>(man) Well, I could drive home and get it, I live off campus, but if I hurry, I'd probably get home and bring the paper back before class was over. You know how strict she is about late submissions.</p>
          <p>(woman) Yeah, but you'd miss part of the class.</p>
          <p>(man) I know!</p>
          <p>(woman) Maybe you could talk to the professor, explain what happened and ask her if you could send it later by email.</p>
          <p>(man) I know, but, I'd have to do it after class cause she always starts class right on time. There wouldn't be time to talk to her until after class.</p>
          <p>(woman) Well, why don't you do that and hope she doesn't consider the paper late?</p>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>Well, the man's problem is that he finished his paper but forgot to take it with him today. Accordingly, he believes that he could drive home because he lives off campus. The woman suggests that the man talk to the professor and ask for a later copy of his paper by email. Well I guess talking to the professor would be a better solution for the man's problem for two main reasons. Firstly, the man did get the paper done, and asking for extension wouldn't be unfair for other students. Considering his attitude it's quite understandable to be a few hours late. Second, fetching his paper at the cost of being late for most of the class is definitely not worthy. After all, it's the class that matters to the students not the due date of paper itself. So, I guess talking to the professor about the problem would be a better solution for the man. (157 words)</p>
