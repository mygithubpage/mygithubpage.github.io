Explain the reasons for your recommendation. </p></section><section id="sample-response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><article><p>Well, the man's problem is that he finished his paper but forgot to take it with him today. Accordingly, he believes that he could drive home because he lives off campus. The woman suggests that the man talk to the professor and ask for a later copy of his paper by email. Well I guess talking to the professor would be a better solution for the man's problem for two main reasons. Firstly, the man did get the paper done, and asking for extension wouldn't be unfair for other students. Considering his attitude it's quite understandable to be a few hours late. Second, fetching his paper at the cost of being late for most of the class is definitely not worthy. After all, it's the class that matters to the students not the due date of paper itself. So, I guess talking to the professor about the problem would be a better solution for the man. (157 words)</p></article></section></main></body></html>
