            <b>Industrialization in the Netherlands and Scandinavia</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>While some European countries, such as England and Germany, began to industrialize in the eighteenth <span class="underline">century</span>, the Netherlands and the Scandinavian countries of Denmark, Norway,
and Sweden developed later. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> All four of these countries lagged <span class="underline">considerably</span> behind in the early nineteenth <span class="underline">century</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>However, they industrialized rapidly in the <span class="underline">second</span> half of the <span class="underline">century</span>,
especially in the last two or three decades. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>In view of their later start and their <span class="underline">lack</span> of <span class="underline">coal</span>-undoubtedly the main <span class="underline">reason</span> they were not among the early industrializers-it is important to 
understand the sources of their success. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p>
          <p>All had small populations. At the beginning of the nineteenth <span class="underline">century</span>, Denmark and Norway had fewer than 1 million people, while Sweden and the Netherlands had fewer than 2.5 million inhabitants. All exhibited <span class="underline">moderate</span> growth rates in the <span class="underline">course</span> of the <span class="underline">century</span> (Denmark the highest and Sweden the lowest), but all more than doubled in <span class="underline">population</span> by 1900. Density <span class="underline">varied</span> greatly. The Netherlands had one of the highest <span class="underline">population</span> densities in Europe, whereas Norway and Sweden had the lowest Denmark was in between but closer to the Netherlands.</p>
          <p>Considering human capital as a <span class="underline">characteristic</span> of the <span class="underline">population</span>, however, all four countries were advantaged by the large percentages of their populations who could read and write. In both 1850 and 1914, the Scandinavian countries had the highest <span class="underline">literacy</span> rates in Europe, or in the world, and the Netherlands was well above the European <span class="underline">average</span>. This fact was of <span class="underline">enormous</span> value in helping the national economies find their niches in the evolving currents of the international <span class="underline">economy</span>.</p>
          <p>Location was an important <span class="underline">factor</span> for all four countries. All had <span class="underline">immediate</span> <span class="underline">access</span> to the sea, and this had important implications for a <span class="underline">significant</span> international <span class="underline">resource</span>, fish, as well as for cheap <span class="underline">transport</span>, <span class="underline">merchant</span> marines, and the shipbuilding <span class="underline">industry</span>. Each took <span class="underline">advantage</span> of these opportunities in its own way. The people of the Netherlands, with a long tradition of fisheries and <span class="underline">mercantile</span> shipping, had difficulty in developing good harbors <span class="underline">suitable</span> for steamships: <span class="underline">eventually</span> they did so at Rotterdam and Amsterdam, with <span class="underline">exceptional</span> results for <span class="underline">transit</span> <span class="underline">trade</span> with Germany and central Europe and for the processing of <span class="underline">overseas</span> foodstuffs and <span class="underline">raw</span> materials (sugar, tobacco, chocolate, <span class="underline">grain</span>, and <span class="underline">eventually</span> oil). Denmark also had an admirable <span class="underline">commercial</span> <span class="underline">history</span>, particularly with <span class="underline">respect</span> to traffic <span class="underline">through</span> the <span class="underline">Sound</span> (the <span class="underline">strait</span> separating Denmark and Sweden). In 1857, in return for a payment of 63 million kronor from other <span class="underline">commercial</span> nations, Denmark abolished the <span class="underline">Sound</span> toll dues the fees it had collected since 1497 for the use of the <span class="underline">Sound</span>. This, <span class="underline">along</span> with other <span class="underline">policy</span> shifts toward free <span class="underline">trade</span>, resulted in a <span class="underline">significant</span> increase in traffic <span class="underline">through</span> the <span class="underline">Sound</span> and in the port of Copenhagen.</p>
          <p>The <span class="underline">political</span> institutions of the four countries posed no <span class="underline">significant</span> barriers to <span class="underline">industrialization</span> or <span class="underline">economic</span> growth. The nineteenth <span class="underline">century</span> passed <span class="underline">relatively</span> peacefully for these countries, with <span class="underline">progressive</span> democratization taking place in all of them. They were reasonably well governed, without <span class="underline">notable</span> corruption or grandiose <span class="underline">state</span> projects, although in all of them the <span class="underline">government</span> gave some aid to railways, and in Sweden the <span class="underline">state</span> built the main lines. As small countries dependent on foreign markets, they followed a liberal <span class="underline">trade</span> <span class="underline">policy</span> in the main, though a protectionist movement developed in Sweden. In Denmark and Sweden agricultural reforms took place <span class="underline">gradually</span> from the late eighteenth <span class="underline">century</span> <span class="underline">through</span> the first half of the nineteenth, resulting in a new class of peasant landowners with a <span class="underline">definite</span> <span class="underline">market</span> <span class="underline">orientation</span>.</p>
          <p>The key <span class="underline">factor</span> in the success of these countries (<span class="underline">along</span> with high <span class="underline">literacy</span>, which contributed to it) was their <span class="underline">ability</span> to <span class="underline">adapt</span> to the international <span class="underline">division</span> of labor <span class="underline">determined</span> by the early industrializers and to <span class="underline">stake</span> out areas of <span class="underline">specialization</span> in international markets for which they were especially well suited. This meant a great dependence on international <span class="underline">commerce</span>, which had <span class="underline">notorious</span> fluctuations; but it also meant high returns to those factors of production that were fortunate enough to be well placed in times of <span class="underline">prosperity</span>. In Sweden exports accounted for 18 percent of the national income in 1870, and in 1913, 22 percent of a much larger national income. In the early twentieth <span class="underline">century</span>, Denmark exported 63 percent of its agricultural production: <span class="underline">butter</span>, pork products, and eggs. It exported 80 percent of its <span class="underline">butter</span>, almost all to Great Britain, where it accounted for 40 percent of British <span class="underline">butter</span> imports.</p>
