          <h4 class="w3-center">Industrialization in the Netherlands and Scandinavia</h4>
          <p>While some European countries, such as England and Germany, began to industrialize in the eighteenth <span class="highlight">century</span>, the Netherlands and the Scandinavian countries of Denmark, Norway,
and Sweden developed later. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> All four of these countries lagged <span class="highlight">considerably</span> behind in the early nineteenth <span class="highlight">century</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>However, they industrialized rapidly in the <span class="highlight">second</span> half of the <span class="highlight">century</span>,
especially in the last two or three decades. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>In view of their later start and their <span class="highlight">lack</span> of <span class="highlight">coal</span>-undoubtedly the main <span class="highlight">reason</span> they were not among the early industrializers-it is important to 
understand the sources of their success. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p>
          <p>All had small populations. At the beginning of the nineteenth <span class="highlight">century</span>, Denmark and Norway had fewer than 1 million people, while Sweden and the Netherlands had fewer than 2.5 million inhabitants. All exhibited <span class="highlight">moderate</span> growth rates in the <span class="highlight">course</span> of the <span class="highlight">century</span> (Denmark the highest and Sweden the lowest), but all more than doubled in <span class="highlight">population</span> by 1900. Density <span class="highlight">varied</span> greatly. The Netherlands had one of the highest <span class="highlight">population</span> densities in Europe, whereas Norway and Sweden had the lowest Denmark was in between but closer to the Netherlands.</p>
          <p>Considering human capital as a <span class="highlight">characteristic</span> of the <span class="highlight">population</span>, however, all four countries were advantaged by the large percentages of their populations who could read and write. In both 1850 and 1914, the Scandinavian countries had the highest <span class="highlight">literacy</span> rates in Europe, or in the world, and the Netherlands was well above the European <span class="highlight">average</span>. This fact was of <span class="highlight">enormous</span> value in helping the national economies find their niches in the evolving currents of the international <span class="highlight">economy</span>.</p>
          <p>Location was an important <span class="highlight">factor</span> for all four countries. All had <span class="highlight">immediate</span> <span class="highlight">access</span> to the sea, and this had important implications for a <span class="highlight">significant</span> international <span class="highlight">resource</span>, fish, as well as for cheap <span class="highlight">transport</span>, <span class="highlight">merchant</span> marines, and the shipbuilding <span class="highlight">industry</span>. Each took <span class="highlight">advantage</span> of these opportunities in its own way. The people of the Netherlands, with a long tradition of fisheries and <span class="highlight">mercantile</span> shipping, had difficulty in developing good harbors <span class="highlight">suitable</span> for steamships: <span class="highlight">eventually</span> they did so at Rotterdam and Amsterdam, with <span class="highlight"><span class="question5">exceptional</span></span> results for <span class="highlight">transit</span> <span class="highlight">trade</span> with Germany and central Europe and for the processing of <span class="highlight">overseas</span> foodstuffs and <span class="highlight">raw</span> materials (sugar, tobacco, chocolate, <span class="highlight">grain</span>, and <span class="highlight">eventually</span> oil). Denmark also had an admirable <span class="highlight">commercial</span> <span class="highlight">history</span>, particularly with <span class="highlight">respect</span> to traffic <span class="highlight">through</span> the <span class="highlight">Sound</span> (the <span class="highlight">strait</span> separating Denmark and Sweden). In 1857, in return for a payment of 63 million kronor from other <span class="highlight">commercial</span> nations, Denmark <span class="question6">abolished</span> the <span class="highlight">Sound</span> toll dues the fees it had collected since 1497 for the use of the <span class="highlight">Sound</span>. This, <span class="highlight">along</span> with other <span class="highlight">policy</span> shifts toward free <span class="highlight">trade</span>, resulted in a <span class="highlight">significant</span> increase in traffic <span class="highlight">through</span> the <span class="highlight">Sound</span> and in the port of Copenhagen.</p>
          <p>The <span class="highlight">political</span> institutions of the four countries posed no <span class="highlight">significant</span> barriers to <span class="highlight">industrialization</span> or <span class="highlight">economic</span> growth. The nineteenth <span class="highlight">century</span> passed <span class="highlight">relatively</span> peacefully for these countries, with <span class="highlight"><span class="question8">progressive</span></span> democratization taking place in all of them. They were reasonably well governed, without <span class="highlight">notable</span> corruption or grandiose <span class="highlight">state</span> projects, although in all of them the <span class="highlight">government</span> gave some aid to railways, and in Sweden the <span class="highlight">state</span> built the main lines. As small countries dependent on foreign markets, they followed a liberal <span class="highlight">trade</span> <span class="highlight">policy</span> in the main, though <span class="question9">a protectionist movement developed in Sweden.</span> In Denmark and Sweden agricultural reforms took place <span class="highlight">gradually</span> from the late eighteenth <span class="highlight">century</span> <span class="highlight">through</span> the first half of the nineteenth, resulting in a new class of peasant landowners with a <span class="highlight">definite</span> <span class="highlight">market</span> <span class="highlight">orientation</span>.</p>
          <p><span class="question10">The key <span class="highlight">factor</span> in the success of these countries (<span class="highlight">along</span> with high <span class="highlight">literacy</span>, which contributed to it) was their <span class="highlight">ability</span> to <span class="highlight">adapt</span> to the international <span class="highlight">division</span> of labor <span class="highlight">determined</span> by the early industrializers and to <span class="highlight">stake</span> out areas of <span class="highlight">specialization</span> in international markets for which they were especially well suited.</span> This meant a great dependence on international <span class="highlight">commerce</span>, which had <span class="highlight">notorious</span> fluctuations; but it also meant high returns to those factors of production that were fortunate enough to be well placed in times of <span class="highlight">prosperity</span>. In Sweden exports accounted for 18 percent of the national income in 1870, and in 1913, 22 percent of a much larger national income. In the early twentieth <span class="highlight">century</span>, Denmark exported 63 percent of its agricultural production: <span class="highlight">butter</span>, pork products, and eggs. It exported 80 percent of its <span class="highlight">butter</span>, almost all to Great Britain, where it accounted for 40 percent of British <span class="highlight">butter</span> imports.</p>

              <p>B. Note that there is no obvious keyword for this question. England and Germany cannot be used because they are related to the topic. Therefore, the exclusion method is used. A start of the 19th century does keyword positioning to the second sentence, saying that it is relatively backward, A and C are all the opposite; B's coal keyword positioning to the last sentence, the original said that there is no coal so the Nordic countries did not realize industrialization very early That is, the early realization of industrialization in the United Kingdom and Germany had coal, so B was correct; D was the opposite of the first sentence of the original text and was not chosen.</p>

            <div class="explanation">
              <p>D population density is targeted to the last two sentences of the second paragraph. It is said that the density of population changes greatly and Denmark is the smallest in Sweden. However, the reason why they all achieved industrialization and industrialization is the same, so density is not important and D is correct. There is no comparison in the original, so no other answer is correct.</p>

              <p>D. Use economic development as a key word to position the last sentence of the third paragraph. Say this fact helps economic development because there are pronouns.

              <p>The main logic of B's sentence is juxtaposition. The main factors that the trunk says are: 1) adapting to international division of labor; 2) opening up professional fields. So B is correct. A's stake out new areas did not say, the original said areas of specialization; C's take over the original did not say; D said, it should be these countries to adapt to the labor market, not the labor market to adapt to these countries.</p>
