Different views of a type of sculpture popular in ancient Roman times.</p><p>B. Evidence that Romans had outstanding artistic ability.</p><p>C. The differences between Greek sculpture and Roman sculpture.</p><p>D. The relationship between art and politics in ancient Roman times.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>Lecture talked about the view of the Roman sculpture -copies. Traditional believes that the Romans do not have the skills to copy the Greeks. Gazda thinks Roman sculpture has a double meaning. The author also illustrated the value and function of the Roman sculpture -copies of Greek sculpture through examples of coin and emperor skulls. So the answer is A.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to traditional art historians , why did the Romans copy Greek sculpture?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The Roman public was not interested in original works of art.</p><p>B. The Roman government did not support other forms of art.</p><p>C. Roman artists did not have sufficient skill to create original sculpture.</p><p>D. Romans wanted to imitate the art they admired.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Now the dominant view in traditional art history is that Roman artists lacked creativity and skill especially compared to the Greek artists who came before them. Essentially, the traditional view, a view that’s been prevalent for over 250 years, is that the Romans copied Greek sculptures because they couldn’t create sculpture of their own. </p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is Gazda's view of the Roman copies of Greek statues?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The copies represented the idea that Roman society was similar to Greek society.</p><p>B. The copies introduced the citizens of the Roman Empire to Greek history.</p><p>C. The copies were inferior to the original statues.</p><p>D. The copies had both artistic and political functions.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>Gazda also believes that it's been a mistake to dismiss the Roman copies as, well, copies for copy's sake and not to consider the Roman function and meaning of the statues</p><p>But rather, as a sign word, plays a role of emphasis, and the content behind it is certainly very important. Sure enough, this is part of Gazda's view that the Romans copied the Greek sculpture because of appreciation. Also is another sign that Gazda's point of view is not over. The difficulty of this question lies in the understanding of the red part. Gazda believes that it is wrong to ignore the role and meaning of Roman sculpture. The implication is that there are reasons other than artistic reasons for the Romans to copy Greek sculptures. Look at option D is the most appropriate.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor mention Roman coins?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To show the similarity between the likenesses of the emperor in statues and on coins.</p><p>B. To illustrate the Roman policy of distributing the emperor s image throughout the empire.</p><p>C. To imply that the citizens of the Roman Empire became quite wealthy.</p><p>D. To suggest that the Romans also copied Greek art on their coins.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The coins were easy to distribute and they allowed people to see the emperor or at least his likes and served as an additional reminder to let them know, well, who was in charge.</p><p>The professor said that sculpture is not just a decoration, but also has a certain political role, so that the public can understand the appearance of the executive. To prove this, he used the coin analogy. The Highlight section introduces the function of the coin. Looking at options, B is undoubtedly the correct answer.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor, why did the Romans sometimes remove the emperor's head from a statue?Click on 2 answers</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The head made the statue too heavy to transport.</p><p>B. The head was placed on the body of a different statue.</p><p>C. The emperor was no longer in power.</p><p>D. The emperor was not satisfied with the quality of the statue.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="BC"><p>The B option is easily selected. C's options are hidden deeper, but there are some implied reasons for infer:Highlight; with the previous incarnation, the next head implies that the governing party was replaced by the original ruler. The head is to be removed. The coins were easy to distribute and they allowed people to see the emperor or at least his likes and served as an reminder to let them know, well, who was in charge. The Roman sculpture has a political purpose, in order for the people to know who is If you are in power, then if the ruling party takes over, you will naturally need to change your head, or how will the people know who is in power?</p></div></div><div class="replay" id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor imply when he says this:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.
