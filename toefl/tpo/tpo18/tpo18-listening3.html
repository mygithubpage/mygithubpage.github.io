              <span class="time" data-times="4.9" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in an art <span class="underline">history</span> class. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.39" data-time="4.9">[00:04.90]</span>Professor: Today we'll continue our examination of <span class="underline">ancient</span> Roman <span class="underline">sculpture</span>. <span class="time" data-times="11.03" data-time="10.29">[00:10.29]</span>We've already looked at <span class="underline">portrait</span> <span class="underline">sculpture</span> which are busts created to <span class="underline">commemorate</span> people who had died, and we've looked at <span class="underline">relief</span> <span class="underline">sculpture</span>, or sculpting on walls. <span class="time" data-times="5.51" data-time="21.32">[00:21.32]</span>And today we'll look at yet another <span class="underline">category</span> of sculpture-copies. <span class="time" data-times="4.74" data-time="26.83">[00:26.83]</span>Roman sculptors often made copies of famous Greek sculptures. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.32" data-time="31.57">[00:31.57]</span>Student: Why did they do that? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.92" data-time="32.89">[00:32.89]</span>Professor: Well no one knows for sure. <span class="time" data-times="13.64" data-time="35.81">[00:35.81]</span>You see, in the late 4th <span class="underline">century</span> B.C., the Romans began a <span class="underline">campaign</span> to <span class="underline">expand</span> the Roman <span class="underline">Empire</span>, and in 300 years they had conquered most of the <span class="underline">Mediterranean</span> area and parts of Europe. <span class="time" data-times="3.53" data-time="49.45">[00:49.45]</span>You know the saying, "To the victor belong the spoils"? <span class="time" data-times="5.06" data-time="52.98">[00:52.98]</span>Well, the Roman army returned to Rome with many works of Greek art. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.46" data-time="58.04">[00:58.04]</span>It's probably <span class="underline">fair</span> to say that the Romans were impressed be Greek art and <span class="underline">culture</span> and they began making copies of the Greek statues. <span class="time" data-times="12.17" data-time="67.5">[01:07.50]</span>Now the <span class="underline">dominant</span> view in <span class="underline">traditional</span> art his that Roman artists lacked <span class="underline">creativity</span> and skill especially compared to the Greek artists who came before them. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="13.4" data-time="79.67">[01:19.67]</span>
              <span class="underline">Essentially</span>, the <span class="underline">traditional</span> view, a view that's been <span class="underline">prevalent</span> for over 250 years, is that the Romans copied Greek sculptures because they couldn't create <span class="underline">sculpture</span> of their own. <span class="time" data-times="7.92" data-time="93.07">[01:33.07]</span>But finally some <span class="underline">contemporary</span> art historians have challenged this view. <span class="time" data-times="2.87" data-time="100.99">[01:40.99]</span>One is Elaine Gazda. <span class="time" data-times="6.32" data-time="103.86">[01:43.86]</span>Gazda says that there might be other reasons that Romans made copies. <span class="time" data-times="4.08" data-time="110.18">[01:50.18]</span>She wasn't convinced that it was because of a <span class="underline">lack</span> of <span class="underline">creativity</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.65" data-time="114.26">[01:54.26]</span>Can anyone think of another possible <span class="underline">reason</span>? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.22" data-time="117.91">[01:57.91]</span>Student: Well maybe they just admired these sculptures. <span class="time" data-times="2.21" data-time="122.13">[02:02.13]</span>You know, they liked the way they looked. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.64" data-time="124.34">[02:04.34]</span>Professor: Yes. That's one of Gazda's points. <span class="time" data-times="6.72" data-time="126.98">[02:06.98]</span>Another is that while nowadays <span class="underline">reproduction</span> is easy, it was not so easy in Roman times. <span class="time" data-times="4.28" data-time="133.7">[02:13.70]</span>Copying statues required a lot of skill, time and effort. <span class="time" data-times="15.36" data-time="137.98">[02:17.98]</span>So Gazda hypothesizes that copying didn't <span class="underline">indicate</span> a <span class="underline">lack</span> of <span class="underline">artistic</span> imagination or skill on the part of Roman artists, but rather the Romans made copies because they admired Greek <span class="underline">sculpture</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.14" data-time="153.34">[02:33.34]</span>
              <span class="underline">Classical</span> Greek statues represented an idealization of the human body and were considered quite beautiful at the time. <span class="time" data-times="13.38" data-time="161.48">[02:41.48]</span>Gazda also believes that it's been a mistake to dismiss the Roman copies as, well, copies for copy's <span class="underline">sake</span> and not to <span class="underline">consider</span> the Roman <span class="underline">function</span> and meaning of the statues. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.93" data-time="174.86">[02:54.86]</span>Student: What do you mean the Roman <span class="underline">function</span>? <span class="time" data-times="1.72" data-time="177.79">[02:57.79]</span>Weren't they just for decoration? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.93" data-time="179.51">[02:59.51]</span>Professor: Well, not necessarily. <span class="time" data-times="19.96" data-time="181.44">[03:01.44]</span>Under the <span class="underline">Emperor</span> Augustus at the height of the Roman <span class="underline">Empire</span>, <span class="underline">portrait</span> statues were sent <span class="underline">throughout</span> the <span class="underline">empire</span>. They were supposed to <span class="underline">communicate</span> <span class="underline">specific</span> ideas about the <span class="underline">emperor</span> and the <span class="underline">imperial</span> family and to help inhabitants of the conquered areas become <span class="underline">familiar</span> with the Roman way of life. <span class="time" data-times="4.47" data-time="201.4">[03:21.40]</span>You know, Roman coins were also distributed <span class="underline">throughout</span> the <span class="underline">empire</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.67" data-time="205.87">[03:25.87]</span>Anybody <span class="underline">care</span> to guess what was on them? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.14" data-time="208.54">[03:28.54]</span>Student: The <span class="underline">emperor</span>'s face? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="0.94999999999999" data-time="209.68">[03:29.68]</span>Professor: That's right! <span class="time" data-times="13.16" data-time="210.63">[03:30.63]</span>The coins were easy to <span class="underline">distribute</span> and they allowed people to see the <span class="underline">emperor</span> or at <span class="underline">least</span> his likes and served as an <span class="underline">additional</span> reminder to let them know, well, who was in charge. <span class="time" data-times="4.34" data-time="223.79">[03:43.79]</span>And the images helped people become <span class="underline">familiar</span> with the <span class="underline">emperor</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.66" data-time="228.13">[03:48.13]</span>Statues of him in different roles were sent all over the <span class="underline">empire</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="11.9" data-time="232.79">[03:52.79]</span>Now, actually some Roman sculptures were <span class="underline">original</span> but others were <span class="underline">exact</span> copies of Greek statues and some Roman sculptures were combinations of some <span class="underline">sort</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.59" data-time="244.69">[04:04.69]</span>Some combined more than one Greek <span class="underline">statue</span> and others combined a Greek god or an <span class="underline">athlete</span> with a Roman's head. <span class="time" data-times="8.51" data-time="253.28">[04:13.28]</span>At the time of Julius Caesar, it wasn't uncommon to create statues that had the body of a god and the head of an <span class="underline">emperor</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.3" data-time="261.79">[04:21.79]</span>And the Romans were clever. <span class="time" data-times="5.33" data-time="265.09">[04:25.09]</span>What they did was: they made <span class="underline">plaster</span> casts from molds of the sculptures. <span class="time" data-times="8.41" data-time="270.42">[04:30.42]</span>Then they shipped these <span class="underline">plaster</span> casts to workshops all over the <span class="underline">empire</span>, where they were replicated in <span class="underline">marble</span> or <span class="underline">bronze</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.01" data-time="278.83">[04:38.83]</span>And on some statues the heads were removable. <span class="time" data-times="5.92" data-time="282.84">[04:42.84]</span>They could put an <span class="underline">emperor</span>'s head on different bodies, showing him doing different things. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="288.76">[04:48.76]</span>And then later when the time came they could <span class="underline">even</span> use the head of the next <span class="underline">emperor</span> on the same body. </p>
