          <h4 class="w3-center">University Choir to Enter Off-Campus Singing Competitions</h4>
          <p>Currently, the university choir gives singing concerts only on campus. Next year, however, the choir will add competitive events at other locations to its schedule. The choir's new director feels that entering singing competitions will make the quality of the choir's performance even better than it is now. "Competitions will motivate students in the choir to pursue a higher standard of excellence in singing," he said. In addition, it is hoped that getting the choir off campus and out in the public will strengthen the reputation of the university s music program. This in turn will help the program grow.</p>

        <article>
          <p>Now listen to two students discussing the article.</p>
          <p>(woman) Jim, you're in the choir, right? What do you think about what they are doing next year? This article?</p>
          <p>(man) I really like it.</p>
          <p>(woman) Yeah?</p>
          <p>(man) Yeah! The new director is right that it'll motivate us.</p>
          <p>(woman) How's that?</p>
          <p>(man) Well, some of the other schools are really good, so we'll really have to work hard to go up against them.</p>
          <p>(woman) Yeah!</p>
          <p>(man) I mean, right now, we don't rehearse more than once a week. But if we know we'd be competing with other schools, we'd probably rehearse more often and improve our singing the line.</p>
          <p>(woman) That's true, uh, the more you practice the better you get. So, uh, what about the article said about how this will help the program?</p>
          <p>(man) I hope it works. Right now, the program is pretty small but we have some really talented people and it would be great to attract even more people.</p>
          <p>(woman) So, how would this plan help?</p>
          <p>(man) Well, if we go to these off campus events and other people hear us and think we are really good, we might be able to get some new students interested in coming to this university, to be a part of our music program and perform in our choir concerts. (woman) You're right! I haven't really thought about that.</p>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>According to the article, the university choir will add competitive events at other locations to its schedule, and the man agrees with the change for two main reasons. First of all, he believes that such a change will motivate the students because some other schools are good, and the students in the choir will have to work hard to go up against them. He believes that the students will even work harder; they'd perhaps rehearse more often singing the line. The second reason for the man's preference is that even though the program is small, there are talented people in the program and if students go to off-campus events and win the public attention, their performance could attract more people to both the university and the musical program. So the man is looking forward to the change for the reasons stated above. (144 words)</p>
