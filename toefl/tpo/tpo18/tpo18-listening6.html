          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.83" data-time="4.88">[00:04.88]</span>Professor: Well, it's finally looking like <span class="highlight">spring</span> is arriving. <span class="time" data-times="3.2" data-time="8.71">[00:08.71]</span>The last of the winter snow would be <span class="highlight">melting</span> away in a few days. <span class="time" data-times="11.47" data-time="11.91">[00:11.91]</span>So before we close today, I thought I'd <span class="highlight">mention</span> a biological event that's a part of the <span class="highlight">transition</span> from winter to <span class="highlight">spring</span>, something you can go outside and watch if you have some patience. <span class="time" data-times="3.66" data-time="23.38">[00:23.38]</span>There is a small creature that lives in this area; you've probably seen it. <span class="time" data-times="3.37" data-time="27.04">[00:27.04]</span>It's the North American wood frog. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="10.98" data-time="30.41">[00:30.41]</span>Now the wood frog's not that easy tosspot since it stays <span class="highlight">pretty</span> to close to the ground, under leaves and things and it blends in really well with its background as you can see. <span class="time" data-times="7.5" data-time="41.39">[00:41.39]</span>But they are <span class="highlight">worth</span> the effort because they do something very unusual, something you might not have <span class="highlight">even</span> thought possible. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="7.51" data-time="48.89">[00:48.89]</span>OK. North American wood frogs live over a very <span class="highlight">broad</span> <span class="highlight">territory</span> or <span class="highlight">range</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.42" data-time="56.4">[00:56.40]</span>They're found all over the northeastern United States and all <span class="highlight">through</span> Canada and Alaska, <span class="highlight">even</span> inside the <span class="highlight">Arctic</span> Circle. <span class="time" data-times="3.5" data-time="62.82">[01:02.82]</span>No other frog is able to live that far and north. <span class="time" data-times="14.72" data-time="66.32">[01:06.32]</span>But wherever they live, once the weather starts to turn cold and the <span class="highlight">temperature</span> starts to <span class="highlight">drop</span> below freezing, as soon as the frog <span class="highlight">even</span> touches an ice <span class="highlight">crystal</span> or a bit of frozen ground, well, it begins to <span class="highlight">freeze</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.08" data-time="81.04">[01:21.04]</span>Yeah...yes to me. <span class="time" data-times="3.01" data-time="83.12">[01:23.12]</span>You look a little bit taken aback. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.67" data-time="86.13">[01:26.13]</span>Student: Wait, you mean it's still alive but it freezes, <span class="highlight">solid</span>? </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.52" data-time="90.8">[01:30.80]</span>Professor: Well, almost. <span class="time" data-times="3.87" data-time="92.32">[01:32.32]</span>Ice forms in all the spaces outside the cells but never <span class="highlight">within</span> a <span class="highlight">cell</span>. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.5" data-time="96.19">[01:36.19]</span>Student: But... then how does its heart <span class="highlight">beat</span>? </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.18" data-time="98.69">[01:38.69]</span>Professor: It doesn't. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.48" data-time="99.87">[01:39.87]</span>Student: But...then how could it....... </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1" data-time="101.35">[01:41.35]</span>Professor: You are <span class="highlight">gonna</span> do such a thing? <span class="time" data-times="5.8" data-time="102.35">[01:42.35]</span>Well, that first touch of ice apparently triggers a biological <span class="highlight">response</span> inside the frog. <span class="time" data-times="16.82" data-time="108.15">[01:48.15]</span>That first of all starts drawing water away from the center of its body, so the middle part of the frog, its <span class="highlight">internal</span> organs, its heart, lungs, liver, these start getting drier and drier while the water that's being pulled away is forming a <span class="highlight">puddle</span> around the organs just <span class="highlight">underneath</span> the skin. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3" data-time="124.97">[02:04.97]</span>And then that <span class="highlight">puddle</span> of water starts to <span class="highlight">freeze</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.63" data-time="127.97">[02:07.97]</span>OK, up to known, the frog's heart is still beating, right? <span class="time" data-times="12.64" data-time="132.6">[02:12.60]</span>Slower and slower but...and in those last few hours before it freezes, it distributes <span class="highlight">glucose</span>, a blood sugar <span class="highlight">throughout</span> its body, its <span class="highlight">circulatory</span> system, <span class="highlight">sort</span> of acts like an antifreeze. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.19" data-time="145.24">[02:25.24]</span>Student: A <span class="highlight">solution</span> of antifreeze like you put in your car in the winter? </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.5" data-time="148.43">[02:28.43]</span>Professor: Well, you tell me. <span class="time" data-times="5.3" data-time="150.93">[02:30.93]</span>In frogs, the <span class="highlight">extra</span> <span class="highlight">glucose</span> makes it harder for the winter inside the cells to <span class="highlight">freeze</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.05" data-time="156.23">[02:36.23]</span>So the cells stay just <span class="highlight">slightly</span> wet, enough so that they can <span class="highlight">survive</span> the winter. <span class="time" data-times="3.5" data-time="161.28">[02:41.28]</span>Then after that, the heart stops beating <span class="highlight">altogether</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.38" data-time="164.78">[02:44.78]</span>So is that the same? </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.56" data-time="167.16">[02:47.16]</span>Student: I don't really know, but how long does it stay that way? </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="9.82" data-time="172.72">[02:52.72]</span>Professor: Well, it could be days or months, all winter in fact but umm, see the heart really doesn't need to do any pumping now because the blood is frozen too. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.17" data-time="182.54">[03:02.54]</span>Student: I just, I guess I just don't see how it isn't, you know, clinically dead. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.94" data-time="188.71">[03:08.71]</span>Professor: Well, that's the amazing thing and how it revives is <span class="highlight">pretty</span> amazing too. <span class="time" data-times="14.42" data-time="192.65">[03:12.65]</span>After months without a heartbeat, <span class="highlight">spring</span> time came around again, the earth starts to warm up and suddenly one day, ping, a <span class="highlight">pulse</span>, followed by another one, then another until maybe ten, twelve hours later, the animal is fully recovered. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.49" data-time="207.07">[03:27.07]</span>Student: And does the thawing <span class="highlight">process</span> have some kind of <span class="highlight">trigger</span> as well? </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="11.13" data-time="211.56">[03:31.56]</span>Professor: Well, we are not sure actually, the clearer thing is <span class="highlight">even</span> though the sun is warning the frog up on the outside, its inside <span class="highlight">thaw</span> out first, the heart and brain and everything. <span class="time" data-times="3.35" data-time="222.69">[03:42.69]</span>But somehow it all just happens that way every <span class="highlight">spring</span>. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.29" data-time="226.04">[03:46.04]</span>Student: But after they <span class="highlight">thaw</span> does it <span class="highlight">affect</span> them like their <span class="highlight">lifespan</span>? </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="11.66" data-time="229.33">[03:49.33]</span>Professor: Well, hmm, we really don't know a lot about how long a wood frog <span class="highlight">normally</span> lives, probably just a few years but there is no <span class="highlight">evidence</span> its <span class="highlight">longevity</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.45" data-time="240.99">[04:00.99]</span>It does have some other impacts though. <span class="time" data-times="6.84" data-time="243.44">[04:03.44]</span>In studies, we found that when it comes to <span class="highlight">reproduction</span>, freezing diminishes the mating performance of males. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.25" data-time="250.28">[04:10.28]</span>After they've been frozen and thawed of <span class="highlight">course</span>, they don't <span class="highlight">seem</span> quite as <span class="highlight">vocal</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.91" data-time="255.53">[04:15.53]</span>They move slower and they <span class="highlight">seem</span> to have a harder time recognizing a <span class="highlight">potential</span> <span class="highlight">mate</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="260.44">[04:20.44]</span>So if the <span class="highlight">male</span> frog could <span class="highlight">manage</span> not to go <span class="highlight">through</span> this freezing <span class="highlight">cycle</span>, he'd probably have more success in mating. </p>

              <p>Student: A solution of antifreeze like you put in your car in the winter? Professor: Well, you tell me. In frogs, the extra glucose makes it harder for the winter inside the cells to freeze. So the cells stay just slightly wet, Enough so that they can survive the winter. Then after that, the heart stops beating altogether. So is that the same?</p>
              <p>Just tell me you can not choose the answer. The Professor said a bunch of words to guide students in distinguishing the difference between the physiological phenomenon of woodfrog's antifreeze and put the car in the winter. The purpose is to allow students to conclusion based on her tips. Answer selection B</p>
