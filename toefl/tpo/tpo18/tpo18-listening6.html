            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.88" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in a <span class="underline">biology</span> class. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.83" data-time="4.88">[00:04.88]</span>Professor: Well, it's finally looking like <span class="underline">spring</span> is arriving. <span class="time" data-times="3.2" data-time="8.71">[00:08.71]</span>The last of the winter snow would be <span class="underline">melting</span> away in a few days. <span class="time" data-times="11.47" data-time="11.91">[00:11.91]</span>So before we close today, I thought I'd <span class="underline">mention</span> a biological event that's a part of the <span class="underline">transition</span> from winter to <span class="underline">spring</span>, something you can go outside and watch if you have some patience. <span class="time" data-times="3.66" data-time="23.38">[00:23.38]</span>There is a small creature that lives in this area; you've probably seen it. <span class="time" data-times="3.37" data-time="27.04">[00:27.04]</span>It's the North American wood frog. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.98" data-time="30.41">[00:30.41]</span>Now the wood frog's not that easy tosspot since it stays <span class="underline">pretty</span> to close to the ground, under leaves and things and it blends in really well with its background as you can see. <span class="time" data-times="7.5" data-time="41.39">[00:41.39]</span>But they are <span class="underline">worth</span> the effort because they do something very unusual, something you might not have <span class="underline">even</span> thought possible. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.51" data-time="48.89">[00:48.89]</span>OK. North American wood frogs live over a very <span class="underline">broad</span> <span class="underline">territory</span> or <span class="underline">range</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.42" data-time="56.4">[00:56.40]</span>They're found all over the northeastern United States and all <span class="underline">through</span> Canada and Alaska, <span class="underline">even</span> inside the <span class="underline">Arctic</span> Circle. <span class="time" data-times="3.5" data-time="62.82">[01:02.82]</span>No other frog is able to live that far and north. <span class="time" data-times="14.72" data-time="66.32">[01:06.32]</span>But wherever they live, once the weather starts to turn cold and the <span class="underline">temperature</span> starts to <span class="underline">drop</span> below freezing, as soon as the frog <span class="underline">even</span> touches an ice <span class="underline">crystal</span> or a bit of frozen ground, well, it begins to <span class="underline">freeze</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.08" data-time="81.04">[01:21.04]</span>Yeah...yes to me. <span class="time" data-times="3.01" data-time="83.12">[01:23.12]</span>You look a little bit taken aback. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.67" data-time="86.13">[01:26.13]</span>Student: Wait, you mean it's still alive but it freezes, <span class="underline">solid</span>? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.52" data-time="90.8">[01:30.80]</span>Professor: Well, almost. <span class="time" data-times="3.87" data-time="92.32">[01:32.32]</span>Ice forms in all the spaces outside the cells but never <span class="underline">within</span> a <span class="underline">cell</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.5" data-time="96.19">[01:36.19]</span>Student: But... then how does its heart <span class="underline">beat</span>? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.18" data-time="98.69">[01:38.69]</span>Professor: It doesn't. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.48" data-time="99.87">[01:39.87]</span>Student: But...then how could it....... </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1" data-time="101.35">[01:41.35]</span>Professor: You are <span class="underline">gonna</span> do such a thing? <span class="time" data-times="5.8" data-time="102.35">[01:42.35]</span>Well, that first touch of ice apparently triggers a biological <span class="underline">response</span> inside the frog. <span class="time" data-times="16.82" data-time="108.15">[01:48.15]</span>That first of all starts drawing water away from the center of its body, so the middle part of the frog, its <span class="underline">internal</span> organs, its heart, lungs, liver, these start getting drier and drier while the water that's being pulled away is forming a <span class="underline">puddle</span> around the organs just <span class="underline">underneath</span> the skin. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3" data-time="124.97">[02:04.97]</span>And then that <span class="underline">puddle</span> of water starts to <span class="underline">freeze</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.63" data-time="127.97">[02:07.97]</span>OK, up to known, the frog's heart is still beating, right? <span class="time" data-times="12.64" data-time="132.6">[02:12.60]</span>Slower and slower but...and in those last few hours before it freezes, it distributes <span class="underline">glucose</span>, a blood sugar <span class="underline">throughout</span> its body, its <span class="underline"><span class="underline">circulatory</span></span> system, <span class="underline">sort</span> of acts like an antifreeze. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.19" data-time="145.24">[02:25.24]</span>Student: A <span class="underline">solution</span> of antifreeze like you put in your car in the winter? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.5" data-time="148.43">[02:28.43]</span>Professor: Well, you tell me. <span class="time" data-times="5.3" data-time="150.93">[02:30.93]</span>In frogs, the <span class="underline">extra</span> <span class="underline">glucose</span> makes it harder for the winter inside the cells to <span class="underline">freeze</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.05" data-time="156.23">[02:36.23]</span>So the cells stay just <span class="underline">slightly</span> wet, enough so that they can <span class="underline">survive</span> the winter. <span class="time" data-times="3.5" data-time="161.28">[02:41.28]</span>Then after that, the heart stops beating <span class="underline">altogether</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.38" data-time="164.78">[02:44.78]</span>So is that the same? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.56" data-time="167.16">[02:47.16]</span>Student: I don't really know, but how long does it stay that way? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.82" data-time="172.72">[02:52.72]</span>Professor: Well, it could be days or months, all winter in fact but umm, see the heart really doesn't need to do any pumping now because the blood is frozen too. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.17" data-time="182.54">[03:02.54]</span>Student: I just, I guess I just don't see how it isn't, you know, clinically dead. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.94" data-time="188.71">[03:08.71]</span>Professor: Well, that's the amazing thing and how it revives is <span class="underline">pretty</span> amazing too. <span class="time" data-times="14.42" data-time="192.65">[03:12.65]</span>After months without a heartbeat, <span class="underline">spring</span> time came around again, the earth starts to warm up and suddenly one day, ping, a <span class="underline">pulse</span>, followed by another one, then another until maybe ten, twelve hours later, the animal is fully recovered. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.49" data-time="207.07">[03:27.07]</span>Student: And does the thawing <span class="underline">process</span> have some kind of <span class="underline">trigger</span> as well? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="11.13" data-time="211.56">[03:31.56]</span>Professor: Well, we are not sure actually, the clearer thing is <span class="underline">even</span> though the sun is warning the frog up on the outside, its inside <span class="underline">thaw</span> out first, the heart and brain and everything. <span class="time" data-times="3.35" data-time="222.69">[03:42.69]</span>But somehow it all just happens that way every <span class="underline">spring</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.29" data-time="226.04">[03:46.04]</span>Student: But after they <span class="underline">thaw</span> does it <span class="underline">affect</span> them like their <span class="underline">lifespan</span>? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="11.66" data-time="229.33">[03:49.33]</span>Professor: Well, hmm, we really don't know a lot about how long a wood frog <span class="underline">normally</span> lives, probably just a few years but there is no <span class="underline">evidence</span> its <span class="underline">longevity</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.45" data-time="240.99">[04:00.99]</span>It does have some other impacts though. <span class="time" data-times="6.84" data-time="243.44">[04:03.44]</span>In studies, we found that when it comes to <span class="underline">reproduction</span>, freezing diminishes the mating performance of males. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.25" data-time="250.28">[04:10.28]</span>After they've been frozen and thawed of <span class="underline">course</span>, they don't <span class="underline">seem</span> quite as <span class="underline">vocal</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.91" data-time="255.53">[04:15.53]</span>They move slower and they <span class="underline">seem</span> to have a harder time recognizing a <span class="underline">potential</span> <span class="underline">mate</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="260.44">[04:20.44]</span>So if the <span class="underline">male</span> frog could <span class="underline">manage</span> not to go <span class="underline">through</span> this freezing <span class="underline">cycle</span>, he'd probably have more success in mating. </p>
