The electrical <span class="highlight">discharge</span> takes place when the <span class="highlight">attractive</span><span class="highlight">tension</span> between a <span class="highlight">region</span> of negatively charged particles and a <span class="highlight">region</span> of positively charged particles becomes so great that the charged particles suddenly <span class="highlight">rush</span> together. The coming together of the oppositely charged particles neutralizes the electrical <span class="highlight">tension</span> and releases a <span class="highlight"><span class="question2">tremendous</span></span><span class="highlight">amount</span> of energy, which we see as <span class="highlight">lightning</span>. The separation of positively and negatively charged particles takes place during the <span class="highlight">development</span> of the storm cloud.</p><p>The separation of charged particles that forms in a storm cloud has a sandwich-like structure. Concentrations of positively charged particles develop at the top and bottom of the cloud, but the middle <span class="highlight">region</span> becomes negatively charged. Recent measurements made in the <span class="highlight">field</span> together with <span class="highlight">laboratory</span> simulations <span class="highlight">offer</span> a <span class="highlight">promising</span> explanation of how this structure of charged particles forms. What happens is that small (millimeter-to centimeter-size) pellets of ice form in the cold upper regions of the cloud. When these ice pellets fall, some of them <span class="highlight">strike</span> much smaller ice crystals in the center of the cloud. The <span class="highlight">temperature</span> at the center of the cloud is about -15? or <span class="highlight">lower</span>. At such temperatures, the <span class="highlight">collision</span> between the ice pellets and the ice crystals causes electrical charges to <span class="highlight">shift</span> so that the ice pellets <span class="highlight"><span class="question4">acquire</span></span> a <span class="highlight">negative</span> charge and the ice crystals become positively charged. Then <span class="highlight">updraft</span> wind currents carry the light, positively charged ice crystals up to the top of the cloud. The heavier negatively charged ice pellets are left to <span class="highlight">concentrate</span> in the center. This <span class="highlight">process</span> explains why the top of the cloud becomes positively charged, while the center becomes negatively charged. The negatively charged <span class="highlight">region</span> is large: several hundred meters thick and several kilometers in <span class="highlight">diameter</span>. Below this large, cold, negatively charged <span class="highlight">region</span>, the cloud is warmer than -15?, and at these temperatures, collisions between ice crystals and falling ice pellets produce positively charged ice pellets that then <span class="highlight">populate</span> a small <span class="highlight">region</span> at the <span class="highlight">base</span> of the cloud.</p><p>Most <span class="highlight">lightning</span> takes place <span class="highlight">within</span> a cloud when the charge separation <span class="highlight">within</span> the cloud collapses. However, as the storm cloud develops, the ground <span class="highlight">beneath</span> the cloud becomes positively charged and <span class="highlight">lightning</span> can take place in the form of an electrical <span class="highlight">discharge</span> between the <span class="highlight">negative</span> charge of the cloud and the positively charged ground. <span class="question8"><span class="highlight">Lightning</span> that strikes the ground is the most likely to be <span class="highlight">destructive</span></span>, so <span class="highlight">even</span> though it represents only 20 percent of all <span class="highlight">lightning</span>, it has received a lot of <span class="highlight">scientific</span><span class="highlight">attention</span>.</p><p>Using high-speed <span class="highlight">photography</span>, scientists have <span class="highlight">determined</span> that there are two steps to the <span class="highlight">occurrence</span> of <span class="highlight">lightning</span> from a cloud to the ground. First, a <span class="highlight">channel</span>, or <span class="highlight">path</span>, is formed that connects the cloud and the ground. Then a strong <span class="highlight">current</span> of electrons follows that <span class="highlight">path</span> from the cloud to the ground, and it is that <span class="highlight">current</span> that <span class="question9">illuminates</span> the <span class="highlight">channel</span> as the <span class="highlight">lightning</span> we see.</p><p>The <span class="highlight">formation</span> of the <span class="highlight">channel</span> is <span class="question12">initiated</span> when electrons <span class="highlight">surge</span> from the cloud <span class="highlight">base</span> toward the ground. When a <span class="highlight">stream</span> of these negatively charged electrons comes <span class="highlight">within</span> 
100 meters of the ground it is met by a <span class="highlight">stream</span> of positively charged particles that comes up from the ground. When the negatively and positively charged streams meet, 
a complete <span class="highlight">channel</span> connecting the cloud and the ground is formed. The <span class="highlight">channel</span> is only a few centimeters in <span class="highlight">diameter</span>, but that is wide enough for electrons to follow the 
<span class="highlight">channel</span> to the ground in the <span class="highlight">visible</span> form of a <span class="highlight">flash</span> of <span class="highlight">lightning</span>. The <span class="highlight">stream</span> of <span class="highlight">positive</span> particles that meets the <span class="highlight">surge</span> of electrons from the cloud often arises from a 
tall <span class="highlight">pointed</span> structure such as a metal flagpole or a tower. That is why the <span class="highlight">subsequent</span><span class="highlight">lightning</span> that follows the completed <span class="highlight">channel</span> often strikes a tall structure. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span></p><p>Once a <span class="highlight">channel</span> has been formed, it is usually used by several <span class="highlight">lightning</span> discharges, each of them consisting of a <span class="highlight">stream</span> of electrons from the cloud meeting a 
<span class="highlight">stream</span> of <span class="highlight">positive</span> particles <span class="highlight">along</span> the established <span class="highlight">path</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>Sometimes, however, a <span class="highlight">stream</span> of electrons following an established <span class="highlight">channel</span> is met by a <span class="highlight">positive</span><span class="highlight">stream</span> making 
a new <span class="highlight">path</span> up from the ground. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>The result is a forked <span class="highlight">lightning</span> that strikes the ground in two places. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 1, all of the following take place in the development of a flash of lightening EXCEPT</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. great tension between two oppositely charged regions</p><p>B. an increase in negatively charged particles over positively charged particles</p><p>C. oppositely charged particles coming together</p><p>D. the release of electrical energy in the form of visible light</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B EXCEPT questions, exclusion method, A's tension and keyword positioning to the second sentence, correct, not selected; B's negatively and positively charged particles are also positioned to the second sentence, but the original is not compared, so B did not say, choose ; C's come together and D's release do keyword positioning to the penultimate sentence, are correct, not selected.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question2">tremendous</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. distinct</p><p>B. growing</p><p>C. huge</p><p>D. immediate</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" C"><p>C huge: A lot, huge. A is obvious, unique; B is increasing; C is huge; D is immediate. So the correct answer is huge.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph2, what causes ice crystal to become positively charged?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Collisions with ice pellets</p><p>B. Collisions with negatively charged ice crystals at the base of the cloud</p><p>C. Becoming concentrated in the central region of the cloud</p><p>D. Forming at a temperature greater than -15?</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A, with ice crystal and positively charged keyword positioning to the seventh sentence, said that at this temperature, the collision of ice pellet and ice crystal transfers the charge, causing the pellet to be negatively charged and the crystal is positively charged, so the answer should be A Collision; B, although it also speaks of a collision, does not collide with negative electricity; the temperature of D is not a positively charged decision.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question4">acquire</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. reject</p><p>B. obtain</p><p>C. need</p><p>D. produce</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>B <span class="question4">acquire</span>: Get. A is rejected; B is obtained; C is needed; D is production. So the answer is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph2, why are positively charged ice pellets produced in the lower part of the cloud?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Collisions between ice crystals and ice pellets increase in number in the lower part of the cloud.</p><p>B. The lower part of the cloud is smaller than the region above it.</p><p>C. More ice pellets than ice crystals reach the lower part of the cloud.</p><p>D. Temperature in the lower part of the cloud are warmer than -15?.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D. Positioned to the last sentence with positively charged ice pellets, said that under this large, negatively charged zone, the collision produced positively charged pellets, so the answer was D. A's increase in number, B's smaller and C comparison of the original did not say.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph2, the middle region of a cloud becomes negatively charged due to all of the following EXCEPT</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. a shift of electrical charged between ice pellets and ice crystals</p><p>B. negatively charged ice pellets that remain in the middle</p><p>C. a temperature of -15? or less</p><p>D. the development of a positive charge at the base of the cloud</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D EXCEPT questions, exclusion method, A's ice pellets and ice crystals do keyword positioning to the seventh sentence, correct, not selected; B's in the middle keyword positioning to the fourth last sentence, correct, not selected; C Numbers are keyword-targeted to the sixth sentence, correct, not selected; D's base of the cloud does keyword positioning until the last sentence, but the penultimate sentence has already said this process explains, that is to say, the reason is to the last After three sentences are finished, D is not the cause, wrong, or election.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>It can be inferred from paragraph 2 that part of the reason that the top of a storm cloud becomes positively charged is that</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. the top of the cloud is warmer than the middle of the cloud</p><p>B. the middle of the cloud is already occupied by positively charged particles</p><p>C. the negatively charged ice pellets are too heavy to be carried by the updrafts that move ice crystals</p><p>D. collisions between ice pellets in the top of the cloud produce mainly positively charged particles</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Use the top of the storm cloud keywords to locate the penultimate sentence:</p><p>Then updraft wind currents carry the light, positively charged ice crystals up to the top of the cloud.</p><p>The upward flow of air brings light, positively charged particles to the upper part of the clouds. This is naturally the reason why the upper clouds are positively charged. Conversely, particles with negative charge are heavy, so they do not come up. So the answer is C. The original only stated the temperature in the middle and the lower part. The upper temperature had no information, so A was wrong. From the fourth sentence of the countdown, we can see that the middle part was negatively charged, and B said it was the opposite; the D text did not say either.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The author remarks that "<span class="highlight">Lightning that strikes the ground is the most likely to be destructive</span>" in order to explain why</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. this form of lightning has been investigated so much</p><p>B. this form of lightning is not as common as lightning within a cloud</p><p>C. scientific understanding of this form of lightning is important</p><p>D. the buildup of positive charge on the ground beneath a storm cloud can have serious consequences</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="Lightning that strikes the ground is the most likely to be destructive A"><p>The last sentence of the A paragraph and the latter half of the phrase "It has received a lot of scientific attention." This form of lightning has received a lot of scientific attention. Only when the options are met, the rest of the options do not match.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question9">illuminates</span></span>" in the passage is closet in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. opens</p><p>B. completes</p><p>C. lights</p><p>D. electrifies</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" C"><p>C illuminate glows and shines, so C's light is the correct answer. The original sentence said that a strong stream of electrons went along the path from the clouds to the ground, and that the path had become what we saw as lightning. If it doesn't illuminate, how can we see lightning? So C is correct; A opens B to complete D so that no charge can be interpreted and seen, so it is not correct.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph5, which of the following is true of the stream of charged particles from the ground?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It prevents streams of electrons from the cloud from striking the ground.</p><p>B. It completes a channel that connects the storm cloud with the ground.</p><p>C. It produces a stream of electrons from the cloud.</p><p>D. It widens the path made by the initial stream of electrons from the cloud.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B. Position the stream of particles from the ground to the second sentence, saying that negatively charged electrons from the ground will encounter positively charged electrons from the clouds about 100 meters above the ground, and then say When the two touched each other, they formed a pathway, so B formed the pathway is correct. A's prevent, C's produce, and D's widen did not say anything.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the following claims about lightning strikes can be inferred from paragraph 5?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. During a lightning strike the diameter of the channel the electrons follow is considerably enlarged beyond a few centimeters.</p><p>B. A building is unlikely to be hit by lightning unless it is at least 100 meters tall.</p><p>C. A building is hit by a lightning strike because the building itself has first determined the path the lightening then takes to it.</p><p>D. The light of a lightning strike first appears at the point where the streams of negative and positive particles meet.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C. Therefore, the keyword is more difficult to find, so use the exclusion method. A's diameter of the channel and centimeter do keyword positioning to the fourth sentence, but the original text has no information to launch widen, so A mistakes; B's number is targeted to the second sentence, saying that the positive and negative charges within 100 meters will touch To, so B goes against; C's path is targeted to the channel of the last sentence, saying that the positive charge usually rises from a high point on the ground, such as a flagpole, and then the lightning reaches the ground by the path, ie the height of the flagpole The building is part of this channel, so C said building decided that the path is correct; there is no information on the first occurrence of D.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question12">initiated</span></span>" is closet in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. started</p><p>B. intensified</p><p>C. finished</p><p>D. expected</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" A"><p>A,initiate: Start. A is the beginning, B is the reinforcement; C is the completion; D is the hope, the expectation. So the correct answer is A.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The descending stream of electrons divides at the point where the new positive-stream channel intersects the established path..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C Two transition points, noun established path and verb divide, according to the established path can determine the answer is A / B / C, note that the established channel and established path is a synonym, so do not forget the C answer, according to the divide and the last sentence forked The synonym substitutions determine C or D, so C is the answer.</p></div></div><div id="question14" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>
Lightning takes place when a separation of a positive and negative electrical particles that develops in a storm could suddenly collapses.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.A storm cloud first develops a positively charged layer at the top, then a negatively charged middle layer, and finally, a positively charged layer at the bottom.</p><p>B.Lightning from cloud to ground follows a channel that forms when a stream of electrons moving down meets a stream of positive particles coming up from the ground.</p><p>C.Lightning from a cloud to the ground is more likely to be destructive than is lightning that takes place within a cloud.</p><p>D.A separation of oppositely charged particles in clouds develops from collisions of falling ice pellets with ice crystals, from updrafts and from temperature variations.</p><p>E.Field studies laboratory simulations, and high-speed photography have all been used to investigate the way charge separations develop in clouds.</p><p>F.Once a channel has been formed, it is usually used by several successive electrical discharges that illuminate the channel as flashes of lightning.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="BDF"><p>BDF A storm option is obviously wrong, because the positive and negative charges are formed at the same time, there is no precedence and no choice.
