            <b>Lightning</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>
            <span class="underline">Lightning</span> is a <span class="underline">brilliant</span> <span class="underline">flash</span> of light produced by an electrical <span class="underline">discharge</span> from a storm cloud. The electrical <span class="underline">discharge</span> takes place when the <span class="underline">attractive</span> <span class="underline">tension</span> between a <span class="underline">region</span> of negatively charged particles and a <span class="underline">region</span> of positively charged particles becomes so great that the charged particles suddenly <span class="underline">rush</span> together. The coming together of the oppositely charged particles neutralizes the electrical <span class="underline">tension</span> and releases a <span class="underline">tremendous</span> <span class="underline">amount</span> of energy, which we see as <span class="underline">lightning</span>. The separation of positively and negatively charged particles takes place during the <span class="underline">development</span> of the storm cloud.</p>
          <p>The separation of charged particles that forms in a storm cloud has a sandwich-like structure. Concentrations of positively charged particles develop at the top and bottom of the cloud, but the middle <span class="underline">region</span> becomes negatively charged. Recent measurements made in the <span class="underline">field</span> together with <span class="underline">laboratory</span> simulations <span class="underline">offer</span> a <span class="underline">promising</span> explanation of how this structure of charged particles forms. What happens is that small (millimeter-to centimeter-size) pellets of ice form in the cold upper regions of the cloud. When these ice pellets fall, some of them <span class="underline">strike</span> much smaller ice crystals in the center of the cloud. The <span class="underline">temperature</span> at the center of the cloud is about -15? or <span class="underline">lower</span>. At such temperatures, the <span class="underline">collision</span> between the ice pellets and the ice crystals causes electrical charges to <span class="underline">shift</span> so that the ice pellets <span class="underline">acquire</span> a <span class="underline">negative</span> charge and the ice crystals become positively charged. Then <span class="underline">updraft</span> wind currents carry the light, positively charged ice crystals up to the top of the cloud. The heavier negatively charged ice pellets are left to <span class="underline">concentrate</span> in the center. This <span class="underline">process</span> explains why the top of the cloud becomes positively charged, while the center becomes negatively charged. The negatively charged <span class="underline">region</span> is large: several hundred meters thick and several kilometers in <span class="underline">diameter</span>. Below this large, cold, negatively charged <span class="underline">region</span>, the cloud is warmer than -15?, and at these temperatures, collisions between ice crystals and falling ice pellets produce positively charged ice pellets that then <span class="underline">populate</span> a small <span class="underline">region</span> at the <span class="underline">base</span> of the cloud.</p>
          <p>Most <span class="underline">lightning</span> takes place <span class="underline">within</span> a cloud when the charge separation <span class="underline">within</span> the cloud collapses. However, as the storm cloud develops, the ground <span class="underline">beneath</span> the cloud becomes positively charged and <span class="underline">lightning</span> can take place in the form of an electrical <span class="underline">discharge</span> between the <span class="underline">negative</span> charge of the cloud and the positively charged ground. <span class="underline">Lightning</span> that strikes the ground is the most likely to be <span class="underline">destructive</span>, so <span class="underline">even</span> though it represents only 20 percent of all <span class="underline">lightning</span>, it has received a lot of <span class="underline">scientific</span> <span class="underline">attention</span>.</p>
          <p>Using high-speed <span class="underline">photography</span>, scientists have <span class="underline">determined</span> that there are two steps to the <span class="underline">occurrence</span> of <span class="underline">lightning</span> from a cloud to the ground. First, a <span class="underline">channel</span>, or <span class="underline">path</span>, is formed that connects the cloud and the ground. Then a strong <span class="underline">current</span> of electrons follows that <span class="underline">path</span> from the cloud to the ground, and it is that <span class="underline">current</span> that illuminates the <span class="underline">channel</span> as the <span class="underline">lightning</span> we see.</p>
          <p>The <span class="underline">formation</span> of the <span class="underline">channel</span> is initiated when electrons <span class="underline">surge</span> from the cloud <span class="underline">base</span> toward the ground. When a <span class="underline">stream</span> of these negatively charged electrons comes <span class="underline">within</span> 
100 meters of the ground it is met by a <span class="underline">stream</span> of positively charged particles that comes up from the ground. When the negatively and positively charged streams meet, 
a complete <span class="underline">channel</span> connecting the cloud and the ground is formed. The <span class="underline">channel</span> is only a few centimeters in <span class="underline">diameter</span>, but that is wide enough for electrons to follow the 
<span class="underline">channel</span> to the ground in the <span class="underline">visible</span> form of a <span class="underline">flash</span> of <span class="underline">lightning</span>. The <span class="underline">stream</span> of <span class="underline">positive</span> particles that meets the <span class="underline">surge</span> of electrons from the cloud often arises from a 
tall <span class="underline">pointed</span> structure such as a metal flagpole or a tower. That is why the <span class="underline">subsequent</span> <span class="underline">lightning</span> that follows the completed <span class="underline">channel</span> often strikes a tall structure. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span></p>
          <p>Once a <span class="underline">channel</span> has been formed, it is usually used by several <span class="underline">lightning</span> discharges, each of them consisting of a <span class="underline">stream</span> of electrons from the cloud meeting a 
<span class="underline">stream</span> of <span class="underline">positive</span> particles <span class="underline">along</span> the established <span class="underline">path</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>Sometimes, however, a <span class="underline">stream</span> of electrons following an established <span class="underline">channel</span> is met by a <span class="underline">positive</span> <span class="underline">stream</span> making 
a new <span class="underline">path</span> up from the ground. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>The result is a forked <span class="underline">lightning</span> that strikes the ground in two places. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p>
