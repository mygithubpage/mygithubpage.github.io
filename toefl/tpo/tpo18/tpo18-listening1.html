        <h3>Listening Text</h3>
        <article>
          <p>Narrator: Listen to a conversation between a student and an administrator in the university employment office.</p>
          <p>:Student: Hi! I hope you can help me. I just transferred from Northeastern State University near Chicago.</p>
          <p>:Professor: Well welcome to Central University .But Chicago is such a great city. Why did you leave?</p>
          <p>:Student: Everyone asks that. It's my hometown. And it was sure convenient to go to a school nearby. But Northeastern is still fairly small. And it doesn't have the program I'm interested in. I want to major in international studies. And the only program in the State is here.</p>
          <p>:Professor: We do have a great program. Well how did you get interested in international studies?</p>
          <p>:Student: My family hosted a few foreign exchange students while I was growing up. Then I took part in an international summer program after I graduated from high school. I thought I really I like meeting people from all over, getting to know them.</p>
          <p>:Professor: OH! Ok! And that led you to our program. Right now though I think you are looking for a job.</p>
          <p>:Student: Yeah, a part time job on campus. I thought I'd save money, being away from the big city. But it doesn't seem to be working that way. Anyway I'm not having much luck.</p>
          <p>:Professor: I'm not surprised. Most of our campus jobs are taken in the first week or two of the semester. What work experience have you had?</p>
          <p>:Student: Well, I worked in the university library last year. But I already checked at the library here. They said their remaining positions were for work-study students getting financial aid. I've never run into that before.</p>
          <p>:Professor: Well, I guess each school has its own policies. Uh, we really don't have much right now.You might be better if you are waiting until next semester. If you really want something, how are your computer skills?</p>
          <p>:Student: About average I'd say. I helped teach some of the basic computer classes. Northeastern offers for new users, if that helps any.</p>
          <p>:Professor: OK, The technology support department needs people to work its helpdesk. [02:01.8]It's basically a customer service job, answering questions, helping people solve their computer problems, give you a chance to develop your people skills.</p>
          <p>:Student: Something every diplomat needs. But is there some problem? I mean why is the job still open?</p>
          <p>:Professor: Well, they have extended hours, from 6 am to 2 am every day. So they need a large staff. But right now they only need people early mornings, late nights, and weekends. You'd probably end up with a bit of everything rather than a regular spot. On the bright side you'll probably be able to get some studying done between calls. At least it could be a start and then you can try for better hours next semester.</p>
          <p>:Student: Um, I see why the hours might be a problem. But I guess I can't afford to be too picky if I want a job. Still maybe we can work something out. </p>
