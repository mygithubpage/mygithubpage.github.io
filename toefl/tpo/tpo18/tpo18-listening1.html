          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.13" data-time="7.72">[00:07.72]</span>Student: Hi! I hope you can help me. <span class="time" data-times="3.89" data-time="9.85">[00:09.85]</span>I just transferred from Northeastern <span class="highlight">State</span> University near Chicago. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.25" data-time="13.74">[00:13.74]</span>Professor: Well welcome to Central University .<span class="time" data-times="2.01" data-time="15.99">[00:15.99]</span>But Chicago is such a great city. <span class="time" data-times="0.89" data-time="18">[00:18.00]</span>Why did you leave? </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.09" data-time="18.89">[00:18.89]</span>Student: Everyone asks that. <span class="time" data-times="1.15" data-time="19.98">[00:19.98]</span>It's my hometown. <span class="time" data-times="3.5" data-time="21.13">[00:21.13]</span>And it was sure <span class="highlight">convenient</span> to go to a school nearby. <span class="time" data-times="3.09" data-time="24.63">[00:24.63]</span>But Northeastern is still <span class="highlight">fairly</span> small. <span class="time" data-times="2.4" data-time="27.72">[00:27.72]</span>And it doesn't have the program I'm interested in. <span class="time" data-times="2.66" data-time="30.12">[00:30.12]</span>I want to <span class="highlight">major</span> in international studies. <span class="time" data-times="2.04" data-time="32.78">[00:32.78]</span>And the only program in the <span class="highlight">State</span> is here. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.91" data-time="34.82">[00:34.82]</span>Professor: We do have a great program. <span class="time" data-times="2.87" data-time="36.73">[00:36.73]</span>Well how did you get interested in international studies? </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4" data-time="39.6">[00:39.60]</span>Student: My family hosted a few foreign <span class="highlight">exchange</span> students while I was growing up. <span class="time" data-times="5.28" data-time="43.6">[00:43.60]</span>Then I took part in an international summer program after I graduated from high school. <span class="time" data-times="4.12" data-time="48.88">[00:48.88]</span>I thought I really I like meeting people from all over, getting to know them. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.99" data-time="53">[00:53.00]</span>Professor: OH! Ok! And that led you to our program. <span class="time" data-times="3.54" data-time="55.99">[00:55.99]</span>Right now though I think you are looking for a job. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.2" data-time="59.53">[00:59.53]</span>Student: Yeah, a part time job on <span class="highlight">campus</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.52" data-time="61.73">[01:01.73]</span>I thought I'd <span class="highlight">save</span> money, being away from the big city. <span class="time" data-times="2.98" data-time="65.25">[01:05.25]</span>But it doesn't <span class="highlight">seem</span> to be working that way. <span class="time" data-times="1.83" data-time="68.23">[01:08.23]</span>Anyway I'm not having much luck. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.57" data-time="70.06">[01:10.06]</span>Professor: I'm not surprised. <span class="time" data-times="3.92" data-time="71.63">[01:11.63]</span>Most of our <span class="highlight">campus</span> jobs are taken in the first week or two of the <span class="highlight">semester</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.48" data-time="75.55">[01:15.55]</span>What work experience have you had? </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.64" data-time="78.03">[01:18.03]</span>Student: Well, I worked in the university library last year. <span class="time" data-times="2.97" data-time="81.67">[01:21.67]</span>But I already <span class="highlight">checked</span> at the library here. <span class="time" data-times="5.1" data-time="84.64">[01:24.64]</span>They said their <span class="highlight">remaining</span> positions were for work-study students getting <span class="highlight">financial</span> aid. <span class="time" data-times="1.79" data-time="89.74">[01:29.74]</span>I've never run into that before. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.88" data-time="91.53">[01:31.53]</span>Professor: Well, I guess each school has its own policies. <span class="time" data-times="4.18" data-time="94.41">[01:34.41]</span>Uh, we really don't have much right now.<span class="time" data-times="3.22" data-time="98.59">[01:38.59]</span>You might be better if you are waiting until next <span class="highlight">semester</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.1" data-time="101.81">[01:41.81]</span>If you really want something, how are your computer skills? </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.93" data-time="107.91">[01:47.91]</span>Student: About <span class="highlight">average</span> I'd say. <span class="time" data-times="2.76" data-time="109.84">[01:49.84]</span>I helped teach some of the <span class="highlight">basic</span> computer classes. <span class="time" data-times="3.12" data-time="112.6">[01:52.60]</span>Northeastern offers for new users, if that helps any. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.36" data-time="115.72">[01:55.72]</span>Professor: OK, The technology support <span class="highlight">department</span> needs people to work its helpdesk. <span class="time" data-times="8.82" data-time="121.08">[02:01.8]</span>It's basically a customer service job, answering questions, helping people solve their computer problems, give you a <span class="highlight">chance</span> to develop your people skills. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.97" data-time="129.9">[02:09.90]</span>Student: Something every <span class="highlight">diplomat</span> needs. <span class="time" data-times="1.69" data-time="131.87">[02:11.87]</span>But is there some problem? <span class="time" data-times="2.35" data-time="133.56">[02:13.56]</span>I mean why is the job still open? </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.86" data-time="135.91">[02:15.91]</span>Professor: Well, they have extended hours, from 6 am to 2 am every day. <span class="time" data-times="2.04" data-time="140.77">[02:20.77]</span>So they need a large <span class="highlight">staff</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.56" data-time="142.81">[02:22.81]</span>But right now they only need people early mornings, late nights, and weekends. <span class="time" data-times="3.7" data-time="147.37">[02:27.37]</span>You'd probably end up with a bit of everything rather than a <span class="highlight">regular</span> <span class="highlight">spot</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.32" data-time="151.07">[02:31.07]</span>On the bright side you'll probably be able to get some studying done between calls. <span class="time" data-times="4.65" data-time="155.39">[02:35.39]</span>At <span class="highlight">least</span> it could be a start and then you can try for better hours next <span class="highlight">semester</span>. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.85" data-time="160.04">[02:40.04]</span>Student: Um, I see why the hours might be a problem. <span class="time" data-times="4.29" data-time="162.89">[02:42.89]</span>But I guess I can't <span class="highlight">afford</span> to be too <span class="highlight">picky</span> if I want a job. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="167.18">[02:47.18]</span>Still maybe we can work something out. </p>
