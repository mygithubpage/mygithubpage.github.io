To apply for a work-study job.</p><p>B. To get information about hosting an exchange student.</p><p>C. To find out if there are any jobs available on campus.</p><p>D. To find out the hours of the computer lab.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Student: Yeah, a part time job on campus.</p><p>The professor said I think you are looking for a job now. The student answers yeah! When I heard this, in fact, C's answer is already obvious. A part time job on campus and work-study job are synonymous.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why did the student transfer to Central University?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To take advantage of an academic program.</p><p>B. To participate in a student exchange program.</p><p>C. To attend a smaller university than the one he was at before.</p><p>D. To benefit from Central University's international reputation.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>And it doesn't have the program I'm interested in. I want to major in international studies. And the only program in the State is here.</p><p>The professor asked the students why he wanted to come to Central University. The student said that Northeastern did not have his favorite major.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the student mention hosting foreign-exchange students?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To explain his interest in a particular field of study.</p><p>B. To explain why he is looking for a job so late in the semester.</p><p>C. To explain why he would like to be an exchange student the following year.</p><p>D. To explain how he learned his computer skills.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>I thought I really I like meeting people from all over, getting to know them</p><p>Professor's questions will usually be test centers. Whenever you hear the question of pro, below you should concentrate on listening to the student's answer. The answer is still very clear. The student mentioned his previous experience to explain his interest in International studies. So choose A.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What can be inferred about students who apply for the open position at the technology-support helpdesk?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They must be enrolled in a computer course.</p><p>B. They will only be able to work on weekends.</p><p>C. They are willing to work many hours each day they work.</p><p>D. They are willing to work irregular hours.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>You'd probably end up with a bit of everything rather than a regular spot student wondering why tech-support's work is still there? You hear many time periods such as early mornings, late nights can also infer irregular working hours so choose D.</p></div></div><div class="replay" id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the woman say this?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To dissuade the student from starting a job right away.</p><p>B. To suggest looking for an off-campus job.</p><p>C. To imply that the student might not like the job that is available.</p><p>D. To encourage the student to apply to a work-study program.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>If you really want something</p><p>This question is combined with the context. Before the student said that he was looking for a part-time job, the library wouldn't want people. The professor also stated that campus jobs are usually picked up two weeks before school starts. Therefore, the work of offering men to her behind should not be very good either. So choose C.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
