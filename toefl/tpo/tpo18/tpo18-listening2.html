The importance of record keeping in the development of hypotheses.</p><p>B. The relationship between sunspots and Earth's geomagnetic cycle.</p><p>C. The progression of scientific knowledge about sunspots.</p><p>D. The effect of sunspots on Earth's climate.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Lecture is a study of sunspots and explains that this study continues to improve over time. First, the Europeans judged on their own beliefs and then went to Galileo to observe through telescopes. Then challenged the two scholars. After years of research, they discovered that the number of sunspots and the geomagnetic cycle are consistent. The main purpose of Lecture is to say that mankind recognizes sunspots. The evolving process of knowledge. So choose C.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why did European astronomers before the time of Galileo not believe sunspots were on the Sun's surface?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They based their beliefs on earlier observations by Chinese astronomers.</p><p>B. The idea was contrary to their beliefs about objects in space.</p><p>C. The sunspots often changed their shape.</p><p>D. The sunspots were not always visible.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Pro: When later European astronomers wrote about sunspots, they didn't believe that the spots were actually on the Sun. That's because of their belief at the time that the heavenly bodies, the Sun, Moon, Stars, and Planets, were perfect, Without any flaws or blemishes.</p><p>That's because is a more obvious prompt. The "prejudice" of European astronauts for sunspots stems from their knowledge of celestial bodies. They have always believed that celestial bodies have no flaws. Of course, there can be no black spots on them.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which hypothesis regarding sunspots did Galileo challenge?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Sunspots are shadows of planets crossing the Sun.</p><p>B. Sunspots are clouds in the solar atmosphere.</p><p>C. Sunspots are evidence of the Sun's rotation.</p><p>D. Sunspots are evidence of magnetic fields.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>He pointed out the the shape of sunspots, well, the sunspots weren't circular.</p><p>Until is the subject of this question! When you hear this word, you can sort out the logic. The European astronaut's point of view continued until the invention of the telescope-a masterpiece of our old friend Galileo. It can be inferred that the birth of an astronomical telescope argued the former European astronaut's view of sunspots. So it is clear that choose A.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What was the importance of Schwabe's observations?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They determined the age of sunspots.</p><p>B. They established that sunspots appear in cycles.</p><p>C. They proved that sunspots were actually on the Sun.</p><p>D. They showed the reason that sunspots change their shape</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>In the end, there was no planet, but there was evidence that the number of sunspots increased and decreased in a pattern, a pattern that began repeating after 10 years, and that was a huge breakthrough</p><p>A great man appeared in 1843. He studied it for a long time. The blablabla is important above In the end and but there are usually test points after the general transition. Hear repeat after 10 years. Can be assured of choice B</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the professor's attitude toward Schwabe's and Wolf's research?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. He is surprised that the research is contradictory.</p><p>B. He is impressed by how many years were spent on the research.</p><p>C. He has difficulty believing that research should take so long.</p><p>D. He doubts that the research is given enough credit by modern astronomers.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>So Wolf did 40 years of research, and Trobe did 17 years of research. I think there is a lesson there. Anyway, Wolf went though all records from various observatories in Europe and put together a history of sunspot observations going back about 100 years</p><p>This subject mainly listens to tone. The professor read the two scholars' research time in 40 years and 17 years respectively. They all used heavy reading, which shows that he was very impressed with the research time of the two men. The C option is too extreme, and the article does not show that the author is unbelievable about the length of the study. So should choose B.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor imply about the discovery of a relationship between the sunspot cycle and Earth's geomagnetic cycle?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It proved that Galileo's cloud hypothesis was correct.</p><p>B. It showed how conditions on Earth can affect the Sun.</p><p>C. It was the start of modern astronomy.</p><p>D. It led to a period of intense scientific research.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>Suddenly, everyone was doing studies of the possible relationship between the Sun and the Earth.</p><p>It's a leading test for but! The discovery of the relationship between the sunspot cycle and the geomagnetic cycle has inspired the enthusiasm of scientists. Many people have studied this topic. The Everyone and Intense highlighted in the article echoed and the answer was D.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
