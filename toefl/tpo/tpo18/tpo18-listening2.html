              <span class="time" data-times="6.25" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in an <span class="underline">astronomy</span> class.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.82" data-time="6.25">[00:06.25]</span>Professor: We are going to start a study of sunspots today, and I think you'll find it rather interesting. <span class="time" data-times="6.63" data-time="12.07">[00:12.07]</span>Now I'm going to <span class="underline">assume</span> that you know that sunspots, in the most <span class="underline">basic</span> terms, are dark spots on the Sun's surface. <span class="time" data-times="1.62" data-time="18.7">[00:18.70]</span>That will do for now. <span class="time" data-times="6.66" data-time="20.32">[00:20.32]</span>The <span class="underline">ancient</span> Chinese were the first to <span class="underline">record</span> observations of sunspots as early as the year 165.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.8" data-time="26.98">[00:26.98]</span>When later European astronomers wrote about sunspots, they didn't believe that the spots were actually on the Sun. <span class="time" data-times="9.04" data-time="33.78">[00:33.78]</span>That's because of their belief at the time that the heavenly bodies, the Sun, Moon, Stars, and Planets, were <span class="underline">perfect</span>, without any flaws or blemishes. <span class="time" data-times="6.99" data-time="42.82">[00:42.82]</span>So the opinion was the spots were actually something else, like shadows of planets <span class="underline">crossing</span> the Sun's face. <span class="time" data-times="7.66" data-time="49.81">[00:49.81]</span>And this was the thinking of European astronomers until the <span class="underline">introduction</span> of the <span class="underline">telescope</span>, which brings us to our old friend, Galileo.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.7" data-time="57.47">[00:57.47]</span>In the early 1600s, based on his observations of sunspots. <span class="time" data-times="2.77" data-time="62.17">[01:02.17]</span>Galileo proposed a new <span class="underline">hypothesis</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.33" data-time="64.94">[01:04.94]</span>He <span class="underline">pointed</span> out that the <span class="underline">shape</span> of sunspots, well, the sunspots weren't <span class="underline">circular</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.6" data-time="70.27">[01:10.27]</span>If they were shadows of the planets, they would be <span class="underline">circular</span>, right? <span class="time" data-times="3.1" data-time="73.87">[01:13.87]</span>So that was a problem for the <span class="underline">prevailing</span> view. <span class="time" data-times="6.33" data-time="76.97">[01:16.97]</span>And he also noticed that the <span class="underline">shape</span> of the sunspots changed as they seemed to move <span class="underline">across</span> the Sun's surface.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.79" data-time="83.3">[01:23.30]</span>Maybe a <span class="underline">particular</span> sunspot was <span class="underline">sort</span> of <span class="underline">square</span>, then later it would become more lopsided, then later something else. <span class="time" data-times="7.25" data-time="91.09">[01:31.09]</span>So there is another problem with the shadow <span class="underline">hypothesis</span>, because the <span class="underline">shape</span> of a <span class="underline">planet</span> doesn't change. <span class="time" data-times="8.92" data-time="98.34">[01:38.34]</span>What Galileo proposed was that sunspots were indeed a feature of the Sun, but he didn't know what kind of feature.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="11.75" data-time="107.26">[01:47.26]</span>He proposed that they might be clouds in the <span class="underline">atmosphere</span>, the <span class="underline">solar</span> <span class="underline">atmosphere</span>, especially because they seemed to change <span class="underline">shape</span> and there was no predicting the changes, at <span class="underline">least</span> nothing Galileo could <span class="underline">figure</span> out. <span class="time" data-times="4.37" data-time="119.01">[01:59.01]</span>That <span class="underline">random</span> <span class="underline">shape</span> changing would be <span class="underline">consistent</span> with the spots being clouds.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.54" data-time="123.38">[02:03.38]</span>Over the next <span class="underline">couple</span> hundred years, a lot of hypotheses were tossed around. <span class="time" data-times="6.32" data-time="127.92">[02:07.92]</span>The spots were mountains or holes in the <span class="underline">solar</span> <span class="underline">atmosphere</span> <span class="underline">through</span> which the dark surface of the Sun could be seen. <span class="time" data-times="5.75" data-time="134.24">[02:14.24]</span>Then in 1843, <span class="underline">astronomer</span> named Heinrich Schwa be made an interesting <span class="underline">claim</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9.96" data-time="139.99">[02:19.99]</span>Trobe had been watching the Sun every day that it was <span class="underline">visible</span> for 17 years, looking for <span class="underline">evidence</span> of a new <span class="underline">planet</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.16" data-time="149.95">[02:29.95]</span>And he started keeping tracks of sunspots, mapping them, so he wouldn't confuse them, so he wouldn't confuse them with any <span class="underline">potential</span> new <span class="underline">planet</span>.<span class="time" data-times="13.71" data-time="156.11">[02:36.11]</span>In the end, there was no <span class="underline">planet</span>, but there was <span class="underline">evidence</span> that the number of sunspots increased and decreased in a <span class="underline">pattern</span>, a <span class="underline">pattern</span> that began repeating after 10 years, and that was a huge <span class="underline">breakthrough</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.13" data-time="169.82">[02:49.82]</span>Another <span class="underline">astronomer</span> named Wolf kept <span class="underline">track</span> of the Sun for an <span class="underline">even</span> longer period, 40 years actually.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.89" data-time="177.95">[02:57.95]</span>So Wolf did 40 years of research, and Trobe did 17 years of research. <span class="time" data-times="1.94" data-time="184.84">[03:04.84]</span>I think there is a lesson there. <span class="time" data-times="9.27" data-time="186.78">[03:06.78]</span>Anyway, Wolf went <span class="underline">through</span> all records from various observatories in Europe and put together a <span class="underline">history</span> of sunspot observations going back about 100 years. <span class="time" data-times="8.7" data-time="196.05">[03:16.05]</span>From this information, he was able to <span class="underline">confirm</span> the <span class="underline">existence</span> of a <span class="underline">pattern</span>, a repeating <span class="underline">cycle</span> but Wolf detected an 11-year cycles? <span class="time" data-times="1.12" data-time="204.75">[03:24.75]</span>Not a 10 year <span class="underline">cycle</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.51" data-time="205.87">[03:25.87]</span>11-year cycles? <span class="time" data-times="3.08" data-time="208.38">[03:28.38]</span>Does that <span class="underline">sound</span> <span class="underline">familiar</span> to anyone? No? <span class="time" data-times="8.62" data-time="211.46">[03:31.46]</span>Well, <span class="underline">geomagnetic</span> <span class="underline">activity</span>, the natural variations in Earth's <span class="underline">magnetic</span> <span class="underline">field</span>, it fluctuates in 11-year cycles.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="15.16" data-time="220.08">[03:40.08]</span>Well, we'll cover this later in this <span class="underline">semester</span>, but for now, well, scientists in the late 19th <span class="underline">century</span> were <span class="underline">aware</span> of <span class="underline">geomagnetic</span> cycles, so when they heard that the sunspots' <span class="underline">cycle</span> was also 11 years, well, they just had to find out what was going on. <span class="time" data-times="5.57" data-time="235.24">[03:55.24]</span>Suddenly, everyone was doing studies of the possible relationship between the Sun and the Earth. <span class="time" data-times="6.7" data-time="240.81">[04:00.81]</span>Did the sunspots cause the <span class="underline">geomagnetic</span> fields or did the <span class="underline">geomagnetic</span> fields cause the sunspots? <span class="time" data-times="2.61" data-time="247.51">[04:07.51]</span>Or is there some other thing that caused both?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.84" data-time="250.12">[04:10.12]</span>And astronomers did <span class="underline">eventually</span> <span class="underline">figure</span> out what sunspots had to do with <span class="underline">magnetic</span> fields. <span class="time" data-times="2.76" data-time="254.96">[04:14.96]</span>Actually, they are <span class="underline">magnetic</span> fields. <span class="time" data-times="4.81" data-time="257.72">[04:17.72]</span>And the fact that sunspots are <span class="underline">magnetic</span> fields accounts for their dark <span class="underline">appearance</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9.77" data-time="262.53">[04:22.53]</span>That's because <span class="underline">magnetic</span> fields reduce the <span class="underline">pressure</span> exerted on the gases inside of them, making the spots cooler than the rest of the Sun's surface. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="272.3">[04:32.30]</span>And since they are cooler, they are darker.</p>
