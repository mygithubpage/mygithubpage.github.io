            <span class="time" data-times="9.22" data-time="8.39">[00:08.39]</span>Professor: In order to really study the social <span class="highlight">history</span> of the Middle Ages, you have to understand the role of spices. <span class="time" data-times="4.44" data-time="17.61">[00:17.61]</span>Now, this might <span class="highlight">sound</span> a little spurring, <span class="highlight">even</span> a little strange. <span class="time" data-times="5.63" data-time="22.05">[00:22.05]</span>But what <span class="highlight">seem</span> like little things now were back then actually rather big things. <span class="time" data-times="3.51" data-time="27.68">[00:27.68]</span>So first let's <span class="highlight">define</span> what a <span class="highlight">spice</span> is. <span class="time" data-times="7.26" data-time="31.19">[00:31.19]</span>Technically speaking, a <span class="highlight">spice</span> is part of an aromatic plant that is not a leaf or <span class="highlight">herb</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="8.47" data-time="38.45">[00:38.45]</span>Spices can come from tree <span class="highlight">bark</span> like cinnamon, plant roots like ginger, flower buds like cloves. <span class="time" data-times="10.89" data-time="46.92">[00:46.92]</span>And in the Middle Ages, Europeans were <span class="highlight">familiar</span> with lots of different spices, most important being <span class="highlight">pepper</span>, cloves, ginger, cinnamon, <span class="highlight">maize</span> and nutmeg. <span class="time" data-times="9.4" data-time="57.81">[00:57.81]</span>These spices literarily dominated the way Europeans lived for centuries, how they traded and <span class="highlight">even</span> how they used their imaginations. <span class="time" data-times="4.2" data-time="67.21">[01:07.21]</span>So why this <span class="highlight">medieval</span> fascination with spices? <span class="time" data-times="3.9" data-time="71.41">[01:11.41]</span>We can boil it down to their general ideas <span class="highlight">briefly</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.61" data-time="75.31">[01:15.31]</span>One was <span class="highlight">cost</span> and rarity. <span class="time" data-times="3.56" data-time="77.92">[01:17.92]</span>Uh two was <span class="highlight">exotic</span> <span class="highlight">taste</span> and fragrance. <span class="time" data-times="5.23" data-time="81.48">[01:21.48]</span>And third, <span class="highlight">mysterious</span> origins and kinds of <span class="highlight">mythical</span> <span class="highlight">status</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.1" data-time="86.71">[01:26.71]</span>Now for <span class="highlight">cost</span> and rarity, spices aren't native to Europe and they had to be imported. <span class="time" data-times="6.11" data-time="92.81">[01:32.81]</span>Spices only grew in the East Indies and of <span class="highlight">course</span> <span class="highlight">transportation</span> costs were <span class="highlight">astronomical</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.93" data-time="98.92">[01:38.92]</span>So spices were incredibly <span class="highlight">valuable</span> <span class="highlight">even</span> from the very beginning.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.76" data-time="103.85">[01:43.85]</span>Here is an example. <span class="time" data-times="6.59" data-time="105.61">[01:45.61]</span>In 408 AD, the <span class="highlight">Gothic</span> General who captured Rome demanded payment. <span class="time" data-times="7.79" data-time="112.2">[01:52.20]</span>He <span class="highlight">wanted</span> 5000 pounds of gold among other things but he also <span class="highlight">wanted</span> 3000 pounds of <span class="highlight">pepper</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.3" data-time="119.99">[01:59.99]</span>Maybe that would give you an idea of exactly where <span class="highlight">pepper</span> stood at the time. <span class="time" data-times="10.76" data-time="124.29">[02:04.29]</span>By the Middle Ages, spices were regarded as so important and expensive they were used in diplomacy, as gifts by heads of <span class="highlight">state</span> and ambassadors.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.61" data-time="135.05">[02:15.05]</span>Now for the <span class="highlight">taste</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.79" data-time="137.66">[02:17.66]</span>The <span class="highlight">diet</span> then was <span class="highlight">relatively</span> <span class="highlight">bland</span>, compared to today's. <span class="time" data-times="1.36" data-time="141.45">[02:21.45]</span>There wasn't much <span class="highlight">variety</span>. <span class="time" data-times="12.18" data-time="142.81">[02:22.81]</span>Especially the <span class="highlight">aristocracy</span> who tended to eat a lot of meat, they were always looking for new ways to <span class="highlight">prepare</span> it, new sources, new tastes and this is where spices came in. <span class="time" data-times="4.68" data-time="154.99">[02:34.99]</span>Now, this is a good point to <span class="highlight">mention</span> one of the biggest myths about spices.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.44" data-time="159.67">[02:39.67]</span>It's commonly said that <span class="highlight">medieval</span> Europeans <span class="highlight">wanted</span> spices to cover up the <span class="highlight">taste</span> of spoiled meat. <span class="time" data-times="1.52" data-time="166.11">[02:46.11]</span>But this isn't really true. <span class="time" data-times="4.91" data-time="167.63">[02:47.63]</span>Anyone who had to worry about spoiled meat couldn't <span class="highlight">afford</span> spices in the first place. <span class="time" data-times="4.34" data-time="172.54">[02:52.54]</span>If you could <span class="highlight">afford</span>spices, you could <span class="highlight">definitely</span> <span class="highlight">afford</span> fresh meat.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="14.99" data-time="176.88">[02:56.88]</span>We also have <span class="highlight">evidence</span> that various <span class="highlight">medieval</span> markets employed a kind of police to make sure that people did not sell spoiled food, and if you were caught doing it, you were <span class="highlight">subject</span> to various fines, humiliating public punishments. <span class="time" data-times="8.78" data-time="191.87">[03:11.87]</span>So what actually was true was this: In order to have meat for the winter, people would <span class="highlight">preserve</span> it in salt, not a <span class="highlight">spice</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.68" data-time="200.65">[03:20.65]</span>Spices actually aren't very <span class="highlight">effective</span> as preservatives.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="10.01" data-time="204.33">[03:24.33]</span>And <span class="highlight">throughout</span> winter, they would eat salted meat, but the <span class="highlight">taste</span> of the <span class="highlight">stuff</span> could grow really boring and depressing after a while. <span class="time" data-times="10.69" data-time="214.34">[03:34.34]</span>So the cook started looking for new ways to <span class="highlight">improve</span> the <span class="highlight">taste</span> and spices were the answer, which brings us to <span class="highlight">mysterious</span> origins and <span class="highlight">mythical</span> <span class="highlight">status</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.91" data-time="225.03">[03:45.03]</span>Now the <span class="highlight">ancient</span> Romans had a thriving <span class="highlight">spice</span> <span class="highlight">trade</span> and they sent their ships to the east and back.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="11.89" data-time="231.94">[03:51.94]</span>But when Rome collapsed in the fifth <span class="highlight">century</span> and the Middle Ages began, direct <span class="highlight">trade</span> stopped, and so did that kind of hands-on knowledge of travel and geography. <span class="time" data-times="7.6" data-time="243.83">[04:03.83]</span>Spices now came by way of the <span class="highlight">trade</span> routes with lots of intermediaries between the producer and the consumer. <span class="time" data-times="4.54" data-time="251.43">[04:11.43]</span>So these spices took on an <span class="highlight">air</span> of mystery. <span class="time" data-times="8.31" data-time="255.97">[04:15.97]</span>Their origins were shrouded in <span class="highlight">exotic</span> travels. They had the <span class="highlight">allure</span> of the unknown, of wild places.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="7.52" data-time="264.28">[04:24.28]</span>Myths grew up of <span class="highlight">fantasy</span> lands, magical faraway places made <span class="highlight">entirely</span> of food and spices. <span class="time" data-times="12.23" data-time="271.8">[04:31.80]</span>And to that, spices themselves had always been considered <span class="highlight">special</span> or magical not just for eating and this was already true in the <span class="highlight">ancient</span> world where legends about spices were <span class="highlight">abundant</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.63" data-time="284.03">[04:44.03]</span>Spices inspired the <span class="highlight">medieval</span> imagination. <span class="time" data-times="5.64" data-time="287.66">[04:47.66]</span>They were used as medicines to ward off diseases, and mixed into perfumes, incent.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.61" data-time="293.3">[04:53.30]</span>They were used in <span class="highlight">religious</span> rituals for thousands of years. <span class="time" data-times="8.96" data-time="296.91">[04:56.91]</span>They took on a life of their own and they inspired the <span class="highlight">medieval</span> imagination, spurred on the age of discovery in the 145th and 16th centuries. <span class="time" data-times="9.72" data-time="305.87">[05:05.87]</span>When famous explorers like Columbus and da Gama and Magellan left Europe in their ships, they weren't looking for a new world; they were looking for spices. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="315.59">[05:15.59]</span>And we know what important historical repercussions some of those voyages had.</p>
