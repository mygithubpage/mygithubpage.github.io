It is important to learn about other cultures.
Use details and examples to explain your opinion.</p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>I totally agree with this statement because we can learn different perspectives from other cultures. It's important to know different perspectives to be reflective. For example, I went to the US in my sophomore year and found out that many students in the US don't use their parents' money. They usually work in the summer to earn tuition fees and living expenses. However, most of my classmates including me use parents' money without even thinking about it.We believe that it's our parents' obligation to pay for the college and give us allowances. I reflected on this issue and thought I should take on the responsibilities myself. Then I took a government loan to pay for the tuition fees and also got some part-time jobs. Therefore, I changed my perspective because I learned a new one from another culture.</p></article></div></main></body></html>
