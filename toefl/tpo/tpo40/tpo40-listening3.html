              <span class="time" data-times="5.15" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Listen to part of a lecture in an <span class="underline">environmental</span> <span class="underline">conservation</span> class.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.17" data-time="5.15">[00:05.15]</span>Professor: Next I want to talk about the <span class="underline">collapse</span> of the North American <span class="underline">Cod</span> <span class="underline">population</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.05" data-time="10.32">[00:10.32]</span>Let's look at <span class="underline">Cape</span> <span class="underline">Cod</span> in the northeastern United States. <span class="time" data-times="14.23" data-time="14.37">[00:14.37]</span>The area was named <span class="underline">Cape</span> <span class="underline">Cod</span> because there was so many <span class="underline">Cod</span> fish in the waters just off its shores, so many that the first Europeans who fished there in the 17th <span class="underline">century</span> reported it was better than in New Finland, Canada. <span class="time" data-times="16.88" data-time="28.6">[00:28.60]</span>At that time, New Finland's <span class="underline">Cod</span> fishery was so rich that people said it was possible just to <span class="underline">lower</span> a bucket in the water, pull it out and it would be full of <span class="underline">cod</span>, but <span class="underline">Cape</span> <span class="underline">Cod</span> was <span class="underline">even</span> better, so the fishing <span class="underline">industry</span> there did great until after the 1940s.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.39" data-time="45.48">[00:45.48]</span>Uh, there were <span class="underline">simply</span> too many fishing vessels, <span class="underline">sophisticated</span> vessels, <span class="underline">competing</span> for fewer and fewer fish. <span class="time" data-times="6.56" data-time="52.87">[00:52.87]</span>In the 1940s there were still about four hundred million pounds of fish caught at <span class="underline">Cape</span> <span class="underline">Cod</span> every year. <span class="time" data-times="7.26" data-time="59.43">[00:59.43]</span>Just 50 years later though, by the 1990s, <span class="underline">commercial</span> <span class="underline">cod</span> fishing there had become unprofitable. <span class="time" data-times="5.23" data-time="66.69">[01:06.69]</span>The <span class="underline">annual</span> catch had gone down to about 5% of its 1940s' <span class="underline">level</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="19.61" data-time="71.92">[01:11.92]</span>And here's what's so fascinating: as more and more fishing vessels with better and better fishing technology were <span class="underline">competing</span> for <span class="underline">cod</span>, this competition was causing changes to the <span class="underline">biology</span> of the fish and these changes were making it more and more difficult for the <span class="underline">cod</span> <span class="underline">population</span> to <span class="underline">sustain</span> itself.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.72" data-time="91.53">[01:31.53]</span>Student: Changes to the <span class="underline">biology</span> of the fish?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.36" data-time="94.25">[01:34.25]</span>Professor: Well, if a <span class="underline">cod</span> fish could <span class="underline">reproduce</span> earlier than usual, it'd have a better <span class="underline">chance</span> of passing on its genes to the next <span class="underline">generation</span> before being caught, right? <span class="time" data-times="7.91" data-time="104.61">[01:44.61]</span>And sure enough, biologists noticed that around <span class="underline">Cape</span> <span class="underline">Cod</span>, the <span class="underline">cod</span> were beginning to <span class="underline">mature</span> at an earlier age than normal.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.1" data-time="112.52">[01:52.52]</span>
              <span class="underline">Prior</span> to the <span class="underline">population</span> <span class="underline">collapse</span>, <span class="underline">cod</span> usually took about 8 to 10 years to fully <span class="underline">mature</span>, to start to <span class="underline">reproduce</span>, and they lived around 40 years total. <span class="time" data-times="4.01" data-time="122.62">[02:02.62]</span>So <span class="underline">cod</span> had about 30 years of active <span class="underline">reproductive</span> life.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="12.77" data-time="126.63">[02:06.63]</span>But now, <span class="underline">cod</span> were beginning to <span class="underline">reproduce</span> at a younger age, at 3 to 4 years old, and they were living shorter lives because they were being caught, so they had fewer years <span class="underline">within</span> which to <span class="underline">reproduce</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.32" data-time="139.4">[02:19.40]</span>Additionally, <span class="underline">even</span> though some fish in the <span class="underline">population</span> were maturing at an earlier age, none was actually growing faster. <span class="time" data-times="3.66" data-time="146.72">[02:26.72]</span>No <span class="underline">cod</span> has a way of speeding up its <span class="underline">rate</span> of growth. <span class="time" data-times="5.46" data-time="150.38">[02:30.38]</span>So the younger <span class="underline">reproductive</span> age actually meant that smaller fish were reproducing. <span class="time" data-times="5.92" data-time="155.84">[02:35.84]</span>And when you're a small <span class="underline">cod</span> reproducing, you produce fewer eggs than a large <span class="underline">cod</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.75" data-time="161.76">[02:41.76]</span>The smaller cods <span class="underline">simply</span> don't have the body <span class="underline">mass</span> to <span class="underline">reproduce</span> as many eggs. <span class="time" data-times="6.26" data-time="166.51">[02:46.51]</span>The overfishing <span class="underline">pressure</span> on the <span class="underline">cod</span> <span class="underline">population</span> was pushing the <span class="underline">cod</span> into an <span class="underline">evolutionary</span> corner. <span class="time" data-times="3.15" data-time="172.77">[02:52.77]</span>They were having a harder and harder time surviving.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.27" data-time="175.92">[02:55.92]</span>Student: But what can be done to prevent other scenarios like this? <span class="time" data-times="4.76" data-time="180.19">[03:00.19]</span>I mean <span class="underline">obviously</span> we need a better way to <span class="underline">manage</span> <span class="underline">environmental</span> resources.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.59" data-time="184.95">[03:04.95]</span>Professor: Well, what do you guys suggest? Carol?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.23" data-time="188.54">[03:08.54]</span>Student: Hmm, uh, maybe privatize the <span class="underline">resource</span>?<span class="time" data-times="4.49" data-time="191.77">[03:11.77]</span>A private owner would want to <span class="underline">manage</span> the <span class="underline">resource</span> efficiently in a sustainable way.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.38" data-time="196.26">[03:16.26]</span>Professor: Ok, but the problem is privatization doesn't necessarily result in better <span class="underline">management</span> of an <span class="underline">environmental</span> <span class="underline">resource</span>. <span class="time" data-times="1.77" data-time="204.64">[03:24.64]</span>Any ideas why it wouldn't?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.79" data-time="206.41">[03:26.41]</span>Student: Well, an <span class="underline">individual</span> owner might not properly <span class="underline">assess</span> the limits of the <span class="underline">resource</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.94" data-time="212.2">[03:32.20]</span>So they could be just as <span class="underline">prone</span> to overexploiting that <span class="underline">resource</span> as a group where lots of people have <span class="underline">access</span> to it.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="15.43" data-time="220.14">[03:40.14]</span>Professor: Yes. Well, like in the 1970s, when it was already <span class="underline">clear</span> the North American <span class="underline">cod</span> <span class="underline">population</span> was declining <span class="underline">dramatically</span>, the US and Canada declared a 200-mile <span class="underline">exclusive</span> <span class="underline">economic</span> <span class="underline">zone</span> in the waters around <span class="underline">Cape</span> <span class="underline">Cod</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.28" data-time="235.57">[03:55.57]</span>By declaring an <span class="underline">exclusive</span> <span class="underline">economic</span> <span class="underline">zone</span>, you see, these two countries were trying to <span class="underline">extend</span> their <span class="underline">territorial</span> waters. <span class="time" data-times="3.69" data-time="242.85">[04:02.85]</span>Basically it was as if they were saying: 'we're the private owners. <span class="time" data-times="1.28" data-time="246.54">[04:06.54]</span>We own these waters. <span class="time" data-times="2.94" data-time="247.82">[04:07.82]</span>So we own the rights to the fish in them too.' .<span class="time" data-times="7.29" data-time="250.76">[04:10.76]</span> <span class="underline">Essentially</span> the two countries told fishing vessels, trollers from all other nations, to get out of the <span class="underline">cod</span> fishing area.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.52" data-time="258.05">[04:18.05]</span>You'd think that would be good news for the <span class="underline">cod</span> because there'd be less fishing. <span class="time" data-times="8.47" data-time="262.57">[04:22.57]</span>However, The US and Canada <span class="underline">wanted</span> to <span class="underline"><span class="underline">expel</span></span> foreign trollers only in order to increase the number of their own fishing fleets. <span class="time" data-times="3.72" data-time="271.04">[04:31.04]</span>The total number of fishing trollers actually increased.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.63" data-time="274.76">[04:34.76]</span>Another possible <span class="underline">solution</span>, pass laws that <span class="underline">regulate</span> use of the <span class="underline">resource</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="280.39">[04:40.39]</span>But for regulation to be <span class="underline">effective</span>, penalties for breaking the law have to be large enough to <span class="underline">deter</span> violators.</p>
