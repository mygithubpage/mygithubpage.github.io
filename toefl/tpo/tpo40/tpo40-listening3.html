Problems related to the overfishing of cod</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The original mentions fishing vessels on fishing vessels, and mentions squid, so we can see that this article will describe the overfishing around squid, so the D option is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor compare Cape Cod to Newfoundland?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To explain how some of Cape Cod's waters first became privatized</p><p>B. To illustrate the enormous size of Cape Cod's seventeenth-century cod population</p><p>C. To explain why large-scale cod fishing began later in Cape Cod than elsewhere</p><p>D. To highlight the results of two different evolutionary pressures on cod</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>According to the source, the reason why the professor compares Cape Cod with Newfoundland is to highlight the large number of cod fish in Cape Cod. So the B option is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What change did scientists notice around Cape Cod after the 1940s?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The amount of pollutants dumped into the ocean increased dramatically.</p><p>B. Trawling ships violated fishing regulations more often.</p><p>C. The cod population's diet became less diverse.</p><p>D.

Smaller cod produce eggs fewer times per year</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>It is known from the source that the B option is correct.

Privatization is an imperfect tool.</p><p>B. Privatization should be tried more often.</p><p>C. Privatization usually results in political conflicts.</p><p>D. Privatization usually results in the best outcome.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>It can be seen from the original text that privatization cannot effectively solve the problem of management of environmental resources. So the A option is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor, what was the result of the 200-mile exclusive economic zone declared by the United States and Canada?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

Penalties for overfishing were toughened.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>From the source language, it can be seen that after the announcement of the 200-nation exclusive economic zone in the United States and Canada, the number of fishing vessels has increased.
