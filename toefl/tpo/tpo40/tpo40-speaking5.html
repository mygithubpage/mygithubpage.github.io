Sally. How are you doing?</p><p>Woman:Well, okay. But I've got a bit of a problem.</p><p>Man:Oh, yeah? What's up?</p><p>Woman:Well, I forgot that tonight is the night my theater class is taking a trip to see a play. We're taking a bus into the city.</p><p>Man:Oh, sounds like fun.</p><p>Woman:Yeah. Well, we have to write a paper about the play for class. Cool thing is my professor got free tickets for us. He and the director of the play are friends. So the whole class is going for free.</p><p>Man:Free theater tickets. Excellent! Theater tickets can be expensive.</p><p>Woman:Yeah. Problem is, though, I have a big history test tomorrow morning and I really need to study. I've been putting it off and I kind of forgot that tonight was when the theater class would be going to the play.</p><p>Man:So you were planning to use tonight to study.</p><p>Woman:Yeah.</p><p>Man:Well, could you do your studying, you know, study for the history test when you get back from the play tonight?</p><p>Woman:Yeah. It would be late though. I could study some on the bus and stay up late when we get back from the play.</p><p>Man:Hmm...not exactly ideal study conditions though.</p><p>Woman:Exactly. So I was thinking I could go by myself into the city another night to see the play. The paper we have to write on the play isn't due for a couple of days. So they'd still be time.</p><p>Man:Then you can get a good night's sleep before the history test.</p><p>Woman:Yap. But I'd have to buy the theater ticket myself. It's only free if I go with the class tonight.</p></article><section id="question"><h4>Question</h4><p>Briefly summarize the problem the speakers are discussing. Then state which solution you would recommend. Explain the reasons for your recommendation. </p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>In this conversation, the woman is having a hard time dealing with the problem that whether she should go to see the play with her classmates tonight. Because she has a history test tomorrow morning and if she went to the trip tonight it'll leave her no time to study. And the man offers her two possible solutions. One is she could do the studying after she get back from the play. The other is go to see the play by herself some other night and prepare for the test tonight. And if it were my choice, I would choose the former one, because if she were to go to see the play by herself, she would have to pay for the ticket and the most important thing is she would have no company to go there and discuss the play with. So if she were to go there tonight with the whole class, not only she could save some money but also it would be a really interesting experience.</p></article></div></main></body></html>
