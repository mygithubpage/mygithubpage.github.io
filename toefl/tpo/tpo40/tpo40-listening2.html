lecture in an art history class</p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.54" data-time="4.94">[00:04.94]</span>Professor: Last class I passed out your assignment for your first paper and today I want to spend some time going over it. <span class="time" data-times="8.64" data-time="12.48">[00:12.48]</span>Most people never take any art history until they get to college, so many of you have probably never written an art history paper before.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.57" data-time="21.12">[00:21.12]</span>I gave you a list of appropriate works of art for you to write about. <span class="time" data-times="8.9" data-time="25.69">[00:25.69]</span>So your next step in this <span class="highlight">process</span> needs to be to go look at the work you've selected as your topic and bring a pencil and a notepad with you. <span class="time" data-times="15.85" data-time="34.59">[00:34.59]</span>Because I don't mean you should just <span class="highlight">drop</span> by at the museum and <span class="highlight">glance</span> at it, so you can say you've seen it in real life, you need to go and sit in front of the work and really look at it carefully and slowly, and keep careful notes about what you see. <span class="time" data-times="3.78" data-time="50.44">[00:50.44]</span>You'll need them for the kind of art <span class="highlight">history</span> paper you are going to be writing. <span class="time" data-times="3.24" data-time="54.22">[00:54.22]</span>It's what we call a <span class="highlight">formal</span><span class="highlight">analysis</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="9.1" data-time="57.46">[00:57.46]</span>A <span class="highlight">formal</span><span class="highlight">analysis</span> of a work of art, any kind of art, is based on its <span class="highlight">formal</span> qualities, which means qualities related to the form. <span class="time" data-times="7.73" data-time="66.56">[01:06.56]</span>Things like color, <span class="highlight">texture</span>, <span class="highlight">line</span>, shapes, <span class="highlight">proportion</span> and <span class="highlight">composition</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.89" data-time="74.29">[01:14.29]</span>Now, probably the closest thing to a <span class="highlight">formal</span><span class="highlight">analysis</span> you might have written is for an English class. <span class="time" data-times="5.83" data-time="80.18">[01:20.18]</span>If, you've, say, written an <span class="highlight">analysis</span> of a poem, you've used the same skills. <span class="time" data-times="5.9" data-time="86.01">[01:26.01]</span>You've <span class="highlight">given</span> an <span class="highlight">analysis</span> of the poem by describing and analyzing its form and meter. <span class="time" data-times="4.82" data-time="91.91">[01:31.91]</span>A <span class="highlight">formal</span><span class="highlight">analysis</span> paper in art <span class="highlight">history</span> is very <span class="highlight">similar</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="18.87" data-time="96.73">[01:36.73]</span>Now, before you begin writing your <span class="highlight">formal</span><span class="highlight">analysis</span>, you'll want to start with a <span class="highlight">summary</span> of the <span class="highlight">overall</span><span class="highlight">appearance</span> of the work, a <span class="highlight">brief</span> description of what you see: either figures, people, what are they doing, or is it a <span class="highlight">landscape</span>, or an <span class="highlight">abstract</span> representation of something. <span class="time" data-times="5.2" data-time="115.6">[01:55.60]</span>Tell what the <span class="highlight">subject</span> is and what aspects are emphasized in the painting. <span class="time" data-times="5.72" data-time="120.8">[02:00.80]</span>This will give your reader an<span class="highlight">overview</span> of what the work looks like before you <span class="highlight">analyze</span> it.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="11.77" data-time="126.52">[02:06.52]</span>The next part of your paper, the actual <span class="highlight">formal</span><span class="highlight">analysis</span>, would be the longest and most important <span class="highlight">section</span> of your paper, where you <span class="highlight">describe</span> and <span class="highlight">analyze</span><span class="highlight">individual</span> design elements. <span class="time" data-times="12.7" data-time="138.29">[02:18.29]</span>For this <span class="highlight">portion</span> of the paper, you are going to <span class="highlight">rely</span> on the notes you took at the museum because you should be able to <span class="highlight">describe</span> in <span class="highlight">detail</span> the design elements the artist uses and how they are used. <span class="time" data-times="4.31" data-time="150.99">[02:30.99]</span>For example, does the artist use <span class="highlight">harsh</span> lines or <span class="highlight">soft</span> lines?. <span class="time" data-times="2.78" data-time="155.3">[02:35.30]</span>Are the colors bright or muted? <span class="time" data-times="6.66" data-time="158.08">[02:38.08]</span><span class="highlight">Focus</span> on the design elements that you feel are most strongly represented in that <span class="highlight">particular</span> work of art. <span class="time" data-times="4.98" data-time="164.74">[02:44.74]</span>And if you don't know where to begin, take note of where your eye goes first. <span class="time" data-times="4.85" data-time="169.72">[02:49.72]</span>Then <span class="highlight">describe</span> things in the order in which your eye moves around the work. <span class="time" data-times="6.74" data-time="174.57">[02:54.57]</span>This will help you understand how one part relates to another, the <span class="highlight">interaction</span> between the different parts of the work. <span class="time" data-times="5.63" data-time="181.31">[03:01.31]</span>Ok? This kind of <span class="highlight">analysis</span> should <span class="highlight">occur</span><span class="highlight">throughout</span> the main <span class="highlight">portion</span> of the paper.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="11.53" data-time="186.94">[03:06.94]</span>In the last <span class="highlight">section</span> of your paper, and this goes beyond <span class="highlight">formal</span><span class="highlight">analysis</span>, you <span class="highlight">comment</span> on the <span class="highlight">significance</span> of what you've seen, what details of the work <span class="highlight">convey</span> meaning. <span class="time" data-times="3.49" data-time="198.47">[03:18.47]</span>Some <span class="highlight">significant</span> details will not be <span class="highlight">apparent</span> to you right away. <span class="time" data-times="5.59" data-time="201.96">[03:21.96]</span>But if you look long enough, you realize how important they are for your <span class="highlight">interpretation</span> of the work.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.15" data-time="207.55">[03:27.55]</span>Many years ago, I was writing a <span class="highlight">formal</span><span class="highlight">analysis</span> of a painting of a little boy. <span class="time" data-times="6.21" data-time="212.7">[03:32.70]</span>In the painting, a little boy was standing in his nursery and he was holding a toy bird in his hand. <span class="time" data-times="3.56" data-time="218.91">[03:38.91]</span>And there were more toys around him in the background of the painting. <span class="time" data-times="6.52" data-time="222.47">[03:42.47]</span>Because of the bird he was holding, I assumed at first that the painting was about the innocence of children. <span class="time" data-times="9.11" data-time="228.99">[03:48.99]</span>But as I looked at the painting longer, I realized that the boy's eyes look sad <span class="highlight">even</span> though there was no discernable expression on his face. <span class="time" data-times="7.4" data-time="238.1">[03:58.10]</span>And then it dawned on me that <span class="highlight">even</span> though he was surrounded by toys, he was all alone in his nursery. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="245.5">[04:05.50]</span>The boy's eyes were a <span class="highlight">significant</span><span class="highlight">detail</span> in the painting that I didn't notice at first.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What point does the professor make about the writing of a formal analysis in art history?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.
