        <h3>Listening Text</h3>
        <article>
          <p>Listen to part of a conversation between a student and an university librarian.</p>
          <p>:Student: Mr. Reese.I am Jennifer Lee.I worked on the photography exhibition last year, the one that was commemorating the university's 100th anniversary.I helped select and display photos for the exhibit.I helped set it all up, remember?</p>
          <p>:Professor: Oh, sure! You're the photography student that Professor Ryan sent to us.How have you been?</p>
          <p>:Student: Good. Thanks.And l...uh...well/I was hoping I could talk to you about a job actually.</p>
          <p>:Professor: Oh, the job here in our library archive? Ha, that was fast! We just posted it yesterday.</p>
          <p>:Student: Oh, no.Actually, it's for a photography job in the portrait studio at the mall.</p>
          <p>:Professor: Taking portrait photos? Sounds like a great job for a photography student.But how can I help?</p>
          <p>:Student: Well, I went for an interview, but I still need to give them professional references from people I've worked for.And well, I don't have a lot of work experience.But you know, you've...you've seen how...how I helped plan and carry a project through and showed up on time and everything.So, I was kind of hoping I...you know, I could give them your name as someone they could talk to.</p>
          <p>:Professor: Of course, we all thought you did a great job.I remember saying that to Professor Ryan and he thought so too.I suppose you've already asked him for a recommendation?</p>
          <p>:Student: I have. He's actually the one who convinced me to apply for it.I wasn't sure I should.I mean, having real photography experience would be great for my resume, but...well...I am little concerned about the hours.It's ten hours a week, which is fine, but they're all during the daytime.I would have to schedule several classes for the late afternoon and evening.I am not sure I will be able to do that.</p>
          <p>:Professor: Yeah, I see how that could be a problem.Well, maybe you should consider the job I mentioned.We just got a grant to hire a part-time library assistant for our photography archives.It doesn't involve taking pictures, but it does involve working with pictures, filling requests for specific photos from students and professors.And it's in the evenings from 6 to 9, three days a week.</p>
          <p>:Student: Hmm, well, the hours are definitely better, but I really do want to find out about that job at the studio first.I am sure you will understand.</p>
          <p>:Professor: Of course. But if it doesn't work out, keep us in mind. </p>
