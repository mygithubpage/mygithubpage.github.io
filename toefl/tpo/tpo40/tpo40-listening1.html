            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.98" data-time="5.39">[00:05.39]</span>Student: Thanks for seeing me. Professor Jackson.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.8" data-time="7.37">[00:07.37]</span>Professor: Sure, Tom. What can I do for you?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.72" data-time="9.17">[00:09.17]</span>Student: I'm <span class="underline">gonna</span> do my <span class="underline">term</span> <span class="underline">project</span> on service design. <span class="time" data-times="4.28" data-time="11.89">[00:11.89]</span>What you see as a customer, the <span class="underline">physical</span> <span class="underline">layout</span> of the building, the <span class="underline">parking</span> lot. <span class="time" data-times="5.41" data-time="16.17">[00:16.17]</span>And I thought I'd <span class="underline">focus</span> on various kinds of eateries: Restaurants, coffee shops, cafeterias. <span class="time" data-times="4.07" data-time="21.58">[00:21.58]</span>So I'd also <span class="underline">analyze</span> where you order your food, where you eat, and so on.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.26" data-time="25.65">[00:25.65]</span>Professor: Wait. I thought you were <span class="underline">gonna</span> come up with a <span class="underline">hypothetical</span> business plan for an <span class="underline">amusement</span> park. <span class="time" data-times="2.26" data-time="30.91">[00:30.91]</span>Isn't that what you e-mailed me last week? <span class="time" data-times="1.96" data-time="33.17">[00:33.17]</span>I could've sworn.. <span class="time" data-times="3.19" data-time="35.13">[00:35.13]</span>Oh, I'm thinking of a Tom from another class. <span class="time" data-times="2.33" data-time="38.32">[00:38.32]</span>Tom Benson.

              <span class="time" data-times="2.87" data-time="40.65">[00:40.65]</span>Student: No problem. I did e-mail you my idea too though.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.8" data-time="43.52">[00:43.52]</span>Professor: That's right. I remember now. <span class="time" data-times="1.28" data-time="45.32">[00:45.32]</span>Restaurants, Yeah.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.76" data-time="46.6">[00:46.60]</span>Student: So here's my question. <span class="time" data-times="3.91" data-time="48.36">[00:48.36]</span>I read something about service <span class="underline">standard</span> that kind of <span class="underline">confused</span> me. <span class="time" data-times="3.79" data-time="52.27">[00:52.27]</span>What's the <span class="underline">difference</span> between service design and service <span class="underline">standard</span>?</p>

              <span class="time" data-times="7.91" data-time="56.06">[00:56.06]</span>Professor: Service <span class="underline">standard</span> refers to what a <span class="underline">company</span>...employees are ideally supposed to do in order for everything to <span class="underline">operate</span> <span class="underline">smoothly</span>. <span class="time" data-times="1.67" data-time="63.97">[01:03.97]</span>The protocols to be followed.</p>

              <span class="time" data-times="2.09" data-time="66.59">[01:06.59]</span>Professor: So backing up. <span class="time" data-times="4.96" data-time="68.68">[01:08.68]</span>Service design is...uh, think of the <span class="underline">cafeteria</span> here on <span class="underline">campus</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.04" data-time="73.64">[01:13.64]</span>There are several food counters, right? <span class="time" data-times="5.53" data-time="75.68">[01:15.68]</span>All with big, <span class="underline">clear</span> signs to help you find what you're looking for: soups, salads, desserts. <span class="time" data-times="2.56" data-time="81.21">[01:21.21]</span>So you know exactly where to go to get what you need. <span class="time" data-times="3.37" data-time="83.77">[01:23.77]</span>And when you are finished picking up your food, where do you go?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.27" data-time="87.14">[01:27.14]</span>Student: To the cash registers.</p>

              <span class="time" data-times="2.78" data-time="89.33">[01:29.33]</span>Student: Right before you get to the seating area.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.81" data-time="92.11">[01:32.11]</span>Professor: Exactly. A place that you would logically move to next.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.72" data-time="95.92">[01:35.92]</span>Student:You know, not every place is like that. <span class="time" data-times="5.61" data-time="98.64">[01:38.64]</span>This past weekend was my friend's birthday, and I went to a bakery in town to pick up a cake for her party. <span class="time" data-times="1.96" data-time="104.25">[01:44.25]</span>And the <span class="underline">layout</span> of the place was <span class="underline">weird</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.57" data-time="106.21">[01:46.21]</span>People were all in each other's way, standing in the wrong lines to <span class="underline">pay</span>, to place orders. <span class="time" data-times="7.14" data-time="110.78">[01:50.78]</span>Oh, and another thing, I heard this bakery makes really good apple pie, so I <span class="underline">wanted</span> to buy a <span class="underline">slice</span> of it too.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.09" data-time="117.92">[01:57.92]</span>Professor:OK.</p>

              <span class="time" data-times="7.47" data-time="124.21">[02:04.21]</span>Professor:That's what's called a service <span class="underline">gap</span>, maybe there wasn't enough training for the employees or maybe they just ran out pie that day. <span class="time" data-times="4.39" data-time="131.68">[02:11.68]</span>But something is wrong with the <span class="underline">process</span>, and the service <span class="underline">standard</span> wasn't being met.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.57" data-time="136.07">[02:16.07]</span>Student:OK. I think I get it. <span class="time" data-times="5.59" data-time="137.64">[02:17.64]</span>Anyway, since part of the requirements for the <span class="underline">term</span> <span class="underline">project</span> is to visit an actual place of business. <span class="time" data-times="1.98" data-time="143.23">[02:23.23]</span>Do you think I could use our <span class="underline">cafeteria</span>? <span class="time" data-times="2.36" data-time="145.21">[02:25.21]</span>They <span class="underline">seem</span> to have a lot of the things I'm looking for.</p>

              <span class="time" data-times="8.04" data-time="147.57">[02:27.57]</span>Professor:Well, <span class="underline">campus</span> businesses like the <span class="underline">cafeteria</span> or <span class="underline">bookstore</span> don't quite follow the kinds of service models we're studying in class. <span class="time" data-times="3.15" data-time="155.61">[02:35.61]</span>You should go to some other <span class="underline">local</span> <span class="underline">establishment</span> I'd say.</p>
