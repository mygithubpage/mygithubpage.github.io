              <span class="time" data-times="1.57" data-time="136.07">[02:16.07]</span>Student:OK. I think I get it. <span class="time" data-times="5.59" data-time="137.64">[02:17.64]</span>Anyway, since part of the requirements for the <span class="highlight">term</span> <span class="highlight">project</span> is to visit an actual place of business. <span class="time" data-times="1.98" data-time="143.23">[02:23.23]</span>Do you think I could use our <span class="highlight">cafeteria</span>? <span class="time" data-times="2.36" data-time="145.21">[02:25.21]</span>They <span class="highlight">seem</span> to have a lot of the things I'm looking for.</p>
