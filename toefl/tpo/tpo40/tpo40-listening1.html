To find out all the requirements for a project</p><p>B. To discuss a service gap at a restaurant</p><p>C. To get help understanding concepts relevant to his project</p><p>D. To get help with designing a business plan</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The student threw out his intention to come to the professor this time, because the difference between service design and service standards is somewhat confusing, so the C option is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor mention a student in another class?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To describe an interesting topic for a project</p><p>B. To explain the cause of her initial confusion</p><p>C. To point out that she has not received e-mails from all her students yet</p><p>D. To indicate that she has several students doing projects about restaurants</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The professor mistakenly believes that the student is writing a hypothetical business plan around the amusement park, but later discovers that this is what another student wants to write, so the B option is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor talk about the cafeteria on campus?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To give an example of an effective service design</p><p>B. To illustrate how service standards can inform service design</p><p>C. To help the man understand a service problem</p><p>D. To illustrate the concept of a service gap</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The example of teaching a school cafeteria is to illustrate that the design of the school cafeteria is very reasonable. We can easily find what we need, so the A option is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>What do the speakers imply about the bakery the student went to recently? Click on 2 answers.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The apple pie he bought there was not as good as it usually is.</p><p>B. The bakery's service design was inefficient.</p><p>C. The bakery needs additional employees to fix a service gap.</p><p>D. The bakery did not meet a service standard.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="BD"><p>Students want to buy apple pie, there is also a small label, which reads Apple pie, but there is no remaining. So the professor said that this is the service gap. So the B option is correct. Later, he continued to say that perhaps it was because of the lack of adequate training for the employees. Perhaps it happened that the factions of the day were sold out. However, the whole process was problematic. The service standards may not be up to the standard, so the D option was correct.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor say the student should do for his project?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Compare an on-campus service model with an off-campus one</p><p>B. Interview the service manager and employees at the cafeteria</p><p>C. Recommend service improvements at the cafeteria and the bookstore</p><p>D. Analyze the service design of a nearby restaurant</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>Students want to use the school's canteen as a research object, but professors say that the school's canteen or bookstore does not meet the service model learned in the classroom and should go to other local companies for research. So the D option is correct.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
