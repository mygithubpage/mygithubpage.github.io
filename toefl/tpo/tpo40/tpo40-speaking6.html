          <p>Listen to part of a lecture from a business class.</p>
          <p>All right. So...um...a good salesperson needs to know how to talk to customers effectively. Sometimes customers looking to buy products will raise concerns, things that may be keeping them from buying the product. And salespeople stand a much better chance of selling their products if they can effectively address these concerns. Let's look at a couple of strategies they use to address customers' concerns.</p>
          <p>Okay. Now one strategy is to point out something special about the product. Something that outweighs the customer's concern, like a special feature. Like, say a customer is in an electronic store, and a salesperson is showing her a portable laptop computer. The customer expresses a concern saying the computer is expensive. Well, that's true. But the salesperson can provide information to outweigh the concern about the price by pointing out how fast the computer is, how much work it can get done in a short time. This special feature may outweigh the customer's concern, convince her that it's worth the price. So she's more likely to buy it.</p>
          <p>Now another strategy is to demonstrate something about the product, actually use the product in front of the customer in response to a concern. Going back to the electronic store example, say the customer raises concerns about whether the laptop is portable enough, that it looks like it would be difficult to pack up and carry. Well, the salesperson could address this concern by unplugging the computer, putting it into its carrying case and slinging it over his shoulder, right in front of the customer. That is, he can demonstrate how easy it is to transport. This demonstration may help eliminate the customer's concerns about buying the computer.</p>

          <p>In the lecture, the professor provides two strategies to illustrate a theory that how important a good salesman needs to talk to customers effectively and get their products sold. The first one is that he should point out something special about the product. For example, if a customer says the computer is expensive in an electronic store, the salesperson should mention how fast the computer is, and how much work it can get done within a short time. The second one is that demonstrate something about the product, actually use it in front of the customer. For instance, if the customer were to express the concern about whether the laptop is portable enough, the salesman should address this concern by unplugging the computer and putting it into the carrying case to show the customer how easy it is to transport. And that's the two strategies the speaker presented to explain the theory.</p>
