            <b>Ancient Athens</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>One of the most important changes in Greece during the period from 800 B.C. to 500 B.C. was the rise of the polis, or city-state, and each polis developed a system of <span class="highlight">government</span> that was <span class="highlight">appropriate</span> to its circumstances. The problems that were faced and solved in Athens were the sharing of <span class="highlight">political</span> power between the established <span class="highlight">aristocracy</span> and the emerging other classes, and the <span class="highlight">adjustment</span> of aristocratic ways of life to the ways of life of the new polis. It was the <span class="highlight">harmonious</span> blending of all of these elements that was to produce the <span class="highlight">classical</span> <span class="highlight">culture</span> of Athens.</p>
          <p>Entering the polis age, Athens had the <span class="highlight">traditional</span> institutions of other Greek protodemocratic states: an <span class="highlight">assembly</span> of adult males, an aristocratic <span class="highlight">council</span>, and annually elected officials. <span class="highlight">Within</span> this <span class="highlight">traditional</span> <span class="highlight">framework</span> the Athenians, between 600 B.C. and 450 B.C., evolved what Greeks regarded as a fully fledged <span class="highlight">democratic</span> <span class="highlight">constitution</span>, though the right to vote was <span class="highlight">given</span> to fewer groups of people than is seen in <span class="highlight">modem</span> times.</p>
          <p>The first steps toward change were taken by Solon in 594 B.C., when he broke the <span class="highlight">aristocracy</span>'s stranglehold on elected offices by establishing wealth rather than birth as the basis of office holding, <span class="question4">abolishing </span>the <span class="highlight">economic</span> obligations of ordinary Athenians to the <span class="highlight">aristocracy</span>, and allowing the <span class="highlight">assembly</span> (of which all citizens were <span class="highlight">equal</span> members) to overrule the decisions of <span class="highlight">local</span> courts in certain cases. The strength of the Athenian <span class="highlight">aristocracy</span> was further weakened during the rest of the <span class="highlight">century</span> by the rise of a type of <span class="highlight">government</span> known as a <span class="question5">tyranny, </span>which is a form of interim rule by a <span class="highlight">popular</span> strongman (not rule by a ruthless dictator as the modern use of the <span class="highlight">term</span> suggests to us). The Peisistratids, as the <span class="highlight">succession</span> of tyrants were called (after the founder of the dynasty, Peisistratos), strengthened Athenian central <span class="highlight">administration</span> at the expense of the <span class="highlight">aristocracy</span> by appointing judges <span class="highlight">throughout</span> the <span class="highlight">region</span>, producing Athens' first national <span class="highlight">coinage</span>, and adding and <span class="question7">embellishing </span>festivals that tended to <span class="highlight">focus</span> <span class="highlight">attention</span> on Athens rather than on <span class="highlight">local</span> villages of the surrounding <span class="highlight">region</span>. <span class="question8">By the end of the <span class="highlight">century</span>, the time was <span class="highlight">ripe</span> for more change: the tyrants were driven out, and in 508 B.C. a new reformer, Cleisthenes, gave final form to the developments reducing aristocratic control already under way.</span></p>
          <p>Cleisthenes' <span class="highlight">principal</span> <span class="highlight">contribution</span> to the creation of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> at Athens was to complete the long <span class="highlight">process</span> of weakening family and <span class="highlight">clan</span> structures, especially among the aristocrats, and to set in their place locality-based corporations called demes, which became the point of <span class="highlight">entry</span> for all civic and most <span class="highlight">religious</span> life in Athens. Out of the demes were created 10 <span class="highlight">artificial</span> tribes of <span class="highlight">roughly</span> <span class="highlight">equal</span> <span class="highlight">population</span>. From the demes, by either election or <span class="highlight">selection</span>, came 500 members of a new <span class="highlight">council</span>, 6,000 jurors for the courts, 10 generals, and hundreds of commissioners. The <span class="highlight">assembly</span> was <span class="highlight">sovereign</span> in all matters but in practice delegated its power to <span class="highlight">subordinate</span> bodies such as the <span class="highlight">council</span>, which prepared the <span class="highlight">agenda</span> for the meetings of the <span class="highlight">assembly</span>, and courts, which took <span class="highlight">care</span> of most judicial matters. Various committees acted as an <span class="highlight">executive</span> <span class="highlight">branch</span>, implementing policies of the <span class="highlight">assembly</span> and supervising, for <span class="highlight">instance</span>, the food and water supplies and public buildings. This wide-scale participation by the citizenry in the <span class="highlight">government</span> <span class="highlight">distinguished</span> the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> form of the Athenian polis from other less liberal forms.</p>
          <p>The effect of Cleisthenes' reforms was to <span class="highlight">establish</span> the superiority of the Athenian <span class="highlight">community</span> as a whole over <span class="highlight">local</span> institutions without destroying them. National <span class="highlight">politics</span> rather than <span class="highlight">local</span> or deme <span class="highlight">politics</span> became the focal point. At the same time, <span class="highlight">entry</span> into national <span class="highlight">politics</span> began at the deme <span class="highlight">level</span> and gave <span class="highlight">local</span> loyalty a new focus: Athens itself. Over the next two centuries the implications of Cleisthenes' reforms were fully <span class="question11">exploited.</span></p>
          <p>During the fifth <span class="highlight">century</span> B.C. the <span class="highlight">council</span> of 500 was extremely <span class="highlight">influential</span> in shaping <span class="highlight">policy</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> In the next <span class="highlight">century</span>, however, it was the <span class="highlight">mature</span> <span class="highlight">assembly</span> that took on decision-making responsibility. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>By any <span class="highlight">measure</span> other than that of the aristocrats, who had been upstaged by the <span class="highlight">supposedly</span> <span class="highlight">inferior</span> "people", the Athenian <span class="highlight">democracy</span> was a <span class="question12">stunning </span>success. Never before, or since, have so many people been involved in the serious business of self-governance. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>It was precisely this <span class="highlight">opportunity</span> to <span class="highlight">participate</span> in public life that provided a <span class="highlight">stimulus</span> for the <span class="highlight">brilliant</span> unfolding of <span class="highlight">classical</span> Greek <span class="highlight">culture</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p>
