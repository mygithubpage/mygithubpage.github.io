And there are a couple of reasons to list. The most important thing is that, you know, the USA is the freest country in the world, so it must be really nice of living there, and since I want to have that kind of experience, so I'd like to learn more about it first. Furthermore, I'll go to the postgraduate school in the USA, so I suppose it's good for me to understand what that country looks like or feels like, in that case, I can fit in my school life better. So that's why I want to learn more about America.</p></article></div></main></body></html>
