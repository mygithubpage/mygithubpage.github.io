          <h4 class="w3-center">Amphibian Thermoregulation</h4>
          <p>In <span class="highlight">contrast</span> to mammals and birds, amphibians are unable to produce <span class="highlight">thermal</span> energy <span class="highlight">through</span> their <span class="highlight">metabolic</span> <span class="highlight">activity</span>, which would allow them to <span class="highlight">regulate</span> their body <span class="highlight">temperature</span> <span class="highlight">independent</span> of the surrounding or <span class="highlight">ambient</span> <span class="highlight">temperature</span>. However, the idea that amphibians have no control whatsoever over their body <span class="highlight">temperature</span> has been proven false because their body <span class="highlight">temperature</span> does not always <span class="highlight"><span class="highlight">correspond</span></span> to the surrounding <span class="highlight">temperature</span>. While amphibians are poor thermoregulators, they do <span class="highlight">exercise</span> control over their body <span class="highlight">temperature</span> to a limited <span class="highlight">degree</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="highlight">Physiological</span> adaptations can assist amphibians in colonizing habitats where <span class="highlight">extreme</span> conditions <span class="highlight">prevail</span>. The tolerance <span class="highlight">range</span> in body <span class="highlight">temperature</span> represents the <span class="highlight">range</span> of temperatures <span class="highlight">within</span> which a <span class="highlight">species</span> can <span class="highlight">survive</span>. One <span class="highlight">species</span> of North American <span class="highlight">newt</span> is still active when temperatures <span class="highlight">drop</span> to -2°C while one <span class="question2">South American frog</span> feels comfortable <span class="highlight">even</span> when temperatures measured to 41°C - the highest body <span class="highlight">temperature</span> measured in a free-ranging <span class="highlight">amphibian</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> Recently it has been shown that some North American frog and <span class="highlight">toad</span> <span class="highlight">species</span> can <span class="highlight">survive</span> up to five days with a body <span class="highlight">temperature</span> of -6°C with <span class="highlight">approximately</span> one-third of their body fluids frozen. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> The other tissues are protected because they <span class="highlight">contain</span> the frost-protective agents glycerin or <span class="highlight">glucose</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span> Additionally, in many <span class="highlight">species</span> the tolerance boundaries are <span class="highlight">flexible</span> and can change as a result of acclimatization (long-term <span class="highlight">exposure</span> to <span class="highlight">particular</span> conditions). <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p>
          <p>Frog <span class="highlight">species</span> that <span class="highlight">remain</span> <span class="highlight">exposed</span> to the sun despite high diurnal (daytime) temperatures <span class="highlight">exhibit</span> some <span class="highlight">fascinating</span> modifications in the skin structure that <span class="highlight">function</span> as <span class="highlight">morphological</span> adaptations. Most <span class="highlight">amphibian</span> skin is fully water <span class="highlight">permeable</span> and is <span class="highlight">therefore</span> not a <span class="highlight">barrier</span> against <span class="highlight">evaporation</span> or <span class="highlight">solar</span> <span class="highlight">radiation</span>. The African savanna frog Hyperolius viridiflavus stores guanine crystals in its skin, which enable it to better <span class="highlight">reflect</span> <span class="highlight">solar</span> <span class="highlight">radiation</span>, thus providing protection against overheating. The tree frog <span class="question4">Phyllomedusa sauvagei</span> responds to <span class="highlight">evaporative</span> losses with <span class="highlight">gland</span> secretions that provide a greasy <span class="highlight">film</span> over its entire body that helps prevent <span class="highlight">desiccation</span> (dehydration).</p>
          <p>However, <span class="highlight">behavior</span> is by far the most important <span class="highlight">factor</span> in thermoregulation. The <span class="highlight">principal</span> elements in <span class="highlight">behavioral</span> thermoregulation are basking (heliothermy), heat <span class="highlight">exchange</span> with substrates such as rock or earth (thigmothermy), and diurnal and <span class="highlight">annual</span> avoidance behaviors, which include moving to <span class="highlight">shelter</span> during the day for cooling and hibernating or estivating (reducing <span class="highlight">activity</span> during cold or hot weather, <span class="highlight">respectively</span>). Heliothermy is especially <span class="highlight">common</span> among frogs and toads: it allows them to increase their body <span class="highlight">temperature</span> by more than 10°C. The <span class="question6">Andean <span class="highlight">toad</span> Bufo spinulosus</span> exposes itself immediately after sunrise on <span class="highlight">moist</span> ground and <span class="question7">attains</span> its preferred body <span class="highlight">temperature</span> by this means, long before either ground or <span class="highlight">air</span> is correspondingly warmed. A <span class="highlight">positive</span> side effect of <span class="question8">this <span class="highlight">approach</span></span> is that it accelerates the digestion of the <span class="highlight">prey</span> consumed <span class="highlight">overnight</span>, thus also accelerating growth. Thigmothermy is a <span class="highlight">behavior</span> present in most amphibians, although pressing against the ground serves a dual purpose: heat <span class="highlight">absorption</span> by <span class="highlight">conductivity</span> and water <span class="highlight">absorption</span> <span class="highlight">through</span> the skin. The effect of thigmothermy is especially <span class="highlight">evident</span> in the Andean <span class="highlight">toad</span> during rainfall: its body <span class="highlight">temperature</span> corresponds to the <span class="highlight">temperature</span> of the warm earth and not to the much cooler <span class="highlight">air</span> <span class="highlight">temperature</span>.</p>
          <p>Avoidance <span class="highlight">behavior</span> occurs whenever <span class="highlight">physiological</span> and <span class="highlight">morphological</span> adaptations are <span class="highlight">insufficient</span> to <span class="highlight">maintain</span> body <span class="highlight">temperature</span> <span class="highlight">within</span> the <span class="highlight">vital</span> <span class="highlight">range</span>. <span class="highlight">Nocturnal</span> <span class="highlight">activity</span> in amphibians with low tolerance for high <span class="highlight">ambient</span> temperatures is a <span class="highlight">typical</span> thermoregulatory <span class="highlight">behavior</span> of avoidance. <span class="highlight">Seasonal</span> avoidance <span class="highlight">behavior</span> is extremely important in many amphibians. <span class="highlight">Species</span> whose <span class="highlight">habitat</span> lies in the <span class="highlight">temperate</span> latitudes are confronted by <span class="highlight">lethal</span> low temperatures in winter, while <span class="highlight">species</span> <span class="highlight"><span class="question10">dwelling</span></span> in <span class="highlight">semiarid</span> regions are <span class="highlight">exposed</span> to long dry, hot periods in summer.</p>
          <p>In amphibians <span class="highlight">hibernation</span> occurs in mud or deep holes away from <span class="highlight">frost</span>. North of the Pyrenees Mountains, the natterjack <span class="highlight">toad</span> offers a good example of <span class="highlight">hibernation</span>, passing the winter dug deep into sandy ground. Conversely, natterjacks in southern Spain <span class="highlight">remain</span> active during the <span class="highlight">mild</span> winters <span class="highlight">common</span> to the <span class="highlight">region</span> and are <span class="highlight">instead</span> forced into inactivity during the dry, hot summer <span class="highlight">season</span>. Summer estivation also occurs by burrowing into the ground or hiding in cool, deep rock crevasses to <span class="highlight">avoid</span> <span class="highlight">desiccation</span> and <span class="highlight">lethal</span> <span class="highlight">ambient</span> <span class="highlight">temperature</span>. <span class="question12">Amphibians are <span class="highlight">therefore</span> <span class="highlight">hardly</span> at <span class="highlight">mercy</span> of <span class="highlight">ambient</span> <span class="highlight">temperature</span>, since by means of the mechanisms described above they are more than <span class="highlight">exercise</span> some control over their body <span class="highlight">temperature</span>.</span></p>

The minimum temperature that remains active is minus 2 degrees, and the maximum temperature at which the frog stays active is 41 degrees above zero. So the A option is wrong.</p>
              <p>According to the original Andean toad Bufo spinulosus exposes itself immediately after sunrise on moist ground and <span class="question7">attains</span> its preferred body temperature by this means.

              <p>According to the original and diurnal and annual avoidance behaviors, which include moving to shelter during the day for cooling and hibernating or estivating, which corresponds to the C option. According to the original Nocturnal activity in amphibians with low tolerance for high ambient temperatures is a typical thermoregulatory behavior of avoidance. According to the original Physiological adaptations can assist amphibians in colonizing habitats where extreme conditions prevail. Where extreme conditions corresponds to the extreme or dangerous climate conditions in the D option. So the E option is wrong, and the best time to adjust body temperature is not after sunrise, but at night.</p>
              <p>According to the original Summer estivation also occurs by burrowing into the ground or hiding in cool, deep rock crevasses to avoid desiccation and lethal ambient temperature. So the F option is wrong, because the summer sleep also needs to dig a hole or hide in a stone crack.</p>
