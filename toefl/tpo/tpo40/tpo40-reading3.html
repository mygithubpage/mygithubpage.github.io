However, the idea that amphibians have no control whatsoever over their body <span class="highlight">temperature</span> has been proven false because their body <span class="highlight">temperature</span> does not always <span class="highlight"><span class="highlight">correspond</span></span> to the surrounding <span class="highlight">temperature</span>. While amphibians are poor thermoregulators, they do <span class="highlight">exercise</span> control over their body <span class="highlight">temperature</span> to a limited <span class="highlight">degree</span>.</p><p><span class="highlight">Physiological</span> adaptations can assist amphibians in colonizing habitats where <span class="highlight">extreme</span> conditions <span class="highlight">prevail</span>. The tolerance <span class="highlight">range</span> in body <span class="highlight">temperature</span> represents the <span class="highlight">range</span> of temperatures <span class="highlight">within</span> which a <span class="highlight">species</span> can <span class="highlight">survive</span>. One <span class="highlight">species</span> of North American <span class="highlight">newt</span> is still active when temperatures <span class="highlight">drop</span> to -2ï¿½C while one <span class="question2">South American frog</span> feels comfortable <span class="highlight">even</span> when temperatures measured to 41ï¿½C - the highest body <span class="highlight">temperature</span> measured in a free-ranging <span class="highlight">amphibian</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> Recently it has been shown that some North American frog and <span class="highlight">toad</span><span class="highlight">species</span> can <span class="highlight">survive</span> up to five days with a body <span class="highlight">temperature</span> of -6ï¿½C with <span class="highlight">approximately</span> one-third of their body fluids frozen. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> The other tissues are protected because they <span class="highlight">contain</span> the frost-protective agents glycerin or <span class="highlight">glucose</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span> Additionally, in many <span class="highlight">species</span> the tolerance boundaries are <span class="highlight">flexible</span> and can change as a result of acclimatization (long-term <span class="highlight">exposure</span> to <span class="highlight">particular</span> conditions). <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p><p>Frog <span class="highlight">species</span> that <span class="highlight">remain</span><span class="highlight">exposed</span> to the sun despite high diurnal (daytime) temperatures <span class="highlight">exhibit</span> some <span class="highlight">fascinating</span> modifications in the skin structure that <span class="highlight">function</span> as <span class="highlight">morphological</span> adaptations. Most <span class="highlight">amphibian</span> skin is fully water <span class="highlight">permeable</span> and is <span class="highlight">therefore</span> not a <span class="highlight">barrier</span> against <span class="highlight">evaporation</span> or <span class="highlight">solar</span><span class="highlight">radiation</span>. The African savanna frog Hyperolius viridiflavus stores guanine crystals in its skin, which enable it to better <span class="highlight">reflect</span><span class="highlight">solar</span><span class="highlight">radiation</span>, thus providing protection against overheating. The tree frog <span class="question4">Phyllomedusa sauvagei</span> responds to <span class="highlight">evaporative</span> losses with <span class="highlight">gland</span> secretions that provide a greasy <span class="highlight">film</span> over its entire body that helps prevent <span class="highlight">desiccation</span> (dehydration).</p><p>However, <span class="highlight">behavior</span> is by far the most important <span class="highlight">factor</span> in thermoregulation. The <span class="highlight">principal</span> elements in <span class="highlight">behavioral</span> thermoregulation are basking (heliothermy), heat <span class="highlight">exchange</span> with substrates such as rock or earth (thigmothermy), and diurnal and <span class="highlight">annual</span> avoidance behaviors, which include moving to <span class="highlight">shelter</span> during the day for cooling and hibernating or estivating (reducing <span class="highlight">activity</span> during cold or hot weather, <span class="highlight">respectively</span>). Heliothermy is especially <span class="highlight">common</span> among frogs and toads: it allows them to increase their body <span class="highlight">temperature</span> by more than 10ï¿½C. The <span class="question6">Andean <span class="highlight">toad</span> Bufo spinulosus</span> exposes itself immediately after sunrise on <span class="highlight">moist</span> ground and <span class="question7">attains</span> its preferred body <span class="highlight">temperature</span> by this means, long before either ground or <span class="highlight">air</span> is correspondingly warmed. A <span class="highlight">positive</span> side effect of <span class="question8">this <span class="highlight">approach</span></span> is that it accelerates the digestion of the <span class="highlight">prey</span> consumed <span class="highlight">overnight</span>, thus also accelerating growth. Thigmothermy is a <span class="highlight">behavior</span> present in most amphibians, although pressing against the ground serves a dual purpose: heat <span class="highlight">absorption</span> by <span class="highlight">conductivity</span> and water <span class="highlight">absorption</span><span class="highlight">through</span> the skin. The effect of thigmothermy is especially <span class="highlight">evident</span> in the Andean <span class="highlight">toad</span> during rainfall: its body <span class="highlight">temperature</span> corresponds to the <span class="highlight">temperature</span> of the warm earth and not to the much cooler <span class="highlight">air</span><span class="highlight">temperature</span>.</p><p>Avoidance <span class="highlight">behavior</span> occurs whenever <span class="highlight">physiological</span> and <span class="highlight">morphological</span> adaptations are <span class="highlight">insufficient</span> to <span class="highlight">maintain</span> body <span class="highlight">temperature</span><span class="highlight">within</span> the <span class="highlight">vital</span><span class="highlight">range</span>. <span class="highlight">Nocturnal</span><span class="highlight">activity</span> in amphibians with low tolerance for high <span class="highlight">ambient</span> temperatures is a <span class="highlight">typical</span> thermoregulatory <span class="highlight">behavior</span> of avoidance. <span class="highlight">Seasonal</span> avoidance <span class="highlight">behavior</span> is extremely important in many amphibians. <span class="highlight">Species</span> whose <span class="highlight">habitat</span> lies in the <span class="highlight">temperate</span> latitudes are confronted by <span class="highlight">lethal</span> low temperatures in winter, while <span class="highlight">species</span><span class="highlight"><span class="question10">dwelling</span></span> in <span class="highlight">semiarid</span> regions are <span class="highlight">exposed</span> to long dry, hot periods in summer.</p><p>In amphibians <span class="highlight">hibernation</span> occurs in mud or deep holes away from <span class="highlight">frost</span>. North of the Pyrenees Mountains, the natterjack <span class="highlight">toad</span> offers a good example of <span class="highlight">hibernation</span>, passing the winter dug deep into sandy ground. Conversely, natterjacks in southern Spain <span class="highlight">remain</span> active during the <span class="highlight">mild</span> winters <span class="highlight">common</span> to the <span class="highlight">region</span> and are <span class="highlight">instead</span> forced into inactivity during the dry, hot summer <span class="highlight">season</span>. Summer estivation also occurs by burrowing into the ground or hiding in cool, deep rock crevasses to <span class="highlight">avoid</span><span class="highlight">desiccation</span> and <span class="highlight">lethal</span><span class="highlight">ambient</span><span class="highlight">temperature</span>. <span class="question12">Amphibians are <span class="highlight">therefore</span><span class="highlight">hardly</span> at <span class="highlight">mercy</span> of <span class="highlight">ambient</span><span class="highlight">temperature</span>, since by means of the mechanisms described above they are more than <span class="highlight">exercise</span> some control over their body <span class="highlight">temperature</span>.</span></p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 1, what indicates that amphibians have some control over their body temperature?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

To make the point that an amphibian's temperature tolerance depends on a number of factors</p><p>B. To indicate how precise the range of body temperatures is for certain amphibians</p><p>C. To contrast its ability to adapt to that of the North American newt</p><p>D. To help illustrate the range of environmental conditions to which amphibians have adapted</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" D"><p>According to <span class="question2">South American frog</span> positioning to the third sentence of the second paragraph of the article, One species of North American newt is still active when temperatures drop to -2ï¿½C while one <span class="question2">South American frog</span> feels comfortable even when temperatures rise to 41ï¿½C. The species of North American cockroaches is still active when the temperature drops to minus 2 degrees, when a <span class="question2">South American frog</span> still feels comfortable when the temperature rises to 41 degrees. So the D option is correct to illustrate the range of environmental conditions that an amphibious animal can adapt to.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 2, what allows some North American frog and toad species to survive in ambient temperatures well below freezing?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Their internal body temperatures never fall below -6ï¿½C.</p><p>B. They do not remain at temperatures below freezing for very long periods of time.</p><p>C. Their tolerance boundaries are flexible</p><p>D. Some of their body tissues contain substances that prevent freezing.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>According to the original The other tissues are protected because they contain the frost-protective agents glycerin or glucose. It is known that other tissues in these organisms contain substances that can withstand cold. The frost-protective agents corresponds to the prevent freezing in the D option. So the D option is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>"<span class="highlight"><span class="question4">Phyllomedusa sauvagei</span></span>" is mentioned as an example of a frog with an adaptation that</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. protects its glandular system</p><p>B. helps reduce its secretions</p><p>C. increases the amount of solar radiation that its skin can reflect</p><p>D. modifies its skin structure to protect against the drying effects of the sun</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" D"><p>According to the original The tree frog <span class="question4">Phyllomedusa sauvagei</span> responds to evaporative losses with gland secretion that provides a greasy film over its entire body that prevents prevent symptom (dehydration). We can see that the D option is a synonym substitution, changing its skin structure to avoid dehydration and drying . Where prevent desiccation corresponds to protect against the drying effects of the sun in the D option, so the D option is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Paragraph 4 mentions each of the following as an example of behavioral thermoregulation EXCEPT</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. pressing against the ground</p><p>B. speeding up of the metabolism</p><p>C. reducing activity during the summer</p><p>D. adjusting exposure to the sun</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The original pressing against the ground serves a dual purpose heat absorption by conductivity and water absorption through the skin corresponding to the A option.</p><p>The original reducing activity during cold or hot weather, respectively corresponds to the C option.</p><p>The original which includes moving to shelter during the day for cooling and hibernating or estivating the corresponding D option.</p><p>Only the B option is not mentioned, so choose the B option.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The "<span class="highlight">Andean toad Bufo spinulosus</span>" illustrates which of the following behavioral modifications?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

Thus, although amphibians use the various mechanisms described above, they have hardly any control of their body temperature</p><p>B. Thus, by the mechanisms described above, amphibians are quite capable of controlling their body temperature to survive extreme ambient temperatures.</p><p>C. Thus, unless they can use the mechanisms described above, amphibians are at the mercy of ambient temperatures.</p><p>D. Thus, the mechanisms described above give amphibians control over much more than just their body temperature</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The bright sentence means that amphibians are rarely in an environment with a good surrounding temperature. They can survive by exercising their own body temperature, so only the B option fits the sentence.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>On the other hand, amphibians in very hot climates use secretions from the mucus glands to decrease their temperature through evaporative cooling on the skin..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The sentence to be inserted means that, on the other hand, in a particularly hot climate, amphibians use secretions from mucous glands to lower their temperature by evaporative cooling on the skin. And the sentence in the later sentence is incrementally related, so only the C option matches the context, so the C option is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question14" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>A number of factors may help account for the difference in biodiversity between low and high latitudes.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.Frogs, which survive temperature ranges from as low as -2ï¿½C to as high as 41ï¿½C, are evidence that amphibians are independent of ambient temperatures</p><p>B.Amphibians can increase their body temperature by exposing themselves to the sun (heliothermy) and by pressing against the ground (thigmothermy).</p><p>C.Avoidance behaviors, such as sheltering from the sun, as well as estivation and hibernation,help amphibians control their body temperature.</p><p>D.Physical adaptations offer amphibians a number of ways to protect against extreme or dangerous climate conditions.</p><p>E.Sunrise is the time when some amphibian species have the greatest need for thermoregulatory mechanisms.</p><p>F.Hibernation always involves digging deep holes in mud or sand, whereas estivation sometimes involves nothing more than hiding in deep rock crevasses.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="BCD"><p>According to the original One species of North American newt is still active when temperatures drop to -2ï¿½C while one <span class="question2">South American frog</span> feels comfortable even when temperatures rise to 41ï¿½C-the highest body temperature measured in a free-ranging amphibian. The minimum temperature that remains active is minus 2 degrees, and the maximum temperature at which the frog stays active is 41 degrees above zero. So the A option is wrong.</p><p>According to the original Andean toad Bufo spinulosus exposes itself immediately after sunrise on moist ground and <span class="question7">attains</span> its preferred body temperature by this means. Among them exposing itself immediately after sunrise corresponds to exposing themselves to the sun in the B option.</p><p>And the original Thigmothermy is a Behavior present in most amphibians, yet pressing against the ground serves a dual purpose.</p><p>According to the original and diurnal and annual avoidance behaviors, which include moving to shelter during the day for cooling and hibernating or estivating, which corresponds to the C option. According to the original Nocturnal activity in amphibians with low tolerance for high ambient temperatures is a typical thermoregulatory behavior of avoidance. According to the original Physiological adaptations can assist amphibians in colonizing habitats where extreme conditions prevail. Where extreme conditions corresponds to the extreme or dangerous climate conditions in the D option. So the E option is wrong, and the best time to adjust body temperature is not after sunrise, but at night.</p><p>According to the original Summer estivation also occurs by burrowing into the ground or hiding in cool, deep rock crevasses to avoid desiccation and lethal ambient temperature. So the F option is wrong, because the summer sleep also needs to dig a hole or hide in a stone crack.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
