Explain why.</p></section><section id="sample-response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><article><p>Well, in my opinion, I would definitely agree with the point that printed materials will never be replaced by the electronic ones. The first reason and also the most important one I wanna say is that, printed materials like books and newspapers actually are a kind of culture throughout the whole world which represents the wisdom of our ancestors.
