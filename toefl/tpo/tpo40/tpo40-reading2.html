The tropics <span class="highlight">contain</span> many more <span class="highlight">species</span><span class="highlight"><span class="question2">overall</span></span> than an <span class="highlight">equivalent</span> area at the higher latitudes. This seems to be true for many different groups of animals and plants. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span></p><p>Why is it that higher latitudes have <span class="highlight">lower</span> diversities than the tropics? <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> Perhaps it is <span class="highlight">simply</span> a matter of land area. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span><span class="question3">The tropics <span class="highlight">contain</span> a larger surface area of land than higher latitudes - a fact that is not always <span class="highlight">evident</span> when we examine commonly used projections of Earth's curved surface, since this tends to <span class="highlight">exaggerate</span> the areas of land in the higher latitudes - and some biogeographers regard the differences in <span class="highlight">diversity</span> as a <span class="highlight">reflection</span> of this effect.</span><span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span> But an <span class="highlight">analysis</span> of the <span class="highlight">data</span> by biologist <span class="question4">Klaus Rohde</span> does not support this explanation. Although area may <span class="highlight">contribute</span> to <span class="highlight">biodiversity</span>, it is certainly not the whole story; <span class="highlight">otherwise</span>, large landmasses would always be richer in <span class="highlight">species</span>.</p><p><span class="highlight">Productivity</span> seems to be involved <span class="highlight">instead</span>, though perhaps its influence is indirect. Where conditions are most <span class="highlight">suitable</span> for plant growth - that is, where temperatures are <span class="highlight">relatively</span> high and <span class="highlight">uniform</span> and where there is an <span class="highlight">ample</span><span class="highlight">supply</span> of water - one usually finds large masses of <span class="highlight">vegetation</span>. This leads to a <span class="highlight">complex</span> structure in the layers of plant <span class="highlight">material</span> In a <span class="highlight">tropical</span> rain forest, for example, a very large <span class="highlight">quantity</span> of plant <span class="highlight">material</span> builds up above the surface of the ground. There is also a large <span class="highlight">mass</span> of <span class="highlight">material</span>, developed below ground as <span class="highlight">root</span> tissues, but this is less <span class="highlight">apparent</span>. Careful <span class="highlight">analysis</span> of the above ground <span class="highlight">material</span> reveals that it is arranged in a <span class="highlight">series</span> of layers, the <span class="highlight"><span class="question6">precise</span></span> number of layers varying with age and the nature of the forest. The arrangement of the biological <span class="highlight">mass</span> ("biomass") of the <span class="highlight">vegetation</span> into layered forms is termed its "structure" (as <span class="highlight">opposed</span> to its "<span class="highlight">composition</span>", which refers to the <span class="highlight">species</span> of organisms forming the <span class="highlight">community</span>). Structure is <span class="highlight">essentially</span> the <span class="highlight">architecture</span> of <span class="highlight">vegetation</span>, and as in the case of <span class="highlight">tropical</span> forests, it can be extremely <span class="highlight">complicated</span>.In a <span class="question9"><span class="highlight">mature</span><span class="highlight">floodplain</span><span class="highlight">tropical</span> forest in the Amazon River <span class="highlight">basin</span></span>, the <span class="highlight">canopy</span> (the <span class="highlight">uppermost</span> layers of a forest, formed by the crowns of trees) takes on a stratified structure. There are three <span class="highlight">clear</span> peaks in leaf cover at heights of <span class="highlight">approximately</span> 3, 6, and 30 meters above the ground; and the very highest <span class="highlight">layer</span>, at 50 meters, corresponds to the very tall trees that stand free of the main <span class="highlight">canopy</span> and form an open <span class="highlight">layer</span> of their own. So, such a forest contains <span class="highlight">essentially</span> four layers of <span class="highlight">canopy</span>. Forests in <span class="highlight">temperate</span> lands often have just two <span class="highlight">canopy</span> layers, so they have much less <span class="highlight">complex</span><span class="highlight">architecture</span>.</p><p>Structure has a strong influence on the animal life inhabiting a site. It forms the <span class="highlight">spatial</span> environment <span class="highlight">within</span> which an animal feeds, moves around shelters, lives, and breeds. It <span class="highlight">even</span> affects the <span class="highlight">climate</span> on a very <span class="highlight">local</span><span class="highlight">level</span> (the "microclimate") by influencing light intensity, <span class="highlight">humidity</span>, and both the <span class="highlight">range</span> and extremes of <span class="highlight">temperature</span>. An area of grassland <span class="highlight">vegetation</span> with very simple structure, for example, has a very different microclimate at the ground <span class="highlight">level</span> from that experienced in the upper <span class="highlight">canopy</span>. Wind speeds are <span class="highlight">lower</span>, temperatures are <span class="highlight">lower</span> during the day (but warmer at night), and the <span class="highlight">relative</span><span class="highlight">humidity</span> is much greater near the ground. The <span class="highlight">complexity</span> of the microclimate is closely related to the <span class="highlight">complexity</span> of structure in <span class="highlight">vegetation</span>, and generally speaking, the more <span class="highlight">complex</span> the structure of <span class="highlight">vegetation</span>, the more <span class="highlight">species</span> of animal are able to make a living there. The high plant biomass of the tropics leads to a greater <span class="highlight">spatial</span><span class="highlight">complexity</span> in the environment, and this leads to a higher <span class="highlight">potential</span> for <span class="highlight">diversity</span> in the living things that can <span class="highlight">occupy</span> a <span class="highlight">region</span>. The climates of the higher latitudes are generally less <span class="highlight">favorable</span> for the <span class="highlight">accumulation</span> of large quantities of biomass; hence, the structure of <span class="highlight">vegetation</span> is simpler and the animal <span class="highlight">diversity</span> is <span class="highlight"><span class="question12">consequently</span></span><span class="highlight">lower</span>.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">distributed</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. represented</p><p>B. collected</p><p>C. spread</p><p>D. managed</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Distribute, spread.</p><p>Represented, performance, description.

So the A option is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Some biogeographers believe that the tropics have larger surface areas than they actually do because of the distortions produced by projections of Earth's curved surface.</p><p>B. High levels of diversity in the tropics are sometimes attributed to the fact that the tropics have more surface area of land than the higher latitudes do, though distortions in commonly used projections may seem to suggest otherwise.</p><p>C. Because biogeographers disagree on whether or not the tropics are correctly represented in projections of Earth s surface, it is difficult to determine the relationship their surface area has to their diversity.</p><p>D. Most biogeographers agree that the tropics contain a larger surface area of land than higher latitudes do,but they disagree on whether or not the tropics' level of diversity is a reflection of that larger surface area.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The sentence sentence backbone for The tropics contain a larger surface area of land than higher latitudes - a fact that is not always evident when we tended to use projections of Earth's curved surface. The tropics have a larger surface area than the high latitudes when we inspect The mapping of the earth's surface is not obvious. The causal relationship between these tends to exaggerate the areas of land in the higher latitudes, which corresponds to the tropics have more surface area of land than the higher latitudes do. Therefore, the B option is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the author mention "<span class="highlight"><span class="question4">Klaus Rohde</span></span>" in the passage?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

High temperatures</p><p>B. Steady temperatures</p><p>C. High latitude</p><p>D. Plentiful water</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>According to the original where temperatures are relatively high and uniform and where there is an ample supply of water, the conditions suitable for plant growth are that the temperature is high and stable, and there is sufficient water. So the C option is wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question6">precise</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. exact</p><p>B. predicted</p><p>C. approximate</p><p>D. required</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" A"><p>Precise, accurate.</p><p>Exact, accurate, accurate.

The height of the very tallest trees in the forest</p><p>B. The number of layers of canopy</p><p>C. The frequency of floods along the plain</p><p>D. The age of the root tissues below the ground</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>According to the original exact number of layers varying with age and the nature of the forest, it can be seen that the reason for the complexity of the forest structure is the number of canopy layers. The exact number of layers corresponds to the number of layers in the B option. So the B option is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 3, which of the following statements best describes the difference between structure and composition?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. "Structure" refers to the arrangement of plant material above the ground surface; "composition" refers to the arrangement of root tissues below the surface of the ground.</p><p>B. "Structure" refers to the age of the forest; "composition" refers to the forest's nature.</p><p>C. "Structure" refers to the arrangement of plant species in an area; "composition" refers to which plant species are present in the area.</p><p>D. "Structure" refers to the shape of the forest canopy; "composition" refers to the number of crowns forming the canopy.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>According to The arrangement of the biological mass ("biomass") of the vegetation into layered forms is termed its "structure" (as opposed to its "composition", which refers to the species of organisms forming the community) It is the distribution of plant species in a region. The composition refers to which plant species is in the area. So the C option is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the author mention "<span class="highlight">mature floodplain tropical forest in the Amazon River basin</span>" in the passage?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To dispute the idea that tropical forests are arranged in layers</p><p>B. To give an example of the complex architecture vegetation displays in a dense area</p><p>C. To suggest that the layers of canopy in some tropical forests can exceed the usual three or four</p><p>D. To emphasize that the layers of canopy in a tropical forest give evidence of the number of layers of root tissues below the ground</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="mature floodplain tropical forest in the Amazon River basin B"><p>According to the original In a mature floodplain tropical forest in the Amazon River basin, the canopy (the uppermost layers of a forest, formed by the crowns of trees) takes on a stratified structure. There are three clear peaks in leaf cover at heights of approximately 3 , 6, and 30 meters above the ground; and the very highest layer, at 50 meters, facing to the very tall trees that stand free of the main canopy and form an open layer of their own. So, such a forest contains essentially four The layers of canopy. Forests in temperate lands often have just two canopy layers, so they have much less complex architecture. The article refers to the abundance of floodplain rainforests in the Amazon basin to illustrate the complexity of its structure, where so they have much less complex architecture The complex architecture corresponds to an example of the complex architecture in the B option, so the B option is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the following is NOT mentioned in paragraph 4 as an aspect of microclimate?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Temperature range</p><p>B. Relative humidity</p><p>C. Light intensity</p><p>D. Seasonal variations</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>According to the keyword microclimate to the third sentence, It even affects the climate on a very local level (the "microclimate") by influencing light intensity, humidity, and both the range and extremes of temperature. Only the D option is not mentioned, So choose D.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What can be inferred from paragraph 4 about a region with a high level of diversity of animal species?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It also has a high level of plant species diversity.</p><p>B. It has relatively few microclimates</p><p>C. It develops a less complex structure than does a region with a high plant species diversity.</p><p>D. It develops a biomass similar to that of higher latitudes</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>According to the keyword a high level of diversity of animal species, the high plant biomass of the tropics leads to a greater spatial complexity in the environment, and this leads to a higher potential for diversity in the living things. That can occupy a region. It is also known that it also has a large number of plant species diversity. So the A option is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question12">consequently</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. usually</p><p>B. obviously</p><p>C. however</p><p>D. therefore</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" D"><p>Eyes, so, so.</p><p>Usually, usually.
