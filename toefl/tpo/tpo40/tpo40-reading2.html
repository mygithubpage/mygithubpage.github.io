            <b>Latitude and Biodiversity</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>When we look at the way in which <span class="underline">biodiversity</span> (biological <span class="underline">diversity</span>) is <span class="light">distributed</span> over the land surface of the <span class="underline">planet</span>, we find that it is far from <span class="underline">even</span>. The tropics <span class="underline">contain</span> many more <span class="underline">species</span> <span class="underline">overall</span> than an <span class="underline">equivalent</span> area at the higher latitudes. This seems to be true for many different groups of animals and plants. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span></p>
          <p>Why is it that higher latitudes have <span class="underline">lower</span> diversities than the tropics? <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> Perhaps it is <span class="underline">simply</span> a matter of land area. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span> The tropics <span class="underline">contain</span> a larger surface area of land than higher latitudes - a fact that is not always <span class="underline">evident</span> when we examine commonly used projections of Earth's curved surface, since this tends to <span class="underline">exaggerate</span> the areas of land in the higher latitudes - and some biogeographers regard the differences in <span class="underline">diversity</span> as a <span class="underline">reflection</span> of this effect. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span> But an <span class="underline">analysis</span> of the <span class="underline">data</span> by biologist Klaus Rohde does not support this explanation. Although area may <span class="underline">contribute</span> to <span class="underline">biodiversity</span>, it is certainly not the whole story; <span class="underline">otherwise</span>, large landmasses would always be richer in <span class="underline">species</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="underline">Productivity</span> seems to be involved <span class="underline">instead</span>, though perhaps its influence is indirect. Where conditions are most <span class="underline">suitable</span> for plant growth - that is, where temperatures are <span class="underline">relatively</span> high and <span class="underline">uniform</span> and where there is an <span class="underline">ample</span> <span class="underline">supply</span> of water - one usually finds large masses of <span class="underline">vegetation</span>. This leads to a <span class="underline">complex</span> structure in the layers of plant <span class="underline">material</span> In a <span class="underline">tropical</span> rain forest, for example, a very large <span class="underline">quantity</span> of plant <span class="underline">material</span> builds up above the surface of the ground. There is also a large <span class="underline">mass</span> of <span class="underline">material</span>, developed below ground as <span class="underline">root</span> tissues, but this is less <span class="underline">apparent</span>. Careful <span class="underline">analysis</span> of the above ground <span class="underline">material</span> reveals that it is arranged in a <span class="underline">series</span> of layers, the <span class="underline">precise</span> number of layers varying with age and the nature of the forest. The arrangement of the biological <span class="underline">mass</span> ("biomass") of the <span class="underline">vegetation</span> into layered forms is termed its "structure" (as <span class="underline">opposed</span> to its "<span class="underline">composition</span>", which refers to the <span class="underline">species</span> of organisms forming the <span class="underline">community</span>). Structure is <span class="underline">essentially</span> the <span class="underline">architecture</span> of <span class="underline">vegetation</span>, and as in the case of <span class="underline">tropical</span> forests, it can be extremely <span class="underline">complicated</span>.In a <span class="underline">mature</span> <span class="underline">floodplain</span> <span class="underline">tropical</span> forest in the Amazon River <span class="underline">basin</span>, the <span class="underline">canopy</span> (the <span class="underline">uppermost</span> layers of a forest, formed by the crowns of trees) takes on a stratified structure. There are three <span class="underline">clear</span> peaks in leaf cover at heights of <span class="underline">approximately</span> 3, 6, and 30 meters above the ground; and the very highest <span class="underline">layer</span>, at 50 meters, corresponds to the very tall trees that stand free of the main <span class="underline">canopy</span> and form an open <span class="underline">layer</span> of their own. So, such a forest contains <span class="underline">essentially</span> four layers of <span class="underline">canopy</span>. Forests in <span class="underline">temperate</span> lands often have just two <span class="underline">canopy</span> layers, so they have much less <span class="underline">complex</span> <span class="underline">architecture</span>.</p>
          <p>Structure has a strong influence on the animal life inhabiting a site. It forms the <span class="underline">spatial</span> environment <span class="underline">within</span> which an animal feeds, moves around shelters, lives, and breeds. It <span class="underline">even</span> affects the <span class="underline">climate</span> on a very <span class="underline">local</span> <span class="underline">level</span> (the "microclimate") by influencing light intensity, <span class="underline">humidity</span>, and both the <span class="underline">range</span> and extremes of <span class="underline">temperature</span>. An area of grassland <span class="underline">vegetation</span> with very simple structure, for example, has a very different microclimate at the ground <span class="underline">level</span> from that experienced in the upper <span class="underline">canopy</span>. Wind speeds are <span class="underline">lower</span>, temperatures are <span class="underline">lower</span> during the day (but warmer at night), and the <span class="underline">relative</span> <span class="underline">humidity</span> is much greater near the ground. The <span class="underline">complexity</span> of the microclimate is closely related to the <span class="underline">complexity</span> of structure in <span class="underline">vegetation</span>, and generally speaking, the more <span class="underline">complex</span> the structure of <span class="underline">vegetation</span>, the more <span class="underline">species</span> of animal are able to make a living there. The high plant biomass of the tropics leads to a greater <span class="underline">spatial</span> <span class="underline">complexity</span> in the environment, and this leads to a higher <span class="underline">potential</span> for <span class="underline">diversity</span> in the living things that can <span class="underline">occupy</span> a <span class="underline">region</span>. The climates of the higher latitudes are generally less <span class="underline">favorable</span> for the <span class="underline">accumulation</span> of large quantities of biomass; hence, the structure of <span class="underline">vegetation</span> is simpler and the animal <span class="underline">diversity</span> is <span class="underline">consequently</span> <span class="underline">lower</span>.</p>
