          <h4 class="w3-center">Latitude and Biodiversity</h4>
          <p>When we look at the way in which <span class="highlight">biodiversity</span> (biological <span class="highlight">diversity</span>) is <span class="highlight question1">distributed</span> over the land surface of the <span class="highlight">planet</span>, we find that it is far from <span class="highlight">even</span>. The tropics <span class="highlight">contain</span> many more <span class="highlight">species</span> <span class="highlight"><span class="question2">overall</span></span> than an <span class="highlight">equivalent</span> area at the higher latitudes. This seems to be true for many different groups of animals and plants. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span></p>
          <p>Why is it that higher latitudes have <span class="highlight">lower</span> diversities than the tropics? <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> Perhaps it is <span class="highlight">simply</span> a matter of land area. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span> <span class="question3">The tropics <span class="highlight">contain</span> a larger surface area of land than higher latitudes - a fact that is not always <span class="highlight">evident</span> when we examine commonly used projections of Earth's curved surface, since this tends to <span class="highlight">exaggerate</span> the areas of land in the higher latitudes - and some biogeographers regard the differences in <span class="highlight">diversity</span> as a <span class="highlight">reflection</span> of this effect.</span> <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span> But an <span class="highlight">analysis</span> of the <span class="highlight">data</span> by biologist <span class="question4">Klaus Rohde</span> does not support this explanation. Although area may <span class="highlight">contribute</span> to <span class="highlight">biodiversity</span>, it is certainly not the whole story; <span class="highlight">otherwise</span>, large landmasses would always be richer in <span class="highlight">species</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="highlight">Productivity</span> seems to be involved <span class="highlight">instead</span>, though perhaps its influence is indirect. Where conditions are most <span class="highlight">suitable</span> for plant growth - that is, where temperatures are <span class="highlight">relatively</span> high and <span class="highlight">uniform</span> and where there is an <span class="highlight">ample</span> <span class="highlight">supply</span> of water - one usually finds large masses of <span class="highlight">vegetation</span>. This leads to a <span class="highlight">complex</span> structure in the layers of plant <span class="highlight">material</span> In a <span class="highlight">tropical</span> rain forest, for example, a very large <span class="highlight">quantity</span> of plant <span class="highlight">material</span> builds up above the surface of the ground. There is also a large <span class="highlight">mass</span> of <span class="highlight">material</span>, developed below ground as <span class="highlight">root</span> tissues, but this is less <span class="highlight">apparent</span>. Careful <span class="highlight">analysis</span> of the above ground <span class="highlight">material</span> reveals that it is arranged in a <span class="highlight">series</span> of layers, the <span class="highlight"><span class="question6">precise</span></span> number of layers varying with age and the nature of the forest. The arrangement of the biological <span class="highlight">mass</span> ("biomass") of the <span class="highlight">vegetation</span> into layered forms is termed its "structure" (as <span class="highlight">opposed</span> to its "<span class="highlight">composition</span>", which refers to the <span class="highlight">species</span> of organisms forming the <span class="highlight">community</span>). Structure is <span class="highlight">essentially</span> the <span class="highlight">architecture</span> of <span class="highlight">vegetation</span>, and as in the case of <span class="highlight">tropical</span> forests, it can be extremely <span class="highlight">complicated</span>.In a <span class="question9"><span class="highlight">mature</span> <span class="highlight">floodplain</span> <span class="highlight">tropical</span> forest in the Amazon River <span class="highlight">basin</span></span>, the <span class="highlight">canopy</span> (the <span class="highlight">uppermost</span> layers of a forest, formed by the crowns of trees) takes on a stratified structure. There are three <span class="highlight">clear</span> peaks in leaf cover at heights of <span class="highlight">approximately</span> 3, 6, and 30 meters above the ground; and the very highest <span class="highlight">layer</span>, at 50 meters, corresponds to the very tall trees that stand free of the main <span class="highlight">canopy</span> and form an open <span class="highlight">layer</span> of their own. So, such a forest contains <span class="highlight">essentially</span> four layers of <span class="highlight">canopy</span>. Forests in <span class="highlight">temperate</span> lands often have just two <span class="highlight">canopy</span> layers, so they have much less <span class="highlight">complex</span> <span class="highlight">architecture</span>.</p>
          <p>Structure has a strong influence on the animal life inhabiting a site. It forms the <span class="highlight">spatial</span> environment <span class="highlight">within</span> which an animal feeds, moves around shelters, lives, and breeds. It <span class="highlight">even</span> affects the <span class="highlight">climate</span> on a very <span class="highlight">local</span> <span class="highlight">level</span> (the "microclimate") by influencing light intensity, <span class="highlight">humidity</span>, and both the <span class="highlight">range</span> and extremes of <span class="highlight">temperature</span>. An area of grassland <span class="highlight">vegetation</span> with very simple structure, for example, has a very different microclimate at the ground <span class="highlight">level</span> from that experienced in the upper <span class="highlight">canopy</span>. Wind speeds are <span class="highlight">lower</span>, temperatures are <span class="highlight">lower</span> during the day (but warmer at night), and the <span class="highlight">relative</span> <span class="highlight">humidity</span> is much greater near the ground. The <span class="highlight">complexity</span> of the microclimate is closely related to the <span class="highlight">complexity</span> of structure in <span class="highlight">vegetation</span>, and generally speaking, the more <span class="highlight">complex</span> the structure of <span class="highlight">vegetation</span>, the more <span class="highlight">species</span> of animal are able to make a living there. The high plant biomass of the tropics leads to a greater <span class="highlight">spatial</span> <span class="highlight">complexity</span> in the environment, and this leads to a higher <span class="highlight">potential</span> for <span class="highlight">diversity</span> in the living things that can <span class="highlight">occupy</span> a <span class="highlight">region</span>. The climates of the higher latitudes are generally less <span class="highlight">favorable</span> for the <span class="highlight">accumulation</span> of large quantities of biomass; hence, the structure of <span class="highlight">vegetation</span> is simpler and the animal <span class="highlight">diversity</span> is <span class="highlight"><span class="question12">consequently</span></span> <span class="highlight">lower</span>.</p>

The causal relationship between these tends to exaggerate the areas of land in the higher latitudes, which corresponds to the tropics have more surface area of land than the higher latitudes do.

            <div class="explanation">
              <p>According to the original In a mature floodplain tropical forest in the Amazon River basin, the canopy (the uppermost layers of a forest, formed by the crowns of trees) takes on a stratified structure. There are three clear peaks in leaf cover at heights of approximately 3 , 6, and 30 meters above the ground; and the very highest layer, at 50 meters, facing to the very tall trees that stand free of the main canopy and form an open layer of their own. So, such a forest contains essentially four The layers of canopy. Forests in temperate lands often have just two canopy layers, so they have much less complex architecture. The article refers to the abundance of floodplain rainforests in the Amazon basin to illustrate the complexity of its structure, where so they have much less complex architecture The complex architecture corresponds to an example of the complex architecture in the B option, so the B option is correct.</p>
