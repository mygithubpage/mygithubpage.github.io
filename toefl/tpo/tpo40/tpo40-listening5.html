            <span class="time" data-times="6.18" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Listen to part of a lecture in an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> science class.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="8.11" data-time="6.18">[00:06.18]</span>Professor:Now, over the next few weeks, we're <span class="highlight">gonna</span> <span class="highlight">focus</span> on <span class="highlight">carbon</span> and its role in what's known as the "greenhouse effect." <span class="time" data-times="2.36" data-time="14.29">[00:14.29]</span>Everyone knows what that is, right? <span class="time" data-times="1.88" data-time="16.65">[00:16.65]</span>But let's make sure anyway. <span class="time" data-times="1.2" data-time="18.53">[00:18.53]</span>Yes, Karlie?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.66" data-time="19.73">[00:19.73]</span>Student:The greenhouse effect is when gases in Earth's <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span> act like the glass in a greenhouse or a hothouse. <span class="time" data-times="2.52" data-time="26.39">[00:26.39]</span>They <span class="highlight">trap</span> in heat which warms up the earth.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.46" data-time="28.91">[00:28.91]</span>Professor:Gases like?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.16" data-time="30.37">[00:30.37]</span>Student:Um, water <span class="highlight">vapor</span>? <span class="highlight">Carbon</span> <span class="highlight">dioxide</span>?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.82" data-time="33.53">[00:33.53]</span>Professor:Right. <span class="highlight">Carbon</span> <span class="highlight">dioxide</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.92" data-time="36.35">[00:36.35]</span>We hear a lot about <span class="highlight">carbon</span> these days, no?<span class="time" data-times="5.36" data-time="39.27">[00:39.27]</span> <span class="highlight">Carbon</span> emissions, <span class="highlight">carbon</span> burning, leaving a <span class="highlight">carbon</span> footprint. <span class="time" data-times="5.39" data-time="44.63">[00:44.63]</span>So it'd be easy to <span class="highlight">assume</span> that any form of <span class="highlight">carbon</span> burning is necessarily a bad thing. <span class="time" data-times="3.42" data-time="50.02">[00:50.02]</span>But the fact is: it's not quite that simple. <span class="time" data-times="11.46" data-time="53.44">[00:53.44]</span>So we're <span class="highlight">gonna</span> <span class="highlight">focus</span> today on the <span class="highlight">difference</span> between good, bad, and well, the, not so bad, the potentially okay <span class="highlight">carbon</span> burning.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3" data-time="64.9">[01:04.90]</span>Student:OK. Good <span class="highlight">carbon</span> burning. <span class="time" data-times="4.96" data-time="67.9">[01:07.90]</span>Well, we all have a <span class="highlight">personal</span> <span class="highlight">stake</span> in this because burning <span class="highlight">carbon</span> is the basis of life. <span class="time" data-times="3.75" data-time="72.86">[01:12.86]</span>We wouldn't be here if we ourselves weren't burning <span class="highlight">carbon</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.79" data-time="76.61">[01:16.61]</span>Basically, all living things burn <span class="highlight">carbon</span> to <span class="highlight">survive</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.8" data-time="81.4">[01:21.40]</span>Usually this happens at the cellular <span class="highlight">level</span> and what's burned is <span class="highlight">carbon</span> in the form of sugars, <span class="highlight">glucose</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="7.94" data-time="88.2">[01:28.20]</span>Professor:<span class="highlight">Oxygen</span> gets chemically combined with sugars in our cells and the energy produced from that <span class="highlight">reaction</span> is then used to power the cells. <span class="time" data-times="7.4" data-time="96.14">[01:36.14]</span>So just by <span class="highlight">breathing</span> you could say we are all <span class="highlight">guilty</span> of <span class="highlight">carbon</span> <span class="highlight">emission</span> and <span class="highlight">contribute</span> to the <span class="highlight">amount</span> of <span class="highlight">carbon</span> in the <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.64" data-time="103.54">[01:43.54]</span>Student:Um, another thing about <span class="highlight">atmospheric</span> carbon: it keeps us from freezing. <span class="time" data-times="9.88" data-time="110.18">[01:50.18]</span>Because without <span class="highlight">carbon</span> and other greenhouse gases, our <span class="highlight">planet</span> would be the same <span class="highlight">temperature</span> as outer <span class="highlight">space</span>, around four degrees above <span class="highlight">absolute</span> zero. <span class="time" data-times="2.51" data-time="120.06">[02:00.06]</span>And there's nothing going on at that <span class="highlight">temperature</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.8" data-time="122.57">[02:02.57]</span>No possibility of life of any <span class="highlight">sort</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.76" data-time="125.37">[02:05.37]</span>So without <span class="highlight">atmospheric</span> <span class="highlight">carbon</span>, life couldn't exist on Earth.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.78" data-time="130.13">[02:10.13]</span>Professor:Now, another thing to remember is that <span class="highlight">carbon</span> is always being removed from the <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span>. <span class="time" data-times="1.87" data-time="136.91">[02:16.91]</span>It gets used up. <span class="time" data-times="4.72" data-time="138.78">[02:18.78]</span>Largely it is consumed by plant life <span class="highlight">through</span> <span class="highlight">photosynthesis</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.38" data-time="143.5">[02:23.50]</span>Also, it dissolves in the oceans or gets stored deep in the ocean. <span class="time" data-times="10.75" data-time="148.88">[02:28.88]</span>You have <span class="highlight">shellfish</span> that use the CO2 dissolved in the water to make <span class="highlight">carbonate</span> shells and when they die, they fall to the ocean floor and the <span class="highlight">carbon</span> gets sequestered down there.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="9" data-time="159.63">[02:39.63]</span>Student:So with all this <span class="highlight">carbon</span> <span class="highlight">constantly</span> being <span class="highlight">depleted</span> from the <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span>, we really need to keep <span class="highlight">carbon</span> <span class="highlight">output</span> up to a certain point.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.16" data-time="168.63">[02:48.63]</span>Professor:So why all the bad <span class="highlight">press</span> for burning <span class="highlight">carbon</span>?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.81" data-time="173.79">[02:53.79]</span>Student:Well, turns out it's the <span class="highlight">source</span> of the <span class="highlight">carbon</span> being burned that's the key. <span class="time" data-times="8.02" data-time="178.6">[02:58.60]</span>It's in fact the burning of what we call "<span class="highlight">fossil</span> carbon" that creates the imbalance: <span class="highlight">fossil</span> fuels, <span class="highlight">coal</span>, oil, natural gas.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.53" data-time="186.62">[03:06.62]</span>Professor:These substances are all mined. <span class="time" data-times="3.92" data-time="189.15">[03:09.15]</span>We have to dig them up or <span class="highlight">drill</span> a well to <span class="highlight">release</span> them. <span class="time" data-times="4.72" data-time="193.07">[03:13.07]</span>And this is <span class="highlight">carbon</span> that was in the <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span> millions of years ago.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="10.73" data-time="197.79">[03:17.79]</span>Student:So what happens is: when we burn this <span class="highlight">carbon</span>, ok, it doesn't really <span class="highlight">release</span> a whole lot compared to the <span class="highlight">amount</span> that's already there in the <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span>, but it adds to the pool. <span class="time" data-times="2.35" data-time="208.52">[03:28.52]</span>And over years it accumulates.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.45" data-time="210.87">[03:30.87]</span>Professor:Think of the <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span> as a big bathtub. <span class="time" data-times="3.35" data-time="214.32">[03:34.32]</span>It's basically already filled to the brim with <span class="highlight">carbon</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.05" data-time="217.67">[03:37.67]</span>When we start adding <span class="highlight">fossil</span> <span class="highlight">carbon</span> into the mix, it starts to <span class="highlight">spill</span> over. <span class="time" data-times="11.68" data-time="222.72">[03:42.72]</span>That being said, there's actually a <span class="highlight">category</span> that's in-between: what we call biomass fuels, probably the most <span class="highlight">common</span> one is wood.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.95" data-time="234.4">[03:54.40]</span>Student:Another example, um, on the North American plains, the Native Americans used to <span class="highlight">collect</span> <span class="highlight">buffalo</span> droppings to burn. <span class="time" data-times="4.31" data-time="241.35">[04:01.35]</span>Uh, in Ireland, they cut up peat from bogs and they burn that.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.25" data-time="245.66">[04:05.66]</span>Professor:So what's the big <span class="highlight">distinction</span> between this and <span class="highlight">fossil</span> <span class="highlight">carbon</span>?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.73" data-time="250.91">[04:10.91]</span>Student:Biomass <span class="highlight">carbon</span> is what we might call <span class="highlight">current</span> <span class="highlight">carbon</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.89" data-time="255.64">[04:15.64]</span>It's always going in and out of the <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.3" data-time="258.53">[04:18.53]</span>So if we burn one of these fuels, we're putting its <span class="highlight">carbon</span> into <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span>. Right? <span class="time" data-times="6.28" data-time="263.83">[04:23.83]</span>But in a <span class="highlight">balanced</span> system, somewhere else in the world the same <span class="highlight">amount</span> of <span class="highlight">carbon</span> is going back. <span class="time" data-times="2.65" data-time="270.11">[04:30.11]</span>It gets taken in by growing <span class="highlight">vegetation</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.38" data-time="272.76">[04:32.76]</span>So burning biomass <span class="highlight">fuel</span> produces <span class="highlight">sort</span> of not-so-bad <span class="highlight">carbon</span>. <span class="time" data-times="15.72" data-time="278.14">[04:38.14]</span>In fact, it can become good <span class="highlight">carbon</span> if we <span class="highlight">endeavor</span> as a society, as <span class="highlight">humanity</span>, to allow forests to <span class="highlight">recover</span> this <span class="highlight">carbon</span>, if we don't, say, <span class="highlight">pave</span> over all the surfaces to prevent things from growing. <span class="time" data-times="6.47" data-time="293.86">[04:53.86]</span>So whenever we cut down a tree and burn its wood, we have to allow another tree to grow to keep things in <span class="highlight">balance</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="300.33">[05:00.33]</span>That way, you're...you're <span class="highlight">carbon</span> <span class="highlight">neutral</span>.</p>
