              <span class="time" data-times="5.02" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator:Listen to part of a lecture in a United States <span class="highlight">Government</span> class.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="11.46" data-time="5.02">[00:05.02]</span>Professor:We've been talking about the <span class="highlight">basic</span> services and facilities that an <span class="highlight">economy</span> needs to <span class="highlight">function</span>, roads, bridges, rail systems, water supplies, power grids, and so forth. <span class="time" data-times="2.54" data-time="16.48">[00:16.48]</span>What we call <span class="highlight">infrastructure</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="11.47" data-time="19.02">[00:19.02]</span>Now, traditionally much of a society's <span class="highlight">infrastructure</span>, particularly the <span class="highlight">transportation</span> <span class="highlight">infrastructure</span>, has been owned and operated by states, by governments. <span class="time" data-times="13.84" data-time="30.49">[00:30.49]</span>But lately, <span class="highlight">local</span> and <span class="highlight">state</span> governments have started to <span class="highlight">consider</span> and sometimes actually enter into various deals to privatize parts of their <span class="highlight">infrastructure</span>, particularly in the <span class="highlight">transportation</span> sector.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.5" data-time="44.33">[00:44.33]</span>And why is this privatization happening?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.56" data-time="47.83">[00:47.83]</span>Well, as you may know, in the 1950s and 60s there was a <span class="highlight">tremendous</span> highway building <span class="highlight">boom</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.06" data-time="54.39">[00:54.39]</span>Governments created a huge interlocking network of highways with <span class="highlight">associated</span> bridges and tunnels. <span class="time" data-times="7.42" data-time="60.45">[01:00.45]</span>But these facilities are getting old now and they're becoming more and more expensive to <span class="highlight">maintain</span>, very expensive actually. <span class="time" data-times="4.28" data-time="67.87">[01:07.87]</span>Tolls and tax revenues don't often cover all the needed repairs.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.65" data-time="72.15">[01:12.15]</span>Student:So why don't the governments just <span class="highlight">raise</span> tolls and taxes?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.72" data-time="76.8">[01:16.80]</span>Professor:Well, that's not so simple. <span class="time" data-times="5.44" data-time="78.52">[01:18.52]</span> <span class="highlight">Government</span> officials are elected by voters and voters get <span class="highlight">upset</span> when their taxes go up. <span class="time" data-times="10.39" data-time="83.96">[01:23.96]</span>And as for highways tolls, commuters especially don't like paying higher tolls, merely proposing increases can damage <span class="highlight">political</span> careers.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.27" data-time="94.35">[01:34.35]</span>So there's <span class="highlight">tremendous</span> <span class="highlight">pressure</span> on governments to find other ways to <span class="highlight">maintain</span> <span class="highlight">infrastructure</span> assets. <span class="time" data-times="13.22" data-time="100.62">[01:40.62]</span>One <span class="highlight">solution</span> is to sell or <span class="highlight">lease</span> a part of the <span class="highlight">infrastructure</span>, a toll bridge, a <span class="highlight">tunnel</span>, something like that to a private <span class="highlight">company</span>, usually a <span class="highlight">company</span> that specializes in this <span class="highlight">sort</span> of thing. <span class="time" data-times="9.3" data-time="113.84">[01:53.84]</span>The idea is that the <span class="highlight">company</span> that buys or leases a bridge or a highway or whatever will find it easier to keep it in good repair.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.83" data-time="123.14">[02:03.14]</span>Student:That will make commuters happy.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.87" data-time="124.97">[02:04.97]</span>Professor:Right, there could be better service. <span class="time" data-times="10.14" data-time="127.84">[02:07.84]</span>Since they are not <span class="highlight">government</span> entities, private companies face less <span class="highlight">political</span> <span class="highlight">resistance</span>, say to raising tolls in order to provide that better service. <span class="time" data-times="4.28" data-time="137.98">[02:17.98]</span>But <span class="highlight">besides</span> that, there's another <span class="highlight">reason</span> governments like these deals. <span class="time" data-times="8.99" data-time="142.26">[02:22.26]</span>States often have trouble paying their bills and they can use money they get from selling or leasing a piece of <span class="highlight">infrastructure</span> to <span class="highlight">balance</span> their budgets.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.67" data-time="151.25">[02:31.25]</span>Student:That all sounds good to me.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.41" data-time="152.92">[02:32.92]</span>Professor:It does <span class="highlight">sound</span> good, but a lot of people are very <span class="highlight">wary</span> of privatizing pieces of <span class="highlight">infrastructure</span> and rightly so. <span class="time" data-times="16.38" data-time="161.33">[02:41.33]</span>For <span class="highlight">instance</span>, in almost every case thus far, the first thing private companies do is <span class="highlight">drastically</span> <span class="highlight">raise</span> user fees because they say, "Oh, we must do <span class="highlight">critical</span> <span class="highlight">maintenance</span> that's gone undone for years and years. <span class="time" data-times="4.39" data-time="177.71">[02:57.71]</span>And because we're a private <span class="highlight">company</span>, we can't use tax money to do it. <span class="time" data-times="3.29" data-time="182.1">[03:02.10]</span>Our only option is raising tolls.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.87" data-time="185.39">[03:05.39]</span>But what's the <span class="highlight">impact</span> on people who use a toll road to get to work? <span class="time" data-times="4.19" data-time="189.26">[03:09.26]</span>What if a private owner doubles or triples the toll <span class="highlight">overnight</span>?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.94" data-time="193.45">[03:13.45]</span>Student:Uh, users would have to spend a higher percentage of their income on commuting.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.16" data-time="199.39">[03:19.39]</span>Professor:And depending on their income, that percentage could be <span class="highlight">significant</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.95" data-time="203.55">[03:23.55]</span>Student:But if tolls went up, me, I'd just <span class="highlight">avoid</span> the toll road and take smaller back roads where there aren't any tolls.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.35" data-time="210.5">[03:30.50]</span>Professor:That's a good point. <span class="time" data-times="6.19" data-time="211.85">[03:31.85]</span>Secondary roads would become <span class="highlight">attractive</span> to lots of other people too, and private companies know this. <span class="time" data-times="4.91" data-time="218.04">[03:38.04]</span>They also know that <span class="highlight">dramatic</span> reductions in traffic would hurt their bottom <span class="highlight">line</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.4" data-time="222.95">[03:42.95]</span>So <span class="highlight">market</span> forces do play a role in keeping private companies from raising their tolls too much. <span class="time" data-times="9.15" data-time="229.35">[03:49.35]</span>But the <span class="highlight">mere</span> <span class="highlight">prospect</span> of <span class="highlight">astronomical</span> toll hikes is still alarming to governments when they think about selling or leasing parts of an <span class="highlight">infrastructure</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.42" data-time="238.5">[03:58.50]</span>Now, from a business standpoint, <span class="highlight">infrastructure</span> purchases can be great investments! <span class="time" data-times="19.75" data-time="244.92">[04:04.92]</span>If a <span class="highlight">company</span> buys or gets a long-term <span class="highlight">lease</span> on a toll bridge from the <span class="highlight">government</span>, it's got an almost guaranteed <span class="highlight">steady</span> <span class="highlight">source</span> of <span class="highlight">revenue</span> for years and years, which means that if the <span class="highlight">company</span> decides it wants to sell the bridge to another <span class="highlight">company</span>, say ten years from now, it'll have no problem finding a buyer.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.01" data-time="264.67">[04:24.67]</span>Student:But what if that buyer, this new owner, continues to charge a high toll but doesn't do the same <span class="highlight">amount</span> of <span class="highlight">maintenance</span> because they want to <span class="highlight">squeeze</span> more money out of the <span class="highlight">asset</span>!</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.18" data-time="274.68">[04:34.68]</span>Professor:In that case, could the governments buy the <span class="highlight">asset</span> back? <span class="time" data-times="8.67" data-time="278.86">[04:38.86]</span>Well, to do that, it would have to <span class="highlight">raise</span> money either by raising taxes or by selling bonds, both of which are politically <span class="highlight">sensitive</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="287.53">[04:47.53]</span>So it's unclear in a <span class="highlight">practical</span> <span class="highlight">sense</span> whether these deals are truly reversible.</p>
