to part of a lecture in a United States <span class="highlight">Government</span> class.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="11.46" data-time="5.02">[00:05.02]</span>Professor:We've been talking about the <span class="highlight">basic</span> services and facilities that an <span class="highlight">economy</span> needs to <span class="highlight">function</span>, roads, bridges, rail systems, water supplies, power grids, and so forth. <span class="time" data-times="2.54" data-time="16.48">[00:16.48]</span>What we call <span class="highlight">infrastructure</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="11.47" data-time="19.02">[00:19.02]</span>Now, traditionally much of a society's <span class="highlight">infrastructure</span>, particularly the <span class="highlight">transportation</span><span class="highlight">infrastructure</span>, has been owned and operated by states, by governments. <span class="time" data-times="13.84" data-time="30.49">[00:30.49]</span>But lately, <span class="highlight">local</span> and <span class="highlight">state</span> governments have started to <span class="highlight">consider</span> and sometimes actually enter into various deals to privatize parts of their <span class="highlight">infrastructure</span>, particularly in the <span class="highlight">transportation</span> sector.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.5" data-time="44.33">[00:44.33]</span>And why is this privatization happening?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.56" data-time="47.83">[00:47.83]</span>Well, as you may know, in the 1950s and 60s there was a <span class="highlight">tremendous</span> highway building <span class="highlight">boom</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.06" data-time="54.39">[00:54.39]</span>Governments created a huge interlocking network of highways with <span class="highlight">associated</span> bridges and tunnels. <span class="time" data-times="7.42" data-time="60.45">[01:00.45]</span>But these facilities are getting old now and they're becoming more and more expensive to <span class="highlight">maintain</span>, very expensive actually. <span class="time" data-times="4.28" data-time="67.87">[01:07.87]</span>Tolls and tax revenues don't often cover all the needed repairs.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.65" data-time="72.15">[01:12.15]</span>Student:So why don't the governments just <span class="highlight">raise</span> tolls and taxes?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="1.72" data-time="76.8">[01:16.80]</span>Professor:Well, that's not so simple. <span class="time" data-times="5.44" data-time="78.52">[01:18.52]</span><span class="highlight">Government</span> officials are elected by voters and voters get <span class="highlight">upset</span> when their taxes go up. <span class="time" data-times="10.39" data-time="83.96">[01:23.96]</span>And as for highways tolls, commuters especially don't like paying higher tolls, merely proposing increases can damage <span class="highlight">political</span> careers.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.27" data-time="94.35">[01:34.35]</span>So there's <span class="highlight">tremendous</span><span class="highlight">pressure</span> on governments to find other ways to <span class="highlight">maintain</span><span class="highlight">infrastructure</span> assets. <span class="time" data-times="13.22" data-time="100.62">[01:40.62]</span>One <span class="highlight">solution</span> is to sell or <span class="highlight">lease</span> a part of the <span class="highlight">infrastructure</span>, a toll bridge, a <span class="highlight">tunnel</span>, something like that to a private <span class="highlight">company</span>, usually a <span class="highlight">company</span> that specializes in this <span class="highlight">sort</span> of thing. <span class="time" data-times="9.3" data-time="113.84">[01:53.84]</span>The idea is that the <span class="highlight">company</span> that buys or leases a bridge or a highway or whatever will find it easier to keep it in good repair.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="1.83" data-time="123.14">[02:03.14]</span>Student:That will make commuters happy.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.87" data-time="124.97">[02:04.97]</span>Professor:Right, there could be better service. <span class="time" data-times="10.14" data-time="127.84">[02:07.84]</span>Since they are not <span class="highlight">government</span> entities, private companies face less <span class="highlight">political</span><span class="highlight">resistance</span>, say to raising tolls in order to provide that better service. <span class="time" data-times="4.28" data-time="137.98">[02:17.98]</span>But <span class="highlight">besides</span> that, there's another <span class="highlight">reason</span> governments like these deals. <span class="time" data-times="8.99" data-time="142.26">[02:22.26]</span>States often have trouble paying their bills and they can use money they get from selling or leasing a piece of <span class="highlight">infrastructure</span> to <span class="highlight">balance</span> their budgets.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="1.67" data-time="151.25">[02:31.25]</span>Student:That all sounds good to me.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="8.41" data-time="152.92">[02:32.92]</span>Professor:It does <span class="highlight">sound</span> good, but a lot of people are very <span class="highlight">wary</span> of privatizing pieces of <span class="highlight">infrastructure</span> and rightly so. <span class="time" data-times="16.38" data-time="161.33">[02:41.33]</span>For <span class="highlight">instance</span>, in almost every case thus far, the first thing private companies do is <span class="highlight">drastically</span><span class="highlight">raise</span> user fees because they say, "Oh, we must do <span class="highlight">critical</span><span class="highlight">maintenance</span> that's gone undone for years and years. <span class="time" data-times="4.39" data-time="177.71">[02:57.71]</span>And because we're a private <span class="highlight">company</span>, we can't use tax money to do it. <span class="time" data-times="3.29" data-time="182.1">[03:02.10]</span>Our only option is raising tolls.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.87" data-time="185.39">[03:05.39]</span>But what's the <span class="highlight">impact</span> on people who use a toll road to get to work? <span class="time" data-times="4.19" data-time="189.26">[03:09.26]</span>What if a private owner doubles or triples the toll <span class="highlight">overnight</span>?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.94" data-time="193.45">[03:13.45]</span>Student:Uh, users would have to spend a higher percentage of their income on commuting.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.16" data-time="199.39">[03:19.39]</span>Professor:And depending on their income, that percentage could be <span class="highlight">significant</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.95" data-time="203.55">[03:23.55]</span>Student:But if tolls went up, me, I'd just <span class="highlight">avoid</span> the toll road and take smaller back roads where there aren't any tolls.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="1.35" data-time="210.5">[03:30.50]</span>Professor:That's a good point. <span class="time" data-times="6.19" data-time="211.85">[03:31.85]</span>Secondary roads would become <span class="highlight">attractive</span> to lots of other people too, and private companies know this. <span class="time" data-times="4.91" data-time="218.04">[03:38.04]</span>They also know that <span class="highlight">dramatic</span> reductions in traffic would hurt their bottom <span class="highlight">line</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.4" data-time="222.95">[03:42.95]</span>So <span class="highlight">market</span> forces do play a role in keeping private companies from raising their tolls too much. <span class="time" data-times="9.15" data-time="229.35">[03:49.35]</span>But the <span class="highlight">mere</span><span class="highlight">prospect</span> of <span class="highlight">astronomical</span> toll hikes is still alarming to governments when they think about selling or leasing parts of an <span class="highlight">infrastructure</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.42" data-time="238.5">[03:58.50]</span>Now, from a business standpoint, <span class="highlight">infrastructure</span> purchases can be great investments! <span class="time" data-times="19.75" data-time="244.92">[04:04.92]</span>If a <span class="highlight">company</span> buys or gets a long-term <span class="highlight">lease</span> on a toll bridge from the <span class="highlight">government</span>, it's got an almost guaranteed <span class="highlight">steady</span><span class="highlight">source</span> of <span class="highlight">revenue</span> for years and years, which means that if the <span class="highlight">company</span> decides it wants to sell the bridge to another <span class="highlight">company</span>, say ten years from now, it'll have no problem finding a buyer.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="10.01" data-time="264.67">[04:24.67]</span>Student:But what if that buyer, this new owner, continues to charge a high toll but doesn't do the same <span class="highlight">amount</span> of <span class="highlight">maintenance</span> because they want to <span class="highlight">squeeze</span> more money out of the <span class="highlight">asset</span>!</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.18" data-time="274.68">[04:34.68]</span>Professor:In that case, could the governments buy the <span class="highlight">asset</span> back? <span class="time" data-times="8.67" data-time="278.86">[04:38.86]</span>Well, to do that, it would have to <span class="highlight">raise</span> money either by raising taxes or by selling bonds, both of which are politically <span class="highlight">sensitive</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="287.53">[04:47.53]</span>So it's unclear in a <span class="highlight">practical</span><span class="highlight">sense</span> whether these deals are truly reversible.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What issue does the professor mainly discuss?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Government purchases of private property to expand transportation routes</p><p>B. The rising cost of public transportation in the United States</p><p>C. The transfer of certain public assets to for-profit companies</p><p>D. Whether voters can be persuaded to approve toll increases</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>It can be seen that the content of lecture will change from public to privatization of public assets, especially transportation, so the C option is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor mention highway construction that took place during the 1950s and 1960s?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To point out changes in voter attitudes toward toll and tax increases</p><p>B. To suggest that mistakes were made when the highway system was built</p><p>C. To explain why traffic congestion is not as bad as it used to be</p><p>D. To make a point about the current need for infrastructure repairs</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>It can be seen that these infrastructures are getting older, but the maintenance costs are getting more and more expensive. Tolls and taxes are not enough to pay for the required maintenance costs, so the D option is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor, why do governments consider selling or leasing pieces of infrastructure? Click on 2 answers.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Governments often have difficulty balancing their general budgets.</p><p>B. The money that governments receive from user fees has gone down in recent years</p><p>C. Political considerations limit governments' ability to raise money for maintenance.</p><p>D. Private companies are better able to estimate the cost of infrastructure repairs.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="AC"><p>It can be seen that there are two reasons why the government is willing to sell or lease infrastructure. First, because they do not belong to government property, private companies will face less political resistance, and they can increase tolls to repair them. Options. Second, countries often face deficits, so selling or leasing infrastructure can also balance their fiscal expenditures.</p><p>Corresponds to the A option.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor imply about some people's concerns over privatizing parts of an infrastructure?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Their concerns are likely to diminish in the future.</p><p>B. Their concerns are completely justified.</p><p>C. Their concerns suggest that voters need better information.</p><p>D. Their concerns have mostly been disregarded by governments.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>It can be seen that people's fears are absolutely necessary, because these private companies will immediately increase their tolls and use their name as an infrastructure for maintenance. Therefore, Option B is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor imply about secondary roads?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Their availability tends to limit toll increases on major highways.</p><p>B. They can be more expensive to repair than major highways are.</p><p>C. Increasing numbers of them are becoming toll roads.</p><p>D. Commuters are attracted to them for their scenic qualities.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>So the role of these secondary roads is to prevent private companies from excessively raising tolls, because when tolls are too high, people will choose these secondary roads, so the A option is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor, what is likely to happen when a bridge provides steady revenue for a private company?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The bridge will be well maintained in the long term.</p><p>B. The company will not raise tolls.</p><p>C. Other companies will be interested in buying the bridge.</p><p>D. Voters will pressure the government to buy back the bridge.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>According to the source language, if a company purchases or obtains a long-term lease of a toll bridge from the government, it will have a very stable source of revenue each year. That is, if the company wants to sell this toll bridge to other companies, it is not difficult. Find the buyer, so the C option is correct.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
