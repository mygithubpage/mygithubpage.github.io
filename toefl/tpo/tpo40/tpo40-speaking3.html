These students live in town or in the suburbs and travel to campus every day The university has decided to provide these commuter students with a special lounge in the student center - with couches, chairs, and a television. University officials hope that this lounge - a place to socialize and relax - will give commuter students some of the same advantages that dormitory residents now have. An important additional feature of the lounge will be a bulletin board on the wall for posting and sharing information that may be especially useful to commuter students and their particular needs.</p></article><div><audio src="tpo40-speaking3.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></div><article id="listening-passage" class="passage"><h3>Listening Text</h3><p>Now listen to two students discussing the article.</p><p>Woman:Hey, it's nice that they're gonna do this.</p><p>Man:It's not a bad idea, but do you think it'll accomplish what they're hoping?</p><p>Woman:Sure.
