          <h4 class="w3-center">University to Create a Lounge for Commuter Students</h4>
          <p>Many students at our university do not live in dormitories. These students live in town or in the suburbs and travel to campus every day The university has decided to provide these commuter students with a special lounge in the student center - with couches, chairs, and a television. University officials hope that this lounge - a place to socialize and relax - will give commuter students some of the same advantages that dormitory residents now have. An important additional feature of the lounge will be a bulletin board on the wall for posting and sharing information that may be especially useful to commuter students and their particular needs.</p>

          <p>Now listen to two students discussing the article. </p>
          <p>Woman: Hey, it's nice that they are gonna do this. </p>
          <p>Man: It's not a bad idea. But do you think they'll accomplish what they are hoping? </p>
          <p>Woman: Sure, I mean the dormitories all have their own lounges. And think about how much time students spend there? And how many people they meet. </p>
          <p>Man: Yeah, I got a lot of people in my dorm during my first semester, just watching TV and taking study breaks during the lunch. </p>
          <p>Woman: Right. Those study lounges are really central to the student's life. And I met people there that really helped with me for my schoolwork, too. Students who live off campus don't have anything like that. </p>
          <p>Man: That's true. </p>
          <p>Woman: Plus, I like the idea of posting stuff. You know, things like notices from students who want to get together with other students to share car rides to campus. </p>
          <p>Man: Yeah, ride sharing information could be helpful. </p>
          <p>Woman: Absolutely. If students knew about ride shares, they could save money getting to campus 'cause a few of them could travel in one car. </p>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>The school has implemented a new policy that create a lounge for the commuter students. And the woman holds a positive view towards the announcement. The first reason she gave is that the lounge is very central to student life, and the people there could actually help her with her school work. Students who live off campus don't have anything like that. And the second one is based on the fact that the woman likes the idea of posting stuff. Things like notices from students who want to get together with other students to share car rides to campus. And it could save a lot of money for students because a few of them could travel in one car. Therefore, she agrees with that opinion.</p>
