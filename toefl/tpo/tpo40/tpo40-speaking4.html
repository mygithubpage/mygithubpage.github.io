          <h4 class="w3-center">Agonistic Behavior</h4>
          <p>Within certain animal species, conflicts sometimes arise over resources such as territory or food. To resolve these conflicts, two animals of the same species may engage in agonistic behavior. With this type of aggressive behavior, the animals participate in a physical competition that demonstrates which animal is more powerful. While each animal attempts to prove its strength in the competition, it typically does so without harming the other animal. Once the winner is established, that animal gains access to the desired resources, while the weaker animal surrenders and leaves the area.</p>

          <p>Now listen to part of lecture in a Biology class. </p>
          <p>I know some scientists who were observing snakes in the wild, and they witnessed in account of this sort between two rattle snakes. As you may know, rattle snakes eat various kinds of small animals, small animals that live underground, in burrows, in little holes underground. And what these scientists saw was these two rattle snakes found the same hole and both wanted to eat whatever food within that hole. So what happened was: the two rattle snakes faced each other, and then they lifted their bodies and went up right position and made themselves as tall as possible. And then they started pushing each other, kind of rustling with one another. Each snake tried to gain control over the other snake. What is interesting is that during all these pushing and shoving and maneuvering, neither snake ever tried to bite the other snake. Neither snake ever tried to injure the other snake. So, then, after this went on for a while, one of the snakes finally gained control of the other snake, pushed it to the ground and held there. At this point, the snake that was on top could have easily bitten the other snake, but it didn't. Instead, it just released the other snake, just let it go. The snake that lost just slipped away, the snake that won right down the hole to look for food. </p>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>In the lecture, the professor mainly talked about the theory about agonistic behavior. To reinforce the theory, the professor gave an example about two rattlesnakes in his speech. In the example, scientists saw two rattlesnakes had found the same hole and both of them wanted to eat the food there. And what happened was the two rattlesnakes faced each other and made themselves as tall as possible. And then they began pushing each other and trying to control one another. But in this process, neither of those two rattlesnakes was trying to hurt each other. And the snake which could have easily bitten the other one, it didn't, and let it go. Finally, the winner got the food. So this example justify the agonistic behavior which is the certain animals species just simply want to show off the power of themselves in the regard of territory or food and prove their strength in the competition.</p>
