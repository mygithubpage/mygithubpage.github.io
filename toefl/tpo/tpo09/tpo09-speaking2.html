Which do you agree with? Explain why.</p></section><section id="sample-response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><article><p>I believe friends are the most important influence. We all know that one takes the behavior of one's company. Friends are always our companies. We play games together, keep secrets and talk anything we like. We share interests and hobbies. For example, many of my friends like playing basketball because I like playing basketball very much. I learned a lot from my friends, their way of talking and their behaviors. However, I rarely spent time with my cousins or with my parents. They might have some influence on me, but they are definitely not the most important influence. In a word, because we are closest to our friends, friends have the most important influence on us.</p></article></section></main></body></html>
