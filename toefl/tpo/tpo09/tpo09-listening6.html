              <span class="time" data-times="5.9" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in a linguistics class. <span class="time" data-times="5.28" data-time="5.9">[00:05.90]</span>The professor has been discussing animal communication systems. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.93" data-time="11.18">[00:11.18]</span>Lecturer: So last time, we covered the dances honey bees do to <span class="highlight">indicate</span> where food can be found and the calls and songs of different types of birds. <span class="time" data-times="12.25" data-time="21.11">[00:21.11]</span>Today, I'd like to look at some communication systems found in mammals, particularly in primates, such as orangutans, chimpanzees, gorillas... <span class="time" data-times="1.72" data-time="33.36">[00:33.36]</span>Yes, Thomas? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.81" data-time="35.08">[00:35.08]</span>Student: Excuse me, Professor. <span class="time" data-times="8.97" data-time="37.89">[00:37.89]</span>But when you talk about <span class="highlight">gorilla</span> language, do you mean like, those experiments where humans taught them sign language or a language like... </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.28" data-time="46.86">[00:46.86]</span>Lecturer: OK, wait just a <span class="highlight">minute</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.42" data-time="49.14">[00:49.14]</span>Now, who in this class heard me use the word "language"? <span class="time" data-times="1.71" data-time="54.56">[00:54.56]</span>No one I hope. <span class="time" data-times="4.46" data-time="56.27">[00:56.27]</span>What we're talking about here are systems of communication, all right? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.46" data-time="60.73">[01:00.73]</span>Student: Oh, sorry, communication, right. <span class="time" data-times="4.8" data-time="63.19">[01:03.19]</span>But could you maybe, like, <span class="highlight">clarify</span> what the <span class="highlight">difference</span> is? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.41" data-time="67.99">[01:07.99]</span>Lecturer: Of <span class="highlight">course</span>, that's a <span class="highlight">fair</span> question. <span class="time" data-times="7.59" data-time="70.4">[01:10.40]</span>OK, well, to start with, let's make it <span class="highlight">clear</span> that language is a type of communication, not the other way around. <span class="time" data-times="6.73" data-time="77.99">[01:17.99]</span>OK, so all communication systems, language included, have certain features in <span class="highlight">common</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.3" data-time="84.72">[01:24.72]</span>For example, the signals used to <span class="highlight">communicate</span> from the bee's dance movements, to the word and sentences found in human languages. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.24" data-time="93.02">[01:33.02]</span>All these signals <span class="highlight">convey</span> meaning. <span class="time" data-times="10.71" data-time="96.26">[01:36.26]</span>And all communication systems serve a purpose, a <span class="highlight">pragmatic</span> <span class="highlight">function</span> of some <span class="highlight">sort</span>–warning of danger perhaps or offering other needed information. <span class="time" data-times="10.71" data-time="106.97">[01:46.97]</span>But there're several features <span class="highlight">peculiar</span> to human language that have, for the most part, never been found in the communication system of any other <span class="highlight">species</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.4" data-time="117.68">[01:57.68]</span>For one thing, learn <span class="highlight">ability</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.16" data-time="121.08">[02:01.08]</span>Animals have <span class="highlight">instinctive</span> communication systems. <span class="time" data-times="4.97" data-time="126.24">[02:06.24]</span>When a dog, a puppy gets to certain age, it's able to <span class="highlight">bark</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.77" data-time="131.21">[02:11.21]</span>It barks without having to learn how from other dogs, it just barks. <span class="time" data-times="4.22" data-time="135.98">[02:15.98]</span>But much of human language has to be learned from other humans. <span class="time" data-times="2.46" data-time="140.2">[02:20.20]</span>What else makes human language <span class="highlight">unique</span>? <span class="time" data-times="4.98" data-time="142.66">[02:22.66]</span>What makes it different from animal communication? Deborah? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.77" data-time="147.64">[02:27.64]</span>D: How about grammar? <span class="time" data-times="3.08" data-time="151.41">[02:31.41]</span>Like having verbs, nouns, adjectives? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.92" data-time="154.49">[02:34.49]</span>L: OK, that's another feature. <span class="time" data-times="0.91" data-time="156.41">[02:36.41]</span>And it's a good example... </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="17.34" data-time="157.32">[02:37.32]</span>D: I mean I <span class="highlight">mention</span> this 'cause like in my <span class="highlight">biology</span> class last year, I kind of remember talking about a study on <span class="highlight">prairie</span> dogs, where, I think the researchers claimed that the warning cries of <span class="highlight">prairie</span> dogs <span class="highlight">constitute</span> language, because they have these different parts of speech. <span class="time" data-times="10.1" data-time="174.66">[02:54.66]</span>You know, like nouns, to name the type of <span class="highlight">predator</span> they spotted, adjectives to <span class="highlight">describe</span> its size and <span class="highlight">shape</span>, verbs..., but now it seems like... </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.21" data-time="184.76">[03:04.76]</span>L: All right, hold on a moment. <span class="time" data-times="2.24" data-time="185.97">[03:05.97]</span>I'm <span class="highlight">familiar</span> with the study you're talking about. <span class="time" data-times="4.52" data-time="188.21">[03:08.21]</span>And for those of you who don't know, <span class="highlight">prairie</span> dogs are not actually dogs. <span class="time" data-times="6.99" data-time="192.73">[03:12.73]</span>They're a type of <span class="highlight">rodent</span> who, who <span class="highlight">burrow</span> in the ground, in the grasslands of the western United States and Mexico. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.62" data-time="199.72">[03:19.72]</span>In this study, the researchers looked at the high-pitched barks a <span class="highlight">prairie</span> dog makes when it spots <span class="highlight">predator</span>. <span class="time" data-times="10.57" data-time="208.34">[03:28.34]</span>And from this they made some <span class="highlight">pretty</span>.., well, they made some claims about these calls qualifying as an actual language, with its own <span class="highlight">primitive</span> grammar. <span class="time" data-times="5.51" data-time="218.91">[03:38.91]</span>But actually, these warning calls are no different from those found among certain types of monkeys. <span class="time" data-times="8.1" data-time="224.42">[03:44.42]</span>And, well, let's not <span class="highlight">even</span> get into the question of whether concepts like noun and verb can be meaningfully applied to animal communication. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.06" data-time="232.52">[03:52.52]</span>Another thing that distinguishes a real language is a <span class="highlight">property</span> we call "discreteness". <span class="time" data-times="9.4" data-time="238.58">[03:58.58]</span>In other words, messages are built up out of smaller parts, sentences out of words, words out of <span class="highlight">individual</span> sounds, etc. <span class="time" data-times="5.96" data-time="247.98">[04:07.98]</span>Now maybe you could say that the <span class="highlight">prairie</span> dog's message is built from smaller parts. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.27" data-time="253.94">[04:13.94]</span>Like say for example, our <span class="highlight">prairie</span> dog spots a <span class="highlight">predator</span>, a big <span class="highlight">coyote</span> approaching rapidly. <span class="time" data-times="7.94" data-time="260.21">[04:20.21]</span>So the <span class="highlight">prairie</span> dog makes a call that means "coyote", then one that means "large", and then another one to <span class="highlight">indicate</span> its speed. <span class="time" data-times="6.89" data-time="268.15">[04:28.15]</span>But do you really <span class="highlight">suppose</span> it makes any <span class="highlight">difference</span> what order these calls come in? No. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.47" data-time="275.04">[04:35.04]</span>But the <span class="highlight">discrete</span> units that make up language can be put together in different ways. <span class="time" data-times="9.9" data-time="282.51">[04:42.51]</span>Those smaller parts can be used to form an infinite number of messages, including messages that are completely <span class="highlight">novel</span>, that have never been expressed before. <span class="time" data-times="19" data-time="292.41">[04:52.41]</span>For example, we can <span class="highlight">differentiate</span> between: "A large <span class="highlight">coyote</span> moves fast." and say "Move the large <span class="highlight">coyote</span> fast."or "Move fast, large <span class="highlight">coyote</span>.", and I truly <span class="highlight">doubt</span> whether anyone has ever uttered either of these sentences before. <span class="time" data-times="9.77" data-time="311.41">[05:11.41]</span>Human language is <span class="highlight">productive</span>, an open-ended communication system, whereas no other communication system has this <span class="highlight">property</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.56" data-time="321.18">[05:21.18]</span>And another feature of language that's not displayed by any form of animal communication is what we call "displacement". <span class="time" data-times="7.06" data-time="329.74">[05:29.74]</span>That is, language is <span class="highlight">abstract</span> enough that we can talk about things that aren't present here and now. <span class="time" data-times="6.89" data-time="336.8">[05:36.80]</span>Things like "My friend Joe is not in the room." or "It will probably rain next Thursday." <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="343.69">[05:43.69]</span> <span class="highlight">Prairie</span> dogs may be able to tell you about a <span class="highlight">hawk</span> that's circling overhead right now, but they never show any <span class="highlight">inclination</span> to <span class="highlight">describe</span> the one they saw last week.  </p>
