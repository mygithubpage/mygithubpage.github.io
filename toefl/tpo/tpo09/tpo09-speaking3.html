          <h4 class="w3-center">Required Work Experience</h4>The business studies department at State University will now require all students enrolled in its program to complete one semester of work experience in a local corporation or small business. It is felt that students will benefit from this work experience by developing leadership and organizational skills that would not normally be learned in a classroom or campus setting. Furthermore, the relationships that students establish with the company that they work for many help them to secure permanent employment with that company once they have completed the program and graduated.</article>

          <p>Now listen to two students discussing the announcement.</p>
          <p>(man) Read this announcement?</p>
          <p>(woman) Yeah, and I disagree. I don't think it'll actually help students.</p>
          <p>(man) Really, why not?</p>
          <p>(woman) Well, they talked about leadership and organizational skills, but that's not really the kind of work you do. Like my elder brother's had the kind of job they're talking about, and typically you are just there to do the basic tasks like typing or filing stuff, nothing very meaningful.</p>
          <p>(man) Oh, so you wouldn't actually learn anything new.</p>
          <p>(woman) Exactly!</p>
          <p>(man) I guess I see what you mean. But what about the other point they make?(woman) About this helping us after we graduate? I don't agree.</p>
          <p>(man) How come?</p>
          <p>(woman) Well, the problem is that there're lots of other universities in our area that have the same requirement. So there're lots of other students at these positions.</p>
          <p>(man) Yeah, I guess I haven't thought of that.</p>
          <p>(woman) So, even if you take a position like this in a company while you're still a student, once you graduate the competition for permanent jobs will be impossible. I mean there just won't be enough jobs available for all of the business graduates in the city that will be looking for full-time work.</p>
          <p>(man) Hmmm, I see what you're saying.</p>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>Well, the woman disagrees with the announcement. She doesn't think it'll do any help to the students for some reasons. Firstly, she doesn't think leadership and organization skills are something that students can acquire through the experience because all that many students, like her elder brother, do, is some basic and meaningless tasks like typing or filing stuff. The second reason from the woman is that other universities in her area have the same requirement as her university does, which means there are lots of competitors at the same positions especially when the business students graduate. There won't be enough full-time job opportunities or positions available at all. So the woman virtually disagrees for the reasons stated above. (118 words)</p>
