      <h4 class="w3-center">Required Work Experience</h4>
      <p>The business studies department at State University will now require all students enrolled in its program to complete one semester of work experience in a local corporation or small business. It is felt that students will benefit from this work experience by developing leadership and organizational skills that would not normally be learned in a classroom or campus setting. Furthermore, the relationships that students establish with the company that they work for many help them to secure permanent employment with that company once they have completed the program and graduated.</p>

      <h3>Listening Text</h3>
      <p>Now listen to two students discussing the announcement.</p>
      <p>(man) Read this announcement?</p>
      <p>(woman) Yeah, and I disagree. I don't think it'll actually help students.</p>
      <p>(man) Really, why not?</p>
      <p>(woman) Well, they talked about leadership and organizational skills, but that's not really the kind of work you do. Like my elder brother's had the kind of job they're talking about, and typically you are just there to do the basic tasks like typing or filing stuff, nothing very meaningful.</p>
      <p>(man) Oh, so you wouldn't actually learn anything new.</p>
      <p>(woman) Exactly!</p>
      <p>(man) I guess I see what you mean. But what about the other point they make?(woman) About this helping us after we graduate? I don't agree.</p>
      <p>(man) How come?</p>
      <p>(woman) Well, the problem is that there're lots of other universities in our area that have the same requirement. So there're lots of other students at these positions.</p>
      <p>(man) Yeah, I guess I haven't thought of that.</p>
      <p>(woman) So, even if you take a position like this in a company while you're still a student, once you graduate the competition for permanent jobs will be impossible. I mean there just won't be enough jobs available for all of the business graduates in the city that will be looking for full-time work.</p>
      <p>(man) Hmmm, I see what you're saying.</p>

    <section id="question">
      <h4>Question</h4>
      <p>The woman expresses her opinion about the new policy. State her opinion and explain the reasons she gives for holding that opinion. </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h5>Important Points</h5>
      <p> Reasons such as, "I learned to appreciate life" or "It changed my way of thinking" are overly general and lack the specificity needed for full credit in topic development. You should also explain how you learned to appreciate life or how it changed your way of thinking. For example, "This experience taught me to appreciate life. Before, I was spending all my time working, usually alone, and I wasn't happy. But after this happened, I realized that it was more important to spend time with my friends. So now I see my old friends more, and I'm more relaxed and enjoy life more."</p>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <p>Well, the woman disagrees with the announcement. She doesn't think it'll do any help to the students for some reasons. Firstly, she doesn't think leadership and organization skills are something that students can acquire through the experience because all that many students, like her elder brother, do, is some basic and meaningless tasks like typing or filing stuff. The second reason from the woman is that other universities in her area have the same requirement as her university does, which means there are lots of competitors at the same positions especially when the business students graduate. There won't be enough full-time job opportunities or positions available at all. So the woman virtually disagrees for the reasons stated above. (118 words)</p>

      <p><b>High-level Response: Listen to Track 25.</b></p>
      <p><audio src="track_25.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></p>
      <p><b>Rater’s Comments</b></p>
      <p>This speaker clearly states the woman's opinion of the policy ("The woman believe that this policy is not a positive move"), a brief explanation of the policy, and the two reasons why she disagrees with the policy. The speaker makes a few very minor agreement errors ("the woman believe"; "the abundance of university who"; "offered to student"), but these do not prevent listeners from understanding what the speaker is communicating. The speaker has very clear pronunciation and speaks at an even pace, making use of appropriate pauses and intonation. He is also able to use advanced vocabulary and grammatical structures effectively ("she believes that job that would be offered to student would be really low-level and low-responsibility jobs which will not allow them to grow into and develop the qualities of leadership"; "contrary to what the policy says"). </p>
      <p><b>Low-level Response: Listen to Track 26.</b></p>
      <p><audio src="track_26.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></p>
      <p><b>Rater’s Comments</b></p>
      <p>This speaker addresses the question, but does not provide a complete answer, and her response is overall somewhat difficult to follow. She states the woman's opinion, but does not explain what the woman is disagreeing with, since she only makes a vague reference to the policy "Girl says, say, say that uh recruiting proposed by university is not a good uh, urn, uh, a good statement". While she does use some sophisticated vocabulary ("particular skills," "permanent employment"), she does not fully explain her ideas. For example, when she says, "he didn't give any particular skills in leadership or organization," she does not make it clear that she is talking about the woman's brother or his job experience, and how that relates to the new policy. Her pronunciation is clear, but her control of grammar is weak, which makes it difficult to understand her meaning: "when the student um attain graduation, have to compete with older students. . . so there's no any. . . ." </p>
