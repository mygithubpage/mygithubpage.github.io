The host is a couple. They hold the meeting at their apartment every week. We prayed in the living room together and recited the scripture. Also, we all talked about our happy events and unhappy events happened recently and exchanged our ideas about everyone's events. It was important to me because it's the first time I attended a small prayer meeting like that and we talked without concealment. It's like a whole new experience to me. In addition, I made some friends there.</p></article></section></main></body></html>
