Describe what happened and explain why it was important to you.</p></section><section><h4>Important Points</h4><p> Reasons such as, "I learned to appreciate life" or "It changed my way of thinking" are overly general and lack the specificity needed for full credit in topic development. You should also explain how you learned to appreciate life or how it changed your way of thinking. For example, "This experience taught me to appreciate life. Before, I was spending all my time working, usually alone, and I wasn't happy. But after this happened, I realized that it was more important to spend time with my friends. So now I see my old friends more, and I'm more relaxed and enjoy life more."</p></section><div id="responses"><article><h5>Sample Response</h5><p>I recently attended a prayer meeting of BAHAI. The host is a couple. They hold the meeting at their apartment every week. We prayed in the living room together and recited the scripture. Also, we all talked about our happy events and unhappy events happened recently and exchanged our ideas about everyone's events. It was important to me because it's the first time I attended a small prayer meeting like that and we talked without concealment. It's like a whole new experience to me. In addition, I made some friends there.</p></article></div><div><p><b>High-level Response: Listen to Track 21.</b></p><p><audio src="track_21.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></p><p><b>Rater’s Comments</b></p><p>This is a fully developed response to the question. She describes her experience studying abroad in Spain and gives a few examples of the importance of the experience (learning a new language, new culture, and so on.); she also gives a longer explanation to describe the experience of living alone for the first time. Although she doesn't provide a lot of support for the importance of the event, she does mention several things such as learning a new language and living in a different culture for which the importance is implicit. She doesn't sound like a native English speaker, and there are occasional mispronunciations, but her speech is clear throughout and she uses correct, precise language and vocabulary to describe the topic.</p><p><b>Mid-level Response: Listen to Track 22.</b></p><p><audio src="track_22.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></p><p><b>Rater’s Comments</b></p><p>The speaker gives a specific recent experience—her brother's car accident—but does not develop it fully with specific reasons. She also does not specifically discuss why it was important to her. General statements, such as, "We practically had to do everything ourselves" are not supported with specific details. Too often the speaker is not precise in what she says. Her statement, "I think we all learned about it" is vague. For example, she does not make clear what the pronoun "it" refers to. Therefore, listeners are not sure what the speaker means. A lack of precise vocabulary and grammar prevent this speaker from fully developing her ideas. Her pronunciation is clear in general, but there are some hesitations that cause problems for listeners. </p></div></main></body></html>
