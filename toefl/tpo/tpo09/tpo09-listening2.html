<span class="highlight">mechanical</span> figures, such as <span class="highlight">cattle</span>, moved <span class="highlight">across</span> the <span class="highlight">scene</span>, and ships sailed <span class="highlight">along</span> the river. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.43" data-time="271.93">[04:31.93]</span>But what really got people was the <span class="highlight">attention</span> to <span class="highlight">detail</span>, much like his work at Drury Lane. <span class="time" data-times="8.94" data-time="278.36">[04:38.36]</span>So, for example, he painted very <span class="highlight">realistic</span> ships, and <span class="highlight">varied</span> their size depending on their distance from the <span class="highlight">audience</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.2" data-time="287.3">[04:47.30]</span>Small boats moved more quickly <span class="highlight">across</span> the <span class="highlight">foreground</span> than larger ones did that were closer to the <span class="highlight">horizon</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.49" data-time="295.5">[04:55.50]</span>Other effects, like waves, were also very convincing. <span class="time" data-times="5.2" data-time="299.99">[04:59.99]</span>They reflected sunlight or moonlight depending on the time of day or night. <span class="time" data-times="3.92" data-time="305.19">[05:05.19]</span><span class="highlight">Even</span> the colors changed as they would in nature. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.22" data-time="309.11">[05:09.11]</span><span class="highlight">Sound</span> and light were important in making his productions <span class="highlight">realistic</span>. <span class="time" data-times="13.27" data-time="314.33">[05:14.33]</span>He used a great number of lamps, and he was able to change colors of light by using variously colored pieces of glass, to create effects like passing clouds that suddenly change in color. <span class="time" data-times="8.62" data-time="327.6">[05:27.60]</span>Furthermore, he used effects to make patterns of shadow and light, rather than using the <span class="highlight">uniform</span> lighting that was <span class="highlight">common</span> at the time. <span class="time" data-times="10.19" data-time="336.22">[05:36.22]</span>And many of the <span class="highlight">sound</span> effects he pioneered are still in use today, like creating thunder by pulling on one of the corners of a thin <span class="highlight">copper</span> sheet. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.66" data-time="346.41">[05:46.41]</span>One of his most <span class="highlight">popular</span> scenes was of a storm. <span class="time" data-times="6.61" data-time="350.07">[05:50.07]</span>And there is a story that on one occasion, an actual storm passed over head during the show. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="356.68">[05:56.68]</span>And some people went outside, and they claimed Loutherbourg's thunder was actually better than the real thunder. </p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor mainly discuss?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.
