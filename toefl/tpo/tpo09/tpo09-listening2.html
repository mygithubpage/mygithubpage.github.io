            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.72" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in a theater class. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="15.78" data-time="8.72">[00:08.72]</span>Pro: As we have seen, the <span class="underline">second</span> half of the 18th <span class="underline">century</span> was an <span class="underline">exciting</span> time in Europe: it was not only an age of great invention, but social changes also led to a rise in all sorts of entertainment, from reading to museums, to travel. <span class="time" data-times="9.56" data-time="24.5">[00:24.50]</span>And finding himself in the middle of this excitement was an <span class="underline">accomplished</span> French painter named Philippe Jacques de Loutherbourg. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.67" data-time="34.06">[00:34.06]</span>Loutherbourg arrived in England in 1771, and immediately went to work as a set <span class="underline">designer</span> at the famous Drury Lane Theater in London. <span class="time" data-times="13.79" data-time="43.73">[00:43.73]</span>From his first shows, Loutherbourg showed a knack for imagination and <span class="underline">stage</span> design, all in the <span class="underline">interest</span> of creating illusions that allowed the <span class="underline">audience</span> to <span class="underline">suspend</span> disbelief completely. <span class="time" data-times="13.85" data-time="57.52">[00:57.52]</span>He <span class="underline">accomplished</span> this by giving the <span class="underline">stage</span> a greater feeling of depth, which he did by cutting up some of the <span class="underline">rigid</span> background <span class="underline">scenery</span>, and placing it at various angles and distances from the <span class="underline">audience</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="11.02" data-time="71.37">[01:11.37]</span>Another <span class="underline">realistic</span> touch was using three-dimensional objects on the set, like rocks and bushes as <span class="underline">opposed</span> to two-dimensional painted <span class="underline">scenery</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.43" data-time="82.39">[01:22.39]</span>He also paid much more <span class="underline">attention</span> to lighting and <span class="underline">sound</span> than had been done before. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.95" data-time="87.82">[01:27.82]</span>Now, these sets were so <span class="underline">elaborate</span> that many people attended the theater more for them than for the actors or the story. <span class="time" data-times="7.78" data-time="95.77">[01:35.77]</span>At the time, people were wild for travel and for experiencing new places; but not everyone could <span class="underline">afford</span> it. <span class="time" data-times="5.9" data-time="103.55">[01:43.55]</span>Loutherbourg outdid himself, however, with a show that he set up in his own home. <span class="time" data-times="7.37" data-time="109.45">[01:49.45]</span>He called it the "Eidophusikon". </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="13.84" data-time="116.82">[01:56.82]</span>"Eidophusikon" means something like representation of nature, and that's exactly what he intended to do: create <span class="underline">realistic</span> moving scenes that change before the audiences' eyes. <span class="time" data-times="15.94" data-time="130.66">[02:10.66]</span>In this, he synthesized all his tricks from Drury Lane: <span class="underline">mechanical</span> motions, <span class="underline">sound</span>, light, other <span class="underline">special</span> effects to create, if you will, an early multimedia production. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.89" data-time="146.6">[02:26.60]</span>The "Eidophusikon" was Loutherbourg's <span class="underline">attempt</span> to <span class="underline">release</span> painting from the constraints of the picture <span class="underline">frame</span>. <span class="time" data-times="11.28" data-time="154.49">[02:34.49]</span>After all, <span class="underline">even</span> the most action-filled <span class="underline">exciting</span> painting can <span class="underline">represent</span> only one moment in time; and any <span class="underline">illusion</span> of movement is gone after the first <span class="underline">glance</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.37" data-time="165.77">[02:45.77]</span>But Loutherbourg, like other <span class="underline">contemporary</span> painters, <span class="underline">wanted</span> to add the <span class="underline">dimension</span> of time to his paintings. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.85" data-time="173.14">[02:53.14]</span>You know, the <span class="underline">popular</span> thinking is that Loutherbourg was influenced by <span class="underline">landscape</span> painting. <span class="time" data-times="6.38" data-time="178.99">[02:58.99]</span>But why can't we say that the "Eidophusikon" actually influenced the painters? <span class="time" data-times="6.47" data-time="185.37">[03:05.37]</span>At the very <span class="underline">least</span> we have to <span class="underline">consider</span> that it was more ... it was more of a <span class="underline">mutual</span> thing. <span class="time" data-times="14.58" data-time="191.84">[03:11.84]</span>We know, for example, that the important English <span class="underline">landscape</span> painter, Thomas Gainsborough, attended almost all of the early performances, and his later paintings are <span class="underline">notable</span> for their increased color and <span class="underline">dynamic</span> use of light. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.54" data-time="206.42">[03:26.42]</span>Loutherbourg's influence on the theater though, he was incredibly <span class="underline">influential</span>. <span class="time" data-times="12.17" data-time="211.96">[03:31.96]</span>The way he brought together design and lighting and <span class="underline">sound</span> as a unified feature of the <span class="underline">stage</span> can easily be seen in English theater's <span class="underline">subsequent</span> emphasis on lighting and <span class="underline">motion</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.61" data-time="224.13">[03:44.13]</span>Now, the "Eidophusikon" <span class="underline">stage</span> was actually a box: a few meters wide, a <span class="underline">couple</span> meters tall and a <span class="underline">couple</span> meters deep. <span class="time" data-times="4.45" data-time="233.74">[03:53.74]</span>That is, the <span class="underline">action</span> took place <span class="underline">within</span> this box. <span class="time" data-times="3.55" data-time="238.19">[03:58.19]</span>This was much smaller of <span class="underline">course</span> than the usual <span class="underline">stage</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.22" data-time="241.74">[04:01.74]</span>But, it also allowed Loutherbourg to <span class="underline">concentrate</span> the lighting to better effect. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.68" data-time="246.96">[04:06.96]</span>Also, the <span class="underline">audience</span> was in the dark, which wouldn't be a <span class="underline">common</span> feature of the theater until a hundred years later. <span class="time" data-times="3.34" data-time="254.64">[04:14.64]</span>The show consisted of a <span class="underline">series</span> of scenes. <span class="time" data-times="13.95" data-time="257.98">[04:17.98]</span>For example, a view of London from sunrise that changes as the day moves on; <span class="underline">mechanical</span> figures, such as <span class="underline">cattle</span>, moved <span class="underline">across</span> the <span class="underline">scene</span>, and ships sailed <span class="underline">along</span> the river. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.43" data-time="271.93">[04:31.93]</span>But what really got people was the <span class="underline">attention</span> to <span class="underline">detail</span>, much like his work at Drury Lane. <span class="time" data-times="8.94" data-time="278.36">[04:38.36]</span>So, for example, he painted very <span class="underline">realistic</span> ships, and <span class="underline">varied</span> their size depending on their distance from the <span class="underline">audience</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.2" data-time="287.3">[04:47.30]</span>Small boats moved more quickly <span class="underline">across</span> the <span class="underline">foreground</span> than larger ones did that were closer to the <span class="underline">horizon</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.49" data-time="295.5">[04:55.50]</span>Other effects, like waves, were also very convincing. <span class="time" data-times="5.2" data-time="299.99">[04:59.99]</span>They reflected sunlight or moonlight depending on the time of day or night. <span class="time" data-times="3.92" data-time="305.19">[05:05.19]</span> <span class="underline">Even</span> the colors changed as they would in nature. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.22" data-time="309.11">[05:09.11]</span>
              <span class="underline">Sound</span> and light were important in making his productions <span class="underline">realistic</span>. <span class="time" data-times="13.27" data-time="314.33">[05:14.33]</span>He used a great number of lamps, and he was able to change colors of light by using variously colored pieces of glass, to create effects like passing clouds that suddenly change in color. <span class="time" data-times="8.62" data-time="327.6">[05:27.60]</span>Furthermore, he used effects to make patterns of shadow and light, rather than using the <span class="underline">uniform</span> lighting that was <span class="underline">common</span> at the time. <span class="time" data-times="10.19" data-time="336.22">[05:36.22]</span>And many of the <span class="underline">sound</span> effects he pioneered are still in use today, like creating thunder by pulling on one of the corners of a thin <span class="underline">copper</span> sheet. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.66" data-time="346.41">[05:46.41]</span>One of his most <span class="underline">popular</span> scenes was of a storm. <span class="time" data-times="6.61" data-time="350.07">[05:50.07]</span>And there is a story that on one occasion, an actual storm passed over head during the show. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="356.68">[05:56.68]</span>And some people went outside, and they claimed Loutherbourg's thunder was actually better than the real thunder. </p>
