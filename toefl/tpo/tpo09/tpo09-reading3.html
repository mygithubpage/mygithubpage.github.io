            <b>The Arrival of Plant Life in Hawaii</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>Spores light enough to <span class="underline">float</span> on the breezes were carried thousands of miles from more <span class="underline">ancient</span> lands and deposited <span class="light">at <span class="underline">random</span></span> <span class="underline">across</span> the <span class="underline">bare</span> mountain flanks. A few of these spores found a toehold on the dark, forbidding rocks and grew and began to work their <span class="underline">transformation</span> upon the land. Lichens were probably the first successful <span class="underline">flora</span>. These are not single <span class="underline">individual</span> plants; each one is a symbiotic <span class="underline">combination</span> of an <span class="underline">alga</span> and a <span class="underline">fungus</span>. The <span class="underline">algae</span> <span class="underline">capture</span> the sun's energy by <span class="underline">photosynthesis</span> and store it in <span class="underline">organic</span> molecules. The <span class="underline">fungi</span> <span class="underline">absorb</span> <span class="underline">moisture</span> and <span class="underline">mineral</span> salts from the rocks, passing these on in <span class="underline">waste</span> products that <span class="underline">nourish</span> <span class="underline">algae</span>. It is <span class="underline">significant</span> that the earliest living thing that built communities on these islands are examples of symbiosis, a <span class="underline">phenomenon</span> that depends upon the close <span class="underline">cooperation</span> of two or more forms of life and a <span class="underline">principle</span> that is very important in island communities.</p>
          <p>Lichens helped to speed the <span class="underline">decomposition</span> of the hard rock surfaces, preparing a <span class="underline">soft</span> bed of soil that was abundantly supplied with minerals that had been carried in the <span class="underline">molten</span> rock from the bowels of Earth. Now, other forms of life could take hold: ferns and mosses (two of the most <span class="underline">ancient</span> types of land plants) that <span class="underline">flourish</span> <span class="underline">even</span> in rock crevices. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>These plants <span class="underline">propagate</span> by producing spores–tiny <span class="underline">fertilized</span> cells that <span class="underline">contain</span> all the instructions for making a new plant–but the <span class="underline">spore</span> are unprotected by any outer <span class="underline">coating</span> and carry no <span class="underline">supply</span> of <span class="underline">nutrient</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> <span class="underline">Vast</span> numbers of them fall on the ground <span class="underline">beneath</span> the mother plants. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>Sometimes they are carried farther <span class="underline">afield</span> by water or by wind. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>But only those few spores that <span class="underline">settle</span> down in very <span class="underline">favorable</span> locations can start new life; the <span class="underline">vast</span> <span class="underline">majority</span> fall on <span class="underline">barren</span> ground. By force of <span class="underline">sheer</span> numbers, however, the mosses and ferns reached Hawaii, survived, and multiplied. Some <span class="underline">species</span> developed great size, becoming tree ferns that <span class="underline">even</span> now grow in the Hawaiian forests.</p>
          <p>Many millions of years after ferns evolved (but long before the Hawaiian Islands were born from the sea), another kind of <span class="underline">flora</span> evolved on Earth: the seed-bearing plants. This was a wonderful biological invention. The seed has an outer <span class="underline">coating</span> that surrounds the <span class="underline">genetic</span> <span class="underline">material</span> of the new plant, and inside this covering is a concentrated <span class="underline">supply</span> of nutrients. Thus the seed's chances of <span class="underline">survival</span> are greatly enhanced over those of the <span class="underline">naked</span> <span class="underline">spore</span>. One type of seed-bearing plant, the <span class="underline">angiosperm</span>, includes all forms of blooming <span class="underline">vegetation</span>. In the <span class="underline">angiosperm</span> the seeds are wrapped in an <span class="underline">additional</span> <span class="underline">layer</span> of covering. Some of these coats are hard–like the <span class="underline">shell</span> of a nut–for <span class="underline">extra</span> protection. Some are <span class="underline">soft</span> and tempting, like a peach or a cherry. In some angiosperms the seeds are equipped with gossamer wings, like the <span class="underline">dandelion</span> and milkweed seeds. These new characteristics offered better ways for the seed to move to new habitats. They could travel <span class="underline">through</span> the <span class="underline">air</span>, <span class="underline">float</span> in water, and lie <span class="underline">dormant</span> for many months.</p>
          <p>Plants with large, <span class="underline">buoyant</span> seeds-like coconuts-<span class="underline">drift</span> on ocean currents and are washed up on the shores. Remarkably <span class="underline">resistant</span> to the vicissitudes of ocean travel, they can <span class="underline">survive</span> <span class="underline">prolonged</span> immersion in saltwater when they come to rest on warm beaches and the conditions are <span class="underline">favorable</span>, the seed coats soften. Nourished by their imported <span class="underline">supply</span> of nutrients, the young plants push out their roots and <span class="underline">establish</span> their place in the sun.</p>
          <p>By means of these seeds, plants <span class="underline">spread</span> more widely to new locations, <span class="underline">even</span> to <span class="underline">isolated</span> islands like the Hawaiian <span class="underline">archipelago</span>, which lies more than 2,000 miles west of California and 3,500 miles east of Japan. The seeds of grasses, flowers, and blooming trees made the long trips to these islands. (Grasses are simple forms of angiosperms that <span class="underline">bear</span> their encapsulated seeds on long stalks.) In a surprisingly short time, angiosperms filled many of the land areas on Hawaii that had been <span class="underline">bare</span>.</p>
