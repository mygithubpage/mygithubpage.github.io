            <span class="time" data-times="7.28" data-time="117.98">[01:57.98]</span>Pro: True! In fact, the type of packaging has something to do with the way milk's treated against <span class="highlight">bacteria</span>.</p>

            <span class="time" data-times="6.35" data-time="125.26">[02:05.26]</span>Stu: Yeah, and I read a study that showed how light can give milk a funny <span class="highlight">flavor</span> and <span class="highlight">decrease</span> its nutritional value. <span class="time" data-times="2.32" data-time="131.61">[02:11.61]</span>And yet most milk bottles are <span class="highlight">clear</span>. <span class="time" data-times="1.25" data-time="133.93">[02:13.93]</span>What's up about that?</p>

            <span class="time" data-times="4.76" data-time="135.18">[02:15.18]</span>Pro: Well consumers like being able to visually examine the color of the milk. <span class="time" data-times="4.05" data-time="139.94">[02:19.94]</span>That might be one <span class="highlight">reason</span> that <span class="highlight">opaque</span> bottles haven't really caught on. <span class="time" data-times="4.2" data-time="143.99">[02:23.99]</span>But that study... I'm sure there is more studies on the <span class="highlight">subject</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.6" data-time="148.19">[02:28.19]</span>You shouldn't <span class="highlight">base</span> your paper on only one study.</p>
