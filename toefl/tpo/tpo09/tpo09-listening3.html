            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.99" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in an <span class="underline">environmental</span> science class.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="19.23" data-time="7.99">[00:07.99]</span>Lecturer: So since we're on the topic of global <span class="underline">climate</span> change and its effects, in Alaska, in the northern <span class="underline">Arctic</span> part of Alaska, over the last ... oh... thirty years or so, temperatures have increased about half a <span class="underline">degree</span> Celsius per <span class="underline">decade</span>, and scientists have noticed that there's been a change in surface <span class="underline">vegetation</span> during this time. <span class="time" data-times="3.13" data-time="27.22">[00:27.22]</span>Shrubs are increasing in the "tundra". <span class="time" data-times="3.03" data-time="30.35">[00:30.35]</span> <span class="underline">Tundra</span> is <span class="underline">flat</span> land with very little <span class="underline">vegetation</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.65" data-time="33.38">[00:33.38]</span>Just a few <span class="underline">species</span> of plants grow there because the <span class="underline">temperature</span> is very cold, and there's not much <span class="underline">precipitation</span>. <span class="time" data-times="10.08" data-time="39.03">[00:39.03]</span>And because of the cold temperatures, the <span class="underline">tundra</span> has two layers: top <span class="underline">layer</span>, which is called the active <span class="underline">layer</span>, is frozen in the winter and <span class="underline">spring</span>, but thaws in the summer. <span class="time" data-times="8.99" data-time="49.11">[00:49.11]</span> <span class="underline">Beneath</span> this active <span class="underline">layer</span> is a <span class="underline">second</span> <span class="underline">layer</span> called "permafrost", which is frozen all year around, and is <span class="underline">impermeable</span> to water.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.69" data-time="58.1">[00:58.10]</span>
              <span class="underline">Female</span> Stu: So because of the permafrost, none of the plants that grow there can have deep roots, can they?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.28" data-time="63.79">[01:03.79]</span>Lecturer: No, and that's one of the reasons that shrubs <span class="underline">survive</span> in the <span class="underline">Arctic</span>. <span class="time" data-times="1.73" data-time="68.07">[01:08.07]</span>Shrubs are little bushes. <span class="time" data-times="4.13" data-time="69.8">[01:09.80]</span>They're not tall and being low to the ground protects them from the cold and wind. <span class="time" data-times="6" data-time="73.93">[01:13.93]</span>And their roots don't grow very deep, so the permafrost doesn't <span class="underline">interfere</span> with their growth. OK? <span class="time" data-times="6.54" data-time="79.93">[01:19.93]</span>Now since the temperatures have been increasing in <span class="underline">Arctic</span> Alaska, the growth of shrubs has increased. <span class="time" data-times="3.29" data-time="86.47">[01:26.47]</span>And this has presented <span class="underline">climate</span> scientists with a <span class="underline">puzzle</span>...</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.73" data-time="89.76">[01:29.76]</span>
              <span class="underline">Male</span> Stu: I'm sorry, when you say the growth of shrubs has increased, do you mean that the shrubs are bigger, or that there are more shrubs?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.66" data-time="97.49">[01:37.49]</span>Lecturer: Good question! And the answer is both. <span class="time" data-times="8.62" data-time="100.15">[01:40.15]</span>The size of the shrubs has increased and <span class="underline">shrub</span> cover has <span class="underline">spread</span> to what was <span class="underline">previously</span> shrub-free <span class="underline">tundra</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.2" data-time="108.77">[01:48.77]</span>Ok, so what's the <span class="underline">puzzle</span>? <span class="time" data-times="4.65" data-time="110.97">[01:50.97]</span>Warmer temperatures should <span class="underline">lead</span> to increased <span class="underline">vegetation</span> growth, right? <span class="time" data-times="2.61" data-time="115.62">[01:55.62]</span>Well, the connection is not so simple.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.23" data-time="118.23">[01:58.23]</span>The <span class="underline">temperature</span> increase has occurred during the winter and <span class="underline">spring</span>, not during the summer. <span class="time" data-times="3.96" data-time="123.46">[02:03.46]</span>But the increase in shrubs has occurred in the summer. <span class="time" data-times="6.59" data-time="127.42">[02:07.42]</span>So how can increase temperatures in the winter and <span class="underline">spring</span> result in increased <span class="underline">shrub</span> growth in the summer? <span class="time" data-times="15.62" data-time="134.01">[02:14.01]</span>Well, it may be biological processes that <span class="underline">occur</span> in the soil in the winter, that cause increased <span class="underline">shrub</span> growth in the summer, and here's how: there are "microbes", <span class="underline">microscopic</span> organisms that live in the soil.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.42" data-time="149.63">[02:29.63]</span>These microbes enable the soil to have more <span class="underline">nitrogen</span>, which plants need to live and they <span class="underline">remain</span> quite active during the winter. <span class="time" data-times="8.41" data-time="157.05">[02:37.05]</span>There're two reasons for this: first, they live in the active <span class="underline">layer</span>, which, remember, contains water that doesn't <span class="underline">penetrate</span> the permafrost.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.22" data-time="165.46">[02:45.46]</span>
              <span class="underline">Second</span>, most of the <span class="underline">precipitation</span> in the <span class="underline">Arctic</span> is in the form of snow. <span class="time" data-times="6.38" data-time="170.68">[02:50.68]</span>And the snow, which blankets the ground in the winter, actually has an insulating effect on the soil <span class="underline">beneath</span> it. <span class="time" data-times="7.73" data-time="177.06">[02:57.06]</span>And it allows the <span class="underline">temperature</span> of the soil to <span class="underline">remain</span> warm enough for microbes to <span class="underline">remain</span> active. <span class="time" data-times="3.54" data-time="184.79">[03:04.79]</span>So there's been increased <span class="underline">nutrient</span> production in the winter. <span class="time" data-times="6.02" data-time="188.33">[03:08.33]</span>And that's what's <span class="underline">responsible</span> for the growth of shrubs in the summer and their <span class="underline">spread</span> to new areas of the <span class="underline">tundra</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.23" data-time="194.35">[03:14.35]</span>Areas with more new nutrients are the areas with the largest increase in shrubs.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.26" data-time="198.58">[03:18.58]</span>
              <span class="underline">Female</span> Stu: But, what about run-off in the <span class="underline">spring</span>, when the snow finally melts? <span class="time" data-times="2.09" data-time="202.84">[03:22.84]</span>Won't the nutrients get washed away? <span class="time" data-times="3.29" data-time="204.93">[03:24.93]</span> <span class="underline">Spring</span> <span class="underline">thaw</span> always washes away soil, doesn't it?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.97" data-time="208.22">[03:28.22]</span>Lecturer: Well, much of the soil is usually still frozen during <span class="underline">peak</span> run-off. <span class="time" data-times="9.04" data-time="212.19">[03:32.19]</span>And the nutrients are deep down in the active <span class="underline">layer</span> anyway, not high up near the surface, which is the part of the active <span class="underline">layer</span> most affected by run-off. <span class="time" data-times="3.92" data-time="221.23">[03:41.23]</span>But as I was about to say, there's more to the story. <span class="time" data-times="5.01" data-time="225.15">[03:45.15]</span>The <span class="underline">tundra</span> is windy, and the snow is blown <span class="underline">across</span> the <span class="underline">tundra</span>, it's caught by shrubs. <span class="time" data-times="3.04" data-time="230.16">[03:50.16]</span>And deep snow drifts often form around shrubs.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.86" data-time="233.2">[03:53.20]</span>And we've already mentioned the insulating effect of snow. <span class="time" data-times="11.6" data-time="237.06">[03:57.06]</span>So that <span class="underline">extra</span> warmth means <span class="underline">even</span> more microbial <span class="underline">activity</span>, which means <span class="underline">even</span> more food for the shrubs, which means <span class="underline">even</span> more shrubs and more snow around etc.. <span class="time" data-times="1.57" data-time="248.66">[04:08.66]</span>It's a circle, a loop. <span class="time" data-times="9.35" data-time="250.23">[4:10.23]</span>And because of this loop, which is promoted by warmer temperatures in winter and <span class="underline">spring</span>, well, it looks like the <span class="underline">tundra</span> may be turning into <span class="underline">shrub</span> land.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.12" data-time="259.58">[04:19.58]</span>
              <span class="underline">Female</span> Stu: But will it be long-term? <span class="time" data-times="4.91" data-time="261.7">[04:21.70]</span>I mean maybe the shrubs will be <span class="underline">abundant</span> for a few years, and then it'll change back to <span class="underline">tundra</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.89" data-time="266.61">[04:26.61]</span>Lecturer: Well, <span class="underline">shrub</span> <span class="underline">expansion</span> has occurred in other environments, like <span class="underline">semiarid</span> grassland, and tall grass prairies. <span class="time" data-times="6.17" data-time="273.5">[04:33.50]</span>And <span class="underline">shrub</span> <span class="underline">expansion</span> in these environments does <span class="underline">seem</span> to <span class="underline">persist</span>, almost to the point of causing a <span class="underline">shift</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="279.67">[04:39.67]</span>Once is established, <span class="underline">shrub</span> land thrives, particularly in the <span class="underline">Arctic</span>, because <span class="underline">Arctic</span> shrubs are good at taking <span class="underline">advantage</span> of increased nutrients in the soil, better than other <span class="underline">Arctic</span> plants.</p>
