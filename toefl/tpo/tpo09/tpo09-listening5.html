<span class="time" data-times="1.78" data-time="57.44">[00:57.44]</span>It's just sand, after all. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="1.25" data-time="59.22">[00:59.22]</span>Lecturer: Good question! <span class="time" data-times="9.98" data-time="60.47">[01:00.47]</span>We know from modern day <span class="highlight">desert</span> lakes, like Lake Eyre in South Australia, that under the right conditions, lakes do form in the <span class="highlight">desert</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.12" data-time="70.45">[01:10.45]</span>But the Empty Quarter lakes disappeared thousands of years ago. <span class="time" data-times="8.36" data-time="75.57">[01:15.57]</span>They left behind their beds or basins as <span class="highlight">limestone</span> formations that we can still see today. <span class="time" data-times="8.05" data-time="83.93">[01:23.93]</span>They look like <span class="highlight">low-lying</span>, white or grey buttes, long, narrow hills with <span class="highlight">flat</span> tops, <span class="highlight">barely</span> a meter high. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.37" data-time="91.98">[01:31.98]</span>A recent study of some of the formations presents some new theories about the area's past. <span class="time" data-times="4.81" data-time="98.35">[01:38.35]</span>Keep in <span class="highlight">mind</span> though that this study only looked at 19 formations. <span class="time" data-times="2.27" data-time="103.16">[01:43.16]</span>And about a thousand have been documented. <span class="time" data-times="2.55" data-time="105.43">[01:45.43]</span>So there's a lot more work to be done. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="10.5" data-time="107.98">[01:47.98]</span>According to the study, two factors were important for lake <span class="highlight">formation</span> in the Empty Quarter: first, the rains that fell there were torrential. <span class="time" data-times="4.27" data-time="118.48">[01:58.48]</span>So it would've been impossible for all the water to <span class="highlight">soak</span> into the ground. <span class="time" data-times="8.41" data-time="122.75">[02:02.75]</span><span class="highlight">Second</span>, as you know, sand dunes <span class="highlight">contain</span> other types of particles, <span class="highlight">besides</span> sand, including <span class="highlight">clay</span> and <span class="highlight">silt</span>. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.57" data-time="131.16">[02:11.16]</span>Now, when the rain fell, water ran down the sides of the dunes, carrying <span class="highlight">clay</span> and <span class="highlight">silt</span> particles with it. <span class="time" data-times="7.14" data-time="138.73">[02:18.73]</span>And wherever these particles settled, they formed a <span class="highlight">pan</span>, a <span class="highlight">layer</span> that water couldn't <span class="highlight">penetrate</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.48" data-time="145.87">[02:25.87]</span>Once this <span class="highlight">pan</span> formed, further run-off collected, and formed a lake.<span class="time" data-times="19.69" data-time="152.35">[02:32.35]</span>Now, the older lakes, about half the formations, the ones that started forming 37, 000 years ago, the <span class="highlight">limestone</span> formations we see, they're up to a kilometer long, but only a few meters wide, and they're <span class="highlight">scattered</span><span class="highlight">along</span> the <span class="highlight">desert</span> floor, in valleys between the dunes. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.21" data-time="172.04">[02:52.04]</span>So, the <span class="highlight">theory</span> is, the lakes formed there on the <span class="highlight">desert</span> floor, in these long narrow valleys. <span class="time" data-times="12.18" data-time="179.25">[02:59.25]</span>And we know, because of what we know about <span class="highlight">similar</span><span class="highlight">ancient</span><span class="highlight">desert</span> lakes, we know that the lakes didn't last very long, from a few months to a few years on <span class="highlight">average</span>. <span class="time" data-times="11.05" data-time="191.43">[03:11.43]</span>As for the more recent lakes, the ones from 10,000 years ago, well, they seemed to have been smaller, and so may have dried up more quickly. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="9.76" data-time="202.48">[03:22.48]</span>Another <span class="highlight">difference</span>, very important today for distinguishing between older lake beds and newer ones, is the location of the <span class="highlight">limestone</span> formations. <span class="time" data-times="3.56" data-time="212.24">[03:32.24]</span>The more recent beds are high up in the dunes. <span class="time" data-times="2.66" data-time="215.8">[03:35.80]</span>Why these differences? <span class="time" data-times="8.36" data-time="218.46">[03:38.46]</span>Well, there are some ideas about that, and they have to do with the shapes of the sand dunes, when the lakes were formed. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="9.98" data-time="226.82">[03:46.82]</span>37, 000 years ago, the dunes were probably nicely rounded at the top, so the water just ran right down their sides to the <span class="highlight">desert</span> floor. <span class="time" data-times="6.9" data-time="236.8">[03:56.80]</span>But there were thousands of years of wind between the two rainy periods, reshaping the dunes. <span class="time" data-times="13.54" data-time="243.7">[04:03.70]</span>So, during the <span class="highlight">second</span> rainy period, the dunes were kind of chopped up at the top, full of hollows and ridges, and these hollows would've captured the rain right there on the top. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="12.79" data-time="257.24">[04:17.24]</span>Now, in a grassland of Lake Ecosystem, we'd <span class="highlight">expect</span> to find fossils from a <span class="highlight">variety</span> of animals, and <span class="highlight">numerous</span> fossils have been found at <span class="highlight">least</span> at these <span class="highlight">particular</span> sites. <span class="time" data-times="3.11" data-time="270.03">[04:30.03]</span>But, where did these animals come from? <span class="time" data-times="8.88" data-time="273.14">[04:33.14]</span>Well, the <span class="highlight">theory</span> that has been suggested is that they migrated in from nearby habitats where they were already living. <span class="time" data-times="4.16" data-time="282.02">[04:42.02]</span>Then as the lakes dried up, they died out. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.45" data-time="286.18">[04:46.18]</span>The study makes a <span class="highlight">couple</span> of interesting points about the fossils, which I hope will be looked at in future studies. <span class="time" data-times="14.02" data-time="293.63">[04:53.63]</span>At older lake sites, there's <span class="highlight">fossil</span> remains from hippopotamuses, water <span class="highlight">buffalo</span>, animals that spend much of their lives standing in water, and also, fossils of <span class="highlight">cattle</span>. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="14.65" data-time="307.65">[05:07.65]</span>However, at the sites of the more recent lakes, there's only <span class="highlight">cattle</span> fossils, <span class="highlight">additional</span><span class="highlight">evidence</span> for geologists that these lakes were probably smaller, shallower, because <span class="highlight">cattle</span> only use water for drinking. <span class="time" data-times="2.25" data-time="322.3">[05:22.30]</span>So they <span class="highlight">survive</span> on much less. <span class="time" data-times="6.84" data-time="324.55">[05:24.55]</span>Interestingly, there are clams and snail shells; but, no fossils of fish. <span class="time" data-times="1.41" data-time="331.39">[05:31.39]</span>We're not sure why. <span class="time" data-times="3.5" data-time="332.8">[05:32.80]</span>Maybe there was a problem with the water. <span class="time" data-times="1.83" data-time="336.3">[05:36.30]</span>Maybe it was too salty. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="338.13">[05:38.13]</span>That's certainly true of other <span class="highlight">desert</span> lakes. </p></p></article></section><div id="question"><div id="question1"><p>What is the lecture mainly about?</p><label class="my-label"><span>A.
