Another difference, very important today for distinguishing between older lake beds and newer ones, is the location of the limestone formations. (A option)</p><p>Now, the older lakes, about half the formations, the ones that started forming 37000 years ago, the limestone formations we see, they're up to a kilometer long, but only a few meters wide, and they're scattered along the desert Floor, in valleys between the dunes. So, the theory is, the lakes forming there on the desert floor, in these long narrow valleys. And we know, because of what we know about similar ancient desert lakes, we know that the lakes didn 't last very long, from a few months to a few years on average. As for the more recent lakes, the ones from 10000 years ago, well, they seemed to have been smaller, and so may have dried up more quickly(D Options).</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor imply about the lack of water buffalo and hippopotamus fossils in the more recent lakes?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.
