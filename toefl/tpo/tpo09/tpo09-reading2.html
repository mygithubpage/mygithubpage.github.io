            <b>Reflection in Teaching</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>Teachers, it is thought, <span class="underline">benefit</span> from the practice of <span class="underline">reflection</span>, the <span class="underline">conscious</span> act of thinking deeply about and carefully examining the interactions and events <span class="underline">within</span> their own classrooms. Educators T. Wildman and J. Niles (1987) <span class="underline">describe</span> a <span class="underline">scheme</span> for developing reflective practice in experienced teachers. This was <span class="light">justified</span> by the view that reflective practice could help teachers to feel more intellectually involved in their role and work in teaching and enable them to cope with the <span class="underline">paucity</span> of <span class="underline">scientific</span> fact and the uncertainty of knowledge in the <span class="underline">discipline</span> of teaching.</p>
          <p>Wildman and Niles were particularly interested in investigating the conditions under which <span class="underline">reflection</span> might <span class="underline">flourish</span>–a <span class="underline">subject</span> on which there is little guidance in the <span class="underline">literature</span>. They designed an <span class="underline">experimental</span> <span class="underline">strategy</span> for a group of teachers in Virginia and worked with 40 practicing teachers over several years. They were concerned that many would be "drawn to these new, <span class="underline">refreshing</span>" conceptions of teaching only to find that the void between the abstractions and the realities of teacher <span class="underline">reflection</span> is too great to bridge. <span class="underline">Reflection</span> on a <span class="underline">complex</span> task such as teaching is not easy. The teachers were taken <span class="underline">through</span> a program of talking about teaching events, moving on to reflecting about <span class="underline">specific</span> issues in a supported, and later an <span class="underline">independent</span>, <span class="underline">manner</span>.</p>
          <p>Wildman and Niles observed that <span class="underline">systematic</span> <span class="underline">reflection</span> on teaching required a <span class="underline">sound</span> <span class="underline">ability</span> to understand classroom events in an <span class="underline">objective</span> <span class="underline">manner</span>. They <span class="underline">describe</span> the <span class="underline">initial</span> understanding in the teachers with whom they were working as being "<span class="underline">utilitarian</span> ... and not rich or detailed enough to <span class="underline">drive</span> <span class="underline">systematic</span> <span class="underline">reflection</span>." Teachers <span class="underline">rarely</span> have the time or opportunities to view their own or the teaching of others in an <span class="underline">objective</span> <span class="underline">manner</span>. Further <span class="underline">observation</span> revealed the <span class="underline">tendency</span> of teachers to <span class="underline">evaluate</span> events rather than <span class="underline">review</span> the contributory factors in a considered <span class="underline">manner</span> by, in effect, standing outside the situation.</p>
          <p>Helping this group of teachers to <span class="underline">revise</span> their thinking about classroom events became central.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>This <span class="underline">process</span> took time and patience and <span class="underline">effective</span> trainers. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>The researchers <span class="underline">estimate</span> that the <span class="underline">initial</span> training of the teachers to view events objectively took between 20 and 30 hours, 
with the same number of hours again being required to  practice the skills of <span class="underline">reflection</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C">
            </span>Wildman and Niles <span class="underline">identify</span> three principles that <span class="underline">facilitate</span> reflective practice in a teaching situation.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>The first is support from administrators in an education system, enabling teachers to understand the requirements of reflective practice and how it relates to teaching students. The <span class="underline">second</span> is the <span class="underline">availability</span> of <span class="underline">sufficient</span> time and <span class="underline">space</span>. The teachers in the program described how they found it difficult to put aside the <span class="underline">immediate</span> demands of others in order 
to give themselves the time they needed to develop their reflective skills. The third is the <span class="underline">development</span> of a collaborative environment with support from other teachers. Support and encouragement were also required to help teachers in the program cope with aspects of their <span class="underline">professional</span> life with which they were not comfortable. Wildman and Niles make a <span class="underline">summary</span> comment: "Perhaps the most important thing we learned is the idea of the teacher-as-reflective-practitioner will not happen <span class="underline">simply</span> 
because it is a good or <span class="underline">even</span> <span class="underline">compelling</span> idea."</p>
          <p>The work of Wildman and Niles suggests the importance of recognizing some of the difficulties of instituting reflective practice. Others have noted this, making a similar point about the teaching profession's cultural inhibitions about reflective practice. Zeichner and Liston (1987) point out the inconsistency between the role of the teacher as a (reflective) <span class="underline">professional</span> decision maker and the more usual role of the teacher as a technician, putting into practice the ideas of theirs. More <span class="underline">basic</span> than the cultural issues is the matter of <span class="underline">motivation</span>. Becoming a reflective practitioner requires <span class="underline">extra</span> work (Jaworski, 1993) and has only vaguely defined goals with, perhaps, little <span class="underline">initially</span> perceivable <span class="underline">reward</span> and the threat of <span class="underline">vulnerability</span>. Few have directly questioned what might <span class="underline">lead</span> a teacher to want to become reflective. Apparently, the most <span class="underline">obvious</span> <span class="underline">reason</span> for teachers to work toward reflective practice is that teacher educators think it is a good thing. There <span class="underline">appear</span> to be many unexplored matters about the <span class="underline">motivation</span> to <span class="underline">reflect</span> – for example, the value of externally motivated <span class="underline">reflection</span> as <span class="underline">opposed</span> to that of teachers who might <span class="underline">reflect</span> by <span class="underline">habit</span>.</p>
