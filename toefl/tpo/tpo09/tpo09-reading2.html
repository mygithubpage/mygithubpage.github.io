Educators T. Wildman and J. Niles (1987) <span class="highlight">describe</span> a <span class="highlight">scheme</span> for developing reflective practice in experienced teachers. This was <span class="question1">justified</span> by the view that reflective practice could help teachers to feel more intellectually involved in their role and work in teaching and enable them to cope with the <span class="highlight">paucity</span> of <span class="highlight">scientific</span> fact and the uncertainty of knowledge in the <span class="highlight">discipline</span> of teaching.</p><p>Wildman and Niles were particularly interested in investigating the conditions under which <span class="highlight">reflection</span> might <span class="highlight"><span class="question3">flourish</span></span>-a <span class="highlight">subject</span> on which there is little guidance in the <span class="highlight">literature</span>. They designed an <span class="highlight">experimental</span><span class="highlight">strategy</span> for a group of teachers in Virginia and worked with 40 practicing teachers over several years. They were concerned that many would be "drawn to these new, <span class="highlight">refreshing</span>" conceptions of teaching only to find that the void between the abstractions and the realities of teacher <span class="highlight">reflection</span> is too great to bridge. <span class="highlight">Reflection</span> on a <span class="highlight">complex</span> task such as teaching is not easy. The teachers were taken <span class="highlight">through</span> a program of talking about teaching events, moving on to reflecting about <span class="highlight">specific</span> issues in a supported, and later an <span class="highlight">independent</span>, <span class="highlight">manner</span>.</p><p>Wildman and Niles observed that <span class="highlight">systematic</span><span class="highlight">reflection</span> on teaching required a <span class="highlight">sound</span><span class="highlight">ability</span> to understand classroom events in an <span class="highlight"><span class="question6">objective</span></span><span class="highlight">manner</span>. They <span class="highlight">describe</span> the <span class="highlight">initial</span> understanding in the teachers with whom they were working as being "<span class="highlight">utilitarian</span> ... and not rich or detailed enough to <span class="highlight">drive</span><span class="highlight">systematic</span><span class="highlight">reflection</span>." Teachers <span class="highlight">rarely</span> have the time or opportunities to view their own or the teaching of others in an <span class="highlight">objective</span><span class="highlight">manner</span>. Further <span class="highlight">observation</span> revealed the <span class="highlight">tendency</span> of teachers to <span class="highlight">evaluate</span> events rather than <span class="highlight">review</span> the contributory factors in a considered <span class="highlight">manner</span> by, in effect, standing outside the situation.</p><p>Helping this group of teachers to <span class="highlight">revise</span> their thinking about classroom events became central.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>This <span class="highlight">process</span> took time and patience and <span class="highlight">effective</span> trainers. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>The researchers <span class="highlight">estimate</span> that the <span class="highlight">initial</span> training of the teachers to view events objectively took between 20 and 30 hours,
with the same number of hours again being required to  practice the skills of <span class="highlight">reflection</span>.</p><p><span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>Wildman and Niles <span class="highlight">identify</span> three principles that <span class="highlight">facilitate</span> reflective practice in a teaching situation.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>The first is support from administrators in an education system, enabling teachers to understand the requirements of reflective practice and how it relates to teaching students. The <span class="highlight">second</span> is the <span class="highlight">availability</span> of <span class="highlight">sufficient</span> time and <span class="highlight">space</span>. The teachers in the program described how they found it difficult to put aside the <span class="highlight">immediate</span> demands of others in order
to give themselves the time they needed to develop their reflective skills. The third is the <span class="highlight">development</span> of a collaborative environment with support from other teachers. Support and encouragement were also required to help teachers in the program cope with aspects of their <span class="highlight">professional</span> life with which they were not comfortable. Wildman and Niles make a <span class="highlight">summary</span> comment: "Perhaps the most important thing we learned is the idea of the teacher-as-reflective-practitioner will not happen <span class="highlight">simply</span>
because it is a good or <span class="highlight">even</span><span class="highlight"><span class="question9">compelling</span></span>idea."</p><p>The work of Wildman and Niles suggests the importance of recognizing some of the difficulties of instituting reflective practice. Others have noted this, making a similar point about the teaching profession's cultural inhibitions about reflective practice. Zeichner and Liston (1987) point out the inconsistency between the role of the teacher as a (reflective) <span class="highlight">professional</span> decision maker and the more usual role of the teacher as a technician, putting into practice the ideas of theirs. More <span class="highlight">basic</span> than the cultural issues is the matter of <span class="highlight">motivation</span>. Becoming a reflective practitioner requires <span class="highlight">extra</span> work (Jaworski, 1993) and has only vaguely defined goals with, perhaps, little <span class="highlight">initially</span> perceivable <span class="highlight">reward</span> and the threat of <span class="highlight">vulnerability</span>. Few have directly questioned what might <span class="highlight">lead</span> a teacher to want to become reflective. Apparently, the most <span class="highlight">obvious</span><span class="highlight">reason</span> for teachers to work toward reflective practice is that teacher educators think it is a good thing. <span class="question11">There <span class="highlight">appear</span> to be many unexplored matters about the <span class="highlight">motivation</span> to <span class="highlight">reflect</span> - for example, the value of externally motivated <span class="highlight">reflection</span> as <span class="highlight">opposed</span> to that of teachers who might <span class="highlight">reflect</span> by <span class="highlight">habit</span>.</span></p></article></div><div id="question"><div id="question1"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">justified</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p><label class="my-label"><span>A. supported</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><label class="my-label"><span>B. shaped</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><label class="my-label"><span>C. stimulated</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><label class="my-label"><span>D. suggested</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><p><span>Answer: </span><span class="my-answer">A</span></p></div><div id="question2"><p>According to paragraph 1, it was believed that reflection could help teachers</p><label class="my-label"><span>A. understand intellectual principles of teaching</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><label class="my-label"><span>B. strengthen their intellectual connection to their work</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><label class="my-label"><span>C. use scientific fact to improve discipline and teaching</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><label class="my-label"><span>D. adopt a more disciplined approach to teaching</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><p><span>Answer: </span><span class="my-answer">B</span></p></div><div id="question3"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question3">flourish</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p><label class="my-label"><span>A. continue</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><label class="my-label"><span>B. occur</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><label class="my-label"><span>C. succeed</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><label class="my-label"><span>D. apply</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><p><span>Answer: </span><span class="my-answer">C</span></p></div><div id="question4"><p>All of the following are mentioned about the experimental strategy described in paragraph 2 EXCEPT:</p><label class="my-label"><span>A.
