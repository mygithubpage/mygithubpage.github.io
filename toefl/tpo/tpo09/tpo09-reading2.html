Educators T. Wildman and J. Niles (1987) <span class="highlight">describe</span> a <span class="highlight">scheme</span> for developing reflective practice in experienced teachers. This was <span class="highlight question1">justified</span> by the view that reflective practice could help teachers to feel more intellectually involved in their role and work in teaching and enable them to cope with the <span class="highlight">paucity</span> of <span class="highlight">scientific</span> fact and the uncertainty of knowledge in the <span class="highlight">discipline</span> of teaching.</p><p>Wildman and Niles were particularly interested in investigating the conditions under which <span class="highlight">reflection</span> might <span class="highlight"><span class="question3">flourish</span></span>-a <span class="highlight">subject</span> on which there is little guidance in the <span class="highlight">literature</span>. They designed an <span class="highlight">experimental</span><span class="highlight">strategy</span> for a group of teachers in Virginia and worked with 40 practicing teachers over several years. They were concerned that many would be "drawn to these new, <span class="highlight">refreshing</span>" conceptions of teaching only to find that the void between the abstractions and the realities of teacher <span class="highlight">reflection</span> is too great to bridge. <span class="highlight">Reflection</span> on a <span class="highlight">complex</span> task such as teaching is not easy. The teachers were taken <span class="highlight">through</span> a program of talking about teaching events, moving on to reflecting about <span class="highlight">specific</span> issues in a supported, and later an <span class="highlight">independent</span>, <span class="highlight">manner</span>.</p><p>Wildman and Niles observed that <span class="highlight">systematic</span><span class="highlight">reflection</span> on teaching required a <span class="highlight">sound</span><span class="highlight">ability</span> to understand classroom events in an <span class="highlight"><span class="question6">objective</span></span><span class="highlight">manner</span>. They <span class="highlight">describe</span> the <span class="highlight">initial</span> understanding in the teachers with whom they were working as being "<span class="highlight">utilitarian</span> ... and not rich or detailed enough to <span class="highlight">drive</span><span class="highlight">systematic</span><span class="highlight">reflection</span>." Teachers <span class="highlight">rarely</span> have the time or opportunities to view their own or the teaching of others in an <span class="highlight">objective</span><span class="highlight">manner</span>. Further <span class="highlight">observation</span> revealed the <span class="highlight">tendency</span> of teachers to <span class="highlight">evaluate</span> events rather than <span class="highlight">review</span> the contributory factors in a considered <span class="highlight">manner</span> by, in effect, standing outside the situation.</p><p>Helping this group of teachers to <span class="highlight">revise</span> their thinking about classroom events became central.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>This <span class="highlight">process</span> took time and patience and <span class="highlight">effective</span> trainers. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>The researchers <span class="highlight">estimate</span> that the <span class="highlight">initial</span> training of the teachers to view events objectively took between 20 and 30 hours,
with the same number of hours again being required to  practice the skills of <span class="highlight">reflection</span>.</p><p><span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>Wildman and Niles <span class="highlight">identify</span> three principles that <span class="highlight">facilitate</span> reflective practice in a teaching situation.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>The first is support from administrators in an education system, enabling teachers to understand the requirements of reflective practice and how it relates to teaching students. The <span class="highlight">second</span> is the <span class="highlight">availability</span> of <span class="highlight">sufficient</span> time and <span class="highlight">space</span>. The teachers in the program described how they found it difficult to put aside the <span class="highlight">immediate</span> demands of others in order
to give themselves the time they needed to develop their reflective skills. The third is the <span class="highlight">development</span> of a collaborative environment with support from other teachers. Support and encouragement were also required to help teachers in the program cope with aspects of their <span class="highlight">professional</span> life with which they were not comfortable. Wildman and Niles make a <span class="highlight">summary</span> comment: "Perhaps the most important thing we learned is the idea of the teacher-as-reflective-practitioner will not happen <span class="highlight">simply</span>
because it is a good or <span class="highlight">even</span><span class="highlight"><span class="question9">compelling</span></span> idea."</p><p>The work of Wildman and Niles suggests the importance of recognizing some of the difficulties of instituting reflective practice. Others have noted this, making a similar point about the teaching profession's cultural inhibitions about reflective practice. Zeichner and Liston (1987) point out the inconsistency between the role of the teacher as a (reflective) <span class="highlight">professional</span> decision maker and the more usual role of the teacher as a technician, putting into practice the ideas of theirs. More <span class="highlight">basic</span> than the cultural issues is the matter of <span class="highlight">motivation</span>. Becoming a reflective practitioner requires <span class="highlight">extra</span> work (Jaworski, 1993) and has only vaguely defined goals with, perhaps, little <span class="highlight">initially</span> perceivable <span class="highlight">reward</span> and the threat of <span class="highlight">vulnerability</span>. Few have directly questioned what might <span class="highlight">lead</span> a teacher to want to become reflective. Apparently, the most <span class="highlight">obvious</span><span class="highlight">reason</span> for teachers to work toward reflective practice is that teacher educators think it is a good thing. <span class="question11">There <span class="highlight">appear</span> to be many unexplored matters about the <span class="highlight">motivation</span> to <span class="highlight">reflect</span> - for example, the value of externally motivated <span class="highlight">reflection</span> as <span class="highlight">opposed</span> to that of teachers who might <span class="highlight">reflect</span> by <span class="highlight">habit</span>.</span></p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">justified</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. supported</p><p>B. shaped</p><p>C. stimulated</p><p>D. suggested</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>Justify: Proof. A is support; B is development, formation; C is stimulation; D is suggestion, suggestion. Just think of justice means justice, so A's support is correct. Corresponding to the original: This was justified by the view that reflective law could help teachers to feel more intellectually involved in their role and work in teaching and enable them to cope with the paucity of scientific fact and the uncertainty of knowledge in the discipline of teaching. Sentences justify the point of view. Look at the contents of the two, before that teachers benefit from reflection, behind the reflective practice to help the teacher, so the meaning of the two should be the same, that is justify is a positive word, BCD are neutral, so it is not right.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 1, it was believed that reflection could help teachers</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. understand intellectual principles of teaching</p><p>B. strengthen their intellectual connection to their work</p><p>C. use scientific fact to improve discipline and teaching</p><p>D. adopt a more disciplined approach to teaching</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>With help teachers keyword-targeted to the last sentence: This was justified by the view that reflective that could help teachers to feel more intellectually involved in their role and work in teaching and enable them to cope with the paucity of scientific fact and the uncertainty of Knowledge in the discipline of teaching. Help teachers to participate in teaching more intellectually, so the answer is B, where the degree of rewriting is relatively large, and all are easily misplaced. A's understanding of the concept of stealing, the original statement is to deal with uncertainty of discipline; C and A is the concept of stealing, the original scientific fact and discipline is a tie, there is no purpose relationship.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question3">flourish</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. continue</p><p>B. occur</p><p>C. succeed</p><p>D. apply</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" C"><p>Flourish: prosperous and prosperous. A is a continuation; B is an appearance; C is a success; D is an application. So C's succeded correctly. Corresponding to the original: Wildman and Niles were interested in investigating the conditions under which reflected perhaps <span class="question3">flourish</span>ï¿½a subject on which there is little guidance in the literature. The original said that these two individuals were interested in the investigation, the investigation was about reflection in some cases How is it? This sentence alone or even in the paragraph is not a good guess, but the full text is said that the reflection is very good, so it should be a good word, A continued B application D application is not reliable.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>All of the following are mentioned about the experimental strategy described in paragraph 2 EXCEPT:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It was designed so that teachers would eventually reflect without help from others.</p><p>B. It was used by a group of teachers over a period of years.</p><p>C. It involved having teachers take part in discussions of classroom events.</p><p>D. It involved having teachers record in writing their reflections about teaching.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>A's without help synonymous with the little guidance of the first sentence: Wildman and Niles were interested in investigating the conditions under which reflection might <span class="question3">flourish</span>ï¿½a subject on which there is little guidance in the literature. A correct, not selected. In the same way, it can also be seen from the independent of the last sentence that it is ultimately independent and completes the reflection without help; the discussion of C is synonymous with that of the last sentence of the original text. B's a period of years is keyword oriented to the second sentence: they designed an experimental strategy for a group of teachers in Virginia and worked with 40 practicing teachers over several years. B is correct, not selected; D's writing did not say, wrong, choose.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 2, Wildman and Niles worried that the teachers they were working with might feel that</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. the number of teachers involved in their program was too large</p><p>B. the concepts of teacher reflection were so abstract that they could not be applied</p><p>C. the ideas involved in reflection were actually not new and refreshing</p><p>D. several years would be needed to acquire the habit of reflecting on their teaching</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Worried keywords positioning to the third sentence of thecern:They were concerned that many would be "drawn to these new, refreshing" conceptions of teaching only to find that the void between the abstractions and the realities of teacher reflection is too great to bridge Say they are worried that teachers feel that the gap between teaching theory and reality is insurmountable, so B is correct and nothing else is mentioned.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">objective</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. unbiased</p><p>B. positive</p><p>C. systematic</p><p>D. thorough</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>B objective, objective, object objects, objects, so A's unbiased is not biased correctly. There is also an objective in the penultimate sentence, so you can use the last sentence to make a guess. The last sentence says that teachers are more willing to stay out of the house to evaluate the whole thing. Being impersonal means being objective. It is easy to mistakenly choose systematic. Systematic and thoroughness are similar in meaning to some extent, so they are not selected. Positive positive positives have nothing to do.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 3, what did the teachers working with Wildman and Niles often fail to do when they attempted to practice reflection?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Correctly calculate the amount of time needed for reflection.</p><p>B. Provide sufficiently detailed descriptions of the methods they used to help them reflect.</p><p>C. Examine thoughtfully the possible causes of events in their classrooms.</p><p>D. Establish realistic goals for themselves in practicing reflection.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C This problem is more difficult, the lack of keywords in the stem, exclusion. A's time keyword positioning to the third sentence, the original said that there is no time to do, the option that the calculation time, is not the same thing, wrong; B's detailed descriptions do keyword positioning to the second sentence, the original teacher said on the reflection The understanding is not meticulous enough, the answer says that the description of the method is not detailed enough, not the same thing, and it is not selected; the cause of C is synonymous with the contributory factors in the last sentence of the original text. The original text says evaluate rather than review, that is, there is no reason for the review. The cause with C is the synonymous substitution, correct; D did not mention it.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>How is paragraph 4 related to other aspects of the discussion of reflection in the passage?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It describes and comments on steps taken to overcome problems identified earlier in the passage.</p><p>B. It challenges the earlier claim that teachers rarely have the time to think about their own or others' teaching.</p><p>C. It identifies advantages gained by teachers who followed the training program described earlier in the passage.</p><p>D. It explains the process used to define the principles discussed later in the passage.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A asked the entire sentence to see the first sentence, saying that it is very important to help these teachers change their thinking about classroom events. The previous paragraph stated that many teachers face problems arising from classroom incidents, so this section proposes solutions. Method, so the answer is A. This paragraph and the previous paragraph is not a contradiction between, so B's challenge is wrong; this paragraph is just to state the facts, did not say follow teachers have any advantage, so C's advantages are wrong; from the contents of this paragraph can not see and the next paragraph What to contact, so D is wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question9">compelling</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. commonly held</p><p>B. persuasive</p><p>C. original</p><p>D. practical</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>Compelling: <span class="question9">compelling</span> and convincing. A is usually held; B is convincing; C is primitive; D is actual. So persuasive is persuasively correct. Corresponding to the original: Perhaps the most important thing we learned is the idea of the teacher-as-reflective-practitioner will not happen simply because it is a good or even <span class="question9">compelling</span> idea. The most important thing that we learned is that Just because this is a good note, even a <span class="question9">compelling</span> note. In the sentence, there is a progressive relationship between <span class="question9">compelling</span> and good, so it should be better than good, and the ACD cannot express this meaning.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 6, teachers may be discouraged from reflecting because</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. it is not generally supported by teacher educators</p><p>B. the benefits of reflection may not be apparent immediately</p><p>C. it is impossible to teach and reflect on one's teaching at the same time</p><p>D. they have often failed in their attempts to become reflective practitioners</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B This problem is more difficult, lack of keywords in the stem, exclusion. A's educators do keyword positioning to the penultimate sentence, the original saying educator thinks it's a good thing, the option says no, supportive, and wrong; B has no obvious keywords, but the penultimate sentence says that reflective practitioner needs extra work. Unclear, there are few returns at first, that is, B will not see the benefits at first, but neither C nor D will mention them.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The practice of being reflective is no longer simply a habit among teachers but something that is externally motivated.</p><p>B. Most teachers need to explore ways to form the habit of reflection even when no external motivation exists.</p><p>C. Many aspects of the motivation to reflect have not been studied, including the comparative benefits of externally motivated and habitual reflection among teachers.</p><p>D. There has not been enough exploration of why teachers practice reflection as a habit with or without external motivation.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C: The original dash is followed by an example, and the main part is: There are many unknown questions about motivation. A changed the original trunk, wrong; B mixed the example and the trunk, changed the original structure, wrong; C correct; D has a certain deceptive, behind the original dash is only one of many unknown problems, D did not mention the trunk Many unknown problems, wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>However, changing teachers' thinking about reflection will not succeed unless there is support for reflection in the teaching environment..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C, two transition points, how and teaching environment, teaching environment coincide with teaching situation of the fifth paragraph, and confirm C or D. D said after the first, said three principals before, so the transition is tight, ruled out, correct answer C. The fourth paragraph says that changing thinking requires time and manpower. However a turning point begins to say that changes in the teaching situation will change the effect of thinking, so however is just right here.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>Wildman and Niles have conducted research on reflection in teaching.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.Through their work with Virginia teachers, Wildman and Niles proved conclusively that reflection, though difficult, benefits both teachers and students.</p><p>B.Wildman and Niles found that considerable training and practice are required to understand classroom events and develop the skills involved in reflection.</p><p>C.Wildman and Niles identified three principles that teachers can use to help themselves cope with problems that may arise as a result of reflection.</p><p>D.Wildman and Niles concluded that teachers need sufficient resources as well as the cooperation and encouragement of others to practice reflection.</p><p>E.There are numerous obstacles to implementing reflection in schools and insufficient understanding of why teachers might want to reflect.</p><p>F.Whether teachers can overcome the difficulties involved in reflection may depend on the nature and intensity of their motivation to reflect.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="BDE"><p>BDE</p><p>The structure of this paper is rather special in TOEFL reading. It is a review of the study and mainly introduces two people's research on the practice of education reflection.</p><p>The first paragraph said the importance of educational reflection.</p><p>The second paragraph says that W and N have studied the conditions for implementing reflective education.</p><p>The third paragraph is still a study of the conditions for implementing reflective education, emphasizing sound ability to understand classroom events in an objective manner.</p><p>The fourth paragraph continues with three paragraphs, emphasizing that training can be achieved through education.</p><p>The fifth section introduces the three principles of implementation of educational rethinking discovered by W and N: leadership support, time and space, and team atmosphere.</p><p>The last paragraph said that W and N emphasize difficulty, and others' research emphasizes the importance of motivation.</p><p>The guide sentence is a summary of the article.</p><p>The A(through) option is wrong.

It has nothing to do with the student.</p><p>The B (Wildman and Niles found) option corresponds to the fourth paragraph of the original text, correct.</p><p>The C (Wildman and Niles identify) option seems to correspond to five paragraphs. It is somewhat confusing. The original text emphasizes the team and emphasizes leadership support. It does not say that individuals can handle it. Therefore, this option is wrong and should not be chosen.</p><p>The D (Wildman and Niles conclude) option corresponds to the three principals in the fifth paragraph of the original text, correct.</p><p>The E (There are) option corresponds to the two parts of the sixth paragraph of the original text and is correct.</p><p>The F(Whether) option seems to correspond to the second half of the original paragraph, but the original only speaks of motivation, and does not speak of nature and intensity.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
