            <b>Colonizing the Americas via the Northwest Coast</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>It has long been accepted that the Americas were colonized by a <span class="highlight">migration</span> of peoples from Asia, slowly traveling <span class="highlight">across</span> a land bridge called Beringia 
(now the Bering Strait between northeastern Asia and Alaska) during the last Ice Age. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>The first water <span class="highlight">craft</span> <span class="highlight">theory</span> about the <span class="highlight">migration</span> was that around 11,000-12,000 years ago 
there was an ice-free <span class="highlight">corridor</span> stretching from eastern Beringia to the areas of North America south of the great northern glaciers. It was the midcontinental <span class="highlight">corridor</span> between two
<span class="highlight">massive</span> ice sheets-the Laurentide to the west-that enabled the southward <span class="highlight">migration</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>But belief in this ice-free <span class="highlight">corridor</span> began to <span class="highlight">crumble</span> when paleoecologist Glen MacDonald 
demonstrated that some of the most important <span class="highlight">radiocarbon</span> dates used to support the <span class="highlight">existence</span> of an ice-free <span class="highlight">corridor</span> were incorrect. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>He <span class="question2">persuasively </span>argued that such an ice-free 
<span class="highlight">corridor</span> did not exist until much later, when the <span class="highlight">continental</span> ice began its final <span class="highlight">retreat</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p>
          <p>Support is growing for the <span class="highlight">alternative</span> <span class="highlight">theory</span> that people using watercraft, possibly skin boats, moved southward from Beringia <span class="highlight">along</span> the Gulf of Alaska and then southward <span class="highlight">along</span> the Northwest <span class="highlight">coast</span> of North America possibly as early as 16,000 years ago. This <span class="highlight">route</span> would have enabled humans to enter southern areas of the Americas <span class="highlight"><span class="question4">prior</span> to </span>the <span class="highlight">melting</span> of the <span class="highlight">continental</span> glaciers. Until the early 1970s,most archaeologists did not <span class="highlight">consider</span> the <span class="highlight">coast</span> a possible <span class="highlight">migration</span> <span class="highlight">route</span> into the Americas because geologists originally believed that during the last Ice Age the entire Northwest <span class="highlight">Coast</span> was covered by <span class="highlight">glacial</span> ice. It had been assumed that the ice extended westward from the Alaskan/Canadian mountains to the very <span class="highlight">edge</span> of the <span class="highlight">continental</span> shelf, the <span class="highlight">flat</span>, submerged part of the <span class="highlight">continent</span> that extends into the ocean. This would have created a <span class="highlight">barrier</span> of ice extending from the Alaska Peninsula, <span class="highlight">through</span> the Gulf of Alaska and southward <span class="highlight">along</span> the Northwest <span class="highlight">Coast</span> of north America to what is today the <span class="highlight">state</span> of Washington.</p>
          <p>The most <span class="highlight">influential</span> <span class="highlight">proponent</span> of the coastal <span class="highlight">migration</span> <span class="highlight">route</span> has been Canadian archaeologist Knut Fladmark. He theorized that with the use of watercraft, people <span class="highlight">gradually</span> colonized unglaciated refuges and areas <span class="highlight">along</span> the <span class="highlight">continental</span> shelf <span class="highlight">exposed</span> by the <span class="highlight">lower</span> sea <span class="highlight">level</span>. Fladmark's <span class="highlight">hypothesis</span> received <span class="highlight">additional</span> support from the fact that the greatest <span class="highlight">diversity</span> in native American languages occurs <span class="highlight">along</span> the west <span class="highlight">coast</span> of the Americas, suggesting that this <span class="highlight">region</span> has been settled the longest.</p>
          <p>More recent geologic studies documented deglaciation and the <span class="highlight">existence</span> of ice-free areas <span class="highlight">throughout</span> <span class="highlight">major</span> coastal areas of British Columbia, Canada, by 13,000 years ago. Research now indicates that sizable areas of southeastern Alaska <span class="highlight">along</span> the <span class="highlight">inner</span> <span class="highlight">continental</span> shelf were not covered by ice toward the end of the last Ice Age. One study suggests that except for a 250-mile coastal area between southwestern British Columbia and Washington <span class="highlight">State</span>, the Northwest <span class="highlight">Coast</span> of North America was largely free of ice by <span class="highlight">approximately</span> 16,000 years ago. <span class="highlight"><span class="question8">Vast</span> </span>areas <span class="highlight">along</span> the <span class="highlight">coast</span> may have been deglaciated beginning around 16,000 years ago, possibly providing a coastal <span class="highlight">corridor</span> for the movement of plants, animals, and humans sometime between 13,000 and 14,000 years ago.</p>
          <p>The coastal <span class="highlight">hypothesis</span> has gained increasing support in recent years because the remains of large land animals, such as <span class="highlight">caribou</span> and brown bears, have been found in southeastern Alaska dating between 10,000 and 12,500 years ago. This is the time period in which most scientists formerly believed the area to be <span class="highlight"><span class="question10">inhospitable</span> </span>for humans. It has been suggested that if the environment were <span class="highlight">capable</span> of supporting <span class="highlight">breeding</span> populations of bears, there would have been enough food resources to support humans. Fladmark and other believe that the first human <span class="highlight">colonization</span> of America occurred by boat <span class="highlight">along</span> the Northwest <span class="highlight">Coast</span> during the very late Ice Age, possibly as early as 14,000 years ago. The most recent geologic <span class="highlight">evidence</span> indicates that it may have been possible for people to <span class="highlight">colonize</span> ice-free regions <span class="highlight">along</span> the <span class="highlight">continental</span> shelf that were still <span class="highlight">exposed</span> by the <span class="highlight">lower</span> sea <span class="highlight">level</span> between13,000 and 14,000 years ago.</p>
          <p>The coastal <span class="highlight">hypothesis</span> suggests an <span class="highlight">economy</span> based on <span class="highlight">marine</span> <span class="highlight">mammal</span> hunting, saltwater fishing gathering, and the use of watercraft. Because of the <span class="highlight">barrier</span> of ice to the east, the <span class="highlight">Pacific</span> Ocean to the west, and populated areas to the north, there may have been a greater <span class="highlight"><span class="question12">impetus</span> </span>for people to move in a southerly direction.</p>

          <p>Recent evidence favors a rival to the long-standing theory that the Americas were colonized 11,000-12,000 years ago by people migrating south from Beringia along a midcontinental ice-free corridor.</p>

            <span>A.Evidence that an ice-free corridor between two ice sheets developed when the continental ice first began to melt came primarily from radiocarbon dating.</span>
