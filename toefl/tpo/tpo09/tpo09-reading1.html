(now the Bering Strait between northeastern Asia and Alaska) during the last Ice Age. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>The first water <span class="highlight">craft</span><span class="highlight">theory</span> about the <span class="highlight">migration</span> was that around 11,000-12,000 years ago 
there was an ice-free <span class="highlight">corridor</span> stretching from eastern Beringia to the areas of North America south of the great northern glaciers. It was the midcontinental <span class="highlight">corridor</span> between two
<span class="highlight">massive</span> ice sheets-the Laurentide to the west-that enabled the southward <span class="highlight">migration</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>But belief in this ice-free <span class="highlight">corridor</span> began to <span class="highlight">crumble</span> when paleoecologist Glen MacDonald 
demonstrated that some of the most important <span class="highlight">radiocarbon</span> dates used to support the <span class="highlight">existence</span> of an ice-free <span class="highlight">corridor</span> were incorrect. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>He <span class="question2">persuasively</span> argued that such an ice-free 
<span class="highlight">corridor</span> did not exist until much later, when the <span class="highlight">continental</span> ice began its final <span class="highlight">retreat</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p><p>Support is growing for the <span class="highlight">alternative</span><span class="highlight">theory</span> that people using watercraft, possibly skin boats, moved southward from Beringia <span class="highlight">along</span> the Gulf of Alaska and then southward <span class="highlight">along</span> the Northwest <span class="highlight">coast</span> of North America possibly as early as 16,000 years ago. This <span class="highlight">route</span> would have enabled humans to enter southern areas of the Americas <span class="question4"><span class="highlight">prior</span> to</span> the <span class="highlight">melting</span> of the <span class="highlight">continental</span> glaciers. Until the early 1970s,most archaeologists did not <span class="highlight">consider</span> the <span class="highlight">coast</span> a possible <span class="highlight">migration</span><span class="highlight">route</span> into the Americas because geologists originally believed that during the last Ice Age the entire Northwest <span class="highlight">Coast</span> was covered by <span class="highlight">glacial</span> ice. It had been assumed that the ice extended westward from the Alaskan/Canadian mountains to the very <span class="highlight">edge</span> of the <span class="highlight">continental</span> shelf, the <span class="highlight">flat</span>, submerged part of the <span class="highlight">continent</span> that extends into the ocean. This would have created a <span class="highlight">barrier</span> of ice extending from the Alaska Peninsula, <span class="highlight">through</span> the Gulf of Alaska and southward <span class="highlight">along</span> the Northwest <span class="highlight">Coast</span> of north America to what is today the <span class="highlight">state</span> of Washington.</p><p>The most <span class="highlight">influential</span><span class="highlight">proponent</span> of the coastal <span class="highlight">migration</span><span class="highlight">route</span> has been Canadian archaeologist Knut Fladmark. He theorized that with the use of watercraft, people <span class="highlight">gradually</span> colonized unglaciated refuges and areas <span class="highlight">along</span> the <span class="highlight">continental</span> shelf <span class="highlight">exposed</span> by the <span class="highlight">lower</span> sea <span class="highlight">level</span>. <span class="question6">Fladmark's <span class="highlight">hypothesis</span> received <span class="highlight">additional</span> support from the fact that the greatest <span class="highlight">diversity</span> in native American languages occurs <span class="highlight">along</span> the west <span class="highlight">coast</span> of the Americas, suggesting that this <span class="highlight">region</span> has been settled the longest.</span></p><p>More recent geologic studies documented deglaciation and the <span class="highlight">existence</span> of ice-free areas <span class="highlight">throughout</span><span class="highlight">major</span> coastal areas of British Columbia, Canada, by 13,000 years ago. Research now indicates that sizable areas of southeastern Alaska <span class="highlight">along</span> the <span class="highlight">inner</span><span class="highlight">continental</span> shelf were not covered by ice toward the end of the last Ice Age. One study suggests that except for a 250-mile coastal area between southwestern British Columbia and Washington <span class="highlight">State</span>, the Northwest <span class="highlight">Coast</span> of North America was largely free of ice by <span class="highlight">approximately</span> 16,000 years ago. <span class="highlight"><span class="question8">Vast</span></span> areas <span class="highlight">along</span> the <span class="highlight">coast</span> may have been deglaciated beginning around 16,000 years ago, possibly providing a coastal <span class="highlight">corridor</span> for the movement of plants, animals, and humans sometime between 13,000 and 14,000 years ago.</p><p>The coastal <span class="highlight">hypothesis</span> has gained increasing support in recent years because the remains of large land animals, such as <span class="highlight">caribou</span> and brown bears, have been found in southeastern Alaska dating between 10,000 and 12,500 years ago. This is the time period in which most scientists formerly believed the area to be <span class="highlight"><span class="question10">inhospitable</span></span> for humans. It has been suggested that if the environment were <span class="highlight">capable</span> of supporting <span class="highlight">breeding</span> populations of bears, there would have been enough food resources to support humans. Fladmark and other believe that the first human <span class="highlight">colonization</span> of America occurred by boat <span class="highlight">along</span> the Northwest <span class="highlight">Coast</span> during the very late Ice Age, possibly as early as 14,000 years ago. The most recent geologic <span class="highlight">evidence</span> indicates that it may have been possible for people to <span class="highlight">colonize</span> ice-free regions <span class="highlight">along</span> the <span class="highlight">continental</span> shelf that were still <span class="highlight">exposed</span> by the <span class="highlight">lower</span> sea <span class="highlight">level</span> between13,000 and 14,000 years ago.</p><p>The coastal <span class="highlight">hypothesis</span> suggests an <span class="highlight">economy</span> based on <span class="highlight">marine</span><span class="highlight">mammal</span> hunting, saltwater fishing gathering, and the use of watercraft. Because of the <span class="highlight">barrier</span> of ice to the east, the <span class="highlight">Pacific</span> Ocean to the west, and populated areas to the north, there may have been a greater <span class="highlight"><span class="question12">impetus</span></span> for people to move in a southerly direction.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 1, the theory that people first migrated to the Americans by way of an ice-free corridor was seriously called into question by</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. paleoecologist Glen MacDonald's argument that the original migration occurred much later than had previously been believed</p><p>B. the demonstration that certain previously accepted radiocarbon dates were incorrect</p><p>C. evidence that the continental ice began its final retreat much later than had previously been believed</p><p>D. research showing that the ice-free corridor was not as long lasting as had been widely assumed</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B. Position the second and fourth sentences with the keyword ice-free corridor. The second sentence simply states what the theory is. The question asked into question is questioned. So the answer should be in the fourth sentence. Say this theory crumble because Mr. GM found that radiocarbon dates is wrong, so answer B.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question2">persuasively</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. aggressively</p><p>B. inflexibly</p><p>C. convincingly</p><p>D. carefully</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" C"><p>A <span class="question2">persuasively</span>: Persuasive and convincing. A is aggression; B is indomitable; C is convincing; D is serious. So C's convincingly correct.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Paragraph 2 begins by presenting a theory and then goes on to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. discuss why the theory was rapidly accepted but then rejected</p><p>B. present the evidence on which the theory was based</p><p>C. cite evidence that now shows that the theory is incorrect</p><p>D. explain why the theory was not initially considered plausible</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D. The question asked how to put forward the theory first, so look at the second sentence. Say this route allows people to enter the southern part of the Americas before the glaciers melt, so this is to support the first sentence of this paragraph, and the latter sentence said that until the 1970s, people recognized the coast line, that is, before people did not agree with this theory, and then Think this theory may be right. Both A and C are not correct; the original did not say that the previous theory was based on this fact. B was wrong and D was correct.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The phrase "<span class="highlight">prior to</span>" is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. before</p><p>B. immediately after</p><p>C. during</p><p>D. in spite of</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="prior to A"><p>Prior to: Before... A is before... B is right after; C is during... D is despite. Think of priority, so A is right. The preceding sentence says that from the Bering Sea to the south along the Gulf of Alaska, the whole thing is talking about the waterway. MS should be iced. Afterwards, but the original text emphasizes special emphasis on entering the southern part of the Americas, which means that people usually go to the north with glaciers. If they enter the south after the glaciers melt, there is no need to emphasize the south. C had no information during the melting of the glacier; D was not necessary although it was used.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Paragraph 2 supports the idea that, before the 1970s, most archaeologists held which of the following views about the earliest people to reach the Americas?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They could not have sailed directly from Beringia to Alaska and then southward because, it was thought, glacial ice covered the entire coastal region.</p><p>B. They were not aware that the climate would continue to become milder.</p><p>C. They would have had no interest in migrating southward from Beringia until after the continental glaciers had begun to melt.</p><p>D. They lacked the navigational skills and appropriate boats needed long-distance trips.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A Positioning to the third sentence with the keywords 1970s. Prior to the 1970s, people believed that the waterway was impossible because the ice covered the sea, so A was correct. B/C/D did not say anything.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways to leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Because this region has been settled the longest, it also displays the greatest diversity in Native American languages.</p><p>B. Fladmark's hypothesis states that the west coast of the Americas has been settled longer than any other region.</p><p>C. The fact that the greatest diversity of Native American languages occurs along the west coast of the Americans lends strength to Fradmark's hypothesis.</p><p>D. According to Fladmark, Native American languages have survived the longest along the west coast of the Americas.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The structure of the C original sentence is the hypothesis of Fladmark, which is supported by fact. C said fact lend strength to his hypothesis, so correct. A's causality is not original; the original said that facts support hypothesis, both B and D said that Fladmark said this, the concept of stealing was not correct.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The author's purpose in paragraph 4 is to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. indicate that a number of recent geologic studies seem to provide support for the coastal hypothesis</p><p>B. indicate that coastal and inland migrations may have happened simultaneously</p><p>C. explain why humans may have reached America's northwest coast before animals and plants did</p><p>D. show that the coastal hypothesis may explain how people first reached Alaska but it cannot explain how people reached areas like modern British Columbia and Washington State</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A asked the purpose of the entire paragraph, so look at the first sentence. The study showed that there was no ice on the Canadian coast at that time, so it was a hypothesis that supported the sea route to the Americas. A or D might be right, but the latter part of D did not say in the original, so A was correct. Don't worry if you look later, the second sentence is again a study indicating blabla, so A's a number of studies is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question8">Vast</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Frozen</p><p>B. Various</p><p>C. Isolated</p><p>D. Huge</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" D"><p><span class="question8">Vast</span>: huge. A is frozen; B is all sorts; C is isolated and separated; D is huge. So D's hugeness is correct. Corresponding to the original: <span class="question8">Vast</span> areas along the coast may have been deglaciated beginning around 16,000 years ago, possibly providing a coastal corridor for the movement of plants, animals, and humans sometime between 13,000 and 14,000 years ago. When it is ice, it provides a migration channel for humans and animals. Only large areas have no ice before they can form channels. Since there is no ice, A's frost must be wrong; B is a variety of mistakes, because the original does not say a lot of areas; all form a channel, and C is isolated.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 5, the discovery of the remains of large land animals supports the coastal hypothesis by providing evidence that</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. humans were changing their hunting techniques to adapt to coastal rather than inland environments</p><p>B. animals had migrated from the inland to the coasts, an indication that a midcontinental ice-free corridor was actually implausible</p><p>C. humans probably would have been able to find enough resources along the coastal corridor</p><p>D. the continental shelf was still exposed by lower sea levels during the period when the southward migration of people began</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C uses the keywords of remains of large land animal to locate the first sentence, but this sentence is obviously only a repetition of the problem. After seeing the past, the next sentence says <span class="question10">inhospitable</span>, and the next one says that if the bear has food, there is also the answer C correct. Did not say anything else.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question10">inhospitable</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. not familiar</p><p>B. not suitable</p><p>C. not dangerous</p><p>D. not reachable</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>Inhospitable: Inhabitable, <span class="question10">inhospitable</span>. A is not familiar with; B is not suitable; C is not dangerous; D is not available. So B doesn't fit correctly. Corresponding to the original: This is the time period in which most scientists formerly considered the area to be <span class="question10">inhospitable</span> for humans. The next sentence says that if the bear has someone to eat, that is, if the person can survive, the phrase in which the inspipid table is located is due to a formal belief. People thought that they could not survive, so C was not dangerous; neither A and D said it.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 5, the most recent geologic research provides support for a first colonization of America dating as far back as</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. 16,000 years ago</p><p>B. 14,000 years ago</p><p>C. 12,500 years ago</p><p>D. 10,000 years ago</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>According to most recent geologic research, the most recent geologic evidence indicates that it may have been possible for people to colonize ice-free regions along the continental shelf that were still exposed by the lower sea level between 13,000 and 14,000 years.

This section refers to time (first sentence, last two sentences) in three places, and you can quickly find answers by quickly sweeping.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question12">impetus</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. chance</p><p>B. protection</p><p>C. possibility</p><p>D. incentive</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" D"><p>Impetus: Impetus, stimulation. A is an opportunity; B is a protection; C is a possibility; D is a motivation, a stimulus. So D's incentive is correct. The original sentence says: Ocean to the west, and populated areas to the north, there may have been a greater <span class="question12">impetus</span> for people to move in a southerly direction. What is bigger in flight? If you simply bring it in, both A's chance and C's possibility are correct, but the meaning of the two words is very close, so it's not right. Protection does not fly.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Moreover, other evidence suggests that even if an ice-free corridor did exist, it would have lacked the resources needed for human colonization..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D Four transition points, namely moreover, other evidence, even if and exist.

The recent option corresponds to the last sentence of the fourth paragraph of the original text, correct. The original research option did not say, do not choose. The there is evidence option corresponds to the last two sentences in the fifth paragraph of the original text, correct.
