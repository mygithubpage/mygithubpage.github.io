What's wrong?</p><p>(woman) I just found out I have to move out of my apartment, like, right away.</p><p>(man) You're kidding! Why?</p><p>(woman) Well, my apartment, it's in a house, a kind of old house. And now something's wrong with the water pipes. I think some of the pipes burst or wore out or something. Anyway, we don't have any water in the house, and apparently it's gonna take two weeks to fix the problem.</p><p>(man) So you need to find a place to live for what? two weeks or so?</p><p>(woman) Yeah, bad timing, huh? With mid-term exams coming up and everything!</p><p>(man) So you've figured out what you're going to do?</p><p>(woman) Well, some friends said I could stay at their place. They don't have an extra bedroom but they said it'd be OK for me to sleep on their living room couch.</p><p>(man) You could probably handle that for a couple of weeks, right?</p><p>(woman) I guess so. I mean it's really nice of them to offer. And it's free! The only problem is they alread y have four people living there so it could be a little crowded.</p><p>(man) And not ideal for studying for mid-terms.</p><p>(woman) Yeah, too many distractions.</p><p>(man) Hmmm, any other options?</p><p>(woman) Well, I did find this place. It's a small hotel over on 3 street right near campus.</p><p>(man) Oh, right! A lot of kid's parents stay there when they come for a visit.</p><p>(woman) Right. So I could get a room there. They have a weekly rate and it's pretty reasonable. But, I don't know.</p><p>(man) At least at the hotel you'd have a space of your own, you know, so you could get more done.</p><p>(woman) That's definitely a plus. But I have to think about it. Even though it's pretty cheap, it'll still end up costing me some money. And my budget is pretty tight right now."</p></article><section id="question"><h4>Question</h4><p>Briefly summarize the problem the speakers are discussing. Then state which solution you would recommend. Explain the reasons for your recommendation. </p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>Well, the woman's problem is that there's something wrong with the water pipes in her house and it takes two weeks to fix the pipes so she has to move out to find some place for her mid-term preparation. Accordingly, there are two options for her to solve the problem: first, she could move to her friends' place; and second, she could find a small hotel near her campus. I think, the second solution is a better idea. Firstly, going to a hotel means personal space and quiet study atmosphere so she will surely prepare herself well for her mid-term. Secondly, the hotel can cost on a weekly rate which is quite reasonable for the woman, so I think she can afford it for the sake of better concentration on study after class. After all the main duty of the students is to study. So based on the reasons stated above I agree and recommend the second solution. (153 words)</p></article></div></main></body></html>
