          <p>As I think, university professor is the most rewarding job. First of all, the profession can bring you a great sense of achievement. One of the greatest joys in the world is seeing students who have struggled with a concept and suddenly get this light behind their eyes as the key ingredient that was confusing them disappears, and they suddenly understand the concept and how to apply it. There are few greater rewards on Earth than being responsible for that kind of knowledge growth in another human being. What's more, a professor might make a difference to a student's life. I can't emphasize enough how much I appreciate Professor Malakoff's guidance when I was struggling with what to do in my life after graduation. She made me realize my passion for education and my possibility for being a good teacher. And I'm enjoying every second of my teaching career now. She made a huge influence on my career path.  </p>
