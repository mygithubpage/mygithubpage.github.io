              <span class="time" data-times="4.66" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in an <span class="underline">architecture</span> class. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.31" data-time="4.66">[00:04.66]</span>Professor: Today I'd like to talk a bit about the relationship between the built world and <span class="underline">sound</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.81" data-time="11.97">[00:11.97]</span>Uh, the design of buildings like <span class="underline">concert</span> halls or theaters. <span class="time" data-times="4.8" data-time="15.78">[00:15.78]</span>So, what's the most important <span class="underline">aspect</span> in the design of such a building? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="0.93" data-time="20.58">[00:20.58]</span>Student: Acoustics? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.9" data-time="21.51">[00:21.51]</span>Professor: Yes. Now, people have been concerned about how <span class="underline">sound</span> carries in auditoriums and theaters for at <span class="underline">least</span> 2,000 years. <span class="time" data-times="8.06" data-time="30.41">[00:30.41]</span>But it was not until the beginning of the twentieth <span class="underline">century</span> that architectural acoustics became a <span class="underline">scientific</span> <span class="underline">field</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.53" data-time="38.47">[00:38.47]</span>That was when the physicist Wallace Sabine started to do <span class="underline">extensive</span> studies on reverberation. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.73" data-time="46">[00:46.00]</span>Sabine <span class="underline">wanted</span> to find out why the <span class="underline">audience</span> could not understand speakers at a lecture hall in Boston. <span class="time" data-times="5.04" data-time="54.73">[00:54.73]</span>He designed a <span class="underline">series</span> of studies on reverberation to <span class="underline">figure</span> it out. <span class="time" data-times="2.72" data-time="59.77">[00:59.77]</span>So, what is reverberation? <span class="time" data-times="6.74" data-time="62.49">[01:02.49]</span>It's the persistence of <span class="underline">sound</span> in a room after the <span class="underline">source</span> has stopped making <span class="underline">sound</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.24" data-time="69.23">[01:09.23]</span>You see, <span class="underline">sound</span> made in a room reflects off the walls, floors and ceiling. <span class="time" data-times="2.39" data-time="75.47">[01:15.47]</span>That's the reverberant <span class="underline">sound</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.44" data-time="77.86">[01:17.86]</span>The time it takes for the reverberant <span class="underline">sound</span> to die down is important for the <span class="underline">acoustic</span> <span class="underline">quality</span> of a room. <span class="time" data-times="7.2" data-time="85.3">[01:25.30]</span>Sabine recognized this and he came up with an <span class="underline">equation</span> to <span class="underline">measure</span> a room's reverberation time. <span class="time" data-times="5.44" data-time="92.5">[01:32.50]</span>So, what happens if the reverberation time is very long? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.29" data-time="97.94">[01:37.94]</span>Student: Wouldn't it be difficult to hear new sounds if you can still hear the old sounds? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.8" data-time="104.23">[01:44.23]</span>Professor: Exactly. A long reverberation time may cause <span class="underline">musical</span> notes to drown one another out. <span class="time" data-times="9.88" data-time="111.03">[01:51.03]</span>On the other hand, if the reverberation time is very short ... meaning, the reverberations are absorbed very quickly, the room is called dead. <span class="time" data-times="5.3" data-time="120.91">[02:00.91]</span>Performers would feel they have to struggle to fill the room with <span class="underline">sound</span>. <span class="time" data-times="1.7" data-time="126.21">[02:06.21]</span>We don't want that. <span class="time" data-times="6.4" data-time="127.91">[02:07.91]</span>In a <span class="underline">concert</span> hall or theater, we <span class="underline">prefer</span> a live room, where the <span class="underline">sound</span> has fullness. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.94" data-time="134.31">[02:14.31]</span>So we need to control the reverberation time.<span class="time" data-times="4.89" data-time="138.25">[02:18.25]</span> After all, we don't want the listeners or the performers to have to struggle, right? <span class="time" data-times="6.15" data-time="143.14">[02:23.14]</span>So what are some important considerations when we design a theater or a <span class="underline">concert</span> hall? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.73" data-time="149.29">[02:29.29]</span>Student: The size of the place? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.26" data-time="153.02">[02:33.02]</span>Professor: <span class="underline">Absolutely</span>. The larger the room, the longer the reverberation time. <span class="time" data-times="9.49" data-time="157.28">[02:37.28]</span>So we'll have to take into <span class="underline">account</span> what the room will be mainly used for, since music requires more reverberation than speech. <span class="time" data-times="6.14" data-time="166.77">[02:46.77]</span>A room intended for music needs to be designed differently from a room intended for drama. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.25" data-time="172.91">[02:52.91]</span>For music, we need a very large room, a <span class="underline">concert</span> hall, actually I should say for full orchestras. <span class="time" data-times="8.61" data-time="182.16">[03:02.16]</span>Because for a single <span class="underline">instrument</span>, say something like a piano <span class="underline">recital</span>, a room with a short reverberation time is better. <span class="time" data-times="6.93" data-time="190.77">[03:10.77]</span>So for a <span class="underline">solo</span> piano a smaller room works well. Yes? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.45" data-time="197.7">[03:17.70]</span>Student: I read that <span class="underline">concert</span> halls designed for <span class="underline">symphony</span> orchestras have too much <span class="underline">echo</span> for jazz music. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.26" data-time="203.15">[03:23.15]</span>Professor: That doesn't surprise me. <span class="time" data-times="5.15" data-time="205.41">[03:25.41]</span>Most small jazz groups would need rooms with a shorter reverberation time. <span class="time" data-times="7.31" data-time="210.56">[03:30.56]</span>But <span class="underline">besides</span> the size of the room, another <span class="underline">variable</span> affecting reverberation is the <span class="underline">shape</span> of the room. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="18.25" data-time="217.87">[03:37.87]</span>Let's say you design a <span class="underline">rectangular</span> box-like <span class="underline">space</span> with <span class="underline">bare</span> walls and ceiling, this would allow the <span class="underline">sound</span> to act like a ball in a racquetball <span class="underline">court</span>, you know, bouncing around and hitting some parts of the walls and ceiling but missing many others. <span class="time" data-times="6.24" data-time="236.12">[03:56.12]</span>If that happens in a <span class="underline">concert</span> hall, <span class="underline">audience</span> members may hear some sounds, but not others. <span class="time" data-times="5.64" data-time="242.36">[04:02.36]</span>So what can be done to <span class="underline">distribute</span> the <span class="underline">sound</span> evenly in every direction? <span class="time" data-times="6.4" data-time="248">[04:08.00]</span>The answer is: <span class="underline">avoid</span> straight, <span class="underline">parallel</span> walls. Karen? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.75" data-time="254.4">[04:14.40]</span>Student: But I think I've seen photos of <span class="underline">rectangular</span> <span class="underline">concert</span> halls. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.43" data-time="261.15">[04:21.15]</span>Professor: Right. Older <span class="underline">concert</span> halls from the 1800s are generally <span class="underline">rectangular</span>. <span class="time" data-times="13.74" data-time="266.58">[04:26.58]</span>But they all have a lot of decorations on the walls inside, lots of ornamental plasterwork like statues, which <span class="underline">distribute</span> <span class="underline">sound</span> very efficiently, reflecting it in all different directions. <span class="time" data-times="3.97" data-time="280.32">[04:40.32]</span>And that brings me to another <span class="underline">variable</span> we need to <span class="underline">consider</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.7" data-time="284.29">[04:44.29]</span>The <span class="underline">acoustic</span> characteristics of the building materials as well as the wall and floor coverings. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.12" data-time="291.99">[04:51.99]</span>In fact, most objects you see in a <span class="underline">concert</span> hall or theater serve double duty. <span class="time" data-times="4.89" data-time="298.11">[04:58.11]</span>The plush chairs <span class="underline">absorb</span> <span class="underline">sound</span> and soften reverberation.<span class="time" data-times="3.14" data-time="303">[05:03.00]</span> And the beautiful <span class="underline">crystal</span> Chandeliers? <span class="time" data-times="3.94" data-time="306.14">[05:06.14]</span>They are very good at diffusing <span class="underline">sound</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.89" data-time="310.08">[05:10.08]</span>You see, everything must be planned down to the last <span class="underline">detail</span> in order to <span class="underline">predict</span> the <span class="underline">acoustic</span> performance of a room. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.5" data-time="318.97">[05:18.97]</span>That being said, there's something that can't be controlled by the <span class="underline">architect</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.19" data-time="324.47">[05:24.47]</span>The <span class="underline">audience</span> has an effect on acoustics too. <span class="time" data-times="4.27" data-time="328.66">[05:28.66]</span>The heads of people are good diffusers of <span class="underline">sound</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="332.93">[05:32.93]</span>And Architects try to <span class="underline">account</span> for this effect in their design, but they can't <span class="underline">guarantee</span> a full <span class="underline">auditorium</span>. </p>
