To discuss a method to measure the reverberation time of a room.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Today I want to talk a bit about the relationship between the built world and the sound.

They disguise structural changes made to improve sound quality.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>So what can be done to distribute the sounds evenly?.....But they all have some decorations on the wall....which distributed the sound very efficiently.

To add emphasis to his previous statement.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Before you listen to the content again, you must design well to predict sound effects. However, not all of the emphasis on hard-of-hearing can be predicted. It was said later that the audience also had an impact on the sound effect. That being said, there's something that can't be controlled by the architect. After "but they can't guarantee a full auditorium.", select C.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
