<span class="time" data-times="4.28" data-time="23.77">[00:23.77]</span>And of <span class="highlight">course</span>, were they the first people in the Western <span class="highlight">hemisphere</span>? <span class="time" data-times="1.63" data-time="28.05">[00:28.05]</span>And we'll get to that.<span class="time" data-times="9.46" data-time="29.68">[00:29.68]</span> But for today, let's try to get an idea about, well, a question that's not addressed as much as the others and that's – what was their <span class="highlight">culture</span> like? <span class="time" data-times="1.7" data-time="39.14">[00:39.14]</span>And how do we <span class="highlight">figure</span> that out? </p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.53" data-time="40.84">[00:40.84]</span>Now, again, there's a great <span class="highlight">debate</span> about when the Clovis people first arrived in the Americas. <span class="time" data-times="11.93" data-time="48.37">[00:48.37]</span>And I am not like a lot of archaeologists who want to push the number way back, so let's use a round number and probably a safe number and say 11,000 years ago. <span class="time" data-times="4.47" data-time="60.3">[01:00.30]</span>The Clovis people were likely settling North America 11,000 years ago.<span class="time" data-times="1.44" data-time="64.77">[01:04.77]</span> And leave it at that for now. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.43" data-time="66.21">[01:06.21]</span>Now, most of what we know about the Clovis people comes from one of their tools-the Clovis point.<span class="time" data-times="9.45" data-time="73.64">[01:13.64]</span>When we talk about a point we are referring to a piece of stone that's worked to a sharp point, in this case probably to be attached to a <span class="highlight">spear</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.08" data-time="83.09">[01:23.09]</span>The Clovis point may be the most analyzed <span class="highlight">artifact</span> in <span class="highlight">archaeology</span>. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="12.85" data-time="88.17">[01:28.17]</span>And the point used by Clovis people differs <span class="highlight">slightly</span> from later points, in the way that the <span class="highlight">base</span> of the stone is thinned, uh, it's thinner toward the <span class="highlight">base</span>, the part that's attached to the <span class="highlight">spear</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.18" data-time="101.02">[01:41.02]</span>So when one is found, it's usually not <span class="highlight">confused</span> with points made by later groups. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.12" data-time="106.2">[01:46.20]</span>Clovis points have been discovered at both hunting grounds and camp sites, which you might <span class="highlight">expect</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.54" data-time="112.32">[01:52.32]</span>But another <span class="highlight">fascinating</span> place we find them is in Clovis caches. <span class="time" data-times="4.31" data-time="117.86">[01:57.86]</span>A <span class="highlight">cache</span> is just something stored or hidden away. <span class="time" data-times="3.5" data-time="122.17">[02:02.17]</span>It's also the <span class="highlight">term</span> for the place where it's hidden. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="10.72" data-time="125.67">[02:05.67]</span>The Clovis caches are collections of tools, stone points and other tools made of stone or bone, often at various stages of manufacturing, some were left unfinished. <span class="time" data-times="6.65" data-time="136.39">[02:16.39]</span>The <span class="highlight">traditional</span> explanation is that these were <span class="highlight">emergency</span> supplies, uh, meant to be used at a later time.<span class="time" data-times="9.86" data-time="143.04">[02:23.04]</span>Since the Clovis people were highly <span class="highlight">mobile</span>, it's <span class="highlight">plausible</span> that they would set up spots <span class="highlight">along</span> established travel routes where they keep a <span class="highlight">variety</span> of items. <span class="time" data-times="8.74" data-time="152.9">[02:32.90]</span>Either so that they wouldn't have to carry everything with them or so they could <span class="highlight">save</span> time once they arrived at a site by not having to make <span class="highlight">stuff</span> from <span class="highlight">scratch</span>. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.39" data-time="161.64">[02:41.64]</span>But there's another <span class="highlight">theory</span> about the caches based on the <span class="highlight">quality</span> of some of the points we've found. <span class="time" data-times="7.52" data-time="168.03">[02:48.03]</span>You see, the points in some caches differ from other points, from points at Clovis camp sites for example. <span class="time" data-times="13.99" data-time="175.55">[02:55.55]</span>For one thing, these <span class="highlight">cache</span> points are quite large, up to twice as large as <span class="highlight">regular</span> points, so big that you couldn't <span class="highlight">attach</span> one to a <span class="highlight">spear</span> say, and <span class="highlight">expect</span> to <span class="highlight">throw</span> the <span class="highlight">spear</span> accurately over any distance.<span class="time" data-times="1.81" data-time="189.54">[03:09.54]</span> So what were they for? </p><p><span class="time" data-times="11.69" data-time="191.35">[03:11.35]</span>Well, it was originally thought that they were unfinished, that someone was working away a point, then had to stop and put it aside in one of these caches to work on later. <span class="time" data-times="6.67" data-time="203.04">[03:23.04]</span>The problem is: it's <span class="highlight">unlikely</span> that a point would have started out as large as the points in these caches.<span class="time" data-times="2.78" data-time="209.71">[03:29.71]</span> That would be a lot of stone to <span class="highlight">chip</span> away. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.05" data-time="212.49">[03:32.49]</span>A toolmaker starts with a smaller piece. <span class="time" data-times="8.41" data-time="215.54">[03:35.54]</span>And actually, far from being unfinished, a lot of these points really show excellent <span class="highlight">craftsmanship</span> and <span class="highlight">attention</span> to <span class="highlight">detail</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9.21" data-time="223.95">[03:43.95]</span>And not just with <span class="highlight">respect</span> to the skill, but also with <span class="highlight">respect</span> to the <span class="highlight">raw</span><span class="highlight">material</span>, it seems that cached points are made from the very best pieces of stone. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.97" data-time="233.16">[03:53.16]</span>So we have to ask-could these points have served another purpose? <span class="time" data-times="2.56" data-time="238.13">[03:58.13]</span>Maybe be they weren't just tools.<span class="time" data-times="1.31" data-time="240.69">[04:00.69]</span>Look at it this way. <span class="time" data-times="5.79" data-time="242">[04:02.00]</span>When the Clovis people first arrived in the Americas, they had a lot to learn about their new environment. <span class="time" data-times="6.25" data-time="247.79">[04:07.79]</span>Over time, they would have begun to <span class="highlight">recognize</span> some places as <span class="highlight">special</span>, important for some <span class="highlight">reason</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.29" data-time="254.04">[04:14.04]</span>Maybe there was always water <span class="highlight">available</span> there. <span class="time" data-times="2.04" data-time="257.33">[04:17.33]</span>Or the hunting was especially good. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="259.37">[04:19.37]</span>So maybe the <span class="highlight">cache</span> was a way to mark the place as <span class="highlight">significant</span>. </p></p></article></section><div id="question"><div id="question1"><p>What is the main purpose of the lecture?</p><label class="my-label"><span>A.
