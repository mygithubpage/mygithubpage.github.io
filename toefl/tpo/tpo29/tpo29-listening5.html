<span class="time" data-times="4.28" data-time="23.77">[00:23.77]</span>And of <span class="highlight">course</span>, were they the first people in the Western <span class="highlight">hemisphere</span>? <span class="time" data-times="1.63" data-time="28.05">[00:28.05]</span>And we'll get to that.<span class="time" data-times="9.46" data-time="29.68">[00:29.68]</span> But for today, let's try to get an idea about, well, a question that's not addressed as much as the others and that's  what was their <span class="highlight">culture</span> like? <span class="time" data-times="1.7" data-time="39.14">[00:39.14]</span>And how do we <span class="highlight">figure</span> that out? </p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.53" data-time="40.84">[00:40.84]</span>Now, again, there's a great <span class="highlight">debate</span> about when the Clovis people first arrived in the Americas. <span class="time" data-times="11.93" data-time="48.37">[00:48.37]</span>And I am not like a lot of archaeologists who want to push the number way back, so let's use a round number and probably a safe number and say 11,000 years ago. <span class="time" data-times="4.47" data-time="60.3">[01:00.30]</span>The Clovis people were likely settling North America 11,000 years ago.<span class="time" data-times="1.44" data-time="64.77">[01:04.77]</span> And leave it at that for now. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.43" data-time="66.21">[01:06.21]</span>Now, most of what we know about the Clovis people comes from one of their tools-the Clovis point.<span class="time" data-times="9.45" data-time="73.64">[01:13.64]</span>When we talk about a point we are referring to a piece of stone that's worked to a sharp point, in this case probably to be attached to a <span class="highlight">spear</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.08" data-time="83.09">[01:23.09]</span>The Clovis point may be the most analyzed <span class="highlight">artifact</span> in <span class="highlight">archaeology</span>. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="12.85" data-time="88.17">[01:28.17]</span>And the point used by Clovis people differs <span class="highlight">slightly</span> from later points, in the way that the <span class="highlight">base</span> of the stone is thinned, uh, it's thinner toward the <span class="highlight">base</span>, the part that's attached to the <span class="highlight">spear</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.18" data-time="101.02">[01:41.02]</span>So when one is found, it's usually not <span class="highlight">confused</span> with points made by later groups. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.12" data-time="106.2">[01:46.20]</span>Clovis points have been discovered at both hunting grounds and camp sites, which you might <span class="highlight">expect</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.54" data-time="112.32">[01:52.32]</span>But another <span class="highlight">fascinating</span> place we find them is in Clovis caches. <span class="time" data-times="4.31" data-time="117.86">[01:57.86]</span>A <span class="highlight">cache</span> is just something stored or hidden away. <span class="time" data-times="3.5" data-time="122.17">[02:02.17]</span>It's also the <span class="highlight">term</span> for the place where it's hidden. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="10.72" data-time="125.67">[02:05.67]</span>The Clovis caches are collections of tools, stone points and other tools made of stone or bone, often at various stages of manufacturing, some were left unfinished. <span class="time" data-times="6.65" data-time="136.39">[02:16.39]</span>The <span class="highlight">traditional</span> explanation is that these were <span class="highlight">emergency</span> supplies, uh, meant to be used at a later time.<span class="time" data-times="9.86" data-time="143.04">[02:23.04]</span>Since the Clovis people were highly <span class="highlight">mobile</span>, it's <span class="highlight">plausible</span> that they would set up spots <span class="highlight">along</span> established travel routes where they keep a <span class="highlight">variety</span> of items. <span class="time" data-times="8.74" data-time="152.9">[02:32.90]</span>Either so that they wouldn't have to carry everything with them or so they could <span class="highlight">save</span> time once they arrived at a site by not having to make <span class="highlight">stuff</span> from <span class="highlight">scratch</span>. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.39" data-time="161.64">[02:41.64]</span>But there's another <span class="highlight">theory</span> about the caches based on the <span class="highlight">quality</span> of some of the points we've found. <span class="time" data-times="7.52" data-time="168.03">[02:48.03]</span>You see, the points in some caches differ from other points, from points at Clovis camp sites for example. <span class="time" data-times="13.99" data-time="175.55">[02:55.55]</span>For one thing, these <span class="highlight">cache</span> points are quite large, up to twice as large as <span class="highlight">regular</span> points, so big that you couldn't <span class="highlight">attach</span> one to a <span class="highlight">spear</span> say, and <span class="highlight">expect</span> to <span class="highlight">throw</span> the <span class="highlight">spear</span> accurately over any distance.<span class="time" data-times="1.81" data-time="189.54">[03:09.54]</span> So what were they for? </p><p><span class="time" data-times="11.69" data-time="191.35">[03:11.35]</span>Well, it was originally thought that they were unfinished, that someone was working away a point, then had to stop and put it aside in one of these caches to work on later. <span class="time" data-times="6.67" data-time="203.04">[03:23.04]</span>The problem is: it's <span class="highlight">unlikely</span> that a point would have started out as large as the points in these caches.<span class="time" data-times="2.78" data-time="209.71">[03:29.71]</span> That would be a lot of stone to <span class="highlight">chip</span> away. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.05" data-time="212.49">[03:32.49]</span>A toolmaker starts with a smaller piece. <span class="time" data-times="8.41" data-time="215.54">[03:35.54]</span>And actually, far from being unfinished, a lot of these points really show excellent <span class="highlight">craftsmanship</span> and <span class="highlight">attention</span> to <span class="highlight">detail</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9.21" data-time="223.95">[03:43.95]</span>And not just with <span class="highlight">respect</span> to the skill, but also with <span class="highlight">respect</span> to the <span class="highlight">raw</span><span class="highlight">material</span>, it seems that cached points are made from the very best pieces of stone. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.97" data-time="233.16">[03:53.16]</span>So we have to ask-could these points have served another purpose? <span class="time" data-times="2.56" data-time="238.13">[03:58.13]</span>Maybe be they weren't just tools.<span class="time" data-times="1.31" data-time="240.69">[04:00.69]</span>Look at it this way. <span class="time" data-times="5.79" data-time="242">[04:02.00]</span>When the Clovis people first arrived in the Americas, they had a lot to learn about their new environment. <span class="time" data-times="6.25" data-time="247.79">[04:07.79]</span>Over time, they would have begun to <span class="highlight">recognize</span> some places as <span class="highlight">special</span>, important for some <span class="highlight">reason</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.29" data-time="254.04">[04:14.04]</span>Maybe there was always water <span class="highlight">available</span> there. <span class="time" data-times="2.04" data-time="257.33">[04:17.33]</span>Or the hunting was especially good. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="259.37">[04:19.37]</span>So maybe the <span class="highlight">cache</span> was a way to mark the place as <span class="highlight">significant</span>. </p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the main purpose of the lecture?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To explain the method used to date Clovis caches.</p><p>B. To compare two different types of Clovis caches.</p><p>C. To discuss possible interpretations of Clovis caches.</p><p>D. To show how caches indicate the route traveled by the Clovis people.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>At the beginning, the professor said that he would like to discuss Clovis People for some time, and then said that he mainly wanted to discuss what was their culture like, so he chose C.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor imply when she mentions a deviate about when the Clovis people arrived in the Americas?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. An arrival date of 11,000 years ago is acceptable for the purpose of her lecture.</p><p>B. An arrival date of 11,000 years ago is inconsistent with some aspects of Clovis culture.</p><p>C. Only a few archaeologists believe the arrival date is much earlier than 11,000 years ago.</p><p>D. The debate about the arrival date of the Clovis people has recently been settled.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The reason for mentioning deviation is that the exact time of Clovis Arrival is not certain, so the professor used the round number, because the professor felt that the content of the discussion was not the exact time, so 11000 is acceptable. Note that item B is an obfuscation option and the article does not mention inconsistent, so it cannot be selected.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor,what is the traditional explanation for Clovis caches?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They were supplies kept in storage for future use.</p><p>B. They were valuable items for trading with other groups.</p><p>C. They were carved objects that served as maps.</p><p>D. They were forms of communication.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>Professor: The traditional explanation is that these were infant supplies. Traditional has shown that this statement is relatively old. Storage for future use correspondence of emergency supplies and A options</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the lecture,what is indicated by the size of the points found in some Clovis caches?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Methods of toolmaking varied between different Clovis groups.</p><p>B. The Clovis people made a variety of tools for different purposes.</p><p>C. The points may not have been functional tools.</p><p>D. The larger points made the Clovis people's spears more effective.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>These cash points are quite large .......So big that you could not......What were they for? From the professor's words, these points are too large to be practical. Corresponds to C.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>What were two characteristics of tools found in Clovis caches?Click on 2 answers.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They were made later than other Clovis tools.</p><p>B. They were skillfully made.</p><p>C. They were carved with particular symbols.</p><p>D. They were made of the best pieces of stone.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="BD"><p>And not just with respect to the skill, but also with respect to the raw material, it seems that cached points are made from the very best pieces of stone. And before and after connecting the characteristics of the point production, the first is the process is very excellent, The second is that the raw materials are the best ones.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the alternative hypothesis the professor mentions,why might the Clovis people have buried caches?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To indicate that they were the owners of the land.</p><p>B. To pass cultural knowledge to future generations.</p><p>C. To recognize that a place had a special meaning.</p><p>D. To give a name to a particular area.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>So maybe the cash is a way to mark these places. At the end of the lecture Professor mentioned that it is very likely to mark the place as significant.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
