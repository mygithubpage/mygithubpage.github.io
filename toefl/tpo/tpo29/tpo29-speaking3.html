            <b>Remove Old Bicycles from Campus Racks</b>
          </h4>
          <p>I noticed that there are bicycles locked to the campus bicycle racks that have not been moved for a long time. I think the university should remove these bikes from the racks and dispose of them. I recommend this action because, first of all, they will not be missed by anyone, since they apparently have been forgotten by their owners. More important, removing the bikes would help to fee up space o n the racks, thereby benefiting people who are actually using their bikes and need places to park them.</p>

        <article>
          <p>Now listen to two students discussing the letter.</p>
          <p>(woman) He's totally right about this, you know?</p>
          <p>(man) Well, I agree they should do it, but maybe it's not fair.</p>
          <p>(woman) What? Just assuming no one wants them? Well, judging from the conditions some of them are in, I think it's probably a safe assumption. I mean, some are missing parts like handlebars or wheels, and others are really rusty like they've been left outside in the rain for years.</p>
          <p>(man) Yeah, the ones with missing parts sure don't look like they are being used but what if some are?(woman) Well, to be sure, the university could always attach notes to them and say give the owners two weeks to remove them or they'd be removed by campus security.</p>
          <p>(man) Yeah, that'll probably work.</p>
          <p>(woman) Anyway, it'll be really big help if they were gone.</p>
          <p>(man) Oh, I know</p>
          <p>(woman) Because, I mean, especially like in front of the dining hall, there are lots of them there and it can be really hard to find a space. All the spaces are always taken there.</p>
          <p>(man) Yeah, it's bad. Lots of people ride bikes these days.</p>
          <p>(woman) And since the university doesn't allow us to tie them to signposts, or fences or anything like that to park them, I always have to lock mine up in another building and walk over to the dining hall cause there's hardly ever a space."</p>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>The writer of the letter suggests the university remove old bicycles from the racks, because they have been missed by their owners and this measure can save a lot of spaces for people using bikes. The woman in the conversation totally agrees with the proposal. First, she says that these bicycles have lost some parts such as handle bars or wheels, and many other bikes are rusty because of the rain. Or the university can attach notes on them to remind their owners to take them back, or they will be removed by the security. Secondly, the woman says that these old bikes take up a lot of spaces, and it is very difficult for other students to find a place to park. She always has to park her bike in another building, which is very inconvenient. So that's why she agrees with the proposal.</p>
