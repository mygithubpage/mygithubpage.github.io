The high <span class="highlight">quality</span> of Roman <span class="highlight">pottery</span> is very easy to <span class="highlight">appreciate</span> when handling actual pieces of tableware or indeed kitchenware and amphorae (the large jars used <span class="highlight">throughout</span> the <span class="highlight">Mediterranean</span> for the <span class="highlight">transport</span> and <span class="highlight">storage</span> of liquids, such as wine and oil). However, it is impossible to do <span class="highlight">justice</span> to Roman wares on the page, <span class="highlight">even</span> when words can be backed up by photographs and drawing. Most Roman <span class="highlight">pottery</span> is light and smooth to touch and very <span class="highlight">tough</span>, although, like all <span class="highlight">pottery</span>, it shatters if dropped on a hard surface. It is generally made with carefully selected and purified <span class="highlight">clay</span>, worked to thin-walled and standardized shapes on a fast wheel and fired in a <span class="highlight">kiln</span> (<span class="highlight">pottery</span> oven) <span class="highlight">capable</span> of ensuring a <span class="highlight">consistent</span> finish. With handmade <span class="highlight">pottery</span>, <span class="highlight">inevitably</span> there are <span class="highlight">slight</span> differences between <span class="highlight">individual</span> vessels of the same design and <span class="highlight">occasional</span><span class="highlight">minor</span> blemishes (flaws). But what strikes the eye and the touch most immediately and most powerfully with Roman <span class="highlight">pottery</span> is its <span class="highlight">consistent</span> high <span class="highlight">quality</span>.</p><p>This is not just an <span class="highlight">aesthetic</span><span class="highlight">consideration</span> but also a <span class="highlight">practical</span> one. These vessels are <span class="highlight">solid</span> (<span class="highlight">brittle</span>, but not <span class="highlight">fragile</span>), they are pleasant and easy to <span class="highlight">handle</span> (being light and smooth), and, with their hard and sometimes <span class="highlight">glossy</span> (smooth and shiny) surfaces, they hold liquids well and are easy to wash. Furthermore, their <span class="highlight">regular</span> and standardized shapes would have made them simple to <span class="highlight">stack</span> and store. When people today are shown a very ordinary Roman pot and, in <span class="highlight">particular</span>, are allowed to <span class="highlight">handle</span> it, they often <span class="highlight">comment</span> on how modern it looks and feels, and they need to be convinced of its true age.</p><p>As <span class="highlight">impressive</span> as the <span class="highlight">quality</span> of Roman <span class="highlight">pottery</span> is its <span class="highlight">sheer</span><span class="highlight">massive</span><span class="highlight">quantity</span>. When considering quantities, we would ideally like to have some estimates for <span class="highlight">overall</span> production from <span class="highlight">particular</span> sites of <span class="highlight">pottery</span><span class="highlight">manufacture</span> and for <span class="highlight">overall</span><span class="highlight">consumption</span> at <span class="highlight">specific</span> settlements. <span class="highlight">Unfortunately</span>, it is in the nature of the <span class="highlight">archaeological</span><span class="highlight">evidence</span>, which is almost invariable only a <span class="highlight">sample</span> of what once existed, that such figures will always be <span class="highlight">elusive</span>. However, no one who has ever worked in the <span class="highlight">field</span> would question the <span class="highlight">abundance</span> of Roman <span class="highlight">pottery</span>, particularly in the <span class="highlight">Mediterranean</span><span class="highlight">region</span>. This <span class="highlight">abundance</span> is <span class="highlight">notable</span> in Roman settlements (especially <span class="highlight">urban</span> sites) where the labor that archaeologists have to put into the washing and sorting of potsherds (fragments of <span class="highlight">pottery</span>) constitutes a high <span class="highlight">proportion</span> of the total work during the <span class="highlight">initial</span> phases of <span class="highlight">excavation</span>.</p><p><span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>Only <span class="highlight">rarely</span> can we <span class="highlight">derive</span> any "real" quantities from deposits of broken pots. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>However, there is one <span class="highlight">exceptional</span><span class="highlight">dump</span>, which does <span class="highlight">represent</span> a very large part of the site's total <span class="highlight">history</span> of
<span class="highlight">consumption</span> and for which an <span class="highlight">estimate</span> of <span class="highlight">quantity</span> has been produced. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>On the left bank of the Tiber River in Rome, by one of the river ports of the <span class="highlight">ancient</span> city, is a <span class="highlight"><span class="question5">substantial</span></span> hill some 50
meters high called Monte Testaccio. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>It is made up <span class="highlight"><span class="question7">entirely</span></span> of broken oil amphorae, mainly of the <span class="highlight">second</span> and third centuries A.D. It has been estimated that Monte Testaccio contains the remains of 
some 53 million amphorae, in which around 6,000million liters of oil were imported into the city from <span class="highlight">overseas</span>, imports into <span class="highlight">imperial</span> Rome were supported by the full might of the <span class="highlight">state</span> and were 
<span class="highlight">therefore</span> quite exceptional----but the size of the operations at Monte Testaccio, and the <span class="highlight">productivity</span> and <span class="highlight">complexity</span> that <span class="highlight">lay</span> behind them, <span class="highlight">nonetheless</span> cannot fail to impress. This was a society 
with similarities to modern one----moving goods on a <span class="highlight">gigantic</span> scal, manufacturing high-quality containers to do so, and occasionally, as here, <span class="highlight">even</span> discarding them on delivery.</p><p>Roman <span class="highlight">pottery</span> was transported not only in large quantities but also over <span class="highlight">substantial</span> distances. Many Roman pots, in <span class="highlight"><span class="question12">particular</span></span> amphorae and the fine wares designed for use at tables, could travel hundreds of miles----all over the <span class="highlight">Mediterranean</span> and also further <span class="highlight">afield</span>. But <span class="question10">maps that show the various spots where Roman <span class="highlight">pottery</span> of a <span class="highlight">particular</span> type has been found tell only part of the story.</span> What is more <span class="highlight">significant</span> than any <span class="highlight">geographical</span><span class="highlight">spread</span> is the <span class="highlight">access</span> that different levels of society had to good-quality products. In all but the remotest regions of the <span class="highlight">empire</span>, Roman <span class="highlight">pottery</span> of a high <span class="highlight">standard</span> is <span class="highlight">common</span> at the sites of <span class="question11">humble</span> villages and <span class="highlight">isolated</span> farmsteads.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Paragraph 1 indicates which of the following about Roman pottery?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Roman amphorae were of much higher quality overall than other Roman pottery.</p><p>B. Roman pottery can best be appreciated when actual pieces are handled.</p><p>C. Roman pottery declined slightly in quality when the use of fast wheels and kilns was introduced.</p><p>D. Roman practical tableware spread more rapidly across the Mediterranean than amphorae did.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B. There are no particularly good keywords. You need to read it and judge it. You can also use the keywords for the options respectively. The A option can be positioned with quality, and the B option with appreciate, D options with Mediterrannean to locate the second sentence: The high quality of Roman pottery is very easy to appreciate when handing actual pieces of tableware or indeed kitchenware and amphorae ( The large jars used throughout the Mediterranean for the transport and storage of liquids, such as wine and oil). In the corresponding sentence, there is no comparison between amphorae and pottery, so A is wrong; and B options are changed The easy to appreciate when handing echoes, so B is correct; this sentence refers to the widespread use of pottery in Mediterranean, but there is no comparison between species, so D is wrong. The C option can be positioned with wheel and kiln, positioning to the penultimate sentence: It is generally made with carefully selected and purified clay, worked to thin-walled and standardized shapes on a fast wheel and fired in a kiln (pottery oven) The ability of ensuring a consistent finish. The text mentioned the use of quick runners and kilns, but did not say that the quality of pottery fell. So C is incorrect.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>All of the following are mentioned in paragraph 1 as characteristics of Roman pottery EXCEPT:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It was usually made with high-quality clay.</p><p>B. It generally did not weigh much.</p><p>C. It did not break as easily as other ancient pottery.</p><p>D. It sometimes had imperfections.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The C option uses high-quality positioning: The high quality of Roman pottery is very easy to appreciate... content and A options echo, so A is not selected; B option uses weigh to position, to: Most roman pottery is light and smooth. .. Obviously, and B option did not weight too much match, so choose B option not selected; C option to use the break to: Like all pottery, it shatters if dropped on a hard surface. And C options did not Break contradiction, so choose C. The D option uses imperfecxtions to locate the second last sentence of the flaps: With handmade pottery, inevitably there are slight differences between individual vessels of the same design and occasional minor blemishes (flaws). And the content of the D option echoes.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 2, which of the following is NOT true of Roman vessels?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They were good containers for liquids.</p><p>B. Their shapes allowed for easy stacking and storing.</p><p>C. They sometimes had shiny surfaces.</p><p>D. Their true age is immediately apparent.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The D option uses liquids to correspond to the original second sentence: ...they hold liquids well and are easy to wash. The content is consistent with A; The B option uses stacking and storing to locate the third sentence of the text:, their regular and combined shapes Will have made them simple to stack and store. The content matches the B option; the C option uses shiny surfaces to correspond to the original second sentence: ...with their hard and glossy (smooth and shiny) surfaces... content and C The options fit. The D option uses true age to correspond to the last sentence of the original text: ...they often comment on how modern it looks and feels, and they need to be convinced of its true age. This sentence at first glance looks like this pot is very modern. But the reality is very old. Therefore its true age is not obvious. D is wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The author mentions the work of archaeologists in paragraph 3 in order to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. support the idea that pottery was produced in large quantities by the Romans</p><p>B. illustrate how hard it is for archaeologists to find complete pieces of Roman pottery</p><p>C. contrast archaeological sites in Roman urban areas with other sites in the Mediterranean</p><p>D. explain why the quantities of pottery found vary significantly from one site to another</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A using archeologists to locate and position the full sentence: This abundance is notable in Roman settlements (especially urban sites) where the labor that archaeologist have to put into the washing and sorting of potsherds (fragments of pottery) constitutes high proportion of The total work during the initial phases of excavation. This sentence itself is said to be a lot of pottery left over from settlements in Rome. Going forward to find supportive subject sentences, we found that there was a very obvious However in the previous text. Before and after the transition, it was mainly said that the amount of pottery discovered in Rome was different from the past and was very abundant. Later in this corresponding part, the archaeologists mentioned the large settlement in Rome, and also to highlight the number of pottery found here. So the real answer is A.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">substantial</span>"in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. protected</p><p>B. man-made</p><p>C. large</p><p>D. famous</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C Substantial: A lot, really. A is protected; B is artificial; D is famous. Only C is big. From the perspective of wording, C is the closest. The corresponding original On the left bank of the Tiber River in Rome, by one of the river ports of the ancient city, is a substantial hill some 50 meters high called Monte Testaccio. It can also be scrutinized by the meaning of the original sentence. The description of 50 meters high also describes its size. So you should choose size-related. Of these four options, only the C option is the most appropriate.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, Monte Testaccio is particularly important for archaeologists because archaeologists were able to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. conclude how amphorae manufacturing increased rapidly after the second century A.D.</p><p>B. find the locations where most of the amphorae in the Roman Empire were produced</p><p>C. obtain relatively accurate calculations of the quantities of amphorae used over time in that place</p><p>D. discover that the Roman state had supported amphorae production</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C does not have a particularly good positioning word and requires a comprehensive understanding. Here is Monte Testaccil's argument in support of this paragraph. Returning to the original sentence of this passage, you can see the original saying "It is difficult to determine the pot production at that time through the broken pot, and Monte Testaccil does have an exception." So it means that you can get the quantities at the time through this dump site. Select C. ABD did not mention it in the original.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question7">entirely</span></span>"in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. apparently</p><p>B. completely</p><p>C. basically</p><p>D. mostly</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>B <span class="question7">entirely</span>: It's complete, whole. A is obvious, B is complete, C is basic, and D is most. Here B is the best match. Corresponding to the original It is made up <span class="question7">entirely</span> of broken oil amphorae, mainly of the second and third centuries A.D. Substituting the four options, it is found that AC is completely unrecognized after the substitution, BD is possible, and B is closer to entire.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Paragraph 4 indicates which of the following about the port on the Tiber River near Monte Testaccio?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It was built around the third century A.D.</p><p>B. It was close to areas where large quantities of oil were produced.</p><p>C. It was in use only for a very short period of time.</p><p>D. It had impressive level of commercial activity.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D According to Tiber River positioning, see the following description: It has been estimated that Monte Testaccio contains the remains of some 53 million amphorae, in which around 6,000 million liters of oil were imported into the city from overseas... In view of the quantity, the import and export trade at that time was very prosperous. Corresponding answer D. The construction time of the A option cannot be inferred. The original text only stated that the broken oil amphorae found on the hill was mainly in the 2.3th century AD; the oil of B was not the same thing as the oil amphorae stated in the original text, and was excessively inferred; the C option was There is absolutely no relevant content in the original text.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The statement in paragraph 4 that amphorae delivered to the port near Monte Testaccio were occasionally discarded support which of the following?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Traders at the port were often careless.</p><p>B. The quality of the amphorae used at the port was not very good.</p><p>C. The scale of the trade made it possible to waste quality amphorae sometimes.</p><p>D. The importing of oil from overseas gradually declined, reducing the need for pottery containers.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C Positioned to the last sentence of the original text based on the original discarded. Go to the description. The foregoing says that as with modern industrial societies, mass production and demand, but the underlying productivity cannot be satisfied. So it's the same when it's shipped. Sometimes heavy shipping will inevitably break up and need to be thrown away. So choose C. A did not mention the original; B did not say the original, and the previous article has been saying that pot is high quality. D did not mention the relationship between oil and pottery here.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The statement that "<span class="highlight">maps that show the various spots where Roman pottery of a particular type has been found tell only part of the story</span>"makes the point that</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. maps indicate where specific pottery styles have been found, but they do not indicate where these styles originated</p><p>B. maps show the geographical spread of Roman pottery but not the people who had access to it</p><p>C. maps do not usually include pottery styles found in the remotest regions the Roman Empire</p><p>D. archaeologist studying Roman pottery need to use a range of techniques in their investigations</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="maps that show the various spots where Roman pottery of a particular type has been found tell only part of the story B"><p>B. Here, saying that Map is just the tell part of the story, then the proof that you can get the roman pottery is not only the scope of the map, it should have more scope. From the beginning of this sentence, but know that it forms a turning point with the previous text, the central sentence supported by this sentence should be below it. Read the next sentence to find the answer: What is more significant than any divided spread is the access that different levels of society had to good-quality products. This sentence emphasizes access society had to products. Saying maps to a certain extent explains the geographical spread of the pottery in Rome, but not everyone who can get pottery. Correspond to B option. The A option was wrong. Styles came from Rome. C, D does not matter with the original.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question11">humble</span></span>"in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. rural</p><p>B. distant</p><p>C. ancient</p><p>D. modest</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" D"><p>D Humble: Simple. Corresponding to the D option modest (normal, backward). The corresponding original In all but the remotest regions of the empire, Roman pottery of a high standard is common at the sites of <span class="question11">humble</span> villages and isolated farmsteads. It is also possible to deduce the meaning of the word by the juxtaposition of and, followed by the isolated, secluded It can also be extended to be remote and backward. So <span class="question11">humble</span> should be similar in meaning. Here A is the distraction, rural, pastoral. But there is less meaning for Jane. Use D most suitable. The options of distant and ancient have a gap with <span class="question11">humble</span>.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">particular</span>"in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. specific</p><p>B. common</p><p>C. ancient</p><p>D. superior</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A particular: special, specifically. Corresponding to the A specific option, specific maps that show the various spots where Roman pottery of a particular type has been found tell only part of the story. What is the type of what is said. It can then be inferred from the above. B is common, C is primitive, and D is advanced. After substitution, the context is incoherent. Only A is the most appropriate.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>That is because residents of a city did not usually discard used pottery at the same site over a long period of time..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B. There is that because of the sentence to be inserted here, then that must be referring to a certain phenomenon in the previous text, and then explain with the sentence to be inserted, which is the reason component. The foregoing must be the result. The first sentence of the sentence says that there are few sites that can show the pottery production. The second sentence says there is one exception. Then we should explain the reason first, and then say the exception. That refers to the phenomenon described in the first sentence. So insert the second empty.</p></div></div><div id="question14" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>
The pottery of the ancient Roman Empire is remarkable.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.Roman pottery is considered to be practical and of consistently high quality.</p><p>B.Even though the exact quantity of pottery produced by the Romans is almost impossible to calculate, it is certain that it was produced in large quantities.</p><p>C.Roman pottery was transported over long distances, and different levels of society had access to quality pottery.</p><p>D.People are not familiar with the whole range of pottery the Romans created because most of the available pieces represent only a limited number of styles and shapes.</p><p>E.Archaeologists looking for the remains of Roman pottery concentrate on urban sites because that is where the oldest pieces of kitchenware and amphorae have been found.</p><p>F.It is still unclear to archaeologists what the role of the Roman state in the commercial success of Roman pottery was.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="ABC"><p>ABC A: Correct, corresponding to the first and second paragraphs of the article. The first paragraph focuses on high quality. The second paragraph says that it is not only aesthetic but also practical. B: Correct, corresponding to the fourth paragraph of the article. Say there are few relics that can reflect its mass production, but all kinds of evidence indicate its large quantities. C: Right, for the last paragraph of the original text. D: Not selected, the original did not mention. E: Not selected, corresponds to the fourth paragraph of the original text, but the original did not say to concentrate on urban sites, nor did it mention the reasons mentioned in the options. F: Not selected, the original did not mention it.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
