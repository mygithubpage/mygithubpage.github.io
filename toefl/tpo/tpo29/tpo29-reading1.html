            <b>Characteristics of Roman Pottery</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>The <span class="underline">pottery</span> of <span class="underline">ancient</span> Romans is <span class="underline">remarkable</span> in several ways. The high <span class="underline">quality</span> of Roman <span class="underline">pottery</span> is very easy to <span class="underline">appreciate</span> when handling actual pieces of tableware or indeed kitchenware and amphorae (the large jars used <span class="underline">throughout</span> the <span class="underline">Mediterranean</span> for the <span class="underline">transport</span> and <span class="underline">storage</span> of liquids, such as wine and oil). However, it is impossible to do <span class="underline">justice</span> to Roman wares on the page, <span class="underline">even</span> when words can be backed up by photographs and drawing. Most Roman <span class="underline">pottery</span> is light and smooth to touch and very <span class="underline">tough</span>, although, like all <span class="underline">pottery</span>, it shatters if dropped on a hard surface. It is generally made with carefully selected and purified <span class="underline">clay</span>, worked to thin-walled and standardized shapes on a fast wheel and fired in a <span class="underline">kiln</span> (<span class="underline">pottery</span> oven) <span class="underline">capable</span> of ensuring a <span class="underline">consistent</span> finish. With handmade <span class="underline">pottery</span>, <span class="underline">inevitably</span> there are <span class="underline">slight</span> differences between <span class="underline">individual</span> vessels of the same design and <span class="underline">occasional</span> <span class="underline">minor</span> blemishes (flaws). But what strikes the eye and the touch most immediately and most powerfully with Roman <span class="underline">pottery</span> is its <span class="underline">consistent</span> high <span class="underline">quality</span>.</p>
          <p>This is not just an <span class="underline">aesthetic</span> <span class="underline">consideration</span> but also a <span class="underline">practical</span> one. These vessels are <span class="underline">solid</span> (<span class="underline">brittle</span>, but not <span class="underline">fragile</span>), they are pleasant and easy to <span class="underline">handle</span> (being light and smooth), and, with their hard and sometimes <span class="underline">glossy</span> (smooth and shiny) surfaces, they hold liquids well and are easy to wash. Furthermore, their <span class="underline">regular</span> and standardized shapes would have made them simple to <span class="underline">stack</span> and store. When people today are shown a very ordinary Roman pot and, in <span class="underline">particular</span>, are allowed to <span class="underline">handle</span> it, they often <span class="underline">comment</span> on how modern it looks and feels, and they need to be convinced of its true age.</p>
          <p>As <span class="underline">impressive</span> as the <span class="underline">quality</span> of Roman <span class="underline">pottery</span> is its <span class="underline">sheer</span> <span class="underline">massive</span> <span class="underline">quantity</span>. When considering quantities, we would ideally like to have some estimates for <span class="underline">overall</span> production from <span class="underline">particular</span> sites of <span class="underline">pottery</span> <span class="underline">manufacture</span> and for <span class="underline">overall</span> <span class="underline">consumption</span> at <span class="underline">specific</span> settlements. <span class="underline">Unfortunately</span>, it is in the nature of the <span class="underline">archaeological</span> <span class="underline">evidence</span>, which is almost invariable only a <span class="underline">sample</span> of what once existed, that such figures will always be <span class="underline">elusive</span>. However, no one who has ever worked in the <span class="underline">field</span> would question the <span class="underline">abundance</span> of Roman <span class="underline">pottery</span>, particularly in the <span class="underline">Mediterranean</span> <span class="underline">region</span>. This <span class="underline">abundance</span> is <span class="underline">notable</span> in Roman settlements (especially <span class="underline">urban</span> sites) where the labor that archaeologists have to put into the washing and sorting of potsherds (fragments of <span class="underline">pottery</span>) constitutes a high <span class="underline">proportion</span> of the total work during the <span class="underline">initial</span> phases of <span class="underline">excavation</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A">
            </span>Only <span class="underline">rarely</span> can we <span class="underline">derive</span> any "real" quantities from deposits of broken pots. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>However, there is one <span class="underline">exceptional</span> <span class="underline">dump</span>, which does <span class="underline">represent</span> a very large part of the site's total <span class="underline">history</span> of
<span class="underline">consumption</span> and for which an <span class="underline">estimate</span> of <span class="underline">quantity</span> has been produced. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>On the left bank of the Tiber River in Rome, by one of the river ports of the <span class="underline">ancient</span> city, is a <span class="underline">substantial</span> hill some 50
meters high called Monte Testaccio. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>It is made up <span class="underline">entirely</span> of broken oil amphorae, mainly of the <span class="underline">second</span> and third centuries A.D. It has been estimated that Monte Testaccio contains the remains of 
some 53 million amphorae, in which around 6,000million liters of oil were imported into the city from <span class="underline">overseas</span>, imports into <span class="underline">imperial</span> Rome were supported by the full might of the <span class="underline">state</span> and were 
<span class="underline">therefore</span> quite exceptional----but the size of the operations at Monte Testaccio, and the <span class="underline">productivity</span> and <span class="underline">complexity</span> that <span class="underline">lay</span> behind them, <span class="underline">nonetheless</span> cannot fail to impress. This was a society 
with similarities to modern one----moving goods on a <span class="underline">gigantic</span> scal, manufacturing high-quality containers to do so, and occasionally, as here, <span class="underline">even</span> discarding them on delivery.</p>
          <p>Roman <span class="underline">pottery</span> was transported not only in large quantities but also over <span class="underline">substantial</span> distances. Many Roman pots, in <span class="underline">particular</span> amphorae and the fine wares designed for use at tables, could travel hundreds of miles----all over the <span class="underline">Mediterranean</span> and also further <span class="underline">afield</span>. But maps that show the various spots where Roman <span class="underline">pottery</span> of a <span class="underline">particular</span> type has been found tell only part of the story. What is more <span class="underline">significant</span> than any <span class="underline">geographical</span> <span class="underline">spread</span> is the <span class="underline">access</span> that different levels of society had to good-quality products. In all but the remotest regions of the <span class="underline">empire</span>, Roman <span class="underline">pottery</span> of a high <span class="underline">standard</span> is <span class="underline">common</span> at the sites of humble villages and <span class="underline">isolated</span> farmsteads.</p>
