        <p>Some people like to study in public places where there are other people around. Others prefer to study in places where there are few or no people around. Which kind of place do you prefer? Explain why.</p>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>Personally speaking, I prefer to study in places where there are other people around. First, I can get motivated by the diligence of people around me. For example, I have been preparing for TOEFL in the library in my college. Every time, I get tired with the endless vocabulary I need to memorize and feel like giving up, I look at people who are studying around me. Most of them have been studying really hard for hours without even a rest. By looking at them, I feel inspired and reenergized. Second, I can always ask other people for help if I study somewhere with other people around. Like one time, I was stuck with a math question. I had been working on it for half an hour and couldn't figure it out. Then, I turned to a girl sitting next to me for help. She helped me solve the problem in 2 minutes, which really saved me a lot of time.</p>
