Others prefer to study in places where there are few or no people around. Which kind of place do you prefer? Explain why.</p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>"Personally speaking, I prefer to study in places where there are other people around. First, I can get motivated by the diligence of people around me. For example, I have been preparing for TOEFL in the library in my college. Every time, I get tired with the endless vocabulary I need to memorize and feel like giving up, I look at people who are studying around me. Most of them have been studying really hard for hours without even a rest. By looking at them, I feel inspired and reenergized. Second, I can always ask other people for help if I study somewhere with other people around. Like one time, I was stuck with a math question. I had been working on it for half an hour and couldn't figure it out. Then, I turned to a girl sitting next to me for help. She helped me solve the problem in 2 minutes, which really saved me a lot of time. "</p></article></div></main></body></html>
