          <h4 class="w3-center">Scatter Hoarding</h4>Many animals live in environments where food is plentiful during certain times of the year and scarce during other times of the year. In such environments, some animals collect and prepare food when it is plentiful, then hoard it – store it – for future use. Some types of hoarders engage in scatter hoarding. Unlike other types of hoarders, scatter hoarders do not store the food all in once place; instead, they scatter it – divide it up and hide it in many different places. Later, at a time when food is scarce, the hoarders return to these hiding places and recover the food.</article>

          <p>Now listen to part of a lecture on this topic in a biology class.</p>
          <p>(male professor) OK, so we sometimes see this with animals that live in parts of the world where it gets very cold in the winter. For example, in the northeaster United States, there's a species of squirrels that does this. This squirrel, like many species of squirrel, loves to eat nuts. Nuts are one its primary sources of food. Now, nuts are very difficult to find in the winter. But in the autumn, they are lying all over the place because that's when they fall from the trees.So, what this squirrel does is in the autumn it spends a lot of time finding nuts. After it finds a nut, it prepares it. It takes off the outer shell and cleans it. This preparation may in some way help preserve the nut and or may make it easier to eat later on. The squirrel then digs a little hole in the ground and buries the nut. In one autumn, this squirrel may bury hundreds of nuts.But it doesn't just dig a big hole and put all the nuts in it and cover them up. No, it digs hundreds of holes all over the place. And it puts just one nut in each hole. Now, why would it do that? Well, probably primarily because even if other animals happen to find some of the holes, some of the nuts, the squirrel will still have a lot of other holes with nuts in them so it'll still have enough food to survive the winter.</p>

          <p>Animals usually hoard some food for the time when there's no food. And some animals divide their storage of food into different places and when the food is scarce, they return to the places and recover the food. For example, there's a kind of squirrels feeding on nuts that are plentiful in autumn while scarce in winter. So they spend a lot of time in autumn finding nuts. Then they prepare nuts by taking off the shells and cleansing them, which helps preserve and makes the nuts easier to eat later on. After that the squirrels dig thousands of holes at different places to hoard the prepared nuts so that even if some of the nuts are found by other animals, they still have enough food for the winter.
