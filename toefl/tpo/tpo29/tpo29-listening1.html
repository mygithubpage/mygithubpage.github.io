        <h3>Listening Text</h3>
        <article>
          <p>Narrator: Listen to part of a conversation between a student and an employee at the registrar's office.</p>
          <p>:Employee: Morning. How can I help you?</p>
          <p>:Student: Well, I am kind of confused about my schedule. I printed it out this morning. But one of the classes I registered for is missing.</p>
          <p>:Employee: OK. Let's see if we can figure this out. What's your name?</p>
          <p>:Student: Lisa Johnson.</p>
          <p>:Employee: Alright. I am bringing up your schedule on the computer. Hmmm...It looks like you're registered for Introduction to Astronomy, Survey of American Literature, and Introduction to Government and Politics. Is that right?</p>
          <p>:Student: Well, yes, but I also registered for a language class-Level One Japanese. Did they...I don't know, maybe cancel it?</p>
          <p>:Employee: I doubt it. The Japanese classes are quite popular. But let's take a look at the list of Japanese classes being offered this semester just to make sure. Um... what section did you register for?</p>
          <p>:Student: I don't remember the section number. But it's the one that meets at eleven.</p>
          <p>:Employee: Ah! That would be section five. Well, according to this, the class is completely full. Are you sure...you, um, you registered online, right?</p>
          <p>:Student: Yeah.</p>
          <p>:Employee: Did you get a confirmation message?</p>
          <p>:Student: What do you mean?</p>
          <p>:Employee: Well, once you've successfully registered for a class, the computer gives you a message saying you are in.</p>
          <p>:Student: Oh. You mean that message at the bottom of the screen that says you're now registered for this class? Actually, I didn't get that message. I got one that said "instructor's signature required." I thought I just needed to get to professor's signature on the first day of class.</p>
          <p>:Employee: Well, you do. But the professor might no sign it. It depends on how full the class is and how many additional students the professor is willing to let in.</p>
          <p>:Student: So that means I am not registered for the class. Not unless the professor signs me in. What, uh, what should I do now?</p>
          <p>:Employee: Let me give you the form the professor needs to sign. Go to the class on the first day, get there early, so you can talk to the professor before class starts. Find out if he or she is willing to let you in.If so, bring the signed form back here and we'll register you for the class. If not, well, you'll have to find a different class. I'd start looking for alternatives now, just in case.</p>
          <p>:Student: What do you think my chances are of getting into this class?</p>
          <p>:Employee: Students often add and drop classes once the semester begins, so there is a real chance a seat would open up. But of course there are no guarantees.</p>
          <p>:Student: It's just that I need a language class to graduate and that's the only Japanese class that fits my schedule.</p>
          <p>:Employee: Yes. But according to our records, you are only in your first year here. If you can't take the class this semester, you still got time.</p>
          <p>:Student: I know. I was just hoping to take care of my requirements earlier rather than later.</p>
          <p>:Employee: I understand. I just wanted to make sure you know you had options. </p>
