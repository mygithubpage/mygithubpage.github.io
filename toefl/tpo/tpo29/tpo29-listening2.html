There were 3 different causes of pedodiversity. The rest of the professors talked about three causes, which are the main contents of the lecture.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor,in what way is the soil in forested areas generally different from soil in other areas?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. In forested areas,the soil tends to be warmer and moister.</p><p>B. In forested areas,the chemistry of the soil changes more rapidly.</p><p>C.

To help explain the effects of forest gaps on soil.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>For instance, without a tree to absorb radiation from the sun, tool for shade, the full intensity of that radiation reaches the ground. The soil where the tree used to be heats up. And without a tree to soak up moisture from the ground, These words are explaining the role of the gap in a higher temperature and more moist conditions, the process of organic matter decompositions beats up. Professor pointed out that soil without trees shelter will absorb more solar radiation and the soil will warm up.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor consider pedodiversity an important field of research?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

It is an area of study that is often misunderstood.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Professor Professor And when we better understand pedodiversity, we will be better able to predict the impact of forest management on soil. If we can understand the diversity of soil, we can predict the impact of forest soil management.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor give the students an article to read?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

To provide them with more information on pits and mounds.</p><p>D. To provide them with more exposure to a controversial aspect of pedodiversity.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>I want you to read it because it makes the point I only touched on..........As the article explains, forest dynamics affects pedodiversity. That is the relationship between forest dynamics and pedodiversity. Reading this article, he pointed out: As the article explains, forest dynamics affects pedodiversity. But pedodiversity also affects forest dynamics.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
