            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.66" data-time="6.01">[00:06.01]</span>Professor: So far we have covered <span class="underline">biodiversity</span> in the hard wood forest here in the upper <span class="underline">peninsula</span> of Michigan from a number of angles.<span class="time" data-times="7.21" data-time="14.67">[00:14.67]</span>We've looked at everything from how <span class="underline">biodiversity</span> relates to <span class="underline">species</span> <span class="underline">stability</span>, to competition for forests resources and more. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.99" data-time="21.88">[00:21.88]</span>But now I want to discuss what's called pedodiversity. <span class="time" data-times="5.29" data-time="25.87">[00:25.87]</span>Pedodiversity is basically soil <span class="underline">diversity</span>. <span class="time" data-times="10.56" data-time="31.16">[00:31.16]</span>When we <span class="underline">analyze</span> pedodiversity <span class="underline">within</span> an area, we are measuring how much <span class="underline">variability</span> there is in soil properties and how many different types of soil there are in a <span class="underline">particular</span> area. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.82" data-time="41.72">[00:41.72]</span>So we look at soil chemistry.<span class="time" data-times="4.76" data-time="44.54">[00:44.54]</span> For example, how much <span class="underline">nitrogen</span> or <span class="underline">magnesium</span> there's in the soil in one <span class="underline">spot</span>.<span class="time" data-times="4.38" data-time="49.3">[00:49.30]</span>And we <span class="underline">compare</span> it with the chemistry of the soil a short distance away. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.43" data-time="53.68">[00:53.68]</span>Until recently, there hasn't been a whole lot of <span class="underline">attention</span> paid to pedodiversity. <span class="time" data-times="1.97" data-time="60.11">[01:00.11]</span>But that's changing rapidly.<span class="time" data-times="2.68" data-time="62.08">[01:02.08]</span> More and more studies are being done in these fields. <span class="time" data-times="12.28" data-time="64.76">[01:04.76]</span>There's a link between <span class="underline">biodiversity</span> and pedodiversity, an <span class="underline">obvious</span> relationship between soils and <span class="underline">flora</span> and <span class="underline">fauna</span>, which is why pedodiversity really should be considered in forest <span class="underline">management</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.37" data-time="77.04">[01:17.04]</span>A high <span class="underline">degree</span> of soil <span class="underline">variability</span> in a small area is <span class="underline">common</span>, particularly <span class="underline">within</span> forests.<span class="time" data-times="8.72" data-time="83.41">[01:23.41]</span>If you <span class="underline">compare</span> soils from a forest with soils that don't come from a forest, the <span class="underline">amount</span> of <span class="underline">variability</span> will most likely be greater in the forest's soil. <span class="time" data-times="2.25" data-time="92.13">[01:32.13]</span>It generally has more <span class="underline">diversity</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9.17" data-time="94.38">[01:34.38]</span>Um...OK. There are three main causes of pedodiversity <span class="underline">within</span> old-growth forest here in our <span class="underline">region</span> of Michigan. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.8" data-time="103.55">[01:43.55]</span>One is tree <span class="underline">species</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.54" data-time="105.35">[01:45.35]</span>Different <span class="underline">species</span> have different influences on soil <span class="underline">formation</span> and soil properties. <span class="time" data-times="3.42" data-time="110.89">[01:50.89]</span>For example, <span class="underline">pine</span> trees <span class="underline">drop</span> <span class="underline">pine</span> needles.<span class="time" data-times="3.16" data-time="114.31">[01:54.31]</span> And those needles add a lot of <span class="underline">acid</span> to the soil. <span class="time" data-times="6.12" data-time="117.47">[01:57.47]</span>The <span class="underline">organic</span> <span class="underline">litter</span> of another tree <span class="underline">species</span> might add less <span class="underline">acid</span> but more of something else. <span class="time" data-times="5.17" data-time="123.59">[02:03.59]</span>A lot of different types of trees in an area might mean more pedodiversity. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.23" data-time="128.76">[02:08.76]</span>Another cause? Gaps ... created when trees fall. <span class="time" data-times="5.8" data-time="132.99">[02:12.99]</span>You see, where there are gaps, open areas in the forest, the soil there changes.<span class="time" data-times="10.24" data-time="138.79">[02:18.79]</span>Um... for <span class="underline">instance</span>, without a tree to <span class="underline">absorb</span> <span class="underline">radiation</span> from the Sun, to <span class="underline">offer</span> <span class="underline">shade</span>, the full intensity of that <span class="underline">radiation</span> reaches the ground. <span class="time" data-times="3.13" data-time="149.03">[02:29.03]</span>The soil where the tree used to be heats up. <span class="time" data-times="6.4" data-time="152.16">[02:32.16]</span>And without a tree to <span class="underline">soak</span> up <span class="underline">moisture</span> from the ground, the soil remains wetter than in the surrounding forest. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.69" data-time="158.56">[02:38.56]</span>With a higher <span class="underline">temperature</span> and more <span class="underline">moist</span> conditions, the <span class="underline">process</span> of <span class="underline">organic</span> matter <span class="underline">decomposition</span> speeds up.<span class="time" data-times="7.94" data-time="165.25">[02:45.25]</span>In other words, <span class="underline">organic</span> matter gets broken down and added into the soil more quickly in these gaps than in the surrounding forest. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.54" data-time="173.19">[02:53.19]</span>OK. And the third cause-trees being uprooted. <span class="time" data-times="7.08" data-time="177.73">[02:57.73]</span>When a tree is uprooted, it might fall into some other trees on its way down, thus falling only partway over. <span class="time" data-times="3.55" data-time="184.81">[03:04.81]</span>Or it might <span class="underline">crash</span> all the way down to the forest floor. <span class="time" data-times="10.82" data-time="188.36">[03:08.36]</span>Either way, if its roots are pulled up from out of the ground as the tree topples over, then there's usually a big hole, a <span class="underline">pit</span> left in the ground where the roots used to be. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.63" data-time="199.18">[03:19.18]</span>And there's still a lot of soil attached to the roots, clinging to the roots. <span class="time" data-times="7.71" data-time="203.81">[03:23.81]</span>As that soil is <span class="underline">eventually</span> <span class="underline">shed</span> from the roots by rain and wind and the movement of squirrels climbing around, things like that. <span class="time" data-times="6.32" data-time="211.52">[03:31.52]</span>Um... as the soil is <span class="underline">shed</span>, it drops down and forms a little hill of dirt, a <span class="underline">mound</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.29" data-time="217.84">[03:37.84]</span>Pits and mounds have <span class="underline">significantly</span> different soil properties than other areas in the forest. <span class="time" data-times="4.99" data-time="224.13">[03:44.13]</span>You get a redistribution and mixing of soil as deep roots are ripped up from the ground.<span class="time" data-times="5.12" data-time="229.12">[03:49.12]</span>Rock fragments can be pulled up too, if they've gotten entangled with the roots over the years. <span class="time" data-times="4.86" data-time="234.24">[03:54.24]</span>So rock fragments from the subsoil can end up concentrated on the surface. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.94" data-time="239.1">[03:59.10]</span>There are forests <span class="underline">management</span> implications I want to point out. <span class="time" data-times="2.9" data-time="243.04">[04:03.04]</span>Forests <span class="underline">management</span> impacts soil <span class="underline">quality</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.32" data-time="245.94">[04:05.94]</span>And when we better understand pedodiversity, we will be better able to <span class="underline">predict</span> the <span class="underline">impact</span> of forest <span class="underline">management</span> on soil. <span class="time" data-times="6.92" data-time="253.26">[04:13.26]</span>But in general, for <span class="underline">positive</span> <span class="underline">impact</span>, forest <span class="underline">management</span> practices should <span class="underline">mimic</span> natural forest processes. <span class="time" data-times="6.14" data-time="260.18">[04:20.18]</span>And the goal should be to <span class="underline">promote</span> pedodiversity, and <span class="underline">through</span> this, <span class="underline">biodiversity</span> in general. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.45" data-time="266.32">[04:26.32]</span>I have a handout, an article on pedodiversity in a <span class="underline">section</span> of forests near here. <span class="time" data-times="3.48" data-time="271.77">[04:31.77]</span>I want you to read it, because it makes a point that I've only touched on.<span class="time" data-times="11.08" data-time="275.25">[04:35.25]</span>From what I have been saying about the causes of pedodiversity, you might <span class="underline">assume</span> that the relationship between forest dynamics, what happens to the trees, and pedodiversity is a one-way street. <span class="time" data-times="5.09" data-time="286.33">[04:46.33]</span>As the article explains, forest dynamics affects pedodiversity. <span class="time" data-times="3.84" data-time="291.42">[04:51.42]</span>But pedodiversity also affects forest dynamics.<span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="295.26">[04:55.26]</span> It's <span class="underline">worth</span> bearing in <span class="underline">mind</span>. </p>
