The <span class="highlight">existence</span> of competition has been long known to naturalists; its effects were described by Darwin in <span class="highlight">considerable</span><span class="highlight">detail</span>. Competition among individuals of the same <span class="highlight">species</span> (intraspecies competition), one of the <span class="highlight">major</span><span class="question1">mechanisms of natural <span class="highlight">selection</span></span> is the <span class="highlight">concern</span> of <span class="highlight">evolutionary</span><span class="highlight">biology</span>. Competition among the individuals of different <span class="highlight">species</span> (interspecies competition) is a <span class="highlight">major</span><span class="highlight">concern</span> of <span class="highlight">ecology</span>. It is one of the factors controlling the size of <span class="highlight">competing</span> populations, and <span class="highlight">extreme</span> cases it may <span class="highlight">lead</span> to the <span class="highlight">extinction</span> of one of the <span class="highlight">competing</span><span class="highlight">species</span>. This was described by Darwin for <span class="highlight"><span class="question3">indigenous</span></span> New Zealand <span class="highlight">species</span> of animals and plants, which died out when <span class="highlight">competing</span><span class="highlight">species</span> from Europe were introduced.</p><p>No serious competition exists when the <span class="highlight">major</span> needed <span class="highlight">resource</span> is in superabundant <span class="highlight">supply</span>, as in most cases of the coexistence of herbivores (plant eaters). Furthermore, most <span class="highlight">species</span> do not <span class="highlight">depend</span><span class="highlight">entirely</span> on a single <span class="highlight">resource</span>, if the <span class="highlight">major</span><span class="highlight">resource</span> for a <span class="highlight">species</span> becomes <span class="highlight">scarce</span>, the <span class="highlight">species</span> can usually <span class="highlight">shift</span> to <span class="highlight">alternative</span> resources. If more than one <span class="highlight">species</span> is <span class="highlight">competing</span> for a <span class="highlight">scarce</span><span class="highlight">resource</span>, the <span class="highlight">competing</span><span class="highlight">species</span> usually <span class="highlight">switch</span> to different <span class="highlight">alternative</span> resources. Competition is usually most <span class="highlight">severe</span> among close relatives with <span class="highlight">similar</span> demands on the environment. But it may also <span class="highlight">occur</span> among totally unrelated forms that <span class="highlight">compete</span> for the same <span class="highlight">resource</span>, such as seed-eating rodents and ants. The effects of such competition are <span class="question6">graphically</span> demonstrated when all the animals or all the plants in an <span class="highlight">ecosystem</span> come into competition, as happened 2 million years ago at the end of Pliocene, when North and South America became joined by the Isthmus of Panama. North and South American <span class="highlight">species</span> migrating <span class="highlight">across</span> the Isthmus now came into competition with each other. The result was the extermination of a large <span class="highlight">fraction</span> of the South American mammals, which were apparently unable to <span class="highlight">withstand</span> the competition from invading North American species----although added <span class="highlight">predation</span> was also an important <span class="highlight">factor</span>.</p><p>To what <span class="highlight">extent</span> competition determines the <span class="highlight">composition</span> of a <span class="highlight">community</span> and the <span class="highlight">density</span> of <span class="highlight">particular</span><span class="highlight">species</span> has been the <span class="highlight">source</span> of <span class="highlight">considerable</span><span class="highlight">controversy</span>. The problem is that competition ordinarily cannot be observed directly but must be inferred from the <span class="highlight">spread</span> or increase of one <span class="highlight">species</span> and the concurrent <span class="highlight">reduction</span> or disappearance of another <span class="highlight">species</span>. The Russian biologist G. F. Gause performed <span class="highlight">numerous</span> tow-species experiments in the <span class="highlight">laboratory</span>, in which one of the <span class="highlight">species</span> became <span class="highlight">extinct</span> when only a single kind of <span class="highlight">resource</span> was <span class="highlight">available</span>. On the basis of these experiments and of <span class="highlight">field</span> observations, the so-called law of <span class="highlight">competitive</span> exclusion was formulated, according to which no two <span class="highlight">species</span> can <span class="highlight">occupy</span> the same <span class="highlight">niche</span>. <span class="question9"><span class="highlight">Numerous</span> seeming exceptions to this law have since been found, but they can usually be explained as cases in which the two <span class="highlight">species</span>, <span class="highlight">even</span> though <span class="highlight">competing</span> for a <span class="highlight">major</span><span class="highlight">joint</span><span class="highlight">resource</span>, did not really <span class="highlight">occupy</span> exactly the same <span class="highlight">niche</span>.</span></p><p>Competition among <span class="highlight">species</span> is of <span class="highlight">considerable</span><span class="highlight">evolutionary</span> importance. The <span class="highlight">physical</span> structure of <span class="highlight">species</span><span class="highlight">competing</span> for resources in the same <span class="highlight">ecological</span><span class="highlight">niche</span> tends to <span class="highlight">gradually</span><span class="highlight">evolve</span> in ways that allow them to <span class="highlight">occupy</span> different niches. <span class="highlight">Competing</span><span class="highlight">species</span> also <span class="highlight">tend</span> to change their ranges so that their territories no longer <span class="highlight">overlap</span>. The <span class="highlight">evolutionary</span> effect of competition on <span class="highlight">species</span> has been referred to as "<span class="highlight">species</span><span class="highlight">selection</span>"; however, this description is potentially misleading. Only the individuals of a <span class="highlight">species</span> are <span class="highlight">subject</span> to the pressures of natural <span class="highlight">selection</span>. The effect on the well-being and <span class="highlight">existence</span> of a <span class="highlight">species</span> is just the result of the effects of <span class="highlight">selection</span> on all the individuals of the <span class="highlight">species</span>. Thus <span class="highlight">species</span><span class="highlight">selection</span> is actually a result of <span class="highlight">individual</span><span class="highlight">selection</span>.</p><p>Competition may <span class="highlight">occur</span> for any needed <span class="highlight">resource</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>In the case of animals it is usually food; in the case of forest plants it may be light; in the case of <span class="highlight">substrate</span> inhabitants it may be <span class="highlight">space</span>,

The corresponding D option's way (method, route). Corresponding to the original: Competition among individuals of the same species (intraspecies competition), one of the major mechanisms of natural selection, is the concern of evolutionary biology can also be inferred from the original text. We all know that evolution is due to the "natural selection" reason, which is the meaning of the original sentence. The mechanism of of natural selection appears in the linguistic component, which is mainly used to modify the competition, saying that competition is a mechanism of natural selection. The options for the dangers and C options of the B option are obviously wrong, and between A and D, D is closer to the meaning of mechanism, so this question chooses D.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 1, what is one effect of competition among individuals of different species?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It results in the eventual elimination of the resource for which they are competing.</p><p>B. It leads to competition among individuals of the same species.</p><p>C. It encourages new species to immigrate to an area.</p><p>D. It controls the number of individuals in the competing populations.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D With differential species to the original penultimate, three sentences: Competition among the individuals of different species (interspecies competition) is a major concern of ecology.It is one of the factors controlling the size of competing populations, and extreme cases it This may be explicitly cited as a control of the competing population. In extreme cases, one of the competing species may become extinct. So, the control corresponding to the D option. There is no mention of the ABC option.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question3">indigenous</span></span>"in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. native</p><p>B. rate</p><p>C. most</p><p>D. numerous</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" A"><p>A Indigenous: Native. Native (local) for the A option. B is rare, C is most, and D is innumerable. The term was described by Darwin for <span class="question3">indigenous</span> New Zealand species of animals and plants, which dies out when competing species from Europe were introduced. This meaning can also be inferred from the original. In the last part of the original sentence, which guides the clauses that are due to the introduction of European races and which refers to the <span class="question3">indigenous</span> New Zealand species, is the ingenious New Zealand species extinct. The two species exhibit competing oppositions and can be speculated using this relationship. The A option is the most suitable.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>In paragraph 1, why does the author mention what happened in New Zealand?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To indicate that Darwin understood the importance of competition</p><p>B. To illustrate that competition can lead to the extinction of species</p><p>C. To identify where the idea of competition among species first arose</p><p>D. To argue against the idea that the process of selection is a natural occurrence</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B First used New Zealand to locate the details of the source, the last sentence of the paragraph, which states that the native New Zealand species were extinct due to the races introduced by Europe and the <span class="question3">indigenous</span> New Zealand species. Going forward to find the arguments to be supported, the first two sentences talk about the arguments of inter-ethnic competition that can control the number of different races. New Zealand plants and animals are cited as examples, and examples are used to prove and support ideas. So choose the B option.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 2, competition is not usually a significant factor among two coexisting species when</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. one of the species has only recently moved into the territory of the other</p><p>B. the species are closely related to each other</p><p>C. the population of one species is much larger than that of the other</p><p>D. both of the species are herbivores</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D According to coexisting species, the first sentence: No serious competition exists when the major needed resources is in superabundant supply, as in most cases of the coexistence of herbivores (plant eaters). There will not be too much competition. Most herbivores are officially so. So corresponds to the D option. The A option and the original text are in and out. The original text says that if the competition is too strong, one species may turn to other resources; the content of the B option is the opposite of the original, and the original text says closely related species may be the most competitive; C options are not mentioned and.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question6">graphically</span></span>"in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. vividly</p><p>B. frequently</p><p>C. broadly</p><p>D. typically</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" A"><p>A <span class="question6">graphically</span>: vivid. Word A effects of such competition are <span class="question6">graphically</span> demonstrated when all the animals or all the plants in an ecosystem come into competition, as happened 2 million years ago at the end of the Pliocene, when North America's By the Isthmus of Panama . Graph is the meaning of the picture. Graphically, it is <span class="question6">graphically</span> and can give birth vividness. So select the vividly A option. The B option is frequently, C is widely, and D is special. Do not meet. You can also substitute Options based on the context of the original text, eliminating obvious and option answers. BCD substitution is inappropriate.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>In paragraph 2, why does the author talk about what happened as a result of North and South America becoming joined at the Isthmus of Panama?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To make the point that predation can have as much effect on species survival as competition does</p><p>B. To show how the ability to switch to an alternative resource can give a species a competitive advantage</p><p>C. To account for the current species composition of North and South America</p><p>D. To provide an example of the serious effects of competition between unrelated species</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D uses Isthmus of Panama to first locate the details of the source, and the discovery is a description of a specific example. Go forward to find the main sentence, and locate the sentence guided by but: but it may also happen among totally unrelated forms that compete for the same resource, such as seed-eating rodents and ants. This sentence is said to be completely irrelevant The species may also compete for the same resource and there will be strong competition among them. It is inferred that the result of animal competition in North and South America is to illustrate the effects of competition. So choose D. A mentioned in the original sentence, in the last part of the sentence, but the previous although shows that this is not the main point.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Paragraph 3 supports the idea that Gause's experiments were important because they</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. provided a situation in which competition could be removed from the interaction between two species</p><p>B. showed that previous ideas about the extent to which competition determines the composition of a community were completely mistaken</p><p>C. helped establish that competition will remove all but one species from any given ecological niche</p><p>D. offered evidence that competition between species is minimal when there is an overabundance of a single food source</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C. By Gause's experiments, after describing the experimental content, the article says on the basis of these experiments. Then the conclusion is that the basis of these experiments and of field observations, the so-called law of competency There are no two species that can occupy the same niche. There are no two species that can occupy the same niche. That is: a niche can only have one species, which is consistent with the C option. ABD did not mention it in the original.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Apparent exceptions to this law usually involves cases in which two species compete for the same major resource but occupy slightly different niches.</p><p>B. Although it may appear that two species always have different niches, many exceptions show that species compete with each other.</p><p>C. Cases in which two species not only compete for a shared resource but also occupy similar niches are considered exceptions to this law.</p><p>D. Cases in which the two species do not occupy that same niche yet still compete for the same resource are believed to be exceptions to this law.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The main body of the sentence in A's original text is seeming exceptions have been found, and after the existence of the turning logic, this exception can be explained. So only the A option includes these two main meanings. The second half of the B option is not consistent with the original sentence. The parallelism of the not only, but also of the C option is obviously inconsistent with the original sentence. D changes the meaning of the original sentence to some extent, and the original sentence is not expressed. The same niche, its logic changes too much.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, how does competition affect evolution?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It results in the evolution of physical structures that allow the species to compete with each other more effectively.</p><p>B. It results I the evolutionary extinction of all but one of the competing species.</p><p>C. It results in the competing species evolving in such a way that they no longer compete for the same resources.</p><p>D. It results in the competing species evolving to become so much like each other that competition between them eventually disappears.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C. Use evolution to position and locate the first sentence. The first sentence refers to the content of the question. It is said that the competition has an evolutionary importance. The latter should be a concrete explanation. Looking back at the competition in the same niche environment, the content of the competing species tend to to answer the question: The physical structure of species competing for resources in the same ecological niche tends to gradually evolve in ways that allow them to occupy different niches Competing species also tend to change their ranges so that their territories no longer overlap. That is to say, making their territories no longer overlap, that is, no longer competing for resources in the same area. The other three options are not mentioned in the original.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, "species selection"is a misleading term because it</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. overemphasizes the role of selection pressure in species extinction</p><p>B. suggests that selection pressures directly influence whole species</p><p>C. does not make a distinction between species extinction and species evolution</p><p>D. suggests that extinction always results whenever there is a competition</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B positioned through the species selection to "The evolutionary effect of competition...", followed by a turning point, saying that this description is misleading. It will certainly explain why: the effect on the well-being and existence of a species is just the result of the effects of selection on all the individuals of the species. Thus species selection is actually a result of individual selection. Natural selection is actually directly applied to individuals rather than to species. So wrong. Corresponding to option B, "species selection implies that selection pressure is directly applied to the entire species."</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question12">regulating</span></span>"in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. controlling</p><p>B. explaining</p><p>C. observing</p><p>D. stopping</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" A"><p>A regulate: Adjustment, control. The last sentence is that in the growth of <span class="question12">regulating</span>, it is the most important density-dependent factor. The last sentence is the control of the A option, which corresponds to the original Together with predation, it is the most important density-dependent factor in <span class="question12">regulating</span> population growth. It is easy to understand is control. So choose A. B is an explanation, C is an observation, and D is a stop. Substitution of BCD cannot form a suitable match with population growth.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>That is, as the density of a population increases, competition has a greater impact and leads to greater mortality..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D That at the beginning of the sentence to be inserted must refer to the previous sentence. And with the density. The first time the word appeared in the original text was a word "denser" before the D option. After inserting it, it was found that the insert was before the further description of D. Afterwards, it supplements the combined effect of predation and competition on density, and the logical relationship is consistent and smooth.</p></div></div><div id="question14" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>When necessary resources are limited, competition can occur among individuals of the same species or of different species.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.Competition can eliminate a species, but since most species do not depend on a single resource, competition is often reduced by switching to alternative resources.</p><p>B.Competition between individuals of the same species is usually for food whereas competition between species is usually for habitat.</p><p>C.Investigation of the ecological role of competition is difficult because ordinarily the competition cannot be observed directly and must be inferred from its presumed effects.</p><p>D.Experiments and field observations have established that competition between species is strong enough to prevent two species from occupying the same ecologica niche.</p><p>E.Competition between a pair of species tends to lessen over time because the species tend to evolve to occupy different ecological niches and ranges.</p><p>F.Competition is usually strongest when the density of the competing populations is the same.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="ADE"><p>ADE A is correct, corresponding to the second and third sentence in the second paragraph of the original text. The original text of B didn't mean that. It was always saying that it was in the competition resource and it was not selected. The latter part of C was mentioned in the original text, but there was no such causal relationship with the first half of the sentence. D is correct, corresponding to the sentence in paragraph 3 of the original text. E is correct, corresponding to the second sentence of the fourth paragraph of the original text. F is incorrect.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
