            <b>Competition</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>When several individuals of the same <span class="underline">species</span> or of several different <span class="underline">species</span> <span class="underline">depend</span> on the same limited <span class="underline">resource</span>, a situation may arise that is referred to as competition. The <span class="underline">existence</span> of competition has been long known to naturalists; its effects were described by Darwin in <span class="underline">considerable</span> <span class="underline">detail</span>. Competition among individuals of the same <span class="underline">species</span> (intraspecies competition), one of the <span class="underline">major</span><span class="light">mechanisms of natural <span class="underline">selection</span></span> is the <span class="underline">concern</span> of <span class="underline">evolutionary</span> <span class="underline">biology</span>. Competition among the individuals of different <span class="underline">species</span> (interspecies competition) is a <span class="underline">major</span> <span class="underline">concern</span> of <span class="underline">ecology</span>. It is one of the factors controlling the size of <span class="underline">competing</span> populations, and <span class="underline">extreme</span> cases it may <span class="underline">lead</span> to the <span class="underline">extinction</span> of one of the <span class="underline">competing</span> <span class="underline">species</span>. This was described by Darwin for <span class="underline">indigenous</span> New Zealand <span class="underline">species</span> of animals and plants, which died out when <span class="underline">competing</span> <span class="underline">species</span> from Europe were introduced.</p>
          <p>No serious competition exists when the <span class="underline">major</span> needed <span class="underline">resource</span> is in superabundant <span class="underline">supply</span>, as in most cases of the coexistence of herbivores (plant eaters). Furthermore, most <span class="underline">species</span> do not <span class="underline">depend</span> <span class="underline">entirely</span> on a single <span class="underline">resource</span>, if the <span class="underline">major</span> <span class="underline">resource</span> for a <span class="underline">species</span> becomes <span class="underline">scarce</span>, the <span class="underline">species</span> can usually <span class="underline">shift</span> to <span class="underline">alternative</span> resources. If more than one <span class="underline">species</span> is <span class="underline">competing</span> for a <span class="underline">scarce</span> <span class="underline">resource</span>, the <span class="underline">competing</span> <span class="underline">species</span> usually <span class="underline">switch</span> to different <span class="underline">alternative</span> resources. Competition is usually most <span class="underline">severe</span> among close relatives with <span class="underline">similar</span> demands on the environment. But it may also <span class="underline">occur</span> among totally unrelated forms that <span class="underline">compete</span> for the same <span class="underline">resource</span>, such as seed-eating rodents and ants. The effects of such competition are graphically demonstrated when all the animals or all the plants in an <span class="underline">ecosystem</span> come into competition, as happened 2 million years ago at the end of Pliocene, when North and South America became joined by the Isthmus of Panama. North and South American <span class="underline">species</span> migrating <span class="underline">across</span> the Isthmus now came into competition with each other. The result was the extermination of a large <span class="underline">fraction</span> of the South American mammals, which were apparently unable to <span class="underline">withstand</span> the competition from invading North American species----although added <span class="underline">predation</span> was also an important <span class="underline">factor</span>.</p>
          <p>To what <span class="underline">extent</span> competition determines the <span class="underline">composition</span> of a <span class="underline">community</span> and the <span class="underline">density</span> of <span class="underline">particular</span> <span class="underline">species</span> has been the <span class="underline">source</span> of <span class="underline">considerable</span> <span class="underline">controversy</span>. The problem is that competition ordinarily cannot be observed directly but must be inferred from the <span class="underline">spread</span> or increase of one <span class="underline">species</span> and the concurrent <span class="underline">reduction</span> or disappearance of another <span class="underline">species</span>. The Russian biologist G. F. Gause performed <span class="underline">numerous</span> tow-species experiments in the <span class="underline">laboratory</span>, in which one of the <span class="underline">species</span> became <span class="underline">extinct</span> when only a single kind of <span class="underline">resource</span> was <span class="underline">available</span>. On the basis of these experiments and of <span class="underline">field</span> observations, the so-called law of <span class="underline">competitive</span> exclusion was formulated, according to which no two <span class="underline">species</span> can <span class="underline">occupy</span> the same <span class="underline">niche</span>. <span class="underline">Numerous</span> seeming exceptions to this law have since been found, but they can usually be explained as cases in which the two <span class="underline">species</span>, <span class="underline">even</span> though <span class="underline">competing</span> for a <span class="underline">major</span> <span class="underline">joint</span> <span class="underline">resource</span>, did not really <span class="underline">occupy</span> exactly the same <span class="underline">niche</span>.</p>
          <p>Competition among <span class="underline">species</span> is of <span class="underline">considerable</span> <span class="underline">evolutionary</span> importance. The <span class="underline">physical</span> structure of <span class="underline">species</span> <span class="underline">competing</span> for resources in the same <span class="underline">ecological</span> <span class="underline">niche</span> tends to <span class="underline">gradually</span> <span class="underline">evolve</span> in ways that allow them to <span class="underline">occupy</span> different niches. <span class="underline">Competing</span> <span class="underline">species</span> also <span class="underline">tend</span> to change their ranges so that their territories no longer <span class="underline">overlap</span>. The <span class="underline">evolutionary</span> effect of competition on <span class="underline">species</span> has been referred to as "<span class="underline">species</span> <span class="underline">selection</span>"; however, this description is potentially misleading. Only the individuals of a <span class="underline">species</span> are <span class="underline">subject</span> to the pressures of natural <span class="underline">selection</span>. The effect on the well-being and <span class="underline">existence</span> of a <span class="underline">species</span> is just the result of the effects of <span class="underline">selection</span> on all the individuals of the <span class="underline">species</span>. Thus <span class="underline">species</span> <span class="underline">selection</span> is actually a result of <span class="underline">individual</span> <span class="underline">selection</span>.</p>
          <p>Competition may <span class="underline">occur</span> for any needed <span class="underline">resource</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>In the case of animals it is usually food; in the case of forest plants it may be light; in the case of <span class="underline">substrate</span> inhabitants it may be <span class="underline">space</span>,
as in many shallow-water bottom-dwelling <span class="underline">marine</span> organisms. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>Indeed, it may be for any of the factors, <span class="underline">physical</span> as well as biotic, that are <span class="underline">essential</span> for organisms. 
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>Competition is usually the more <span class="underline">severe</span> the denser the <span class="underline">population</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>Together with <span class="underline">predation</span>, it is the most important density-dependent <span class="underline">factor</span> in regulating <span class="underline">population</span> growth.</p>
