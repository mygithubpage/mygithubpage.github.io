          <h4 class="w3-center">Competition</h4>
          <p>When several individuals of the same <span class="highlight">species</span> or of several different <span class="highlight">species</span> <span class="highlight">depend</span> on the same limited <span class="highlight">resource</span>, a situation may arise that is referred to as competition. The <span class="highlight">existence</span> of competition has been long known to naturalists; its effects were described by Darwin in <span class="highlight">considerable</span> <span class="highlight">detail</span>. Competition among individuals of the same <span class="highlight">species</span> (intraspecies competition), one of the <span class="highlight">major</span><span class="question1">mechanisms of natural <span class="highlight">selection</span></span> is the <span class="highlight">concern</span> of <span class="highlight">evolutionary</span> <span class="highlight">biology</span>. Competition among the individuals of different <span class="highlight">species</span> (interspecies competition) is a <span class="highlight">major</span> <span class="highlight">concern</span> of <span class="highlight">ecology</span>. It is one of the factors controlling the size of <span class="highlight">competing</span> populations, and <span class="highlight">extreme</span> cases it may <span class="highlight">lead</span> to the <span class="highlight">extinction</span> of one of the <span class="highlight">competing</span> <span class="highlight">species</span>. This was described by Darwin for <span class="highlight"><span class="question3">indigenous</span></span> New Zealand <span class="highlight">species</span> of animals and plants, which died out when <span class="highlight">competing</span> <span class="highlight">species</span> from Europe were introduced.</p>
          <p>No serious competition exists when the <span class="highlight">major</span> needed <span class="highlight">resource</span> is in superabundant <span class="highlight">supply</span>, as in most cases of the coexistence of herbivores (plant eaters). Furthermore, most <span class="highlight">species</span> do not <span class="highlight">depend</span> <span class="highlight">entirely</span> on a single <span class="highlight">resource</span>, if the <span class="highlight">major</span> <span class="highlight">resource</span> for a <span class="highlight">species</span> becomes <span class="highlight">scarce</span>, the <span class="highlight">species</span> can usually <span class="highlight">shift</span> to <span class="highlight">alternative</span> resources. If more than one <span class="highlight">species</span> is <span class="highlight">competing</span> for a <span class="highlight">scarce</span> <span class="highlight">resource</span>, the <span class="highlight">competing</span> <span class="highlight">species</span> usually <span class="highlight">switch</span> to different <span class="highlight">alternative</span> resources. Competition is usually most <span class="highlight">severe</span> among close relatives with <span class="highlight">similar</span> demands on the environment. But it may also <span class="highlight">occur</span> among totally unrelated forms that <span class="highlight">compete</span> for the same <span class="highlight">resource</span>, such as seed-eating rodents and ants. The effects of such competition are <span class="question6">graphically</span> demonstrated when all the animals or all the plants in an <span class="highlight">ecosystem</span> come into competition, as happened 2 million years ago at the end of Pliocene, when North and South America became joined by the Isthmus of Panama. North and South American <span class="highlight">species</span> migrating <span class="highlight">across</span> the Isthmus now came into competition with each other. The result was the extermination of a large <span class="highlight">fraction</span> of the South American mammals, which were apparently unable to <span class="highlight">withstand</span> the competition from invading North American species----although added <span class="highlight">predation</span> was also an important <span class="highlight">factor</span>.</p>
          <p>To what <span class="highlight">extent</span> competition determines the <span class="highlight">composition</span> of a <span class="highlight">community</span> and the <span class="highlight">density</span> of <span class="highlight">particular</span> <span class="highlight">species</span> has been the <span class="highlight">source</span> of <span class="highlight">considerable</span> <span class="highlight">controversy</span>. The problem is that competition ordinarily cannot be observed directly but must be inferred from the <span class="highlight">spread</span> or increase of one <span class="highlight">species</span> and the concurrent <span class="highlight">reduction</span> or disappearance of another <span class="highlight">species</span>. The Russian biologist G. F. Gause performed <span class="highlight">numerous</span> tow-species experiments in the <span class="highlight">laboratory</span>, in which one of the <span class="highlight">species</span> became <span class="highlight">extinct</span> when only a single kind of <span class="highlight">resource</span> was <span class="highlight">available</span>. On the basis of these experiments and of <span class="highlight">field</span> observations, the so-called law of <span class="highlight">competitive</span> exclusion was formulated, according to which no two <span class="highlight">species</span> can <span class="highlight">occupy</span> the same <span class="highlight">niche</span>. <span class="question9"><span class="highlight">Numerous</span> seeming exceptions to this law have since been found, but they can usually be explained as cases in which the two <span class="highlight">species</span>, <span class="highlight">even</span> though <span class="highlight">competing</span> for a <span class="highlight">major</span> <span class="highlight">joint</span> <span class="highlight">resource</span>, did not really <span class="highlight">occupy</span> exactly the same <span class="highlight">niche</span>.</span></p>
          <p>Competition among <span class="highlight">species</span> is of <span class="highlight">considerable</span> <span class="highlight">evolutionary</span> importance. The <span class="highlight">physical</span> structure of <span class="highlight">species</span> <span class="highlight">competing</span> for resources in the same <span class="highlight">ecological</span> <span class="highlight">niche</span> tends to <span class="highlight">gradually</span> <span class="highlight">evolve</span> in ways that allow them to <span class="highlight">occupy</span> different niches. <span class="highlight">Competing</span> <span class="highlight">species</span> also <span class="highlight">tend</span> to change their ranges so that their territories no longer <span class="highlight">overlap</span>. The <span class="highlight">evolutionary</span> effect of competition on <span class="highlight">species</span> has been referred to as "<span class="highlight">species</span> <span class="highlight">selection</span>"; however, this description is potentially misleading. Only the individuals of a <span class="highlight">species</span> are <span class="highlight">subject</span> to the pressures of natural <span class="highlight">selection</span>. The effect on the well-being and <span class="highlight">existence</span> of a <span class="highlight">species</span> is just the result of the effects of <span class="highlight">selection</span> on all the individuals of the <span class="highlight">species</span>. Thus <span class="highlight">species</span> <span class="highlight">selection</span> is actually a result of <span class="highlight">individual</span> <span class="highlight">selection</span>.</p>
          <p>Competition may <span class="highlight">occur</span> for any needed <span class="highlight">resource</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>In the case of animals it is usually food; in the case of forest plants it may be light; in the case of <span class="highlight">substrate</span> inhabitants it may be <span class="highlight">space</span>,
as in many shallow-water bottom-dwelling <span class="highlight">marine</span> organisms. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>Indeed, it may be for any of the factors, <span class="highlight">physical</span> as well as biotic, that are <span class="highlight">essential</span> for organisms. 
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>Competition is usually the more <span class="highlight">severe</span> the denser the <span class="highlight">population</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>Together with <span class="highlight">predation</span>, it is the most important density-dependent <span class="highlight">factor</span> in <span class="question12">regulating</span> <span class="highlight">population</span> growth.</p>

Corresponding to the original: Competition among individuals of the same species (intraspecies competition), one of the major mechanisms of natural selection, is the concern of evolutionary biology can also be inferred from the original text. We all know that evolution is due to the "natural selection" reason, which is the meaning of the original sentence. The mechanism of of natural selection appears in the linguistic component, which is mainly used to modify the competition, saying that competition is a mechanism of natural selection. The options for the dangers and C options of the B option are obviously wrong, and between A and D, D is closer to the meaning of mechanism, so this question chooses D.</p>

The latter should be a concrete explanation. Looking back at the competition in the same niche environment, the content of the competing species tend to to answer the question: The physical structure of species competing for resources in the same ecological niche tends to gradually evolve in ways that allow them to occupy different niches Competing species also tend to change their ranges so that their territories no longer overlap. That is to say, making their territories no longer overlap, that is, no longer competing for resources in the same area. The other three options are not mentioned in the original.</p>

It will certainly explain why: the effect on the well-being and existence of a species is just the result of the effects of selection on all the individuals of the species. Thus species selection is actually a result of individual selection. Natural selection is actually directly applied to individuals rather than to species. So wrong.
