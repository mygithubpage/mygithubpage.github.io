            <b>The History of Waterpower</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>Moving water was one of the earliest energy sources to be <span class="question1">harnessed</span> to reduce the workload of people and animals. No one knows exactly when the waterwheel was invented, but <span class="highlight">irrigation</span> systems existed at <span class="highlight">least</span> 5,000 years ago, and it seems probable that the earliest waterpower <span class="highlight">device</span> was the noria, a waterwheel that raised water for <span class="highlight">irrigation</span> in attached jars. The <span class="highlight">device</span> appears to have evolved no later than the fifth <span class="highlight">century</span> B.C., perhaps independently in different regions of the Middle and Far East.</p>
          <p>The earliest waterpower mills were probably vertical-axis mills for grinding corn, known as Norse or Greek mills, which <span class="highlight">seem</span> to have appeared during the first or <span class="highlight">second</span> <span class="highlight">century</span> B.C. in the Middle East and a few centuries later in <span class="highlight">Scandinavia</span>. In the following centuries, increasingly <span class="highlight">sophisticated</span> waterpower mills were built <span class="highlight">throughout</span> the Roman <span class="highlight">Empire</span> and beyond its boundaries in the Middle East and northern Europe. In England, the Saxons are thought to have used both horizontal and vertical-axis wheels. The first documented English <span class="highlight">mill</span> was in the eighth <span class="highlight">century</span>, but three centuries later about 5,000 were recorded, suggesting that every <span class="highlight">settlement</span> of any size had its <span class="highlight">mill</span>.</p>
          <p>Raising water and grinding corn were by no means the only uses of the waterpower <span class="highlight">mill</span>, and during the following centuries, <span class="question4">the <span class="highlight">application</span> of waterpower </span>kept pace with the developing 
technologies of <span class="highlight">mining</span>, iron working, paper making, and the wool and cotton industries. Water was the main <span class="highlight">source</span> of <span class="highlight">mechanical</span> power, and by the end of the seventeenth <span class="highlight">century</span>, 
England alone is thought to have had some 20,000 working <span class="highlight">mill</span>. There was much <span class="highlight">debate</span> on the <span class="highlight">relative</span> efficiencies of different types of waterwheels. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>The period from about 1650 until 1800 saw some 
excellent <span class="highlight">scientific</span> and <span class="highlight">technical</span> investigations of different designs. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>They revealed <span class="highlight">output</span> powers ranging from about 1 horsepower to perhaps 60 for the largest wheels and confirmed that for 
<span class="highlight">maximum</span> <span class="highlight">efficiency</span>, the water should pass <span class="highlight">across</span> the blades as <span class="highlight">smoothly</span> as possible and fall away with <span class="highlight">minimum</span> speed, having <span class="highlight">given</span> up almost all of its <span class="highlight">kinetic</span> energy.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>(They also proved that, in <span class="highlight">principle</span>, the overshot wheel, a type of wheel in which an overhead <span class="highlight">stream</span> of water powers the wheel, should win the <span class="highlight">efficiency</span> competition.) <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p>
          <p>But then steam power entered the <span class="highlight">scene</span>, putting the whole future of waterpower in <span class="highlight">doubt</span>. An energy <span class="highlight">analyst</span> writing in the year 1800 would have painted a very <span class="highlight"><span class="question6">pessimistic</span> </span>picture of the future for waterpower. The coal-fired steam <span class="highlight">engine</span> was taking over, and the waterwheel was fast becoming <span class="highlight">obsolete</span>. However, like many later experts, this one would have suffered from an inability to see into the future. A <span class="highlight">century</span> later the picture was completely different: <span class="question7">by then, </span>the world had an electric <span class="highlight">industry</span>, and a quarter of its generating <span class="highlight">capacity</span> was water powered.</p>
          <p><span class="question9">The growth of the electric-power <span class="highlight">industry</span> was the result of a <span class="highlight">remarkable</span> <span class="highlight">series</span> of <span class="highlight">scientific</span> discoveries and <span class="highlight">development</span> in electrotechnology during the nineteenth <span class="highlight">century</span>, but <span class="highlight">significant</span> changes in what we might now call hydro (water) technology also played their part. </span>In 1832, the year of Michael Faraday's discovery that a changing <span class="highlight">magnetic</span> <span class="highlight">field</span> produces an electric <span class="highlight">field</span>, a young French engineer patented a new and more <span class="highlight">efficient</span> waterwheel. His name was Benoit Fourneyron, and his <span class="highlight">device</span> was the first successful water <span class="highlight">turbine</span>. The waterwheel, <span class="question10">unaltered </span>for nearly 2,000 years, had finally been superseded.</p>
          <p>Half a <span class="highlight">century</span> of <span class="highlight">development</span> was needed before Faraday's discoveries in <span class="highlight">electricity</span> were translated into full-scale power stations. In 1881 the Godalming power <span class="highlight">station</span> in Surrey, England, on the banks of the Wey River, created the world's first public <span class="highlight">electricity</span> <span class="highlight">supply</span>. The power <span class="highlight">source</span> of this most modern technology was a <span class="highlight">traditional</span> waterwheel. <span class="highlight">Unfortunately</span> this early plant experienced the problem <span class="highlight">common</span> to many forms of renewable energy: the flow in the Wey River was unreliable, and the waterwheel was soon replaced by a steam <span class="highlight">engine</span>.</p>
          <p>From this <span class="highlight">primitive</span> start, the electric <span class="highlight">industry</span> grew during the final 20 years of the nineteenth <span class="highlight">century</span> at a <span class="highlight">rate</span> seldom if ever exceeded by any technology. The <span class="highlight">capacity</span> of <span class="highlight">individual</span> power stations, many of them hydro plants, rose from a few kilowatts to over a megawatt in less than a <span class="highlight">decade</span>.</p>
