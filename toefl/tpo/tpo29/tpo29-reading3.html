No one knows exactly when the waterwheel was invented, but <span class="highlight">irrigation</span> systems existed at <span class="highlight">least</span> 5,000 years ago, and it seems probable that the earliest waterpower <span class="highlight">device</span> was the noria, a waterwheel that raised water for <span class="highlight">irrigation</span> in attached jars. The <span class="highlight">device</span> appears to have evolved no later than the fifth <span class="highlight">century</span> B.C., perhaps independently in different regions of the Middle and Far East.</p><p>The earliest waterpower mills were probably vertical-axis mills for grinding corn, known as Norse or Greek mills, which <span class="highlight">seem</span> to have appeared during the first or <span class="highlight">second</span><span class="highlight">century</span> B.C. in the Middle East and a few centuries later in <span class="highlight">Scandinavia</span>. In the following centuries, increasingly <span class="highlight">sophisticated</span> waterpower mills were built <span class="highlight">throughout</span> the Roman <span class="highlight">Empire</span> and beyond its boundaries in the Middle East and northern Europe. In England, the Saxons are thought to have used both horizontal and vertical-axis wheels. The first documented English <span class="highlight">mill</span> was in the eighth <span class="highlight">century</span>, but three centuries later about 5,000 were recorded, suggesting that every <span class="highlight">settlement</span> of any size had its <span class="highlight">mill</span>.</p><p>Raising water and grinding corn were by no means the only uses of the waterpower <span class="highlight">mill</span>, and during the following centuries, <span class="question4">the <span class="highlight">application</span> of waterpower</span> kept pace with the developing 
technologies of <span class="highlight">mining</span>, iron working, paper making, and the wool and cotton industries. Water was the main <span class="highlight">source</span> of <span class="highlight">mechanical</span> power, and by the end of the seventeenth <span class="highlight">century</span>, 
England alone is thought to have had some 20,000 working <span class="highlight">mill</span>. There was much <span class="highlight">debate</span> on the <span class="highlight">relative</span> efficiencies of different types of waterwheels. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>The period from about 1650 until 1800 saw some 
excellent <span class="highlight">scientific</span> and <span class="highlight">technical</span> investigations of different designs. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>They revealed <span class="highlight">output</span> powers ranging from about 1 horsepower to perhaps 60 for the largest wheels and confirmed that for 
<span class="highlight">maximum</span><span class="highlight">efficiency</span>, the water should pass <span class="highlight">across</span> the blades as <span class="highlight">smoothly</span> as possible and fall away with <span class="highlight">minimum</span> speed, having <span class="highlight">given</span> up almost all of its <span class="highlight">kinetic</span> energy.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>(They also proved that, in <span class="highlight">principle</span>, the overshot wheel, a type of wheel in which an overhead <span class="highlight">stream</span> of water powers the wheel, should win the <span class="highlight">efficiency</span> competition.) <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p><p>But then steam power entered the <span class="highlight">scene</span>, putting the whole future of waterpower in <span class="highlight">doubt</span>. An energy <span class="highlight">analyst</span> writing in the year 1800 would have painted a very <span class="highlight"><span class="question6">pessimistic</span></span> picture of the future for waterpower. The coal-fired steam <span class="highlight">engine</span> was taking over, and the waterwheel was fast becoming <span class="highlight">obsolete</span>. However, like many later experts, this one would have suffered from an inability to see into the future. A <span class="highlight">century</span> later the picture was completely different: <span class="question7">by then</span>, the world had an electric <span class="highlight">industry</span>, and a quarter of its generating <span class="highlight">capacity</span> was water powered.</p><p><span class="question9">The growth of the electric-power <span class="highlight">industry</span> was the result of a <span class="highlight">remarkable</span><span class="highlight">series</span> of <span class="highlight">scientific</span> discoveries and <span class="highlight">development</span> in electrotechnology during the nineteenth <span class="highlight">century</span>, but <span class="highlight">significant</span> changes in what we might now call hydro (water) technology also played their part.</span> In 1832, the year of Michael Faraday's discovery that a changing <span class="highlight">magnetic</span><span class="highlight">field</span> produces an electric <span class="highlight">field</span>, a young French engineer patented a new and more <span class="highlight">efficient</span> waterwheel. His name was Benoit Fourneyron, and his <span class="highlight">device</span> was the first successful water <span class="highlight">turbine</span>. The waterwheel, <span class="question10">unaltered</span> for nearly 2,000 years, had finally been superseded.</p><p>Half a <span class="highlight">century</span> of <span class="highlight">development</span> was needed before Faraday's discoveries in <span class="highlight">electricity</span> were translated into full-scale power stations. In 1881 the Godalming power <span class="highlight">station</span> in Surrey, England, on the banks of the Wey River, created the world's first public <span class="highlight">electricity</span><span class="highlight">supply</span>. The power <span class="highlight">source</span> of this most modern technology was a <span class="highlight">traditional</span> waterwheel. <span class="highlight">Unfortunately</span> this early plant experienced the problem <span class="highlight">common</span> to many forms of renewable energy: the flow in the Wey River was unreliable, and the waterwheel was soon replaced by a steam <span class="highlight">engine</span>.</p><p>From this <span class="highlight">primitive</span> start, the electric <span class="highlight">industry</span> grew during the final 20 years of the nineteenth <span class="highlight">century</span> at a <span class="highlight">rate</span> seldom if ever exceeded by any technology. The <span class="highlight">capacity</span> of <span class="highlight">individual</span> power stations, many of them hydro plants, rose from a few kilowatts to over a megawatt in less than a <span class="highlight">decade</span>.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">harnessed</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. known</p><p>B. depended on</p><p>C. recognized</p><p>D. utilized</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D harness: use, governance. Corresponds to the D option utilize (use, use). The word "Moving water was one of the earliest energy sources to be harnessed to reduce the workload of people and animals." The word to, "table" or "action" appeared after the word. The whole sentence means that water is used to reduce people and animals. Labor. So it is easy to put the word harneesed in the text to be used. So choose D.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>In paragraph 1, uncertainty is expressed about all of the following aspects of the early development of waterpower EXCEPT</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. when exactly the very first waterpower devices were invented</p><p>B. when exactly the very first waterpower devices were developed</p><p>C. whether water was one of the earliest sources of power to be used by humans</p><p>D. whether the very earliest waterpower devices arose independently</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The C option uses first waterpower devices to locate the second sentence: No one knows exactly when the waterwheel was invented... This sentence says no on knows, correct, not selected. The where and where the last sentence in the B option echoes: The device appears to have evolved no later than the fifth century B.C., perhaps independently in different regions of the Middle and Far East. B is correct, not selected. C's earlist is set to the first sentence: Moving water was one of the earliest energy sources. The description of this fact is affirmative. C is the answer to be selected D option with arose independently corresponds to the last sentence of this paragraph: ...perhaps independently in different regions of the Middle and Far East. Which perhaps shows that this thing is not certain. So D is not selected.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 2, what was true of the waterpower mills built throughout the Roman Empire?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Most had horizontal-axis wheels</p><p>B. Their design was based on mills that had long been used in Scandinavia</p><p>C. Their design was more popular beyond the Empire's boundaries than it was within the Empire.</p><p>D. They are more advanced than the mills used in the Middle East at an earlier time.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D According to Throughout the roman empire, In the following centuries, increasingly sophisticated waterpower mills were constructed throughout the Roman Empire and beyond its boundaries in the Middle East and northern Europe. Corresponding to the original text, the modification of the waterpower mill is increasingly sophisticated. More complicated and more advanced. So choose D. The contradiction between the A option and the original text, the original text said that the earliest is vertical, but in the Saxons of the United Kingdom, there are vertical and horizontal; the B option is not consistent with the original; the D more popular of this option is not reflected in the original.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The phrase "<span class="highlight">the application of waterpower</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. the uses to which waterpower was put</p><p>B. the improvement made to waterpower</p><p>C. the method by which waterpower was supplied</p><p>D. the source of waterpower available</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="the application of waterpower A"><p>A application: Application. The application here refers to the application of hydraulic resources, that is, the role. So choose A, the usefulness of water. Corresponding to the original Raising water and grinding corn were by no means the only uses of the waterpower mill, and during the next centuries, the applications of waterpower kept pace with the developing technologies of mining, iron working, paper making, and the wool and cotton industries Looking at the context, the first half of the sentence says that lifting and grinding grain is not the only aspect of using water, while the lower half of the sentence must emphasize that there are other applications, so it is well speculated. A is most suitable.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 3, which of the following was discovered as a result of scientific and technical investigations of waterpower conducted between 1650 and 1800?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Some types of small waterwheel can produce as much horsepower as the very largest wheels.</p><p>B. Waterwheels operate more efficiently when water falls away from their blades slowly than when water falls away quickly.</p><p>C. Waterwheel efficiency can be improved by increasing the amount of kinetic energy water contains as it passes over a waterwheel's blades.</p><p>D. Unlike other types of waterwheels, the overshot wheel is capable of producing more than 60 horsepower units of energy.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B Positioned through the scientific and technical investigation to the first sentence, the latter sentence is the result of the survey, the original said output power from 1-60 horsepower, the smoother the water, the slower the fall, the higher the efficiency. Therefore, the A option was not mentioned in the original. The B option is correct. C. The kinetic energy of water contain cannot be changed, but it is necessary to release the kinetic energy it contains. D mentioned overshot wheel, corresponding to the last sentence of this paragraph. However, the original did not say that such a wheel could output more than 60 horsepower.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question6">pessimistic</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. negative</p><p>B. unlikely</p><p>C. surprising</p><p>D. incomplete</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" A"><p>A <span class="question6">pessimistic</span>: Pessimistic. Is the opposite of optimistic. Corresponds to the negative (negative, negative) of the A option. According to the previous sentence, after having steam power, the hydraulic resources were put in doubt. Therefore, the prospect of future use of modified hydraulic resources must be a negative word. So choose A, negative. B is not similar, C is surprising, and D is incomplete.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The term "<span class="highlight"><span class="question7">by then</span></span>" in the passage refers to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. by the time steam power entered the scene</p><p>B. by the year 1800</p><p>C. by the year 1900</p><p>D. by the time waterwheel was becoming obsolete</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" C"><p>C As mentioned earlier in 1800, the use of hydraulic resources declined, and then the first half of the sentence said a century later, so it should be a hundred years later, that is, in 1900.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, why did waterpower become more importantly by 1900?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Better waterwheel designs improved the efficiency of waterpower.</p><p>B. Waterpower was needed to operate steam engines.</p><p>C. Waterpower was used to generate electricity.</p><p>D. Waterwheels became more efficient than coal-powered engines.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C The first half of this paragraph said that steam replaced water conservancy, and water conservancy was at a disadvantage. However, it turned from However here and later said that major changes in water conservancy energy have promoted the development of electricity. So meet the C option. The other three options are not mentioned in the original text.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The growth of the electric-power industry stimulated significant changes in hydro technology and scientific progress in electrotechnology in the nineteenth century.</p><p>B. The changes in hydro technology that led to the growth of the electric-power industry also led to discoveries and developments in electrotechnology in the nineteenth century.</p><p>C. Advances in electrotechnology in the nineteenth century and changes in hydro technology were responsible for the growth of the electric-power industry.</p><p>D. In the nineteenth century, the scientific study of electrotechnology and hydro technology benefited greatly from the growth of the electric-power industry.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The logical relationship of the C source sentence is that electrotechnology and changes in water growth jointly promote the electric power industry. A logical relationship completely reversed. B is confusing. D is similar to A logic. So choose C.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question10">unaltered</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. unimproved</p><p>B. unequaled</p><p>C. unchanged</p><p>D. unsatisfactory</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" C"><p>C <span class="question10">unaltered</span>: Immutable. The corresponding C option is unchanged. Corresponding to the original waterwheel, <span class="question10">unaltered</span> for nearly 2,000 years, had finally been supersedled. It can be judged by the context, as mentioned above, Benoit invented the water tubine, and this sentence said that the waterwheel was replaced by (superseded), so to speculate <span class="question10">unaltered</span> here. Which is closer to which option. A is an confusing option. It is the easiest choice to misplace, but there is still an interesting gap between immutable and no progress.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The discussion of the history of electric power production in paragraph 5 supports which of the following?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. 1832 marked the beginning of the industrial production of electric power.</p><p>B.

Practical advances in hydro technology were more important to the development of electric power than were advances in the theoretical understanding of electricity.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B is not particularly well-targeted and needs to be read through. The article just said hydro technology also played a role in the power industry, and then said that benoit invented the water turbine. This hydro technology plays a role in the power industry, which can be used to generate electricity. Correspond to B option. There is no mention of the original A option; the C option contradicts the original and does not say that Benoit is going to get a patent; the D option of more imporant is not reflected in the original.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 6, what problem did the early power station in the town of Godalming in Surrey, United Kingdom, face in providing electricity?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The traditional waterwheel is used was not large enough to meet the demand for energy.</p><p>B. The flow of the River Wey, on which the power station depended, was unreliable.</p><p>C. The operators of the Godalming power station had little experience with hydro technology.</p><p>D. The steam engine that turned the waterwheel was faulty and needed to be replaced.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B Positioning with Godalming. After reading the book, there is an unfortunately turning point, which is to say the problem encountered: Unfortunately this early plant experienced the problem common to many forms of renewable energy: the flow in the Wey River was unreliable, and the waterwheel was soon replaced By a steam engine. Said the water is not very stable, unreliable. So choose B.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Happily, serious studies began to be conducted to help resolve disagreements..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A The sentence to be inserted says resolve disagreement.
