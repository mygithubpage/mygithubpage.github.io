There were pieces I like more than others, but I think you want our comments to be a little more...I don't know, analytical. Right? </p><p><span class="time" data-times="11.59" data-time="53.65">[00:53.65]</span>Professor: Well, whether you like a piece or not is important, but you should be able to explain why you like a <span class="highlight">particular</span> piece and be able to talk about its historical and <span class="highlight">musical</span><span class="highlight">context</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.53" data-time="65.24">[01:05.24]</span>Actually, the listening <span class="highlight">journal</span> is a tool to help you listen to music actively, to think about what you are hearing. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.83" data-time="72.77">[01:12.77]</span>Student: Maybe I am finding it difficult because I am not real <span class="highlight">familiar</span> with most of the music you assigned.<span class="time" data-times="2.88" data-time="77.6">[01:17.60]</span> I mean, if it's hip-hop or something I listen to with my friends... </p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.08" data-time="80.48">[01:20.48]</span>Professor: Sure, because hip-hop is a form that's <span class="highlight">familiar</span> and <span class="highlight">meaningful</span> to you. <span class="time" data-times="8.12" data-time="84.56">[01:24.56]</span>But you'll see as the <span class="highlight">semester</span> progresses and you start learning more about <span class="highlight">musical</span> forms, you'll become a more <span class="highlight">adept</span> listener. <span class="time" data-times="2.09" data-time="92.68">[01:32.68]</span>And you'll start noticing patterns. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.23" data-time="94.77">[01:34.77]</span>Student: OK. So the songs we listened to this week, the ...the Canto? </p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.12" data-time="100">[01:40.00]</span>Professor: The Cante jondo. You remember we said it means "deep song" in Andalusian Spanish? <span class="time" data-times="9.52" data-time="106.12">[01:46.12]</span>Not only because it's sung in a deep <span class="highlight">register</span>, but also because it's a song about deeper or serious matters, certainly not lighthearted. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.08" data-time="115.64">[01:55.64]</span>Student: Really? Hmm...I guess I didn't catch the double meaning. <span class="time" data-times="1.24" data-time="119.72">[01:59.72]</span>That's kind of cool. <span class="time" data-times="12.19" data-time="120.96">[02:00.96]</span>But anyway, <span class="highlight">even</span> with the translations you gave us for the lyrics and everything, I don't know, I could tell it's sad, but I wasn't trying to <span class="highlight">analyze</span> it, from a <span class="highlight">musical</span><span class="highlight">perspective</span> that is. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.71" data-time="133.15">[02:13.15]</span>Professor: OK. So this is what you should do.<span class="time" data-times="6.98" data-time="135.86">[02:15.86]</span> Go back and listen to the song <span class="highlight">selection</span> and this time <span class="highlight">pay</span><span class="highlight">attention</span> to the <span class="highlight">melody</span>, to <span class="highlight">repetition</span>, to the ... </p><p><span class="time" data-times="1.3" data-time="142.84">[02:22.84]</span>Student: There was plenty of that.<span class="time" data-times="2.98" data-time="144.14">[02:24.14]</span>Some parts sounded like the same note played over and over again. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.68" data-time="147.12">[02:27.12]</span>Professor: That's exactly the kind of <span class="highlight">observation</span> you would <span class="highlight">record</span> in a listening <span class="highlight">journal</span>.<span class="time" data-times="8.31" data-time="152.8">[02:32.80]</span>So, <span class="highlight">melody</span><span class="highlight">repetition</span>, <span class="highlight">rhythm</span>, how the piece is structured, as well as your reasons for liking or disliking it. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="1.85" data-time="161.11">[02:41.11]</span>You know what?<span class="time" data-times="5.72" data-time="162.96">[02:42.96]</span> I thought everyone was <span class="highlight">clear</span> about this, but you've just <span class="highlight">given</span> me a great idea. <span class="time" data-times="5.65" data-time="168.68">[02:48.68]</span>I am going to <span class="highlight">draw</span> up a <span class="highlight">list</span> of questions everyone should keep in <span class="highlight">mind</span> when they are writing their journals. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="174.33">[02:54.33]</span>Other students may be having the same problem you are having. </p></p></article></section><div id="question"><div id="question1"><p>Why does the student go to see the professor?</p><label class="my-label"><span>A.
