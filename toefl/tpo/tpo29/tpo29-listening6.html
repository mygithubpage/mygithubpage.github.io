An elevator. <span class="time" data-times="5.52" data-time="151.4">[02:31.40]</span>That's a new idea to most of us, but in fact it's been around for over a <span class="highlight">century</span>. <span class="time" data-times="10.53" data-time="156.92">[02:36.92]</span>If we could power such an elevator with <span class="highlight">solar</span> energy, we could <span class="highlight">simply</span> rise up into <span class="highlight">space</span> for a <span class="highlight">fraction</span> of the <span class="highlight">cost</span> of a <span class="highlight">trip</span> by rocket or <span class="highlight">shuttle</span>. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.23" data-time="167.45">[02:47.45]</span>Student: But wait, elevators don't just rise up. <span class="time" data-times="3.41" data-time="169.68">[02:49.68]</span>It have (sic) to hang on some kind of <span class="highlight">wire</span> or <span class="highlight">track</span> or something. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="8.1" data-time="173.09">[02:53.09]</span>Professor: Uh, true.

To help students understand what is required to launch a satellite.</p><p>B. To describe new materials now being used to explore space.</p><p>C. To describe a potential technology for space exploration.</p><p>D. To show how ideas from science fiction often develop into actual technologies.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Listening is about building a new type of material that can lead to the universe, but this is only an idea. Corresponds to C.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the student mention climbing a ladder?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To demonstrate his familiarity with certain new types of technology.</p><p>B. To make sure he understands the point the professor is making.</p><p>C. To raise an objection to the professor's claims about escape velocity.</p><p>D. To provide a humorous example for the other students' amusement.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>After teaching the misconception of escape velocity, the professor said that as long as the climb may be able to get rid of the shackles of gravitation, the students gave examples of ladders. Note that the student said to the professor at the beginning You mean that... is asking the professor if his understanding is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor imply about using carbon nanotubes in the development of space elevators?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Current technology is good enough to make space elevators even without nanotubes.</p><p>B. We do not yet have the technology to bind nanotubes together in a ribbon.</p><p>C. Nanotube cables would not be rigid enough to support an elevator car.</p><p>D. Nanotubes are the kinds of materials that will be needed if space elevators are ever to be built.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The professor said that most of the materials are not applicable, and the BUT (transit word is the test site)... The benefits of the new materials... Explain that professors believe that the new materials are competent for this task.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor,what is the significance of having a satellite in orbit about 36,000 kilometers above Earth's surface?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. This is the physical limit of the length that a carbon nanotube cable could reach.</p><p>B. A satellite orbiting at this height can remain directly above on location on Earth.</p><p>C. Earth's gravitational field is too weak to hold a satellite in orbit at higher altitudes.</p><p>D. The distance around Earth's equator is approximately 36,000 kilometers.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>That's about how high an object would have to orbiting straight up from the equator to change points directly above the exact same spot on the rotating planet Earth. The professor pointed out that this position is a position that runs synchronously with the Earth's equator.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor mention the writer Arthur C. Clarke?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To use a comment made by Clarke as a way of answering a student's question.</p><p>B. To familiarize students with Clarke's ideas on space engineering.</p><p>C. To cite a prominent opponent of the idea of space elevators.</p><p>D. To point out that Clarke wrote about carbon nanotube technology long before it became a reality.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>When the students asked when they could come true, the professor quoted Clarke's words and said that he would wait until people stopped laughing at the idea for 50 years and then answered the students' questions.

He is enjoying an opportunity to make his students laugh.</p><p>B. He is disappointed that none of his students thought of this idea themselves.</p><p>C.

He has spent a great deal of time researching the idea that he is now presenting.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Prof.: I can see some practical problems. Prof. teaches students to use ladders as an example. It is more feasible to use elevators.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
