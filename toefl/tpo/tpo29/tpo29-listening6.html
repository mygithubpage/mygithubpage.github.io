              <span class="time" data-times="5.9" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in a <span class="underline">structural</span> <span class="underline">engineering</span> class. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.27" data-time="5.9">[00:05.90]</span>Professor: Today let's begin to look at <span class="underline">structural</span> <span class="underline">engineering</span> in the <span class="underline">Space</span> Age.<span class="time" data-times="8.16" data-time="11.17">[00:11.17]</span>Uh, new problems...new possibilities mean we can think in new ways, find <span class="underline">radically</span> different approaches.<span class="time" data-times="11.96" data-time="19.33">[00:19.33]</span>So let's <span class="underline">consider</span>...uh, well, what would you say is the biggest <span class="underline">obstacle</span> today to putting structures, equipment, people ...uh, anything really, into <span class="underline">space</span>? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.79" data-time="31.29">[00:31.29]</span>Student: Well, the <span class="underline">cost</span>, right? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.26" data-time="34.08">[00:34.08]</span>Professor: Exactly. I mean, just taking the <span class="underline">space</span> <span class="underline">shuttle</span> up and back one time is hugely expensive. Uh, why? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.59" data-time="42.34">[00:42.34]</span>Student: I guess a lot of it is for <span class="underline">fuel</span>, right? <span class="time" data-times="2.63" data-time="45.93">[00:45.93]</span>To...to get the rocket going fast enough. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.59" data-time="48.56">[00:48.56]</span>Professor: OK. Fast enough to... </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.08" data-time="51.15">[00:51.15]</span>Student: To <span class="underline">escape</span> Earth's <span class="underline">gravity</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.14" data-time="54.23">[00:54.23]</span>Professor: Good. So we are burning up an <span class="underline">enormous</span> <span class="underline">amount</span> of <span class="underline">fuel</span> at every <span class="underline">launch</span> just to get the rocket up to what's known as <span class="underline">escape</span> <span class="underline">velocity</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.2" data-time="64.37">[01:04.37]</span>Now, <span class="underline">escape</span> <span class="underline">velocity</span> is around 11 kilometers a <span class="underline">second</span>, <span class="underline">pretty</span> fast. <span class="time" data-times="3.24" data-time="72.57">[01:12.57]</span>But do we really have to go this fast? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.17" data-time="75.81">[01:15.81]</span>Student: Well, yeah. I mean, how else can you, um...<span class="underline">escape</span>? <span class="time" data-times="3.16" data-time="80.98">[01:20.98]</span>I mean, that's the whole point of <span class="underline">escape</span> <span class="underline">velocity</span>, right? <span class="time" data-times="3.34" data-time="84.14">[01:24.14]</span> <span class="underline">Otherwise</span> <span class="underline">gravity</span> will pull you back down to the Earth. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.06" data-time="87.48">[01:27.48]</span>Professor: Actually, that's a <span class="underline">common</span> misconception.<span class="time" data-times="13.26" data-time="90.54">[01:30.54]</span> <span class="underline">Escape</span> <span class="underline">velocity</span> is <span class="underline">simply</span> the speed of an object that's ...uh, let's say, <span class="underline">shot</span> out of a cannon, the <span class="underline">minimum</span> <span class="underline">initial</span> speed so that the object could later <span class="underline">escape</span> Earth's <span class="underline">gravity</span> on its own. <span class="time" data-times="4.79" data-time="103.8">[01:43.80]</span>But that's just if there's no <span class="underline">additional</span> force being applied. <span class="time" data-times="5.14" data-time="108.59">[01:48.59]</span>If you keep on supplying force to the object, keep on pushing it upward. <span class="time" data-times="3.93" data-time="113.73">[01:53.73]</span>It could pull away from Earth's <span class="underline">gravity</span> at any speed. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.8" data-time="117.66">[01:57.66]</span>Student: <span class="underline">Even</span> really slow? <span class="time" data-times="5.75" data-time="120.46">[02:00.46]</span>So you're saying ...like, if you had a ladder tall enough, you could just climb into <span class="underline">space</span>? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.47" data-time="126.21">[02:06.21]</span>Professor: Yeah! Uh, well, <span class="underline">theoretically</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.04" data-time="128.68">[02:08.68]</span>I mean, I can see some <span class="underline">practical</span> problems with the ladder example. <span class="time" data-times="9.57" data-time="132.72">[02:12.72]</span>Uh, like you might get just a little bit tired out after the first few thousand kilometers or so, uh, especially with all the <span class="underline">oxygen</span> tanks you'll have to be hauling up with you. <span class="time" data-times="5.22" data-time="142.29">[02:22.29]</span>No. I was thinking more <span class="underline">along</span> the lines of an elevator. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.5" data-time="147.51">[02:27.51]</span>Student: Wait! You are serious? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.39" data-time="149.01">[02:29.01]</span>Professor: Sure. An elevator. <span class="time" data-times="5.52" data-time="151.4">[02:31.40]</span>That's a new idea to most of us, but in fact it's been around for over a <span class="underline">century</span>. <span class="time" data-times="10.53" data-time="156.92">[02:36.92]</span>If we could power such an elevator with <span class="underline">solar</span> energy, we could <span class="underline">simply</span> rise up into <span class="underline">space</span> for a <span class="underline">fraction</span> of the <span class="underline">cost</span> of a <span class="underline">trip</span> by rocket or <span class="underline">shuttle</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.23" data-time="167.45">[02:47.45]</span>Student: But wait, elevators don't just rise up. <span class="time" data-times="3.41" data-time="169.68">[02:49.68]</span>It have (sic) to hang on some kind of <span class="underline">wire</span> or <span class="underline">track</span> or something. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.1" data-time="173.09">[02:53.09]</span>Professor: Uh, true. And for decades that's exactly what's prevented the idea from being <span class="underline">feasible</span> or <span class="underline">even</span> just taken seriously. <span class="time" data-times="6.24" data-time="181.19">[03:01.19]</span>Where do we find the <span class="underline">material</span> strong enough yet lightweight enough to act as a <span class="underline">cable</span> or <span class="underline">track</span>? <span class="time" data-times="4.16" data-time="187.43">[03:07.43]</span>I mean, we are talking 36,000 kilometers here.<span class="time" data-times="4.03" data-time="191.59">[03:11.59]</span> And the <span class="underline">strain</span> on the <span class="underline">cable</span> would be more than most materials could <span class="underline">bear</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.96" data-time="195.62">[03:15.62]</span>But a new <span class="underline">material</span> developed recently has a tensile strength higher than diamond, yet it's much more <span class="underline">flexible</span>.<span class="time" data-times="3.64" data-time="203.58">[03:23.58]</span> I am talking about <span class="underline">carbon</span> nanotubes. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.71" data-time="207.22">[03:27.22]</span>Student: OK. I've read something about <span class="underline">carbon</span> nanotubes.<span class="time" data-times="4.49" data-time="211.93">[03:31.93]</span> They are strong, alright, but aren't they just very short little cylinders in <span class="underline">shape</span>? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.31" data-time="216.42">[03:36.42]</span>Professor: Ah, yes. But these cylinders <span class="underline">cling</span> together at a molecular <span class="underline">level</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.76" data-time="221.73">[03:41.73]</span>You pull out one nanotube or row of nanotubes, and its neighbor's come with it, and their neighbors, and so on. <span class="time" data-times="11.89" data-time="230.49">[03:50.49]</span>So you could actually <span class="underline">draw</span> out a 36,000-kilometer <span class="underline">strand</span> or <span class="underline">ribbon</span> of nanotubes stronger than <span class="underline">steel</span>, but maybe a thousandth the thickness of a human hair. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.72" data-time="242.38">[04:02.38]</span>Student: OK. Fine. But what's going to hold this <span class="underline">ribbon</span> up and keep it <span class="underline">reach</span> enough to support an elevator car? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.4" data-time="249.1">[04:09.10]</span>Professor: Well, we <span class="underline">definitely</span> have to <span class="underline">anchor</span> it at both ends. <span class="time" data-times="9.8" data-time="252.5">[04:12.50]</span>So what we need is a really tall tower here on the ground right at the <span class="underline">equator</span> and a <span class="underline">satellite</span> in geostationary <span class="underline">orbit</span> around the Earth. <span class="time" data-times="5.43" data-time="262.3">[04:22.30]</span>There's a <span class="underline">reason</span> I mentioned that <span class="underline">figure</span> of 36,000 kilometers. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="11.7" data-time="267.73">[04:27.73]</span>That's about how high an object would have to be orbiting straight up from the <span class="underline">equator</span> to <span class="underline">constantly</span> <span class="underline">remain</span> directly above the <span class="underline">exact</span> same <span class="underline">spot</span> on the rotating <span class="underline">planet</span> Earth. <span class="time" data-times="11.75" data-time="279.43">[04:39.43]</span>So once you are in this geostationary <span class="underline">orbit</span> right over the tower, just <span class="underline">lower</span> your <span class="underline">carbon</span> nanotube <span class="underline">cable</span> down from the <span class="underline">satellite</span>, tether it to the tower here on Earth. <span class="time" data-times="1.89" data-time="291.18">[04:51.18]</span>And there you have it! </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.58" data-time="293.07">[04:53.07]</span>Student: So you really think this is a possibility?<span class="time" data-times="1.9" data-time="296.65">[04:56.65]</span> Like, how soon could it happen? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.72" data-time="298.55">[04:58.55]</span>Professor: Well, the science <span class="underline">fiction</span> writer Arthur C. Clarke talked about building a <span class="underline">space</span> elevator back in the 1970s. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="305.27">[05:05.27]</span>And when someone asked him when he thought this idea might become a reality, his reply was, "Probably about fifty years after everybody quits laughing." </p>
