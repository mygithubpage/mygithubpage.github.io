              <span class="time" data-times="5.86" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in a city planning class.</p>

              <span class="highlight">Female</span> Professor: In the last fifty years or so, many American cities have had difficulty in maintaining a successful <span class="highlight">retail</span> environment. <span class="time" data-times="13.17" data-time="17.34">[00:17.34]</span>Business owners in the city centers or, uh, the <span class="highlight">downtown</span> areas have experienced some <span class="highlight">financial</span> losses because of a <span class="highlight">steady</span> movement of people out of the cities and into the suburbs.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.6" data-time="30.51">[00:30.51]</span>In general, <span class="highlight">downtown</span> areas just don't have that many <span class="highlight">residential</span> areas, uh, not that many people live there. <span class="time" data-times="4.34" data-time="38.11">[00:38.11]</span>So, what if city planners decided to do about it? <span class="time" data-times="10.41" data-time="42.45">[00:42.45]</span>Well, one way they've come up with some ways to <span class="highlight">attract</span> more people to shop <span class="highlight">downtown</span> was by creating pedestrian malls. <span class="time" data-times="5.13" data-time="52.86">[00:52.86]</span>Now what is a pedestrian mall?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.75" data-time="57.99">[00:57.99]</span>It's a <span class="highlight">pretty</span> simple <span class="highlight">concept</span> really. <span class="time" data-times="17.58" data-time="60.74">[01:00.74]</span>It's <span class="highlight">essentially</span>, um, an outdoor shopping area, designed just for people on foot, and, uh, well, unlike many other shopping malls that are built on the suburbs nowadays, these pedestrian malls are typically located in the <span class="highlight">downtown</span> area of the city. <span class="time" data-times="11.07" data-time="78.32">[01:18.32]</span>And there are features like wide sidewalks, comfortable outdoor seating and, uh, maybe <span class="highlight">even</span> fountains and, you know, art.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.97" data-time="89.39">[01:29.39]</span>Uh, there are variations on this model, of <span class="highlight">course</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9.72" data-time="93.36">[01:33.36]</span>But the <span class="highlight">common</span> denominator is always the idea of creating a shopping <span class="highlight">space</span> that would get people to shop in the city without needing their cars. <span class="time" data-times="15.28" data-time="103.08">[01:43.08]</span>So I'm sure you can see how having an area that's off limits to <span class="highlight">automobile</span> traffic would be <span class="highlight">ideal</span> for a heavily populated city, where, well, the streets would <span class="highlight">otherwise</span> be <span class="highlight">bustling</span> with noisy unpleasant traffic <span class="highlight">congestion</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.05" data-time="118.36">[01:58.36]</span>Now, the <span class="highlight">concept</span>, which originated in Europe, was adopted by American city planners in the late 1950s. <span class="time" data-times="8.62" data-time="126.41">[02:06.41]</span>And since then, a number of United States cities have created pedestrian malls and many of them have been highly successful. <span class="time" data-times="5.77" data-time="135.03">[02:15.03]</span>So, what have city planners learned about making these malls succeed?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="13.16" data-time="140.8">[02:20.80]</span>Well, there are two <span class="highlight">critical</span> factors to <span class="highlight">consider</span> when creating a pedestrian mall: location and design, both of which are equally important. <span class="time" data-times="2.28" data-time="153.96">[02:33.96]</span>Now let's start with the location. <span class="time" data-times="19.59" data-time="156.24">[02:36.24]</span>In choosing a <span class="highlight">specific</span> location for a pedestrian mall, there are, in fact, two considerations: <span class="highlight">proximity</span> to <span class="highlight">potential</span> customers (um, that's what we would call customer <span class="highlight">base</span>) and accessibility to public <span class="highlight">transportation</span>, which we'll get to it in just moment.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="13.04" data-time="175.83">[02:55.83]</span>Now, for a customer <span class="highlight">base</span>, uh, the most <span class="highlight">obvious</span> example would be a large office building, since the employees could <span class="highlight">theoretically</span> go shopping after work or during their lunch hour, right? <span class="time" data-times="13.47" data-time="188.87">[03:08.87]</span>Uh, another really good example is a <span class="highlight">convention</span> center, which typically has a hotel and large meeting spaces to <span class="highlight">draw</span> visitors to the city for <span class="highlight">major</span> business conferences and events. <span class="time" data-times="13.42" data-time="202.34">[03:22.34]</span>Um, but ideally, the pedestrian mall would be used by <span class="highlight">local</span> residents, not just people work in the city or visiting the area, so that's where <span class="highlight">access</span> to public <span class="highlight">transportation</span> comes in.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="16.78" data-time="215.76">[03:35.76]</span>Either the designers plan to <span class="highlight">locate</span> the mall near a central <span class="highlight">transportation</span> hub, like a bus <span class="highlight">terminal</span> or a <span class="highlight">major</span> train or <span class="highlight">subway</span> <span class="highlight">station</span>, or they work with city officials to create <span class="highlight">sufficient</span> <span class="highlight">parking</span> areas not too far from the mall, <span class="time" data-times="8.15" data-time="232.54">[03:52.54]</span>which make <span class="highlight">sense</span> because if people can't <span class="highlight">drive</span> into the mall area, well, then they need to have easy <span class="highlight">access</span> to it.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.18" data-time="240.69">[04:00.69]</span>OK, so that's location. <span class="time" data-times="3.03" data-time="244.87">[04:04.87]</span>But what about design? <span class="time" data-times="18.24" data-time="247.9">[04:07.90]</span>Well, design doesn't necessarily include things like sculptures or <span class="highlight">decorative</span> walkways or <span class="highlight">even</span> eye-catching window displays, you know, art, although I'd be the first to <span class="highlight">admit</span> those things are aesthetically <span class="highlight">appealing</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.38" data-time="266.14">[04:26.14]</span>However, visually <span class="highlight">pleasing</span> sights, well, they are not a part of the pedestrian mall design that matter the most.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="23.98" data-time="274.52">[04:34.52]</span>The key <span class="highlight">consideration</span> is a <span class="highlight">compact</span> and <span class="highlight">convenient</span> <span class="highlight">layout</span>, um, one which allows pedestrians to walk from one end of the mall to the other in just a few minutes, so they can get to the <span class="highlight">major</span> stores, restaurants and other central places without having to take more than one or two turns. <span class="time" data-times="3.44" data-time="298.5">[04:58.50]</span>Now this takes careful and <span class="highlight">creative</span> planning. <span class="time" data-times="6.83" data-time="301.94">[05:01.94]</span>But, now, what if one <span class="highlight">ingredient</span> to this planning <span class="highlight">recipe</span> is missing? <span class="time" data-times="4.73" data-time="308.77">[05:08.77]</span>There could quite possibly be long-lasting effects. <span class="time" data-times="7.23" data-time="313.5">[05:13.50]</span>And, uh, I think a good example is the pedestrian mall in Louisville, Kentucky, for <span class="highlight">instance</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.46" data-time="320.73">[05:20.73]</span>Now when the Louisville mall was built, it had lots of <span class="highlight">visual</span> <span class="highlight">appeal</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.98" data-time="326.19">[05:26.19]</span>It was attractively designed, right in a small part of <span class="highlight">downtown</span>, and it <span class="highlight">pretty</span> much possessed all of the other design elements for success. <span class="time" data-times="4.49" data-time="336.17">[05:36.17]</span>But, uh, now here is my point about location comes into play. <span class="time" data-times="11.5" data-time="340.66">[05:40.66]</span>There wasn't a <span class="highlight">convention</span> center around to help drawing visitors and, uh, the only nearby hotel <span class="highlight">eventually</span> closed down for that same <span class="highlight">reason</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.93" data-time="352.16">[05:52.16]</span>Well, you can imagine how this must affected <span class="highlight">local</span> pedestrian mall business owners, <span class="highlight">sort</span> of what we called a "<span class="highlight">chain</span> <span class="highlight">reaction</span>". <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="361.09">[06:01.09]</span>It wasn't until a <span class="highlight">convention</span> center and a <span class="highlight">parking</span> garage were built about a <span class="highlight">decade</span> later that the mall started to be successful.</p>
