<span class="time" data-times="10.41" data-time="42.45">[00:42.45]</span>Well, one way they've come up with some ways to <span class="highlight">attract</span> more people to shop <span class="highlight">downtown</span> was by creating pedestrian malls. <span class="time" data-times="5.13" data-time="52.86">[00:52.86]</span>Now what is a pedestrian mall?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.75" data-time="57.99">[00:57.99]</span>It's a <span class="highlight">pretty</span> simple <span class="highlight">concept</span> really. <span class="time" data-times="17.58" data-time="60.74">[01:00.74]</span>It's <span class="highlight">essentially</span>, um, an outdoor shopping area, designed just for people on foot, and, uh, well, unlike many other shopping malls that are built on the suburbs nowadays, these pedestrian malls are typically located in the <span class="highlight">downtown</span> area of the city. <span class="time" data-times="11.07" data-time="78.32">[01:18.32]</span>And there are features like wide sidewalks, comfortable outdoor seating and, uh, maybe <span class="highlight">even</span> fountains and, you know, art.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.97" data-time="89.39">[01:29.39]</span>Uh, there are variations on this model, of <span class="highlight">course</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9.72" data-time="93.36">[01:33.36]</span>But the <span class="highlight">common</span> denominator is always the idea of creating a shopping <span class="highlight">space</span> that would get people to shop in the city without needing their cars. <span class="time" data-times="15.28" data-time="103.08">[01:43.08]</span>So I'm sure you can see how having an area that's off limits to <span class="highlight">automobile</span> traffic would be <span class="highlight">ideal</span> for a heavily populated city, where, well, the streets would <span class="highlight">otherwise</span> be <span class="highlight">bustling</span> with noisy unpleasant traffic <span class="highlight">congestion</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="8.05" data-time="118.36">[01:58.36]</span>Now, the <span class="highlight">concept</span>, which originated in Europe, was adopted by American city planners in the late 1950s. <span class="time" data-times="8.62" data-time="126.41">[02:06.41]</span>And since then, a number of United States cities have created pedestrian malls and many of them have been highly successful. <span class="time" data-times="5.77" data-time="135.03">[02:15.03]</span>So, what have city planners learned about making these malls succeed?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="13.16" data-time="140.8">[02:20.80]</span>Well, there are two <span class="highlight">critical</span> factors to <span class="highlight">consider</span> when creating a pedestrian mall: location and design, both of which are equally important. <span class="time" data-times="2.28" data-time="153.96">[02:33.96]</span>Now let's start with the location. <span class="time" data-times="19.59" data-time="156.24">[02:36.24]</span>In choosing a <span class="highlight">specific</span> location for a pedestrian mall, there are, in fact, two considerations: <span class="highlight">proximity</span> to <span class="highlight">potential</span> customers (um, that's what we would call customer <span class="highlight">base</span>) and accessibility to public <span class="highlight">transportation</span>, which we'll get to it in just moment.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="13.04" data-time="175.83">[02:55.83]</span>Now, for a customer <span class="highlight">base</span>, uh, the most <span class="highlight">obvious</span> example would be a large office building, since the employees could <span class="highlight">theoretically</span> go shopping after work or during their lunch hour, right? <span class="time" data-times="13.47" data-time="188.87">[03:08.87]</span>Uh, another really good example is a <span class="highlight">convention</span> center, which typically has a hotel and large meeting spaces to <span class="highlight">draw</span> visitors to the city for <span class="highlight">major</span> business conferences and events. <span class="time" data-times="13.42" data-time="202.34">[03:22.34]</span>Um, but ideally, the pedestrian mall would be used by <span class="highlight">local</span> residents, not just people work in the city or visiting the area, so that's where <span class="highlight">access</span> to public <span class="highlight">transportation</span> comes in.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="16.78" data-time="215.76">[03:35.76]</span>Either the designers plan to <span class="highlight">locate</span> the mall near a central <span class="highlight">transportation</span> hub, like a bus <span class="highlight">terminal</span> or a <span class="highlight">major</span> train or <span class="highlight">subway</span><span class="highlight">station</span>, or they work with city officials to create <span class="highlight">sufficient</span><span class="highlight">parking</span> areas not too far from the mall, <span class="time" data-times="8.15" data-time="232.54">[03:52.54]</span>which make <span class="highlight">sense</span> because if people can't <span class="highlight">drive</span> into the mall area, well, then they need to have easy <span class="highlight">access</span> to it.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.18" data-time="240.69">[04:00.69]</span>OK, so that's location. <span class="time" data-times="3.03" data-time="244.87">[04:04.87]</span>But what about design? <span class="time" data-times="18.24" data-time="247.9">[04:07.90]</span>Well, design doesn't necessarily include things like sculptures or <span class="highlight">decorative</span> walkways or <span class="highlight">even</span> eye-catching window displays, you know, art, although I'd be the first to <span class="highlight">admit</span> those things are aesthetically <span class="highlight">appealing</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.38" data-time="266.14">[04:26.14]</span>However, visually <span class="highlight">pleasing</span> sights, well, they are not a part of the pedestrian mall design that matter the most.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="23.98" data-time="274.52">[04:34.52]</span>The key <span class="highlight">consideration</span> is a <span class="highlight">compact</span> and <span class="highlight">convenient</span><span class="highlight">layout</span>, um, one which allows pedestrians to walk from one end of the mall to the other in just a few minutes, so they can get to the <span class="highlight">major</span> stores, restaurants and other central places without having to take more than one or two turns. <span class="time" data-times="3.44" data-time="298.5">[04:58.50]</span>Now this takes careful and <span class="highlight">creative</span> planning. <span class="time" data-times="6.83" data-time="301.94">[05:01.94]</span>But, now, what if one <span class="highlight">ingredient</span> to this planning <span class="highlight">recipe</span> is missing? <span class="time" data-times="4.73" data-time="308.77">[05:08.77]</span>There could quite possibly be long-lasting effects. <span class="time" data-times="7.23" data-time="313.5">[05:13.50]</span>And, uh, I think a good example is the pedestrian mall in Louisville, Kentucky, for <span class="highlight">instance</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.46" data-time="320.73">[05:20.73]</span>Now when the Louisville mall was built, it had lots of <span class="highlight">visual</span><span class="highlight">appeal</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="9.98" data-time="326.19">[05:26.19]</span>It was attractively designed, right in a small part of <span class="highlight">downtown</span>, and it <span class="highlight">pretty</span> much possessed all of the other design elements for success. <span class="time" data-times="4.49" data-time="336.17">[05:36.17]</span>But, uh, now here is my point about location comes into play. <span class="time" data-times="11.5" data-time="340.66">[05:40.66]</span>There wasn't a <span class="highlight">convention</span> center around to help drawing visitors and, uh, the only nearby hotel <span class="highlight">eventually</span> closed down for that same <span class="highlight">reason</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.93" data-time="352.16">[05:52.16]</span>Well, you can imagine how this must affected <span class="highlight">local</span> pedestrian mall business owners, <span class="highlight">sort</span> of what we called a "<span class="highlight">chain</span><span class="highlight">reaction</span>". <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="361.09">[06:01.09]</span>It wasn't until a <span class="highlight">convention</span> center and a <span class="highlight">parking</span> garage were built about a <span class="highlight">decade</span> later that the mall started to be successful.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the main topic of the lecture?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. How the first pedestrian mall was developed</p><p>B. How pedestrian malls have affected business in America</p><p>C. Key considerations in creating a pedestrian mall</p><p>D. Ways that cities can better use pedestrian malls</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The whole article talks about the success factors of a pedestrian street, including location and design, so choose the C option.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor,what is the basic reason for building pedestrian malls in the city center?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To increase retail activity in the area</p><p>B. To reduce the noise made by automobile traffic</p><p>C. To increase shopping conveniences for city residents</p><p>D. To encourage people to move from the suburbs back into the city center</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>Many American cities have had difficulties in maintaining a successful retail environment.</p><p>The professor mentioned at the beginning of the lecture that the business environment in the urban centers of the United States has been poor for the past 15 years, resulting in a lot of economic losses. In order to improve this problem, a pedestrian street was built, so the answer is A. The D option is not optional. Logically speaking, due to the relocation of residents in the downtown area, the downtown business environment is not good. In order to solve this problem, a pedestrian street was established. Therefore, the fundamental reason for the establishment of a pedestrian street is actually to make money, not to allow the displaced residents to return to the city center.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>What are two aspects of location that need to be considered when planning a pedestrian mall?Click on 2 answers.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The proximity to the customer base</p><p>B. The number of nearby tourist sites</p><p>C. The variety of restaurants in the area</p><p>D. The access to public transportation</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="AD"><p>Proximity to potential customers, um...that's we'd call a customer base and accessibility to public transportation which we will get to in just a moment (A option)</p><p>So that's where access to public transportation comes in, either ...um...either the designers plan to locate the mall near a central transportation hub, like a bus terminal, a major train or subway station or they work with city officials to Create sufficient parking areas, not too far from the mall, (D option)</p><p>There are two main considerations in building a pedestrian street: location and design. There are two main considerations regarding the location: the distance from the customer's residence, and the convenience of public transportation, so choose AD.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor explain the design of a pedestrian mall?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To illustrate its importance to the success of a pedestrian mall</p><p>B. To explain why pedestrian malls are so appealing to the shoppers</p><p>C. To point out how a pedestrian mall looks different from other malls</p><p>D. To show how the design is more important than the location</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>Location and design are two important factors in the construction of a pedestrian street. The professor explained the design of the pedestrian street in order to emphasize its importance. So choose A. There is no comparison between the pedestrian street and other types of shopping centers, so C is wrong. Nor does it say how walking street attracts customers and B is wrong. The professor also did not compare the importance of two factors. D was wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor mention the Louisville,Kentucky pedestrian mall?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To discuss her favorite pedestrian mall to visit</p><p>B. To illustrate how a pedestrian mall can overcome financial difficulties</p><p>C. To give an example of a typical,American pedestrian mall</p><p>D. To show how poor planning can affect the success of a pedestrian mall</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>But now what if one ingredient to this planning recipe is missing? There could be quite possibly be long-lasting effects. And I think a good example is the pedestrian mall in the Louisville Kentucky for instance.</p><p>The example is to support the point of view. Before mentioning LK, the professor mentioned that the lack of important design elements will affect the success of the pedestrian street, so choose D.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor mean when she says this?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Art is of little importance in designing a pedestrian mall.</p><p>B. There should be a wide variety of art on display in pedestrian malls.</p><p>C. Art is a key feature in the designing of a pedestrian mall.</p><p>D. Most pedestrian mall designers do not like art as much as she does.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>Well, design doesn't include include things like sculptures or decorative walkways or...or even eye catching window displays, you know art. Although I bet the first to admen those things are aesthetically appealing</p><p>The sentence of hard of hearing indicates that ART is not important in the construction of the pedestrian street. The turning sentence is only for the professor to admit that ART does have aesthetics, but he did not recognize the importance of ART in the construction of the pedestrian street. Therefore, he chose A.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
