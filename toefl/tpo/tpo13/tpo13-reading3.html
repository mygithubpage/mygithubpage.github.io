            <b>Methods of Studying Infant Perception</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>In the study of <span class="underline">perceptual</span> abilities of infants, a number of techniques are used to <span class="underline">determine</span> infants' responses to various stimuli. Because they cannot verbalize or fill out questionnaires, indirect techniques of naturalistic <span class="underline">observation</span> are used as the <span class="underline">primary</span> means of determining what infants can see, hear, feel, and so forth. Each of these methods compares an <span class="underline">infant</span>'s <span class="underline">state</span> <span class="underline">prior</span> to the <span class="underline">introduction</span> of a <span class="underline">stimulus</span> with its <span class="underline">state</span> during or immediately following the <span class="underline">stimulus</span>. The <span class="underline">difference</span> between the two measures provides the researcher with an <span class="underline">indication</span> of the <span class="underline">level</span> and <span class="underline">duration</span> of the <span class="underline">response</span> to the <span class="underline">stimulus</span>. For example, if a <span class="underline">uniformly</span> moving <span class="underline">pattern</span> of some <span class="underline">sort</span> is passed <span class="underline">across</span> the <span class="underline">visual</span> <span class="underline">field</span> of a neonate (newborn), <span class="underline">repetitive</span> following movements of the eye <span class="underline">occur</span>. The <span class="underline">occurrence</span> of these eye movements provides <span class="underline">evidence</span> that the moving <span class="underline">pattern</span> is perceived at some <span class="underline">level</span> by the newborn. Similarly, changes in the <span class="underline">infant</span>'s general <span class="underline">level</span> of <span class="underline">motor</span> <span class="underline">activity</span> -turning the head, blinking the eyes, crying, and so forth - have been used by researchers as <span class="underline">visual</span> indicators of the <span class="underline">infant</span>'s <span class="underline">perceptual</span> abilities.</p>
          <p>Such techniques, however, have limitations. First, the <span class="underline">observation</span> may be unreliable in that two or more observers may not agree that the <span class="underline">particular</span> <span class="underline">response</span> occurred, or to what <span class="underline">degree</span> it occurred. <span class="underline">Second</span>, responses are difficult to <span class="underline">quantify</span>. Often the rapid and <span class="underline">diffuse</span> movements of the <span class="underline">infant</span> make it difficult to get an <span class="underline">accurate</span> <span class="underline">record</span> of the number of responses. The third, and most <span class="underline">potent</span>, <span class="underline">limitation</span> is that it is not possible to be certain that the <span class="underline">infant</span>'s <span class="underline">response</span> was <span class="underline">due</span> to the <span class="underline">stimulus</span> presented or to a change from no <span class="underline">stimulus</span> to a <span class="underline">stimulus</span>. The <span class="underline">infant</span> may be responding to aspects of the <span class="underline">stimulus</span> different than those identified by the investigator. <span class="underline">Therefore</span>, when observational assessment is used as a <span class="underline">technique</span> for studying <span class="underline">infant</span> <span class="underline">perceptual</span> abilities, <span class="underline">care</span> must be taken not to overgeneralize from the <span class="underline">data</span> or to <span class="underline">rely</span> on one or two studies as <span class="underline">conclusive</span> <span class="underline">evidence</span> of a <span class="underline">particular</span> <span class="underline">perceptual</span> <span class="underline">ability</span> of the <span class="underline">infant</span>.</p>
          <p>Observational assessment techniques have become much more <span class="underline">sophisticated</span>, reducing the limitations just presented. <span class="underline">Film</span> <span class="underline">analysis</span> of the <span class="underline">infant</span>'s responses, 
heart and <span class="underline">respiration</span> <span class="underline">rate</span> monitors, and nonnutritive sucking devices are used as <span class="underline">effective</span> tools in understanding <span class="underline">infant</span> <span class="underline">perception</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> <span class="underline">Film</span> <span class="underline">analysis</span> permits researchers to 
carefully study the <span class="underline">infant</span>'s responses over and over and in slow <span class="underline">motion</span>.  <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> <span class="underline">Precise</span> measurements can be made of the length and <span class="underline">frequency</span> of the <span class="underline">infant</span>'s <span class="underline">attention</span> between two stimuli. 
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>Heart and <span class="underline">respiration</span> monitors provide the investigator with the number of heartbeats or breaths taken when a new <span class="underline">stimulus</span> is presented. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>Numerical increases are used as quantifiable indicators of heightened <span class="underline">interest</span> in the new <span class="underline">stimulus</span>. Increases in nonnutritive sucking were first used as an assessment <span class="underline">measure</span> by researchers in 1969. They devised an <span class="underline">apparatus</span> that 
connected a baby's pacifier to a counting <span class="underline">device</span>. As stimuli were presented, changes in the <span class="underline">infant</span>'s sucking <span class="underline">behavior</span> were recorded. Increases in the number of sucks were used as an
indicator of the <span class="underline">infant</span>'s <span class="underline">attention</span> to or <span class="underline">preference</span> for a <span class="underline">given</span> <span class="underline">visual</span> <span class="underline">display</span>.</p>
          <p>Two <span class="underline">additional</span> techniques of studying <span class="underline">infant</span> <span class="underline">perception</span> have come into vogue. The first is the habituation-dishabituation <span class="underline">technique</span>, in which a single <span class="underline">stimulus</span> is presented repeatedly to the <span class="underline">infant</span> until there is a measurable <span class="underline">decline</span> (habituation) in whatever attending <span class="underline">behavior</span> is being observed. At that point a new <span class="underline">stimulus</span> is presented, and any recovery (dishabituation) in responsiveness is recorded. If the <span class="underline">infant</span> fails to dishabituate and continues to show habituation with the new <span class="underline">stimulus</span>, it is assumed that the baby is unable to <span class="underline">perceive</span> the new <span class="underline">stimulus</span> as different. The habituation-dishabituation paradigm has been used most extensively with studies of <span class="underline">auditory</span> and <span class="underline">olfactory</span> <span class="underline">perception</span> in infants. The <span class="underline">second</span> <span class="underline">technique</span> relies on evoked potentials, which are electrical brain responses that may be related to a <span class="underline">particular</span> <span class="underline">stimulus</span> because of where they <span class="underline">originate</span>. Changes in the electrical <span class="underline">pattern</span> of the brain <span class="underline">indicate</span> that the <span class="underline">stimulus</span> is getting <span class="underline">through</span> to the <span class="underline">infant</span>'s central nervous system and eliciting some form of <span class="underline">response</span>.</p>
          <p>Each of the preceding techniques provides the researcher with <span class="underline">evidence</span> that the <span class="underline">infant</span> can <span class="underline">detect</span> or <span class="underline">discriminate</span> between stimuli. With these <span class="underline">sophisticated</span> observational assessment and electro-physiological measures, we know that the neonate of only a few days is far more <span class="underline">perceptive</span> than <span class="underline">previously</span> suspected. However, these measures are only "indirect" indicators of the <span class="underline">infant</span>'s <span class="underline">perceptual</span> abilities.</p>
