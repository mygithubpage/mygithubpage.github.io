Because they cannot verbalize or fill out questionnaires, indirect techniques of naturalistic <span class="highlight">observation</span> are used as the <span class="highlight">primary</span> means of determining what infants can see, hear, feel, and so forth. Each of these methods compares an <span class="highlight">infant</span>'s <span class="highlight">state</span><span class="highlight">prior</span> to the <span class="highlight">introduction</span> of a <span class="highlight">stimulus</span> with its <span class="highlight">state</span> during or immediately following the <span class="highlight">stimulus</span>. The <span class="highlight">difference</span> between the two measures provides the researcher with an <span class="highlight">indication</span> of the <span class="highlight">level</span> and <span class="highlight">duration</span> of the <span class="highlight">response</span> to the <span class="highlight">stimulus</span>. For example, if a <span class="highlight"><span class="question2">uniformly</span></span> moving <span class="highlight">pattern</span> of some <span class="highlight">sort</span> is passed <span class="highlight">across</span> the <span class="highlight">visual</span><span class="highlight">field</span> of a neonate (newborn), <span class="question3"><span class="highlight">repetitive</span> following movements of the eye</span><span class="highlight">occur</span>. The <span class="highlight">occurrence</span> of these eye movements provides <span class="highlight">evidence</span> that the moving <span class="highlight">pattern</span> is perceived at some <span class="highlight">level</span> by the newborn. Similarly, changes in the <span class="highlight">infant</span>'s general <span class="highlight">level</span> of <span class="highlight">motor</span><span class="highlight">activity</span> -turning the head, blinking the eyes, crying, and so forth - have been used by researchers as <span class="highlight">visual</span> indicators of the <span class="highlight">infant</span>'s <span class="highlight">perceptual</span> abilities.</p><p>Such techniques, however, have limitations. First, the <span class="highlight">observation</span> may be unreliable in that two or more observers may not agree that the <span class="highlight">particular</span><span class="highlight">response</span> occurred, or to what <span class="highlight">degree</span> it occurred. <span class="highlight">Second</span>, responses are difficult to <span class="highlight">quantify</span>. Often the rapid and <span class="highlight">diffuse</span> movements of the <span class="highlight">infant</span> make it difficult to get an <span class="highlight">accurate</span><span class="highlight">record</span> of the number of responses. The third, and most <span class="highlight"><span class="question5">potent</span></span>, <span class="highlight">limitation</span> is that it is not possible to be certain that the <span class="highlight">infant</span>'s <span class="highlight">response</span> was <span class="highlight">due</span> to the <span class="highlight">stimulus</span> presented or to a change from no <span class="highlight">stimulus</span> to a <span class="highlight">stimulus</span>. The <span class="highlight">infant</span> may be responding to aspects of the <span class="highlight">stimulus</span> different than those identified by the investigator. <span class="question6"><span class="highlight">Therefore</span>, when observational assessment is used as a <span class="highlight">technique</span> for studying <span class="highlight">infant</span><span class="highlight">perceptual</span> abilities, <span class="highlight">care</span> must be taken not to overgeneralize from the <span class="highlight">data</span> or to <span class="highlight">rely</span> on one or two studies as <span class="highlight">conclusive</span><span class="highlight">evidence</span> of a <span class="highlight">particular</span><span class="highlight">perceptual</span><span class="highlight">ability</span> of the <span class="highlight">infant</span>.</span></p><p>Observational assessment techniques have become much more <span class="highlight">sophisticated</span>, reducing the limitations just presented. <span class="highlight">Film</span><span class="highlight">analysis</span> of the <span class="highlight">infant</span>'s responses, 
heart and <span class="highlight">respiration</span><span class="highlight">rate</span> monitors, and nonnutritive sucking devices are used as <span class="highlight">effective</span> tools in understanding <span class="highlight">infant</span><span class="highlight">perception</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span><span class="highlight">Film</span><span class="highlight">analysis</span> permits researchers to 
carefully study the <span class="highlight">infant</span>'s responses over and over and in slow <span class="highlight">motion</span>.  <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span><span class="highlight">Precise</span> measurements can be made of the length and <span class="highlight">frequency</span> of the <span class="highlight">infant</span>'s <span class="highlight">attention</span> between two stimuli. 
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>Heart and <span class="highlight">respiration</span> monitors provide the investigator with the number of heartbeats or breaths taken when a new <span class="highlight">stimulus</span> is presented. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>Numerical increases are used as <span class="question8">quantifiable</span> indicators of heightened <span class="highlight">interest</span> in the new <span class="highlight">stimulus</span>. Increases in nonnutritive sucking were first used as an assessment <span class="highlight">measure</span> by researchers in 1969. They devised an <span class="highlight">apparatus</span> that 
connected a baby's pacifier to a counting <span class="highlight">device</span>. As stimuli were presented, changes in the <span class="highlight">infant</span>'s sucking <span class="highlight">behavior</span> were recorded. Increases in the number of sucks were used as an
indicator of the <span class="highlight">infant</span>'s <span class="highlight">attention</span> to or <span class="highlight">preference</span> for a <span class="highlight">given</span><span class="highlight">visual</span><span class="highlight">display</span>.</p><p>Two <span class="highlight">additional</span> techniques of studying <span class="highlight">infant</span><span class="highlight">perception</span> have come into vogue. The first is the habituation-dishabituation <span class="highlight">technique</span>, in which a single <span class="highlight">stimulus</span> is presented repeatedly to the <span class="highlight">infant</span> until there is a measurable <span class="highlight">decline</span> (habituation) in whatever attending <span class="highlight">behavior</span> is being observed. At that point a new <span class="highlight">stimulus</span> is presented, and any recovery (dishabituation) in responsiveness is recorded. If the <span class="highlight">infant</span> fails to dishabituate and continues to show habituation with the new <span class="highlight">stimulus</span>, it is assumed that the baby is unable to <span class="highlight">perceive</span> the new <span class="highlight">stimulus</span> as different. The habituation-dishabituation paradigm has been used most extensively with studies of <span class="highlight">auditory</span> and <span class="highlight">olfactory</span><span class="highlight">perception</span> in infants. The <span class="highlight">second</span><span class="highlight">technique</span> relies on evoked potentials, which are electrical brain responses that may be related to a <span class="highlight">particular</span><span class="highlight">stimulus</span> because of where they <span class="highlight">originate</span>. Changes in the electrical <span class="highlight">pattern</span> of the brain <span class="highlight">indicate</span> that the <span class="highlight">stimulus</span> is getting <span class="highlight">through</span> to the <span class="highlight">infant</span>'s central nervous system and eliciting some form of <span class="highlight">response</span>.</p><p>Each of the preceding techniques provides the researcher with <span class="highlight">evidence</span> that the <span class="highlight">infant</span> can <span class="highlight">detect</span> or <span class="highlight">discriminate</span> between stimuli. With these <span class="highlight">sophisticated</span> observational assessment and electro-physiological measures, we know that the neonate of only a few days is far more <span class="highlight">perceptive</span> than <span class="highlight">previously</span> suspected. However, these measures are only "indirect" indicators of the <span class="highlight">infant</span>'s <span class="highlight">perceptual</span> abilities.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Paragraph 1 indicates that researchers use indirect methods primarily to observe the</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. range of motor activity in neonates</p><p>B. frequency and duration of various stimuli</p><p>C. change in an infant's state following the introduction of a stimulus</p><p>D. range of an infant's visual field</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Targeting to the second sentence with the indirect methods keyword, said to use the indirect method to observe what the baby can see and hear what, then say that compared with the state before the introduction of the stimulus, so the answer is C, whether it is a hear or see It is the baby's state, and only the imported state can be compared with the previous state to make changes.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question2">uniformly</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. clearly</p><p>B. quickly</p><p>C. consistently</p><p>D. occasionally</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" C"><p>A <span class="question2">uniformly</span>: Uniformly, consistently, consistently. A is clearly, obviously; B is faster; C is consistently, consistently, consistently; D is occasionally. So the answer C is consistently correct.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the author mention |repetitive following movements of the eye|</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To identify a response that indicates a neonate's perception of a stimulus</p><p>B. To explain why a neonate is capable of responding to stimuli only through repetitive movements</p><p>C. To argue that motor activity in a neonate may be random and unrelated to stimuli</p><p>D. To emphasize that responses to stimuli vary in infants according to age</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The title of the function, the sentence on which the rhetorical point is located has been read, but an example is described, and for example further illustrates that this sentence is only an example. Looking ahead, the difference between the two methods in the preceding sentence tells the researcher the level and duration of the newborn's response to the stimulus, so A is the answer. B's only original did not say; C's unrelated is opposite to the original; D's age did not say.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the following is NOT mentioned in paragraph 2 as a problem in using the technique of direct observation?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It is impossible to be certain of the actual cause of an infant's response.</p><p>B. Infants' responses, which occur quickly and diffusely, are often difficult to measure.</p><p>C.

Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Researchers using observational assessment techniques on infants must not overgeneralize and must base their conclusions on data from many studies.</p><p>B. On the basis of the data from one or two studies, it seems that some infants develop a particular perceptual ability not observed in others.</p><p>C. To use data from one or two studies on infant's perceptual abilities, it is necessary to use techniques that will provide conclusive evidence.</p><p>D. When researchers fail to make generalizations from their studies, their observed data is often inconclusive.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The main logic of A original sentence is the conditional adverbial clause, and the logic in the main sentence is parallelism. The structure of the original sentence is when blabla (conditions) must be carefully prevented: 1) overgeneraize 2) rely on one or two studies. The subject implied in the original text is our prevention. A is correct. The remaining three answers completely change the backbone of the original sentence. B said how the baby is like, the last half of the sentence is completely compiled, the original we prevent completely gone; C's content is completely wrong, indiscriminate collocation; D main clauses and clauses are not the same as the original.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the authors primary purpose in paragraph 3?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

To describe new techniques for observing infant perception that overcome problems identified in the previous paragraph</p><p>C. To present and evaluate the conclusions of various studies on infant perception</p><p>D. To point out the strengths and weaknesses of three new methods for quantifying an infant's reaction to stimuli</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The purpose of the third paragraph is to look at the central sentence, which is the first sentence of this paragraph. It is said that the more advanced technology can reduce the limitations mentioned above, so the answer is B.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word |<span class="question8">quantifiable</span>|in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. visual</p><p>B. permanent</p><p>C. meaningful</p><p>D. measurable</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D <span class="question8">quantifiable</span>: Countable, measurable. A is visual; B is permanent; C is meaningful; D is measurable. So D's measurable is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Paragraph 3 mentions all of the following as indications of an infant's heightened interest in a new stimulus EXCEPT an increase in</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. sucking behavior</p><p>B. heart rate</p><p>C. the number of breaths taken</p><p>D. eye movements</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>EXCEPT questions, exclusion. A's sucking keyword positioning to the last two sentences, correct, not selected; B's heart rate and C's breaths keyword positioning to the fifth sentence, are correct, not selected, so D is the answer.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, which of the following leads to the conclusion that infants are able to differentiate between stimuli in a habituation-dishabituation study?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Dishabituation occurs with the introduction of a new stimulus.</p><p>B. Electrical responses in the infant's brain decline with each new stimulus.</p><p>C. Habituation is continued with the introduction of a new stimulus.</p><p>D. The infant displays little change in electrical brain responses.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>You could have used habituation-dishabituation as a key word, but found that it occurred several times and changed to the verb differentiate but was replaced with the adjective different and positioned to the fourth sentence, saying that if the baby does not show signs of dissatisfaction with the new stimulus, it will continue to perform. Adaptability means that they cannot distinguish, so the answer is A.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>In paragraph 4, what does the author suggest about the way an infant's brain perceives stimuli?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. An infant's potential to respond to a stimulus may be related to the size of its brain.</p><p>B. Changes in the electrical patterns of an infant's brain are difficult to detect.</p><p>C.
