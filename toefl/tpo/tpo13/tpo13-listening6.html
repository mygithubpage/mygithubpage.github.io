              <span class="time" data-times="4.27" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in an Astronomy class.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.03" data-time="4.27">[00:04.27]</span>
              <span class="underline">Male</span> professor: OK. I want to go over the different types of meteorites and what we've learned about them from the <span class="underline">formation</span> of earth and the <span class="underline">solar</span> system. <span class="time" data-times="15.36" data-time="13.3">[00:13.30]</span>Uh, the thing is, what's especially interesting about meteorites is that they come from <span class="underline">interplanetary</span> <span class="underline">space</span>, but they <span class="underline">consist</span> of the same chemical elements that are in matter originating on earth, just in different proportions.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.27" data-time="28.66">[00:28.66]</span>But that makes it easier to <span class="underline">identify</span> something as a <span class="underline">meteorite</span> as <span class="underline">opposed</span> to just a <span class="underline">terrestrial</span> rock. <span class="time" data-times="17.06" data-time="36.93">[00:36.93]</span>So to talk about where meteorites come from, we need to talk about comets and asteroids, which basically, they are basically made up of <span class="underline">debris</span> left over from the <span class="underline">origin</span> of the <span class="underline">solar</span> system 4.6 billion years ago. <span class="time" data-times="3.58" data-time="53.99">[00:53.99]</span>Now I'm going a little out of order here, um. <span class="time" data-times="7.56" data-time="57.57">[00:57.57]</span>I'm not going to go into any depth on comets and asteroids now, but we will come back later and do that.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.29" data-time="65.13">[01:05.13]</span>For now, I'll just cover some <span class="underline">basic</span> info about them. <span class="time" data-times="11.57" data-time="69.42">[01:09.42]</span>OK, comets and asteroids, it might help if you think of, remember we talked about the two classes of planets in our <span class="underline">solar</span> system? <span class="time" data-times="3.12" data-time="80.99">[01:20.99]</span>And how they differ in <span class="underline">composition</span>? <span class="time" data-times="6.75" data-time="84.11">[01:24.11]</span>The <span class="underline">terrestrial</span> planets like Mars and Earth, composed largely of rocks and metals? <span class="time" data-times="4.11" data-time="90.86">[01:30.86]</span>And the large gas giants like <span class="underline">Jupiter</span>? <span class="time" data-times="18.66" data-time="94.97">[01:34.97]</span>Well, the <span class="underline">solar</span> system also has two <span class="underline">analogous</span> classes of objects smaller than planets, namely asteroids and comets, <span class="underline">relatively</span> near the Sun, in the <span class="underline">inner</span> <span class="underline">solar</span> system between <span class="underline">Jupiter</span> and Mars to be <span class="underline">precise</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.19" data-time="113.63">[01:53.63]</span>We've got the <span class="underline">asteroid</span> <span class="underline">belt</span>, which contains about 90 percent of all asteroids orbiting the Sun.<span class="time" data-times="9.77" data-time="120.82">[02:00.82]</span>These asteroids are, uh, like the <span class="underline">terrestrial</span> planets in that they are composed mostly of <span class="underline">rocky</span> <span class="underline">material</span> and metals. <span class="time" data-times="15.36" data-time="130.59">[02:10.59]</span>Far from the Sun, in the outer <span class="underline">solar</span> system, beyond <span class="underline">Jupiter</span>'s <span class="underline">orbit</span>, temperatures are low enough to <span class="underline">permit</span> ices to form out of water and, and out of gases like, uh, <span class="underline">methane</span> and <span class="underline">carbon</span> <span class="underline">dioxide</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.42" data-time="145.95">[02:25.95]</span> <span class="underline">Loose</span> collections of these ices and small <span class="underline">rocky</span> particles form into comets. <span class="time" data-times="5.49" data-time="152.37">[02:32.37]</span>So comets are <span class="underline">similar</span> in <span class="underline">composition</span> to the gas giants.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.74" data-time="157.86">[02:37.86]</span>Both comets and asteroids are, typically are smaller than planets. <span class="time" data-times="6.11" data-time="164.6">[02:44.60]</span>And <span class="underline">even</span> smaller type of <span class="underline">interplanetary</span> <span class="underline">debris</span> is the meteoroid. <span class="time" data-times="5.17" data-time="170.71">[02:50.71]</span>And it's from the meteoroids that we get meteors and meteorites. <span class="time" data-times="6.58" data-time="175.88">[02:55.88]</span>Roids are, for the most part anyway, they're just smaller bits of asteroids and comets.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.72" data-time="182.46">[03:02.46]</span>When these bits enter earth's <span class="underline">atmosphere</span>, well, that makes them so <span class="underline">special</span> that they get a <span class="underline">special</span> name: they're called meteors. <span class="time" data-times="6.29" data-time="192.18">[03:12.18]</span>Most of them are very small and they burn up soon after entering earth's <span class="underline">atmosphere</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.87" data-time="198.47">[03:18.47]</span>The larger ones that make it <span class="underline">through</span> the <span class="underline">atmosphere</span> and hit the ground are called meteorites. <span class="time" data-times="4.57" data-time="205.34">[03:25.34]</span>So meteorites are the ones that actually make it <span class="underline">through</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.01" data-time="209.91">[03:29.91]</span>Now, we've been finding meteorites on earth for thousands of years. <span class="time" data-times="8.98" data-time="213.92">[03:33.92]</span>And we've analyzed enough of them to learn a lot about their <span class="underline">composition</span>, most come from asteroids, though a few may have come from comets. <span class="time" data-times="2.51" data-time="222.9">[03:42.90]</span>So, <span class="underline">essentially</span>, they are rocks. <span class="time" data-times="3" data-time="225.41">[03:45.41]</span>And like rocks, they are mixtures of minerals. <span class="time" data-times="9.1" data-time="228.41">[03:48.41]</span>They are generally classified into three <span class="underline">broad</span> categories: stones, stony irons and irons.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.22" data-time="237.51">[03:57.51]</span>Stone meteorites, which we <span class="underline">refer</span> to <span class="underline">simply</span> as, uh, stones, are almost <span class="underline">entirely</span> rock <span class="underline">material</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.41" data-time="245.73">[04:05.73]</span>They actually <span class="underline">account</span> for almost all of the <span class="underline">meteorite</span> <span class="underline">material</span> that falls to earth. <span class="time" data-times="4.23" data-time="251.14">[04:11.14]</span>But <span class="underline">even</span> so, it's <span class="underline">rare</span> to ever find one. <span class="time" data-times="5.02" data-time="255.37">[04:15.37]</span>I mean, it's easier to find an iron <span class="underline">meteorite</span> or stony iron. <span class="time" data-times="2.29" data-time="260.39">[04:20.39]</span>Any one guess why? <span class="time" data-times="1.91" data-time="262.68">[04:22.68]</span>Look at their names. <span class="time" data-times="3.19" data-time="264.59">[04:24.59]</span>What do you think iron meteorites <span class="underline">consist</span> of?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.41" data-time="267.78">[04:27.78]</span>
              <span class="underline">Female</span> student: Mostly iron?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.47" data-time="269.19">[04:29.19]</span>Professor: Yeah! Iron and some <span class="underline">nickel</span>, both of which are metals. <span class="time" data-times="2.61" data-time="273.66">[04:33.66]</span>And if you're trying to find metal?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.3" data-time="276.27">[04:36.27]</span>Student: Oh, metal detectors!</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.36" data-time="278.57">[04:38.57]</span>Professor: Right! Thank you! <span class="time" data-times="2.05" data-time="279.93">[04:39.93]</span>At <span class="underline">least</span> that's part of it. <span class="time" data-times="14.88" data-time="281.98">[04:41.98]</span>Stone meteorites, if they lie around <span class="underline">exposed</span> to the weather for a few years, well, they're made of rock, so they end up looking almost indistinguishable from <span class="underline">common</span> <span class="underline">terrestrial</span> rocks, ones that originated on earth. <span class="time" data-times="2.92" data-time="296.86">[04:56.86]</span>So it's hard to <span class="underline">spot</span> them by eye.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.82" data-time="299.78">[04:59.78]</span>But we can use metal detectors to help us find the others. <span class="time" data-times="2.44" data-time="303.6">[05:03.60]</span>And they are easier to <span class="underline">spot</span> by eye. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="306.04">[05:06.04]</span>So most of the meteorites in collections, uh, in museums, they'll be, they are iron meteorites, or the stony iron kind, <span class="underline">even</span> though they only make up about 5 percent of the <span class="underline">meteorite</span> <span class="underline">material</span> on the ground.</p>
