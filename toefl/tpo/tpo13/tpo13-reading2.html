          <h4 class="w3-center">Biological Clocks</h4>
          <p>
            <span class="highlight">Survival</span> and successful <span class="highlight">reproduction</span> usually <span class="highlight">require</span> the activities of animals to be coordinated with <span class="highlight">predictable</span> events around them. <span class="highlight question1">Consequently</span> the timing and rhythms of biological functions must closely <span class="highlight">match</span> <span class="highlight">periodic</span> events like the <span class="highlight">solar</span> day, the tides, the <span class="highlight">lunar</span> <span class="highlight">cycle</span>, and the seasons. The relations between animal <span class="highlight">activity</span> and these periods, particularly for the daily rhythms, have been of such <span class="highlight">interest</span> and importance that a huge <span class="highlight">amount</span> of work has been done on them and the <span class="highlight">special</span> research <span class="highlight">field</span> of chronobiology has emerged. <span class="highlight">Normally</span>, the <span class="highlight">constantly</span> changing levels of an animal's <span class="highlight">activity</span>-sleeping, feeding, moving, reproducing, metabolizing, and producing enzymes and hormones, for example-are well coordinated with <span class="highlight">environmental</span> rhythms, but the key question is whether the animal's <span class="highlight">schedule</span> is driven by <span class="highlight">external</span> cues, such as sunrise or <span class="highlight">sunset</span>, or is <span class="highlight">instead</span> dependent somehow on <span class="highlight">internal</span> timers that themselves <span class="highlight">generate</span> the observed biological rhythms. Almost universally, biologists accept the idea that all eukaryotes (a <span class="highlight">category</span> that includes most organisms except <span class="highlight">bacteria</span> and certain <span class="highlight">algae</span>) have <span class="highlight">internal</span> clocks. By isolating organisms completely from <span class="highlight">external</span> <span class="highlight">periodic</span> cues, biologists learned that organisms have <span class="highlight">internal</span> clocks. For <span class="highlight">instance</span>, apparently normal daily periods of biological <span class="highlight">activity</span> were maintained for about a week by the <span class="highlight">fungus</span> Neurospora when it was <span class="highlight">intentionally</span> <span class="highlight">isolated</span> from all geophysical timing cues while orbiting in a <span class="highlight">space</span> <span class="highlight">shuttle</span>. The <span class="highlight">continuation</span> of biological rhythms in an <span class="highlight">organism</span> without <span class="highlight">external</span> cues attests to its having an <span class="highlight">internal</span> clock.</p>
          <p>When crayfish are kept continuously in the dark, <span class="highlight">even</span> for four to five months, their <span class="highlight">compound</span> eyes continue to <span class="highlight">adjust</span> on a daily <span class="highlight">schedule</span> for daytime and nighttime <span class="highlight">vision</span>. Horseshoe crabs kept in the dark continuously for a year were found to <span class="highlight">maintain</span> a <span class="highlight"><span class="question4">persistent</span></span> <span class="highlight">rhythm</span> of brain <span class="highlight">activity</span> that similarly adapts their eyes on a daily <span class="highlight">schedule</span> for bright or for weak light. Like almost all daily cycles of animals deprived of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> cues, those measured for the horseshoe crabs in these conditions were not exactly 24 hours. Such a <span class="highlight">rhythm</span> whose period is <span class="highlight">approximately</span>-but not exactly-a day is called circadian. For different <span class="highlight">individual</span> horseshoe crabs, the circadian period ranged from 22.2 to 25.5 hours. A <span class="highlight">particular</span> animal typically maintains its own <span class="highlight">characteristic</span> <span class="highlight">cycle</span> <span class="highlight"><span class="question9">duration</span></span> with great precision for many days. <span class="question5">Indeed, <span class="highlight">stability</span> of the biological clock's period is one of its <span class="highlight">major</span> features, <span class="highlight">even</span> when the <span class="highlight">organism</span>'s environment is subjected to <span class="highlight">considerable</span> changes in factors, such as <span class="highlight">temperature</span>, that would be expected to <span class="highlight">affect</span> biological <span class="highlight">activity</span> strongly.</span> Further <span class="highlight">evidence</span> for <span class="highlight">persistent</span> <span class="highlight">internal</span> rhythms appears when the usual <span class="highlight">external</span> cycles are shifted-either experimentally or by rapid east-west travel over great distances. Typically, the animal's daily internally generated <span class="highlight">cycle</span> of <span class="highlight">activity</span> continues without change. As a result, its activities are shifted <span class="highlight">relative</span> to the <span class="highlight">external</span> <span class="highlight">cycle</span> of the new environment. The disorienting effects of this mismatch between <span class="highlight">external</span> time cues and <span class="highlight">internal</span> schedules may <span class="highlight">persist</span>, like our jet lag, for several days or weeks until certain cues such as the daylight/darkness <span class="highlight">cycle</span> reset the <span class="highlight">organism</span>'s clock to <span class="highlight">synchronize</span> with the daily <span class="highlight">rhythm</span> of the new environment.</p>
          <p>Animals need natural <span class="highlight">periodic</span> signals like sunrise to <span class="highlight">maintain</span> a <span class="highlight">cycle</span> whose period is precisely 24 hours. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>Such an <span class="highlight">external</span> <span class="highlight">cue</span> not only 
coordinates an animal's daily rhythms with <span class="highlight">particular</span> features of the <span class="highlight">local</span> <span class="highlight">solar</span> day but also-because <span class="question11">it</span> <span class="highlight">normally</span> does so day after day-seems to keep
the <span class="highlight">internal</span> clock's period close to that of  Earth's <span class="highlight">rotation</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>Yet despite this <span class="highlight">synchronization</span> of the period of the <span class="highlight">internal</span> <span class="highlight">cycle</span>, the animal's timer 
itself continues to have its own <span class="highlight">genetically</span> built-in period close to, but different from, 24 hours. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>Without the <span class="highlight">external</span> <span class="highlight">cue</span>, the <span class="highlight">difference</span> accumulates and so 
the internally regulated activities of the biological day <span class="highlight">drift</span> continuously, like the tides, in relation to the <span class="highlight">solar</span> day. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>This <span class="highlight">drift</span> has been studied extensively in 
many animals and in biological activities ranging from the hatching of fruit fly eggs to wheel running by squirrels. Light has a predominating influence in <span class="highlight">setting</span> the clock.
<span class="highlight">Even</span> a fifteen-minute burst of light in <span class="highlight">otherwise</span> <span class="highlight"><span class="question12">sustained</span></span> darkness can reset an animal's circadian <span class="highlight">rhythm</span>. <span class="highlight">Normally</span>, <span class="highlight">internal</span> rhythms are kept in step by <span class="highlight">regular</span> <span class="highlight">environmental</span> cycles.
For <span class="highlight">instance</span>, if a <span class="highlight">homing</span> <span class="highlight">pigeon</span> is to <span class="highlight">navigate</span> with its Sun <span class="highlight">compass</span>, its clock must be properly set by cues provided by the daylight/darkness <span class="highlight">cycle</span>.</p>

Then the article says that it may be 22.2 to 25.5 hours. So the answer is C. The circadian of the same species is not the same. This question is apt to misselect A, because the previous article emphasizes that there is no external environment factor when circadian is not 24 hours, so not same, A wrong.</p>

              <p>The word "cycle of the environment" is used to locate the second last sentence of the sentence. The sentence says that the internal rhythm of the creature does not change. Then the activity of the creature has to change because of the new environment, and then there is a miscatch. Disorientation is the correct answer. B is contrary to the original, C and D did not say.</p>

              <p>For the rhetorical question, first look at the sentence under which the number lies, and say that the circadian of different horseshoe crabs is between 22.2 and 25.5 hours, which is obviously just an example. The first sentence says that the 24-hour, but not accurate, 24-hour rhythm is called circadian, which means that the latter sentence is an example of a 24-hour circadian being inaccurate, so the answer is A. B shift from daytime to nighttime did not say; C and D are too absolute and the original did not say.</p>
