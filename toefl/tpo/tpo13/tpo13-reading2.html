            <span class="highlight">Survival</span> and successful <span class="highlight">reproduction</span> usually <span class="highlight">require</span> the activities of animals to be coordinated with <span class="highlight">predictable</span> events around them. <span class="question1">Consequently</span> the timing and rhythms of biological functions must closely <span class="highlight">match</span> <span class="highlight">periodic</span> events like the <span class="highlight">solar</span> day, the tides, the <span class="highlight">lunar</span> <span class="highlight">cycle</span>, and the seasons. The relations between animal <span class="highlight">activity</span> and these periods, particularly for the daily rhythms, have been of such <span class="highlight">interest</span> and importance that a huge <span class="highlight">amount</span> of work has been done on them and the <span class="highlight">special</span> research <span class="highlight">field</span> of chronobiology has emerged. <span class="highlight">Normally</span>, the <span class="highlight">constantly</span> changing levels of an animal's <span class="highlight">activity</span>-sleeping, feeding, moving, reproducing, metabolizing, and producing enzymes and hormones, for example-are well coordinated with <span class="highlight">environmental</span> rhythms, but the key question is whether the animal's <span class="highlight">schedule</span> is driven by <span class="highlight">external</span> cues, such as sunrise or <span class="highlight">sunset</span>, or is <span class="highlight">instead</span> dependent somehow on <span class="highlight">internal</span> timers that themselves <span class="highlight">generate</span> the observed biological rhythms. Almost universally, biologists accept the idea that all eukaryotes (a <span class="highlight">category</span> that includes most organisms except <span class="highlight">bacteria</span> and certain <span class="highlight">algae</span>) have <span class="highlight">internal</span> clocks. By isolating organisms completely from <span class="highlight">external</span> <span class="highlight">periodic</span> cues, biologists learned that organisms have <span class="highlight">internal</span> clocks. For <span class="highlight">instance</span>, apparently normal daily periods of biological <span class="highlight">activity</span> were maintained for about a week by the <span class="highlight">fungus</span> Neurospora when it was <span class="highlight">intentionally</span> <span class="highlight">isolated</span> from all geophysical timing cues while orbiting in a <span class="highlight">space</span> <span class="highlight">shuttle</span>. The <span class="highlight">continuation</span> of biological rhythms in an <span class="highlight">organism</span> without <span class="highlight">external</span> cues attests to its having an <span class="highlight">internal</span> clock.</p>
          <p>When crayfish are kept continuously in the dark, <span class="highlight">even</span> for four to five months, their <span class="highlight">compound</span> eyes continue to <span class="highlight">adjust</span> on a daily <span class="highlight">schedule</span> for daytime and nighttime <span class="highlight">vision</span>. Horseshoe crabs kept in the dark continuously for a year were found to <span class="highlight">maintain</span> a <span class="highlight">persistent</span> <span class="highlight">rhythm</span> of brain <span class="highlight">activity</span> that similarly adapts their eyes on a daily <span class="highlight">schedule</span> for bright or for weak light. Like almost all daily cycles of animals deprived of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> cues, those measured for the horseshoe crabs in these conditions were not exactly 24 hours. Such a <span class="highlight">rhythm</span> whose period is <span class="highlight">approximately</span>-but not exactly-a day is called circadian. For different <span class="highlight">individual</span> horseshoe crabs, the circadian period ranged from 22.2 to 25.5 hours. A <span class="highlight">particular</span> animal typically maintains its own <span class="highlight">characteristic</span> <span class="highlight">cycle</span> <span class="highlight"><span class="question9">duration</span> </span>with great precision for many days. <span class="question5">Indeed, <span class="highlight">stability</span> of the biological clock's period is one of its <span class="highlight">major</span> features, <span class="highlight">even</span> when the <span class="highlight">organism</span>'s environment is subjected to <span class="highlight">considerable</span> changes in factors, such as <span class="highlight">temperature</span>, that would be expected to <span class="highlight">affect</span> biological <span class="highlight">activity</span> strongly. </span>Further <span class="highlight">evidence</span> for <span class="highlight">persistent</span> <span class="highlight">internal</span> rhythms appears when the usual <span class="highlight">external</span> cycles are shifted-either experimentally or by rapid east-west travel over great distances. Typically, the animal's daily internally generated <span class="highlight">cycle</span> of <span class="highlight">activity</span> continues without change. As a result, its activities are shifted <span class="highlight">relative</span> to the <span class="highlight">external</span> <span class="highlight">cycle</span> of the new environment. The disorienting effects of this mismatch between <span class="highlight">external</span> time cues and <span class="highlight">internal</span> schedules may <span class="highlight">persist</span>, like our jet lag, for several days or weeks until certain cues such as the daylight/darkness <span class="highlight">cycle</span> reset the <span class="highlight">organism</span>'s clock to <span class="highlight">synchronize</span> with the daily <span class="highlight">rhythm</span> of the new environment.</p>
          <p>Animals need natural <span class="highlight">periodic</span> signals like sunrise to <span class="highlight">maintain</span> a <span class="highlight">cycle</span> whose period is precisely 24 hours. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>Such an <span class="highlight">external</span> <span class="highlight">cue</span> not only 
coordinates an animal's daily rhythms with <span class="highlight">particular</span> features of the <span class="highlight">local</span> <span class="highlight">solar</span> day but also-because <span class="question11">it</span> <span class="highlight">normally</span> does so day after day-seems to keep
the <span class="highlight">internal</span> clock's period close to that of  Earth's <span class="highlight">rotation</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>Yet despite this <span class="highlight">synchronization</span> of the period of the <span class="highlight">internal</span> <span class="highlight">cycle</span>, the animal's timer 
itself continues to have its own <span class="highlight">genetically</span> built-in period close to, but different from, 24 hours. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>Without the <span class="highlight">external</span> <span class="highlight">cue</span>, the <span class="highlight">difference</span> accumulates and so 
the internally regulated activities of the biological day <span class="highlight">drift</span> continuously, like the tides, in relation to the <span class="highlight">solar</span> day. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>This <span class="highlight">drift</span> has been studied extensively in 
many animals and in biological activities ranging from the hatching of fruit fly eggs to wheel running by squirrels. Light has a predominating influence in <span class="highlight">setting</span> the clock.
<span class="highlight">Even</span> a fifteen-minute burst of light in <span class="highlight">otherwise</span> <span class="highlight"><span class="question12">sustained</span> </span>darkness can reset an animal's circadian <span class="highlight">rhythm</span>. <span class="highlight">Normally</span>, <span class="highlight">internal</span> rhythms are kept in step by <span class="highlight">regular</span> <span class="highlight">environmental</span> cycles.
For <span class="highlight">instance</span>, if a <span class="highlight">homing</span> <span class="highlight">pigeon</span> is to <span class="highlight">navigate</span> with its Sun <span class="highlight">compass</span>, its clock must be properly set by cues provided by the daylight/darkness <span class="highlight">cycle</span>.</p>
