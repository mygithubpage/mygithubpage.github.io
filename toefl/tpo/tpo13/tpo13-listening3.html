            <span class="highlight">Female</span> Professor: So, um, continuing our discussion of <span class="highlight">ecological</span> systems, whole systems, the main thing to keep in <span class="highlight">mind</span> here is the inter-relationships. <span class="time" data-times="5.9" data-time="14.84">[00:14.84]</span>The <span class="highlight">species</span> in the system, um, and <span class="highlight">even</span> the <span class="highlight">landscape</span> itself, they are inter-dependent. <span class="time" data-times="5.85" data-time="20.74">[00:20.74]</span>Let's take what you've read for this week and see if we can <span class="highlight">apply</span> this inter-dependence idea. Mike?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.4" data-time="26.59">[00:26.59]</span>
            <span class="highlight">Male</span> student: Well, um, how about beavers? <span class="time" data-times="2.52" data-time="29.99">[00:29.99]</span>Ecosystems with beavers in waterways.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.61" data-time="32.51">[00:32.51]</span>Professor: Good! Good, go on.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="12.95" data-time="34.12">[00:34.12]</span>
            <span class="highlight">Male</span> student: Like, well, you can see how it's so important because if you go back before Europeans settled the North America, like, before the 1600s back when Native Americans were the only people living here. <span class="time" data-times="2.77" data-time="47.07">[00:47.07]</span>Well, back then there were a lot of beavers. <span class="time" data-times="2.85" data-time="49.84">[00:49.84]</span>But later on, after Europeans...</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="11.18" data-time="52.69">[00:52.69]</span>Professor: OK, wait. I see where you're <span class="highlight">heading</span> with this, but before we go into how European <span class="highlight">settlement</span> affected the <span class="highlight">ecosystem</span>, tell me this, what kind of environment do beavers live in? <span class="time" data-times="3.5" data-time="63.87">[01:03.87]</span>Think about what it was like before the European settlers came. <span class="time" data-times="3.29" data-time="67.37">[01:07.37]</span>We will come back where you're headed.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="9.77" data-time="70.66">[01:10.66]</span>
            <span class="highlight">Female</span> student: OK. Well, beavers live near streams and rivers and they <span class="highlight">block</span> up the streams and rivers with, like, logs and sticks and mud. <span class="time" data-times="8.88" data-time="80.43">[01:20.43]</span>You know, they build dams that really slow down the flow of the <span class="highlight">stream</span>, so then the water backs up and creates like a pond that floods the nearby land.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.88" data-time="89.31">[01:29.31]</span>Professor: And that creates wetlands. <span class="time" data-times="1.41" data-time="91.19">[01:31.19]</span>OK. Tell me more.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.72" data-time="92.6">[01:32.60]</span>
            <span class="highlight">Female</span> student: Well, with wetlands, it's like there's more standing water, more still water around. <span class="time" data-times="7.22" data-time="97.32">[01:37.32]</span>And that waters are a lot cleaner than swiftly flowing water because the dirt and <span class="highlight">sediment</span> and <span class="highlight">stuff</span> has a <span class="highlight">chance</span> to sink to the bottom.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="7.74" data-time="104.54">[01:44.54]</span>Professor: More important for our discussion, wetland areas support a lot more varieties of life than swiftly flowing water. <span class="time" data-times="5.64" data-time="112.28">[01:52.28]</span>For example, there are more varieties of fish, of insects, lots of frog <span class="highlight">species</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.8" data-time="117.92">[01:57.92]</span>And <span class="highlight">species</span> that <span class="highlight">rely</span> on those <span class="highlight">species</span> start to live near the wetlands, too.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.92" data-time="122.72">[02:02.72]</span>
            <span class="highlight">Female</span> student: Yes, like birds and mammals that eat the fish and insects. <span class="time" data-times="5.7" data-time="126.64">[02:06.64]</span>And you get trees and plants that begin to grow near standing water that can't grow in running water. <span class="time" data-times="4.41" data-time="132.34">[02:12.34]</span>Oh, and there's something about wetlands and <span class="highlight">groundwater</span>, too.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.53" data-time="136.75">[02:16.75]</span>Professor: OK. Good! <span class="time" data-times="6.6" data-time="138.28">[02:18.28]</span>Wetlands have a big effect on <span class="highlight">groundwater</span>, the <span class="highlight">amount</span> of water below the surface of the land. <span class="time" data-times="4.44" data-time="144.88">[02:24.88]</span>Think of wetlands as, um, like a <span class="highlight">giant</span> <span class="highlight">sponge</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.21" data-time="149.32">[02:29.32]</span>The earth soaks up a lot of this water that's continually flooding the surface, which increases the <span class="highlight">amount</span> of water below. <span class="time" data-times="3.86" data-time="156.53">[02:36.53]</span>So where there are wetlands, you get a lot of <span class="highlight">groundwater</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.6" data-time="160.39">[02:40.39]</span>And <span class="highlight">groundwater</span> happens to be a big <span class="highlight">source</span> of our own drinking water today. <span class="time" data-times="2.9" data-time="164.99">[02:44.99]</span>All right, so back to the beavers. <span class="time" data-times="2.66" data-time="167.89">[02:47.89]</span>What if the beavers weren't there?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.73" data-time="170.55">[02:50.55]</span>
            <span class="highlight">Male</span> student: You just have a <span class="highlight">regular</span> running <span class="highlight">stream</span> 'cause there was no <span class="highlight">dam</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.89" data-time="177.28">[02:57.28]</span>So the <span class="highlight">ecosystem</span> would be completely different. <span class="time" data-times="1.49" data-time="180.17">[03:00.17]</span>There'd be fewer wetlands.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.54" data-time="181.66">[03:01.66]</span>Professor: Exactly! So now let's go back to where you were headed before, Mike. <span class="time" data-times="4.7" data-time="186.2">[03:06.20]</span>You mentioned a change that occurred after Europeans came to North America.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="8.27" data-time="190.9">[03:10.90]</span>
            <span class="highlight">Male</span> student: Yeah, well, there used to be beavers all over the place, um, something like two hundred million beavers just in the <span class="highlight">continental</span> United States. <span class="time" data-times="15.2" data-time="199.17">[03:19.17]</span>But when Europeans came, they started hunting the beavers for their <span class="highlight">fur</span>, because <span class="highlight">beaver</span> furs were really warm and it was really <span class="highlight">popular</span> for making hats in Europe, so the beavers were hunted a lot, overhunted; they were almost <span class="highlight">extinct</span> by the 1800s. <span class="time" data-times="4.28" data-time="214.37">[03:34.37]</span>So that meant fewer wetlands, less standing water.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.19" data-time="218.65">[03:38.65]</span>Professor: And what does that mean for the <span class="highlight">ecosystem</span>? Kate?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="13.88" data-time="221.84">[03:41.84]</span>
            <span class="highlight">Female</span> student: Well if there's less standing water then the <span class="highlight">ecosystem</span> can't support as many <span class="highlight">species</span>, because a lot of the insects and fish and frogs can't live in running water and then the birds and animals that eat them lose their food <span class="highlight">supply</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.87" data-time="235.72">[03:55.72]</span>Professor: Precisely! So the <span class="highlight">beaver</span> in this <span class="highlight">ecosystem</span> is what we called a keystone <span class="highlight">species</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.19" data-time="242.59">[04:02.59]</span>The <span class="highlight">term</span> keystone kind of explains itself. <span class="time" data-times="7.94" data-time="246.78">[04:06.78]</span>In <span class="highlight">architecture</span>, a keystone in an archway or doorway is the stone that holds the whole thing together and keeps it from collapsing. <span class="time" data-times="4.49" data-time="254.72">[04:14.72]</span>Well, that's what a keystone <span class="highlight">species</span> does in an <span class="highlight">ecosystem</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.06" data-time="259.21">[04:19.21]</span>It's the <span class="highlight">crucial</span> <span class="highlight">species</span> that keeps the system going.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.65" data-time="263.27">[04:23.27]</span>Now, <span class="highlight">beaver</span> populations are on the rise again, but there's something to think about. <span class="time" data-times="3.92" data-time="269.92">[04:29.92]</span> <span class="highlight">Consider</span> humans as part of these ecosystems. <span class="time" data-times="9.04" data-time="273.84">[04:33.84]</span>You've probably heard about water shortages or restrictions on how much water you can use, especially in the summer time in recent years. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="282.88">[04:42.88]</span>And remember what I said about <span class="highlight">groundwater</span>, imagine if we still had all those beavers around, all those wetlands, what would our water <span class="highlight">supply</span> be like then?</p>

              <p>Wetland areas support a lot more varieties of life than swiftly flowing water.</p>
              <p>The lecture mentioned still water and swiftly flowing water. Since the beavers like to make dams, they blocked the flow of water and formed still water and wetland. This environment can support more fish and shore life, and it can also store more groundwater. Therefore, it can be judged that C is the correct option.</p>

            <div class="explanation">
              <p>Beaver itself builds dams, generating still water, generating wetland, species increase, so the number of beavers and wetland should be proportional, so the killing of beavers by European colonists would indirectly lead to a decrease in wetland and a decrease in wetland species. . So option B, C is wrong. Still water helps to store groundwater The decrease in beaver causes still water to decrease, so groundwater reduces D errors. The last correct option is A</p>

              <p>The term keystone kind of benefit itself. In architecture, a keystone in an archway or doorway is the stone that holds the whole thing together, and keeps it from collapsing.</p>
              <p>The sentence for hard of hearing is an explanation of the meaning of the keystone species, so choose D. The significance of keystone in architecture is almost the same as biology, so A is wrong.</p>

              <p>Imagine if we still have all those beavers around, all those wetlands. What would our water supply be like then?</p>
              <p>It has been said that beaver can make wetland, and wetland can store groundwater. So if beaver is not killed, then groundwater reserves will increase, and it will not cause the current shortage. So D is correct.</p>
