It's enjoyable because people can relax and get exercise from playing basketball. Almost every community in my country has a basketball court and every afternoon adults after work and children after school come to play together. Adults play to relax and to get rid of the tiring work in the morning, while some kids come to play for fun and exercise. Some kids enjoy throwing balls into the basket. Some enjoy running around, dribbling and chasing the one with the ball.</p></article></div></main></body></html>
