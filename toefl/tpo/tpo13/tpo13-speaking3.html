The official also said that, additionally, building a new stadium would allow the university to strengthen its relationship with the town since a new and larger stadium would have the space to seat not only students, parents, and alumni, but members of the local community as well.</p></article></section><div><audio src="tpo13-speaking3.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></div><section id="listening-text"><h3>Listening Text</h3><article><p>Now listen to two students discussing the article.</p><p>(man) So what do you think of the university's new plan?</p><p>(woman) Oh, I don't know. I don't think it's gonna work.</p><p>(man) No?</p><p>(woman) I mean, I can't imagine top students being too thrilled about some of the conditions on this campus.</p><p>(man) What do you mean?</p><p>(woman) Like, the science laboratory having such old outdated equipment and the library needing more books, and the student center being so small. I think that the 2 million could be spent in better places if the university is really serious about achieving its goal.</p><p>(man) OK. But what about the other reason for building the stadium? I mean right now we have so little contact with the town.</p><p>(woman) Yeah, but this won't help relations. Look, people from town hardly ever come to the games because our teams always lose. And they're not suddenly going to improve over night. Besides, adding seats won't make a difference. I mean, if people from town didn't come before, they won't come now just because the place is bigger.</p></article></section><section id="question"><h4>Question</h4><p>The woman expresses her opinion about the university's plan. State her opinion and explain the reasons she gives for holding that opinion. </p></section><section id="sample-response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><article><p>Well, the woman disagrees with the plan for two main reasons. In the first place, she believes that such amount of money could be wisely spent in some other places in order to attract more top students. For example, she says, the university could use the funds to update the outdated equipment in the lab, get more books for the library and try to enlarge the students' center, which she thinks will virtually attract more top students. Secondly, she also holds the point that people from the town don't come to the game of the university just because the teams of the university always lose, not because of the places of the game, which means just building a stadium would not do much help, since people won't change their impressions overnight. So based on the reasons stated above the woman disagrees with the plan of the university. (147 words)</p></article></section></main></body></html>
