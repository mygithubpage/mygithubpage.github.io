          <h4 class="w3-center">Types of Social Groups</h4>
          <p>Life places us in a <span class="highlight question1">complex</span> web of relationships with other people. Our humanness arises out of these relationships in the <span class="highlight">course</span> of social <span class="highlight">interaction</span>. Moreover, our humanness must be <span class="highlight">sustained</span> <span class="highlight">through</span> social <span class="highlight">interaction</span>-and <span class="highlight">fairly</span> <span class="highlight">constantly</span> so. When an <span class="highlight">association</span> continues long enough for two people to become linked together by a <span class="highlight">relatively</span> <span class="highlight">stable</span> set of expectations, it is called a relationship.</p>
          <p>People are <span class="highlight">bound</span> <span class="highlight">within</span> relationships by two types of bonds: <span class="highlight">expressive</span> ties and <span class="highlight">instrumental</span> ties. <span class="highlight">Expressive</span> ties are social links formed when we emotionally invest ourselves in and <span class="highlight">commit</span> ourselves to other people. <span class="highlight">Through</span> <span class="highlight">association</span> with people who are <span class="highlight">meaningful</span> to us, we achieve a <span class="highlight">sense</span> of <span class="highlight">security</span>, love, acceptance, companionship, and <span class="highlight">personal</span> <span class="highlight">worth</span>. <span class="highlight">Instrumental</span> ties are social links formed when we cooperate with other people to achieve some goal. Occasionally, this may mean working with <span class="highlight">instead</span> of against competitors. More often, we <span class="highlight">simply</span> cooperate with others to <span class="highlight">reach</span> some end without <span class="question3">endowing</span> the relationship with any larger <span class="highlight">significance</span>.</p>
          <p>Sociologists have built on the <span class="highlight">distinction</span> between <span class="highlight">expressive</span> and <span class="highlight">instrumental</span> ties to <span class="highlight">distinguish</span> between two types of groups: <span class="highlight">primary</span> and secondary. A <span class="highlight">primary</span> group involves two or more people who enjoy a direct, <span class="highlight">intimate</span>, cohesive relationship with one another. <span class="highlight">Expressive</span> ties <span class="highlight">predominate</span> in <span class="highlight">primary</span> groups; we view the people as ends in themselves and <span class="highlight">valuable</span> in their own right. A secondary group entails two or more people who are involved in an <span class="highlight">impersonal</span> relationship and have come together for a <span class="highlight">specific</span>, <span class="highlight">practical</span> purpose. <span class="highlight">Instrumental</span> ties <span class="highlight">predominate</span> in secondary groups; we <span class="highlight">perceive</span> people as means to ends rather than as ends in their own right. Sometimes <span class="highlight">primary</span> group relationships <span class="highlight">evolve</span> out of secondary group relationships. This happens in many work settings. People on the job often develop close relationships with coworkers as they come to share gripes, jokes, gossip, and satisfactions.</p>
          <p>A number of conditions <span class="highlight">enhance</span> the likelihood that <span class="highlight">primary</span> groups will arise. First, group size is important. We find it difficult to get to know people personally when they are milling about and dispersed in large groups. In small groups we have a better <span class="highlight">chance</span> to <span class="highlight">initiate</span> <span class="highlight">contact</span> and <span class="highlight">establish</span> <span class="highlight">rapport</span> with them. <span class="highlight">Second</span>, face-to-face <span class="highlight">contact</span> allows us to <span class="question7">size up</span> others. Seeing and talking with one another in close <span class="highlight">physical</span> <span class="highlight">proximity</span> makes possible a <span class="highlight">subtle</span> <span class="highlight">exchange</span> of ideas and feelings. And third, the probability that we will develop <span class="highlight">primary</span> group bonds increases as we have frequent and <span class="highlight">continuous</span> <span class="highlight">contact</span>. Our ties with people often deepen as we <span class="highlight">interact</span> with them <span class="highlight">across</span> time and <span class="highlight">gradually</span> <span class="highlight">evolve</span> interlocking habits and interests.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="highlight">Primary</span> groups are <span class="highlight">fundamental</span> to us and to society. First, <span class="highlight">primary</span> groups are <span class="highlight">critical</span> to the socialization <span class="highlight">process</span>. <span class="highlight">Within</span> them, infants and children are introduced to the ways of their society. Such groups are the <span class="highlight">breeding</span> grounds in which we <span class="highlight">acquire</span> the norms and values that equip us for social life. <span class="question8">Sociologists view <span class="highlight">primary</span> groups as bridges between individuals and the larger society because they <span class="highlight">transmit</span>, <span class="highlight">mediate</span>, and <span class="highlight">interpret</span> a society's cultural patterns and provide the <span class="highlight">sense</span> of oneness so <span class="highlight">critical</span> for social solidarity.</span></p>
          <p>
            <span class="highlight">Second</span>, <span class="highlight">primary</span> groups are <span class="highlight">fundamental</span> because they provide the settings in which we meet most of our <span class="highlight">personal</span> needs.  <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> <span class="highlight">Within</span> them, we experience companionship, love, <span class="highlight">security</span>,
and an <span class="highlight">overall</span> <span class="highlight">sense</span> of well-being.  <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>Not surprisingly, sociologists find that the strength of a group's <span class="highlight">primary</span> ties has implications for the group's functioning.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>For example, the stronger the <span class="highlight">primary</span> group ties of a sports team playing together, the better their <span class="highlight">record</span> is.  <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p>
          <p>Third, <span class="highlight">primary</span> groups are <span class="highlight">fundamental</span> because they serve as powerful instruments for social control. Their members <span class="highlight">command</span> and <span class="highlight">dispense</span> many of the rewards that are so <span class="highlight">vital</span> to us and that make our lives <span class="highlight">seem</span> <span class="highlight">worthwhile</span>. Should the use of rewards fail, members can frequently win by rejecting or threatening to ostracize those who <span class="highlight"><span class="question10">deviate</span></span> from the <span class="highlight">primary</span> group's norms. For <span class="highlight">instance</span>, some social groups <span class="highlight">employ</span> shunning (a person can <span class="highlight">remain</span> in the <span class="highlight">community</span>, but others are forbidden to <span class="highlight">interact</span> with the person) as a <span class="highlight">device</span> to bring into <span class="highlight">line</span> individuals whose <span class="highlight">behavior</span> goes beyond that allowed by the <span class="highlight">particular</span> group. <span class="highlight">Even</span> more important, <span class="highlight">primary</span> groups <span class="highlight">define</span> social reality for us by structuring our experiences. By providing us with definitions of situations, they <span class="highlight">elicit</span> from our <span class="highlight">behavior</span> that conforms to group-devised meanings. <span class="highlight">Primary</span> groups, then, serve both as carriers of social norms and as enforcers of them.</p>

              <p>C. Asked about the organizational structure of this article, the questions of the full text should focus on the beginning of each paragraph. The original text first proposed two relations, then said an expressive tie and an instrumental tie, and finally said the conditions of the primary group. The opposing opposition relationship mentioned by B is obviously wrong. The original text is only to compare the relationship between the two, and the former may be produced by the latter; A's theory and practice are totally silent on the original, and it is also said that the comparison is not right; the cause and effect of D is The original did not say anything. The author defines two groups and two ties, so C said that the definition concept is correct, and the author has an explanation after defining the concept, so C is correct.</p>

              <p>This question is not typical, because the author used the fourth to seventh paragraphs of the article to describe primary, but only the second and third paragraphs refer to secondary, and the description of the two groups is cross-cutted in this article. The main part is in the second and third paragraphs, but the description of these two paragraphs is also primary after primary, so the order is still there. The fourth and fifth sentences of the third paragraph correspond to the two answers of existinging and viewing, respectively, so the two answers belong to secondary; the second and third sentences of the third sentence correspond to provided answers, and the third and the second sentence correspond to involving answers. The third and fourth sentences of the last paragraph correspond to the developing option, which is easily selected by combining the answers to the 11 questions.</p>
