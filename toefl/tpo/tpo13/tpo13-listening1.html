            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.55" data-time="7.66">[00:07.66]</span>Professor: Good afternoon, Alex. <span class="time" data-times="1.49" data-time="11.21">[00:11.21]</span>Can I help you with something?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.38" data-time="12.7">[00:12.70]</span>Man: Well, I <span class="highlight">wanted</span> to talk with you about the research <span class="highlight">project</span> you assigned today. <span class="time" data-times="3.64" data-time="17.08">[00:17.08]</span>I, um, hope you could <span class="highlight">clarify</span> a few things for me.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.56" data-time="20.72">[00:20.72]</span>Professor: I'll certainly try.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.33" data-time="22.28">[00:22.28]</span>Man: OK, all we have to do is do two observations and take notes on them, right?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.39" data-time="27.61">[00:27.61]</span>Professor: Oh, that's a start, but you'll need to do some research, too. <span class="time" data-times="7.26" data-time="32">[00:32.00]</span>Then you'll write a paper that's not so much about the observations but a <span class="highlight">synthesis</span> of what you observed and read.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.21" data-time="39.26">[00:39.26]</span>Man: OK, and what about the children I am supposed to <span class="highlight">observe</span>?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.92" data-time="43.47">[00:43.47]</span>Professor: Not children, a single child observed twice.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.82" data-time="47.39">[00:47.39]</span>Man: Oh, OK! So I should choose a child, with the <span class="highlight">permission</span> of the child's parents, of <span class="highlight">course</span>, and then <span class="highlight">observe</span> that child a <span class="highlight">couple</span> of times and take good notes, then?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="13.32" data-time="57.21">[00:57.21]</span>Professor: Actually, after your first <span class="highlight">observation</span>, you'll go back and look <span class="highlight">through</span> your textbook or go to the library and find a few sources concerning the <span class="highlight">stage</span> of <span class="highlight">development</span> this <span class="highlight">particular</span> child is in. <span class="time" data-times="8.78" data-time="70.53">[01:10.53]</span>And then, with that knowledge, you'll make a <span class="highlight">second</span> <span class="highlight">observation</span> of the same child to see if the expected developmental behaviors are exhibited.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.68" data-time="79.31">[01:19.31]</span>Man: Can you give me an example?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="11.36" data-time="80.99">[01:20.99]</span>Professor: Well, uh, if you <span class="highlight">observe</span> a four-year-old child, uh, for example, my daughter's four years old, you might read up on Piaget's Stages of <span class="highlight">Cognitive</span> <span class="highlight">Development</span>. <span class="time" data-times="1.56" data-time="92.35">[01:32.35]</span>We covered those in class.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="0.63" data-time="93.91">[01:33.91]</span>Man: Uh huh.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.7" data-time="94.54">[01:34.54]</span>Professor: Most likely, what <span class="highlight">stage</span> would a child of that age be in?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.11" data-time="99.24">[01:39.24]</span>Man: Um, the pre-operational <span class="highlight">stage</span>?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.49" data-time="102.35">[01:42.35]</span>Professor: Exactly! If that's the case, her language use would be maturing and her memory and imagination would be developed.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.75" data-time="110.84">[01:50.84]</span>Man: So she might play pretend, like she can pretend when driving her toy car <span class="highlight">across</span> the couch that the couch is actually a bridge or something.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="0.95" data-time="119.59">[01:59.59]</span>Professor: That's right! <span class="time" data-times="4.47" data-time="120.54">[02:00.54]</span>In <span class="highlight">addition</span>, her thinking would be <span class="highlight">primarily</span> egocentric.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.04" data-time="125.01">[02:05.01]</span>Man: So she'd be thinking mostly about herself and her own needs and might not be able to see things from anyone else's <span class="highlight">perspective</span>?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="0.78999999999999" data-time="132.05">[02:12.05]</span>Professor: Um hmm.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.98" data-time="132.84">[02:12.84]</span>Man: But, what if she doesn't? <span class="time" data-times="3.16" data-time="134.82">[02:14.82]</span>I mean, what if she doesn't <span class="highlight">demonstrate</span> those behaviors?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.04" data-time="137.98">[02:17.98]</span>Professor: That's fine. <span class="time" data-times="1.78" data-time="139.02">[02:19.02]</span>You'll note that in your paper. <span class="time" data-times="8.68" data-time="140.8">[02:20.80]</span>See, your paper should <span class="highlight">compare</span> what is expected of children at certain <span class="highlight">stage</span> of <span class="highlight">development</span> with what you actually <span class="highlight">observe</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.58" data-time="149.48">[02:29.48]</span>Man: OK. I have one more question, though.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="0.82" data-time="152.06">[02:32.06]</span>Professor: And what's that?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.18" data-time="152.88">[02:32.88]</span>Man: Where can I find a child to <span class="highlight">observe</span>?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.82" data-time="155.06">[02:35.06]</span>Professor: Um, I'd suggest you <span class="highlight">contact</span> the Education <span class="highlight">Department</span> <span class="highlight">secretary</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.11" data-time="158.88">[02:38.88]</span>She has a <span class="highlight">list</span> of contacts of various schools and with certain families who are somehow connected to the University. <span class="time" data-times="3.47" data-time="165.99">[02:45.99]</span>Sometimes they are willing to help out students with projects like yours.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.76" data-time="169.46">[02:49.46]</span>Man: OK, I'll stop by the Education <span class="highlight">Department</span> Office this afternoon.</p>
