            <b>Perceptual Constancy</b>
          </h4>
          <p>How an object affects our senses depends in part on external conditions, and these conditions are always changing. An object viewed from one angle presents a different shapes to our eye than when viewed from another angle; similarity, as the distance from which we view an object changes, the object will appear larger or smaller. In spite of this, even as conditions change and we see objects differently, we still recognize that they remain the same. This is what is known as perceptual constancy. If not for perceptual constancy, we might have difficulty recognizing familiar objects if we viewed them in a new and different context.</p>

          <p>Now listen to part of a lecture on this topic in a psychology class.</p>
          <p>(Male Professor) Let's take an everyday example an ordinary round plate like you'd find in a kitchen. If you hold the plate directly in front of your face and look at it, what shape do you see? A perfect circle, right?Suppose you tilt the plate to a different angle, to a horizontal position, like you're planning to put food on it, still a perfect circle? No! The circle is now stretched out, flattened into an oval. Do you conclude the plate had actually changed shape? Or that it's a different object, not the same plate? Of course not! It looks different, but we perceive it as still being the same.Here's a different example. This classroom we're in. It's fairly large, right? Now, from up close, from the front row, I appear to be relatively big, bigger than if you're in the last row, right? But let's say you're sitting in the front row today but tomorrow you're sitting in the back row. From back there I''m going to look smaller, but you don't think I've actually gotten smaller. Yo u don't think you're seeing a different professor, a guy who looks like me except he's smaller. No matter where you are, up close or far away, you understand without even thinking about it, that I'm the same size, the same person.</p>

        <article>
          <p>Perceptual constancy is the phenomenon that however the external conditions affect our perception of an object, we still recognize it. According to the professor, there're two examples of this. The first one is about angle. When you hold a plate upright to your face, you see a perfect circle. But if a plate is placed horizontally, it stretches out, and flattens into an oval. Anyway, no matter what shape we see, we always know that it's the same plate because of perceptual constancy. Another example is about distance. We all know that if someone is far away from us, he/she appears smaller. Otherwise he/she appears bigger and taller. So if a student sits in the front row, he'll see a bigger and taller professor. But if he sits in the back, he will see a smaller professor. Bigger or smaller he still knows that it's the same professor due to perceptual constancy. (158 words)</p>
