In recent years, however, the sale of fossils, particularly of dinosaurs and other large vertebrates, has grown into a big business. Rare and important fossils are now being sold to private ownership for millions of dollars. This is an unfortunate development for both scientists and the general public.</p><p>The public suffers because fossils that would otherwise be donated to museums where everyone can see them are sold to private collectors who do not allow the public to view their collections. Making it harder for the public to see fossils can lead to a decline in public interest in fossils, which would be a pity.</p><p>More importantly, scientists are likely to lose access to some of the most important fossils and thereby miss out on potentially crucial discoveries about extinct life forms. Wealthy fossil buyers with a desire to own the rarest and most important fossils can spend virtually limitless amounts of money to acquire them. Scientists and the museums and universities they work for often cannot compete successfully for fossils against millionaire fossil buyers.</p><p>Moreover, commercial fossil collectors often destroy valuable scientific evidence associated with the fossils they unearth. Most commercial fossil collectors are untrained or uninterested in carrying out the careful field work and documentation that reveal the most about animal life in the past. For example, scientists have learned about the biology of nest-building dinosaurs called oviraptors by carefully observing the exact position of oviraptor fossils in the ground and the presence of other fossils in the immediate surroundings. Commercial fossil collectors typically pay no attention to how fossils lie in the ground or to the smaller fossils that may surround bigger ones. </p></article><div><audio src="tpo13-writing1.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></div><article id="listening-passage" class="passage"><h3>Listening Text</h3><p>Professor：Of course there are some negative consequences of selling fossils in the commercial market, but they have been greatly exaggerated. The benefits of commercial fossil trade greatly outweigh the disadvantages.First of all, the public is likely to have greater exposure to fossils as a result of commercial fossil trade, not less exposure. Commercial fossil hunting makes a lot of fossils available for purchase, and as a result, even low level public institutions like public schools and libraries can now routinely buy interesting fossils and display them for the public.As for the idea that scientists will lose access to really important fossils, that's not realistic either. Before anyone can put a value on a fossil, it needs to be scientifically identified, right? Well, the only people who can identify fossils, who can really tell what a given fossil is or isn't, are scientists, by performing detailed examinations and tests on the fossils themselves. So even if a fossil is destined to go to a private collector, it has to pass through the hands of scientific experts first. This way, the scientific community is not going to miss out on anything important that's out there.Finally, whatever damage commercial fossil collectors sometimes do, if it weren't for them, many fossils would simply go undiscovered because there aren't that many fossil collecting operations that are run by universities and other scientific institutions. Isn't it better for science to at least have more fossils being found even if we don't have all the scientific data we'd like to have about their location and surroundings than it is to have many fossils go completely undiscovered? </p></article><section id="question"><h4>Question</h4><p>Summarize the points made in the lecture, being sure to explain how they oppose specific points made in the reading passage.</p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>The extended family was of great importance in the good old days, but is it still of great importance in our modern society? In my point of view, though the extended family is still important, it is really less important that it was before because of the development of the new society.</p><p>One of the important uses of the extended family is to help with family affairs and housework. Meanwhile, nowadays people tend to turn to the community service to help with housework. Under this circumstance, we can hire someone else, who doesn't belong to our whole family, to help us with family work. For instance, my mom was brought up with the help of her grandparents. But I was taken care of by the baby-sitter, whom may parents hired from the community service center. The community service center provides good service with a reasonable price.</p><p>Another important thing that extended family can to is to provide information to and educate family members. However, in the modern society, we have schools to get our education. We have several methods, such as Television and Internet, to get information. These are resources which can be easily had access to. We do not depend on our family members to get knowledge of the world we live in any longer.</p><p>In addition, nowadays people tend to live alone with their small care family rather than live with many family members within a big family. Therefore, we have our own circle of communication and we have less in common between different families. Taking my own family as an example, my family and my uncle's are living in the different cities. We usually get together only on Spring Festival. We have different friends and interest, so sometimes we just find it hard to have something in common. Thus, if we really have something in trouble, we can hardly turn to them for help.</p><p>All in all, although extended family is still essential to us to some extent it is less useful with the development of the modern society. The importance of extended family is now fading.</p></article></div></main></body></html>
