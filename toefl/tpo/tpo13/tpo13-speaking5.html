My mom said I could borrow her van, you know, so everyone would fit, but unfortunately, it broke down, and it's not gonna be repaired in time for the trip.</p><p>(woman) Oh! So what're you going to do? Can you rent a van?</p><p>(man) Yeah, that's a possibility. A little risky for me, though. I've tried to get in touch with the club members but only four have gotten back to me and said they could contribute some money for the cause.</p><p>(woman) What about the other members?</p><p>(man) I don't know! It'd probably be OK with them, but that's the risk. I don't know for sure. I don't what to get stuck with having to pay for most of the bill.</p><p>(woman) Well, since not everyone has gotten back to you, what don 't you just postpone the trip, you know, until your mom's van's been repaired?</p><p>(man) Yeah, I could do that, though I'm sure everyone would be disappointed when they show up tomorrow read y to go and found out that we're not going.</p></article><section id="question"><h4>Question</h4><p>The speakers discuss two possible solutions to the man's problem. Briefly summarize the problem then state which solution you recommend and explain why. </p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>Actually, the man's problem is that her mom's van is down, so he couldn't take his club members to see the exhibit tomorrow. The woman offers two suggestions for the man: he could rent a van for that trip or he could postpone the trip till his mom's car gets fixed up. Well, I think the man could rent a van. First, nobody would blame him, for not using his mom's car, which indeed is a quite understandable emergency, since no one would share a trip on a van that needs repairing. Secondly, I am sure his friends, the club members would be glad to share the rent and the gas fee when they get together. After all, their purpose is to enjoy the special exhibit not to take advantage of the man's free ride. So I think the man should rent a car. (144 words)</p></article></div></main></body></html>
