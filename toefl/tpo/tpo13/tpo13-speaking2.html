Others prefer to mainly use printed materials such as books and academic journals. Which do you prefer and why?</p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>I prefer to use Internet to look for information for the following two reasons. First, it's very fast to find the information from Internet. Since now we have many search engines such as Google and Bing, we just need to input key words and the results will be listed on the screen. From the results, we can always find the information related to the research project. Second, Internet has way more information than do printed materials. Nearly all printed materials now have e-version online.With may scientific databases, we can always find what we need by title, author or even content. So, when we are doing research project, Internet is more convenient than printed materials.</p></article></div></main></body></html>
