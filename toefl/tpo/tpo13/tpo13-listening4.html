            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.17" data-time="6.64">[00:06.64]</span>Student: Hi, I'm not sure, but, um, is this the Carter language lab? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="0.99" data-time="11.81">[00:11.81]</span>Language Lab Manager: Yes, it is. <span class="time" data-times="1.2" data-time="12.8">[00:12.80]</span>How can I help you? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.51" data-time="14">[00:14.00]</span>Student: I'm taking first year Spanish this <span class="underline">semester</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.07" data-time="16.51">[00:16.51]</span>Our professor says we need to come here to view a <span class="underline">series</span> of videos. <span class="time" data-times="3.72" data-time="19.58">[00:19.58]</span>I think it's called "Spanish Working On Your <span class="underline">Accent</span>"? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="0.94" data-time="23.3">[00:23.30]</span>Language Lab Manager: Yes, we have that. <span class="time" data-times="1.88" data-time="24.24">[00:24.24]</span>Um, they are on the wall behind you. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.39" data-time="26.12">[00:26.12]</span>Student: OK, so I can just take, can I take the whole <span class="underline">series</span> home? <span class="time" data-times="1.67" data-time="30.51">[00:30.51]</span>I think there are three of them. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.46" data-time="32.18">[00:32.18]</span>Language Lab Manager: I guess you <span class="underline">haven</span>'t been here before. </p>

              <span class="time" data-times="3.76" data-time="36.31">[00:36.31]</span>Language Lab Manager: OK, well, you have to watch the videos here. <span class="time" data-times="4.81" data-time="40.07">[00:40.07]</span>You need to sign in to <span class="underline">reserve</span> an open room, and sign out the video you need. <span class="time" data-times="2.43" data-time="44.88">[00:44.88]</span>Just start with the first one in the <span class="underline">series</span>. <span class="time" data-times="1.64" data-time="47.31">[00:47.31]</span>Each video is half-an-hour long. </p>

              <span class="time" data-times="3" data-time="48.95">[00:48.95]</span>Student: So it's a video library, basically? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.53" data-time="51.95">[00:51.95]</span>Language Lab Manager: Yes, but unlike the library, you can't take any videos out of the lab. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.6" data-time="56.48">[00:56.48]</span>Student: OK, so how long can I use a video room for? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.01" data-time="60.08">[01:00.08]</span>Language Lab Manager: You can sign out for two hours at a time. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.71" data-time="62.09">[01:02.09]</span>Student: Oh, good. So I can watch more than one video when I come up here. <span class="time" data-times="2.12" data-time="65.8">[01:05.80]</span>Is the lab <span class="underline">pretty</span> busy all the time? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.42" data-time="67.92">[01:07.92]</span>Language Lab Manager: Well, rooms are usually full right after dinner time. <span class="time" data-times="3.66" data-time="71.34">[01:11.34]</span>Um, but you can sign up the day before to <span class="underline">reserve</span> a room if you want. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.88" data-time="75">[01:15.00]</span>Student: The day before, but I can just stop in, too, to see if there's any room open, right? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2" data-time="81.88">[01:21.88]</span>Language Lab Manager: Sure, stop in anytime. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.14" data-time="83.88">[01:23.88]</span>Student: Umm, what about copies of the videos? <span class="time" data-times="2.41" data-time="86.02">[01:26.02]</span>Is there just one copy of each in the <span class="underline">series</span>? <span class="time" data-times="2.42" data-time="88.43">[01:28.43]</span>I don't want to miss out if everyone comes in at once. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.6" data-time="90.85">[01:30.85]</span>Language Lab Manager: Oh, no. We have several copies of each tape in the Spanish <span class="underline">accent</span> <span class="underline">series</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.6" data-time="95.45">[01:35.45]</span>We usually have <span class="underline">multiple</span> copies of everything for each video collection. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.77" data-time="99.05">[01:39.05]</span>Student: Super! So how many rooms are there total in the lab? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="0.68000000000001" data-time="102.82">[01:42.82]</span>Language Lab Manager: Twenty. <span class="time" data-times="7.02" data-time="103.5">[01:43.50]</span>They are <span class="underline">pretty</span> small, so we <span class="underline">normally</span> get one person or no more than a small group of people in there watching a video together. <span class="time" data-times="5.75" data-time="110.52">[01:50.52]</span>Actually, someone else from your class just came in and took the first Spanish video in to watch. <span class="time" data-times="2.67" data-time="116.27">[01:56.27]</span>You could probably run in there and watch it with him. <span class="time" data-times="8.72" data-time="118.94">[01:58.94]</span>Of <span class="underline">course</span>, you're welcome to have you own room, but sometimes students like to watch with their classmates so they can <span class="underline">review</span> the <span class="underline">material</span> with each other afterwards. <span class="time" data-times="4.15" data-time="127.66">[02:07.66]</span>For example, if there was some <span class="underline">content</span> they didn't really understand. </p>

              <span class="time" data-times="2.46" data-time="131.81">[02:11.81]</span>Student: I guess I <span class="underline">prefer</span> my own room. <span class="time" data-times="1.93" data-time="134.27">[02:14.27]</span>I <span class="underline">concentrate</span> better by myself. <span class="time" data-times="4.6" data-time="136.2">[02:16.20]</span>And I don't want to miss anything, and he's probably already started watching it. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.23" data-time="140.8">[02:20.80]</span>Language Lab Manager: No problem. <span class="time" data-times="2.3" data-time="142.03">[02:22.03]</span>We've got a lot of rooms open right now. <span class="time" data-times="5.17" data-time="144.33">[02:24.33]</span>When you come in, you sign your name on the <span class="underline">list</span> and assigned a room number. <span class="time" data-times="3.76" data-time="149.5">[02:29.50]</span>Or if you call in <span class="underline">advance</span>, the attendant will tell you your room number. <span class="time" data-times="3.03" data-time="153.26">[02:33.26]</span>If you forget, just come in and take a look at the <span class="underline">list</span>. <span class="time" data-times="1.36" data-time="156.29">[02:36.29]</span>The videos are over there. </p>
