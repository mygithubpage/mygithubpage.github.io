            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.79" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in a <span class="underline">poetry</span> class. <span class="time" data-times="3.7" data-time="3.79">[00:03.79]</span>The professor is discussing <span class="underline">medieval</span> <span class="underline">poetry</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.38" data-time="7.49">[00:07.49]</span>
              <span class="underline">Male</span> professor: OK. So the two poems we are looking at today fall into the <span class="underline">category</span> of <span class="underline">medieval</span> times, which was how long ago?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.43" data-time="17.87">[00:17.87]</span>
              <span class="underline">Female</span> student: Almost a thousand years ago, right?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.51" data-time="20.3">[00:20.30]</span>Professor: Yes, that's right.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.36" data-time="21.81">[00:21.81]</span>
              <span class="underline">Female</span> student: But, professor, are you sure these were poems? <span class="time" data-times="2.76" data-time="25.17">[00:25.17]</span>I mean, I thought poems were shorter. <span class="time" data-times="2.55" data-time="27.93">[00:27.93]</span>These were more like long stories. <span class="time" data-times="10.77" data-time="30.48">[00:30.48]</span>I mean, one of them was all about love but the other one that chan... whatever it's called, the other one, it was all about fighting and battles. <span class="time" data-times="3.97" data-time="41.25">[00:41.25]</span>I mean, can both of them be considered poems?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.28" data-time="45.22">[00:45.22]</span>Professor: Well, think back to the very beginning of this <span class="underline">course</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="0.78" data-time="49.5">[00:49.50]</span>
              <span class="underline">Female</span> student: Uh huh?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.61" data-time="50.28">[00:50.28]</span>Professor: Remember how we, uh, we <span class="underline">define</span> <span class="underline">poetry</span>? <span class="time" data-times="16.1" data-time="53.89">[00:53.89]</span>In the very broadest <span class="underline">sense</span>, um, we said, it's written to <span class="underline">evoke</span>, uh, that to make you, the <span class="underline">audience</span>, have some kind of <span class="underline">emotional</span> experience <span class="underline">through</span> the use of imagery. <span class="time" data-times="12.03" data-time="69.99">[01:09.99]</span>Uh, some kind of <span class="underline">predictable</span> <span class="underline">rhythm</span> and usually but not always there's more than one meaning implied with the words that are used.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.68" data-time="82.02">[01:22.02]</span>Let's start with the chanson <span class="underline">poetry</span> first. That's chanson. <span class="time" data-times="7" data-time="89.7">[01:29.70]</span>Chanson poems became <span class="underline">popular</span> in Europe, particularly in France. <span class="time" data-times="8.73" data-time="96.7">[01:36.70]</span>And the <span class="underline">term</span> is actually short for a longer French phrase that translates to, uh, songs of deeds. <span class="time" data-times="14.32" data-time="105.43">[01:45.43]</span>And now they were called songs of deeds because, strangely enough, they were written to <span class="underline">describe</span> the <span class="underline">heroic</span> deeds or actions of warriors, the knights during conflicts.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.12" data-time="119.75">[01:59.75]</span>We don't know a lot about the authors. <span class="time" data-times="8.53" data-time="122.87">[02:02.87]</span>Um, it's still contested <span class="underline">somewhat</span>, but we're <span class="underline">pretty</span> sure about who the chanson poems were written for. <span class="time" data-times="8.88" data-time="131.4">[02:11.40]</span>Um, that is, they were written for knights and the lords, uh, the nobilities that they served. <span class="time" data-times="12.64" data-time="140.28">[02:20.28]</span>The poems were sung, uh, performed by a minstrel, a singer who traveled from castle to castle, uh, singing to the <span class="underline">local</span> lord and his knights. <span class="time" data-times="8.95" data-time="152.92">[02:32.92]</span>Um, well, uh, would someone <span class="underline">summarize</span> the main features of the chanson poem you read?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="12.98" data-time="161.87">[02:41.87]</span>
              <span class="underline">Male</span> student: Well, there's a hero, a knight, who goes to battle and he's admired by his courage, bravery and loyalty, loyalty to the lord he serves, his country and his <span class="underline">fellow</span> warriors. <span class="time" data-times="14.25" data-time="174.85">[02:54.85]</span>In the <span class="underline">field</span>, he's, uh, he has, uh, he's a skilled fighter warring the most <span class="underline">extreme</span> danger; um, <span class="underline">sacrificial</span>, willing to sacrifice anything and everything to protect his king and country.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="11.61" data-time="189.1">[03:09.10]</span>Professor: OK, now, <span class="underline">given</span> that the intended <span class="underline">audience</span> for these poems were knights and lords, what can we say about the purpose of chanson <span class="underline">poetry</span>? <span class="time" data-times="4.57" data-time="200.71">[03:20.71]</span>What kinds of feelings was it meant to <span class="underline">provoke</span>?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="16.71" data-time="205.28">[03:25.28]</span>
              <span class="underline">Female</span> student: I guess they must have been really <span class="underline">appealing</span> to those knights and lords who were listening to them, hearing the songs probably made them feel more patriotic, made them feel it was like a good and noble thing to serve their countries in whatever way they could.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.11" data-time="221.99">[03:41.99]</span>Professor: Good! Uh, we've got a <span class="underline">pretty</span> good picture of what the chanson hero was like. <span class="time" data-times="4.89" data-time="228.1">[03:48.10]</span>Now, let's <span class="underline">compare</span> that to the hero in the other poem. <span class="time" data-times="5.12" data-time="232.99">[03:52.99]</span>The other poem is an example of what's called romance <span class="underline">poetry</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.85" data-time="238.11">[03:58.11]</span>And the hero in the romance poem was also a knight. <span class="time" data-times="8.11" data-time="242.96">[04:02.96]</span>But what made the knight in romance <span class="underline">poetry</span> different from the knight in chanson <span class="underline">poetry</span>?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.37" data-time="251.07">[04:11.07]</span>Well, first, the purpose of the hero's <span class="underline">action</span> was different. <span class="time" data-times="13.22" data-time="257.44">[04:17.44]</span>Uh, the hero in romance <span class="underline">poetry</span> is <span class="underline">independent</span>, purely <span class="underline">solitary</span> in a way, not like the chanson poet who was always surrounded by his fighting companions. <span class="time" data-times="5.69" data-time="270.66">[04:30.66]</span>Um, he doesn't <span class="underline">engage</span> in <span class="underline">conflict</span> to protect his lord or country. <span class="time" data-times="10.34" data-time="276.35">[04:36.35]</span>He does it for the <span class="underline">sake</span> of <span class="underline">adventure</span>, to <span class="underline">improve</span> himself, to show he's worthy of <span class="underline">respect</span> and love from his lady. <span class="time" data-times="8.21" data-time="286.69">[04:46.69]</span>He's very <span class="underline">conscious</span> of the <span class="underline">particular</span> rules of social behaviors he has to live up to somehow. <span class="time" data-times="10.73" data-time="294.9">[04:54.90]</span>And all of his actions are for the purpose of proving that he is, uh, an upright, <span class="underline">moral</span>, well-mannered, well-behaved <span class="underline">individual</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.65" data-time="305.63">[05:05.63]</span>You may have noticed that in chanson <span class="underline">poetry</span>, there isn't much about the hero's feelings. <span class="time" data-times="3.75" data-time="312.28">[05:12.28]</span>Uh, the <span class="underline">focus</span> is on the actions, the deeds. <span class="time" data-times="17.87" data-time="316.03">[05:16.03]</span>Uh, but the romance <span class="underline">poetry</span> describes a lot of the <span class="underline">inner</span> feelings, the, uh, motivations, <span class="underline">psychology</span>, you could say, of a knight trying to <span class="underline">improve</span> himself, to better himself so that he's worthy of the love of a woman.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.51" data-time="333.9">[05:33.90]</span>What explains this <span class="underline">difference</span>? <span class="time" data-times="5.06" data-time="336.41">[05:36.41]</span>Well, digging into the historical <span class="underline">context</span> tells us a lot. <span class="time" data-times="5.94" data-time="341.47">[05:41.47]</span>Um, romance <span class="underline">poetry</span> emerged a few generations after chanson. <span class="time" data-times="9.79" data-time="347.41">[05:47.41]</span>And its roots were in geographic regions of France that were calmer, where <span class="underline">conflict</span> wasn't central to people's lives. <span class="time" data-times="9.3" data-time="357.2">[05:57.20]</span>Uh, more peaceful times meant there was more time for education, uh, travel, more time for <span class="underline">reflection</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.15" data-time="366.5">[06:06.50]</span>Another name for romance <span class="underline">poetry</span> that's often synonymous with it is troubadour <span class="underline">poetry</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.47" data-time="374.65">[06:14.65]</span>Troubadours were the authors of these new romance poems. <span class="time" data-times="12.55" data-time="380.12">[06:20.12]</span>And we know a lot more about the troubadours than we do about the chanson authors because they often had small biographical sketches added to their poems. <span class="time" data-times="10.56" data-time="392.67">[06:32.67]</span>That gave <span class="underline">pretty</span> <span class="underline">specific</span> information about their social <span class="underline">status</span>, uh, <span class="underline">geographical</span> location and a small <span class="underline">outline</span> of their <span class="underline">career</span>. <span class="time" data-times="21.29" data-time="403.23">[06:43.23]</span>This information wasn't particularly <span class="underline">reliable</span> because they were sometimes based on fictitious stories of great <span class="underline">adventure</span> or scrapped together from parts of different poems, but there is enough there to <span class="underline">squeeze</span>, or, uh, infer some facts about their social class.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="16.51" data-time="424.52">[07:04.52]</span>The <span class="underline">political</span> <span class="underline">climate</span> had settled down enough so that, um, troubadours had the <span class="underline">luxury</span> of being able to spend most, if not all of their time, creating, uh, crafting, or composing their love songs for their audiences. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="441.03">[07:21.03]</span>And, yes, these poems were also sung, many troubadours were able to make a living being full-time poets, which should tell you something about the value of that <span class="underline">profession</span> during <span class="underline">medieval</span> times.</p>
