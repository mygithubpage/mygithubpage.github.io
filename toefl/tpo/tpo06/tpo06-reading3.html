The <span class="highlight">sheer</span><span class="highlight">passage</span> of time does not <span class="highlight">account</span> for it; adults have excellent <span class="highlight">recognition</span> of pictures of people who attended high school with them 35 years earlier. Another seemingly <span class="highlight"><span class="question2">plausible</span></span> explanation-that infants do not form <span class="highlight">enduring</span> memories at this point in <span class="highlight">development</span>-also is incorrect. Children two and a half to three years old remember experiences that occurred in their first year, and eleven month olds remember some events a year later. Nor does the <span class="highlight">hypothesis</span> that infantile <span class="highlight">amnesia</span> reflects repression-or holding back-of sexually charged episodes explain the <span class="highlight"><span class="question3">phenomenon</span></span>. While such repression may <span class="highlight">occur</span>, people cannot remember ordinary events from the <span class="highlight">infant</span> and toddler periods either.</p><p>Three other explanations <span class="highlight">seem</span> more <span class="highlight">promising</span>. One involves <span class="highlight">physiological</span> changes <span class="highlight">relevant</span> to memory. Maturation of the frontal lobes of the brain continues <span class="highlight">throughout</span> early childhood, and this part of the brain may be <span class="highlight">critical</span> for remembering <span class="highlight">particular</span> episodes in ways that can be retrieved later. Demonstrations of infants' and toddlers' long-term memory have involved their repeating <span class="highlight">motor</span> activities that they had seen or done earlier, such as reaching in the dark for objects, putting a bottle in a doll's mouth, or pulling apart two pieces of a toy. The brain's <span class="highlight">level</span> of <span class="highlight">physiological</span> maturation may support these types of memories, but not ones requiring <span class="highlight">explicit</span><span class="highlight">verbal</span> descriptions.</p><p>A <span class="highlight">second</span> explanation involves the influence of the social world on children's language use. Hearing and telling stories about events may help children store information in ways that will <span class="highlight">endure</span> into later childhood and adulthood. <span class="highlight">Through</span> hearing stories with a <span class="highlight">clear</span> beginning, middle, and ending children may learn to <span class="highlight">extract</span> the gist of events in ways that they will be able to <span class="highlight">describe</span> many years later. Consistent with <span class="question9">this view</span>, parents and children increasingly <span class="highlight">engage</span> in discussions of past events when children are about three years old. However, hearing such stories is not <span class="highlight">sufficient</span> for younger children to form <span class="highlight">enduring</span> memories. Telling such stories to two year olds does not <span class="highlight">seem</span> to produce long-lasting verbalizable memories.</p><p>A third likely explanation for infantile <span class="highlight">amnesia</span> involves incompatibilities between the ways in which infants encode information and the ways in which older children and adults <span class="highlight">retrieve</span> it. Whether people can remember an event depends <span class="question7">critically</span> on the fit between the way in which they earlier encoded the information and the way in which they later <span class="highlight">attempt</span> to <span class="highlight">retrieve</span> it. The better able the person is to reconstruct the <span class="highlight"><span class="question8">perspective</span></span> from which the <span class="highlight">material</span> was encoded, the more likely that <span class="highlight">recall</span> will be successful.</p><p>This view is supported by a <span class="highlight">variety</span> of factors that can create mismatches between very young children's encoding and older children's and adults' retrieval efforts. The world looks very different to a person whose head is only two or three feet above the ground than to one whose head is five or six feet above it. Older children and adults often try to <span class="highlight">retrieve</span> the names of things they saw, but infants would not have encoded the information verbally. General knowledge of categories of events such as a birthday party or a visit to the doctor's office helps older individuals encode their experiences, but again, infants and toddlers are <span class="highlight">unlikely</span> to encode many experiences <span class="highlight">within</span> such knowledge structures.</p><p>These three explanations of infantile <span class="highlight">amnesia</span> are not <span class="highlight">mutually</span><span class="highlight">exclusive</span>; indeed, they support each other. <span class="question11"><span class="highlight">Physiological</span> immaturity may be part of why infants and toddlers do not form extremely <span class="highlight">enduring</span> memories, <span class="highlight">even</span> when they hear stories that <span class="highlight">promote</span> such remembering in preschoolers.</span> Hearing the stories may <span class="highlight">lead</span> preschoolers to encode aspects of events that allow them to form memories they can <span class="highlight">access</span> as adults. Conversely, improved encoding of what they hear may help them better understand and remember stories and thus make the stories more useful for remembering future events. Thus, all three explanations-<span class="highlight">physiological</span> maturation, hearing and producing stories about past events, and improved encoding of key aspects of events-<span class="highlight">seem</span> likely to be involved in overcoming infantile <span class="highlight">amnesia</span>.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What purpose does paragraph 2 serve in the larger discussion of children's inability to recall early experiences?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To argue that theories that are not substantiated by evidence should generally be considered unreliable</p><p>B. To argue that the hypotheses mentioned in paragraph 2 have been more thoroughly researched than have the theories mentioned later in the passage</p><p>C. To explain why some theories about infantile amnesia are wrong before presenting ones more likely to be true</p><p>D. To explain why infantile amnesia is of great interest to researchers</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C. Use inability to recall early experience keywords to locate the first sentence. But this sentence is a problem. We should focus on the answer, that is, the second sentence. The second sentence says that time is not the cause of oblivion, and then another One possible explanation is to give one wrong first and one more possibility, so C is the answer.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question2">plausible</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. flexible</p><p>B. believable</p><p>C. debatable</p><p>D. predictable</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>Plausible: Looks credible. So B's believeable is the correct answer. A is elastic; C is arguable; D is predictable. Corresponding to the original: Another seemingly <span class="question2">plausible</span> explanation-that infants do not form enduring memories at this point in development-also is incorrect. After removing the original text from the original text, it is wrong to say what it looks like. It should obviously look reasonable. Or rather, it should look right, so it should be a positive vocabulary. A variable D is predictable and neutral. Exclusion; C's debatable is even slightly pejorative and even less reliable.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question3">phenomenon</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. exception</p><p>B. repetition</p><p>C. occurrence</p><p>D. idea</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" C"><p>Phenomenon: Phenomenon, thing. A is the exception; B is repetition; C is appearance, time; D is idea. So C's occurrence is correct. The original sentence: Nor does the hypothesis that infantile amnesia reflects repression-or holding back-of sexually charged episodes explain the <span class="question3">phenomenon</span>. The children remember what they were when they were a year old. Eleven-month-old children still remember some of the things that they experienced after one year, so <span class="question3">phenomenon</span> should be talking about these things before, so choose C, A exception B repeat D idea wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>All of the following theories about the inability to recall early experiences are rejected in paragraph 2 EXCEPT:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The ability to recall an event decreases as the time after the event increases.</p><p>B. Young children are not capable of forming memories that last for more than a short time.</p><p>C. People may hold back sexually meaningful memories.</p><p>D. Most events in childhood are too ordinary to be worth remembering.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D EXCEPT questions, exclusion. The time in A is positioned to the first sentence of the second sentence. This reason is excluded. Therefore, A is not selected. The memories in B are located in the third sentence. The content of the insertion language is exactly this option. The original text is also considered unreasonable. , so B right, not selected; C in the sexually distinct memories positioning to the penultimate sentence, has also been ruled out, so C is right, not selected, the wrong is D, election.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does paragraph 3 suggest about long-term memory in children?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Maturation of the frontal lobes of the brain is important for the long-term memory of motor activities but not verbal descriptions.</p><p>B. Young children may form long-term memories of actions they see earlier than of things they hear or are told.</p><p>C. Young children have better long-term recall of short verbal exchanges than of long ones.</p><p>D. Children's long-term recall of motor activities increases when such activities are accompanied by explicit verbal descriptions.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B locates to the penultimate sentence with long-term memory, saying that babies will repeat the actions they see. Then they say that the maturity of the brain leads them to form memories of these, but those that need to be clearly explained are not at this stage. You can't remember what you heard, so B said that it was earlier and correct than what you heard. A wrong, did not say that the verbal description is not important; C / D did not say.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, what role may storytelling play in forming childhood memories?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It may encourage the physiological maturing of the brain.</p><p>B. It may help preschool children tell the difference between ordinary and unusual memories.</p><p>C. It may help preschool children retrieve memories quickly.</p><p>D. It may provide an ordered structure that facilitates memory retrieval.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The storytelling stories about events may help children store information in ways that will endure into later childhood and adulthood. Through hearing stories with a clear beginning, middle, and ending children may Learn to extract the gist of events in ways that they will be able to describe many years later. The second sentence loses helps the children to store information in a specific way, making the memory lasting; the third sentence says so, many years later You can also describe these times. So D's ordered structure and inways are corresponding, and facilitate memory retrieval also fits the generality of these two sentences. is correct. A/B/C did not say anything.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question7">critically</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. fundamentally</p><p>B. partially</p><p>C. consistently</p><p>D. subsequently</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" A"><p>Critically: Critical, important. A is base, essential; B is partially; C is consistently, consistently; D is subsequent. So A's fundamentally correct is fundamentally important. The original sentence: Whether people can remember an event depends on <span class="question7">critically</span> the the fit between the way in which they earlier encoded the information and the way in which they later attempted to retrieve it. Babies recall information in different ways, and then say whether or not to remember how to rely on information to obtain matching. Since the first sentence is just saying this, it means that the whole paragraph is saying this, that is, relying on a large extent. The degree of the B part is not enough, C is always too deep, and D is completely unreliable.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question8">perspective</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. system</p><p>B. theory</p><p>C. source</p><p>D. viewpoint</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" D"><p>D <span class="question8">perspective</span>: Perspectives, <span class="question8">perspective</span>s, and prospects. So D's viewpoint is correct. A is the system; B is the theory; C is the source.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The phrase "<span class="highlight">This view</span>" in the passage refers to the belief that</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. the ability to retrieve a memory partly depends on the similarity between the encoding and retrieving process</p><p>B. the process of encoding information is less complex for adults than it is for young adults and infants</p><p>C. infants and older children are equally dependent on discussion of past events for the retrieval of information</p><p>D. infants encode information in the same way older children and adults do</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="This view A"><p>A at the beginning is a view of this, indicating that it must be related to the previous paragraph. This view represents the viewpoint of the previous paragraph. The above paragraph says that babies are forgotten because adults and babies decode and obtain information in different ways, so the answer is obviously A; B and C did not mention, D said, it should be different.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraphs 5 and 6, one disadvantage very young children face in processing information is that they cannot</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. process a lot of information at one time</p><p>B. organize experiences according to type</p><p>C. block out interruptions</p><p>D. interpret the tone of adult language</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Both paragraphs 5 and 6 say that adults and children are different from infants in the way they parse information. The sixth paragraph gives concrete examples. The answer in the last sentence: General knowledge of categories of events such as a birthday party or a Visit to the doctor's office soon because people encode their experiences, but again, infants and toddlers are unlikely to encode many experiences within such knowledge structures. Saying that adult and older children's common sense about categories can help them parse information, but children cannot, That is, children are not classified, so B is the answer and nothing else.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Incomplete physiological development may partly explain why hearing stories does not improve long-term memory in infants and toddlers.</p><p>B. One reason why preschoolers fail to comprehend the stories they hear is that they are physiologically immature.</p><p>C. Given the chance to hear stories, infants and toddlers may form enduring memories despite physiological immaturity.</p><p>D. Physiologically mature children seem to have no difficulty remembering stories they heard as preschoolers.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A: This sentence is relatively simple. The main logic is to make adverbial clauses. The reason immaturity is do not form enduring memories is that even if you listen to theories, A is correct. B is mistaken in changing the structure of the original text. The result of the original text is do not form enduring memories, B is changed into comprehend stories; C is opposite to the part after the original even number; D does not say, attention cannot be inferred.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>How does paragraph 7 relate to the earlier discussion of infantile amnesia?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It introduces a new theory about the causes of infantile amnesia.</p><p>B. It argues that particular theories discussed earlier in the passage require further research.</p><p>C. It explains how particular theories discussed earlier in the passage may work in combination.</p><p>D. It evaluates which of the theories discussed earlier is most likely to be true.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C. Asked the whole paragraph. Look at the beginning and say that the three previous theories are not mutually exclusive, but they support each other. It is clear that C's work in combination is correct, and this paragraph concludes by saying that all explanations suffices to In overcoming, further proof that C is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Other important occasions are school graduations and weddings..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D has only one transition point, but it is enough. Other important occasions must be preceded by some important occasions. The dash before D explains the events, meaningful and distinctive, and gives some examples. It is synonymous substitution of important. So there are some important things before, and others should naturally be placed behind them.</p></div></div><div id="question14" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>There are several possible explanations why people cannot easily remember their early childhoods.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.Preschoolers typically do not recall events from their first year.</p><p>B.Frontal lobe function of the brain may need to develop before memory retrieval can occur.</p><p>C.Children recall physical activities more easily if they are verbalized.</p><p>D.The opportunity to hear chronologically narrated stories may help three-year-old children produce long-lasting memories.</p><p>E.The content of a memory determines the way in which it is encoded.</p><p>F.The contrasting ways in which young children and adults process information may determine their relative success in remembering.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="BDF"><p>The original B.D.F preschoolers option did not say, do not choose. The frontal lobe option corresponds to the second sentence of the third paragraph of the original text, correct. The original options for children did not say, do not choose. The opportunity option corresponds to the second sentence of the fourth paragraph and the second to last sentence of the original text, correct. The content option did not say originally, do not choose. The contrasting ways option corresponds to the first sentence of the fifth paragraph of the original text, correct.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
