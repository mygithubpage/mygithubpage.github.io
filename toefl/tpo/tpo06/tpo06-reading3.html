          <h4 class="w3-center">Infantile Amnesia</h4>
          <p>How might this inability to <span class="highlight">recall</span> early experiences be explained? The <span class="highlight">sheer</span> <span class="highlight">passage</span> of time does not <span class="highlight">account</span> for it; adults have excellent <span class="highlight">recognition</span> of pictures of people who attended high school with them 35 years earlier. Another seemingly <span class="highlight"><span class="question2">plausible</span></span> explanation-that infants do not form <span class="highlight">enduring</span> memories at this point in <span class="highlight">development</span>-also is incorrect. Children two and a half to three years old remember experiences that occurred in their first year, and eleven month olds remember some events a year later. Nor does the <span class="highlight">hypothesis</span> that infantile <span class="highlight">amnesia</span> reflects repression-or holding back-of sexually charged episodes explain the <span class="highlight"><span class="question3">phenomenon</span></span>. While such repression may <span class="highlight">occur</span>, people cannot remember ordinary events from the <span class="highlight">infant</span> and toddler periods either.</p>
          <p>Three other explanations <span class="highlight">seem</span> more <span class="highlight">promising</span>. One involves <span class="highlight">physiological</span> changes <span class="highlight">relevant</span> to memory. Maturation of the frontal lobes of the brain continues <span class="highlight">throughout</span> early childhood, and this part of the brain may be <span class="highlight">critical</span> for remembering <span class="highlight">particular</span> episodes in ways that can be retrieved later. Demonstrations of infants' and toddlers' long-term memory have involved their repeating <span class="highlight">motor</span> activities that they had seen or done earlier, such as reaching in the dark for objects, putting a bottle in a doll's mouth, or pulling apart two pieces of a toy. The brain's <span class="highlight">level</span> of <span class="highlight">physiological</span> maturation may support these types of memories, but not ones requiring <span class="highlight">explicit</span> <span class="highlight">verbal</span> descriptions.</p>
          <p>A <span class="highlight">second</span> explanation involves the influence of the social world on children's language use. Hearing and telling stories about events may help children store information in ways that will <span class="highlight">endure</span> into later childhood and adulthood. <span class="highlight">Through</span> hearing stories with a <span class="highlight">clear</span> beginning, middle, and ending children may learn to <span class="highlight">extract</span> the gist of events in ways that they will be able to <span class="highlight">describe</span> many years later. Consistent with <span class="question9">this view</span>, parents and children increasingly <span class="highlight">engage</span> in discussions of past events when children are about three years old. However, hearing such stories is not <span class="highlight">sufficient</span> for younger children to form <span class="highlight">enduring</span> memories. Telling such stories to two year olds does not <span class="highlight">seem</span> to produce long-lasting verbalizable memories.</p>
          <p>A third likely explanation for infantile <span class="highlight">amnesia</span> involves incompatibilities between the ways in which infants encode information and the ways in which older children and adults <span class="highlight">retrieve</span> it. Whether people can remember an event depends <span class="question7">critically</span> on the fit between the way in which they earlier encoded the information and the way in which they later <span class="highlight">attempt</span> to <span class="highlight">retrieve</span> it. The better able the person is to reconstruct the <span class="highlight"><span class="question8">perspective</span></span> from which the <span class="highlight">material</span> was encoded, the more likely that <span class="highlight">recall</span> will be successful.</p>
          <p>This view is supported by a <span class="highlight">variety</span> of factors that can create mismatches between very young children's encoding and older children's and adults' retrieval efforts. The world looks very different to a person whose head is only two or three feet above the ground than to one whose head is five or six feet above it. Older children and adults often try to <span class="highlight">retrieve</span> the names of things they saw, but infants would not have encoded the information verbally. General knowledge of categories of events such as a birthday party or a visit to the doctor's office helps older individuals encode their experiences, but again, infants and toddlers are <span class="highlight">unlikely</span> to encode many experiences <span class="highlight">within</span> such knowledge structures.</p>
          <p>These three explanations of infantile <span class="highlight">amnesia</span> are not <span class="highlight">mutually</span> <span class="highlight">exclusive</span>; indeed, they support each other. <span class="question11"><span class="highlight">Physiological</span> immaturity may be part of why infants and toddlers do not form extremely <span class="highlight">enduring</span> memories, <span class="highlight">even</span> when they hear stories that <span class="highlight">promote</span> such remembering in preschoolers.</span> Hearing the stories may <span class="highlight">lead</span> preschoolers to encode aspects of events that allow them to form memories they can <span class="highlight">access</span> as adults. Conversely, improved encoding of what they hear may help them better understand and remember stories and thus make the stories more useful for remembering future events. Thus, all three explanations-<span class="highlight">physiological</span> maturation, hearing and producing stories about past events, and improved encoding of key aspects of events-<span class="highlight">seem</span> likely to be involved in overcoming infantile <span class="highlight">amnesia</span>.</p>

              <p>Both paragraphs 5 and 6 say that adults and children are different from infants in the way they parse information. The sixth paragraph gives concrete examples. The answer in the last sentence: General knowledge of categories of events such as a birthday party or a Visit to the doctor's office soon because people encode their experiences, but again, infants and toddlers are unlikely to encode many experiences within such knowledge structures. Saying that adult and older children's common sense about categories can help them parse information, but children cannot, That is, children are not classified, so B is the answer and nothing else.</p>

              <p>A: This sentence is relatively simple. The main logic is to make adverbial clauses. The reason immaturity is do not form enduring memories is that even if you listen to theories, A is correct. B is mistaken in changing the structure of the original text. The result of the original text is do not form enduring memories, B is changed into comprehend stories; C is opposite to the part after the original even number; D does not say, attention cannot be inferred.</p>
