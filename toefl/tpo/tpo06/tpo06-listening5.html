lecture in a <span class="highlight">creative</span> writing class. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="9.55" data-time="7.58">[00:07.58]</span>Professor: Alright everybody, the topic for today is, well, we're <span class="highlight">gonna</span> take a look at how to start creating the characters for the stories you're writing. <span class="time" data-times="9.7" data-time="17.13">[00:17.13]</span>One way of doing that is to come up with what's called "a <span class="highlight">character</span><span class="highlight">sketch</span>", I don't mean a <span class="highlight">sketch</span> like a drawing, I guess that's <span class="highlight">obvious</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.52" data-time="26.83">[00:26.83]</span>It's um...it's a...a <span class="highlight">sketch</span> is a way of getting started on defining your characters' personalities. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.12" data-time="34.35">[00:34.35]</span>To begin, how do we create fictional characters? <span class="time" data-times="3.13" data-time="39.47">[00:39.47]</span>We don't just pull them from thin <span class="highlight">air</span>, do we? <span class="time" data-times="2.71" data-time="42.6">[00:42.60]</span>I mean we don't create them out of nothing. <span class="time" data-times="12.17" data-time="45.31">[00:45.31]</span>We <span class="highlight">base</span> them, <span class="highlight">consciously</span> or unconsciously, we <span class="highlight">base</span> them on real people, or we <span class="highlight">blend</span> several people's traits, their attributes into one <span class="highlight">character</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.15" data-time="57.48">[00:57.48]</span>But when people think <span class="highlight">fiction</span>, they may <span class="highlight">assume</span> the characters come from the author's imagination. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.06" data-time="63.63">[01:03.63]</span>But the writer's imagination is influenced by... by real people, could be anyone. <span class="time" data-times="13.65" data-time="70.69">[01:10.69]</span>So, <span class="highlight">pay</span><span class="highlight">attention</span> to the people you meet: someone in class, at the <span class="highlight">gym</span>, that guy who is always sitting in the corner at the coffee house, um... your <span class="highlight">cousin</span>, who's always getting into dangerous situations. <span class="time" data-times="5.74" data-time="84.34">[01:24.34]</span>We're pulling from reality, gathering bits and pieces of real people. <span class="time" data-times="10.66" data-time="90.08">[01:30.08]</span>You use these people, and the bits of <span class="highlight">behavior</span> or characteristics as a starting point as you begin to <span class="highlight">sketch</span> out your characters. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.64" data-time="100.74">[01:40.74]</span>Here is what you should think about doing first. <span class="time" data-times="6.8" data-time="104.38">[01:44.38]</span>When you begin to <span class="highlight">formulate</span> a story, make a <span class="highlight">list</span> of interesting people you know or have observed. <span class="time" data-times="4.8" data-time="111.18">[01:51.18]</span><span class="highlight">Consider</span> why they're <span class="highlight">unique</span> or <span class="highlight">annoying</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.65" data-time="115.98">[01:55.98]</span>Then make notes about their unusual or <span class="highlight">dominant</span> attributes. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="12.83" data-time="120.63">[02:00.63]</span>As you create fictional characters, you'll almost always <span class="highlight">combine</span> characteristics from several different people on your <span class="highlight">list</span> to form the <span class="highlight">identity</span> and <span class="highlight">personality</span> of just one <span class="highlight">character</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9.46" data-time="133.46">[02:13.46]</span>Keeping this kind of <span class="highlight">character</span><span class="highlight">sketch</span> can help you <span class="highlight">solidify</span> your <span class="highlight">character</span>'s <span class="highlight">personality</span>, so that it remains <span class="highlight">consistent</span><span class="highlight">throughout</span> your story. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="11.93" data-time="142.92">[02:22.92]</span>You need to <span class="highlight">define</span> your characters, know their personalities so that you can have them <span class="highlight">acting</span> in ways that are <span class="highlight">predictable</span>, <span class="highlight">consistent</span> with their personalities. <span class="time" data-times="2.77" data-time="154.85">[02:34.85]</span>Get to know them like a friend. <span class="time" data-times="5.02" data-time="157.62">[02:37.62]</span>You know your friends well enough to know how they'll act in certain situations, right? </p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.27" data-time="162.64">[02:42.64]</span>Say you have three friends, their car runs out of gas on the highway. <span class="time" data-times="2.15" data-time="167.91">[02:47.91]</span>John gets <span class="highlight">upset</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.5" data-time="170.06">[02:50.06]</span>Mary remains <span class="highlight">calm</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.3" data-time="172.56">[02:52.56]</span>Teresa takes charge of handling the situation. <span class="time" data-times="5.27" data-time="175.86">[02:55.86]</span>And let's say, both John and Mary <span class="highlight">defer</span> to her leadership. <span class="time" data-times="2.96" data-time="181.13">[03:01.13]</span>They call you to explain what happen. <span class="time" data-times="7.63" data-time="184.09">[03:04.09]</span>And when John tells you he got mad, you're not surprised, because he always gets frustrated when things go wrong. <span class="time" data-times="8.43" data-time="191.72">[03:11.72]</span>Then he tells you how Teresa took charge, calmed him down, assigned tasks for each person and got them on their way. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.16" data-time="200.15">[03:20.15]</span>Again, you're not surprised. <span class="time" data-times="1.84" data-time="202.31">[03:22.31]</span>It's exactly what you'd <span class="highlight">expect</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.54" data-time="204.15">[03:24.15]</span>Well, you need to know your characters, like you know your friends. <span class="time" data-times="5.4" data-time="208.69">[03:28.69]</span>If you know a lot about a person's <span class="highlight">character</span>, it's easy to <span class="highlight">predict</span> how they'll <span class="highlight">behave</span>. <span class="time" data-times="12.47" data-time="214.09">[03:34.09]</span>So if your characters' personalities are well defined, it will be easy for you as the writer to <span class="highlight">portray</span> them realistically...er... believably, in any <span class="highlight">given</span> situation. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.41" data-time="226.56">[03:46.56]</span>While writing <span class="highlight">character</span> sketches, do think about details. <span class="time" data-times="4.12" data-time="231.97">[03:51.97]</span>Ask yourself questions, <span class="highlight">even</span> if you don't use the details in your story. <span class="time" data-times="14.71" data-time="236.09">[03:56.09]</span>Um...what does each <span class="highlight">character</span> like to eat, what <span class="highlight">setting</span> does each <span class="highlight">prefer</span>, the mountains, the city, what about educational background, their reactions to success or defeat. <span class="time" data-times="2.03" data-time="250.8">[04:10.80]</span>Write it all down. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.31" data-time="252.83">[04:12.83]</span>But, here I need to warn you about a possible pitfall. <span class="time" data-times="3.54" data-time="257.14">[04:17.14]</span>Don't make your <span class="highlight">character</span> into a <span class="highlight">stereotype</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.18" data-time="260.68">[04:20.68]</span>Remember the reader needs to know how your <span class="highlight">character</span> is different from other people who might fall in the same <span class="highlight">category</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.5" data-time="267.86">[04:27.86]</span>Maybe your <span class="highlight">character</span> loves the mountains and has lived in a <span class="highlight">remote</span> area for years. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="8.55" data-time="274.36">[04:34.36]</span>To make sure he is not a <span class="highlight">stereotype</span>, ask yourself how he sees life differently from other people who live in that kind of <span class="highlight">setting</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.63" data-time="282.91">[04:42.91]</span>Be careful not to make him into the cliché of the "ragged mountain <span class="highlight">dweller</span>". </p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.97" data-time="289.54">[04:49.54]</span>Okay, now, I'll <span class="highlight">throw</span> out a little <span class="highlight">terminology</span>. <span class="time" data-times="1.51" data-time="294.51">[04:54.51]</span>It's easy <span class="highlight">stuff</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.81" data-time="296.02">[04:56.02]</span><span class="highlight">Major</span> characters are sometimes called "round characters".<span class="time" data-times="5.9" data-time="300.83">[05:00.83]</span><span class="highlight">Minor</span> characters are sometimes called, well, just the <span class="highlight">opposite</span>, "<span class="highlight">flat</span>". <span class="time" data-times="5.15" data-time="306.73">[05:06.73]</span>A round <span class="highlight">character</span> is fully developed; a <span class="highlight">flat</span><span class="highlight">character</span> isn't. <span class="time" data-times="2.71" data-time="311.88">[05:11.88]</span><span class="highlight">Character</span><span class="highlight">development</span> is <span class="highlight">fairly</span> limited. <span class="time" data-times="6.01" data-time="314.59">[05:14.59]</span>The <span class="highlight">flat</span><span class="highlight">character</span> tends to serve mainly as a motivating <span class="highlight">factor</span>. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.58" data-time="320.6">[05:20.60]</span>For <span class="highlight">instance</span>, you introduce a <span class="highlight">flat</span><span class="highlight">character</span> who has experienced some <span class="highlight">sort</span> of defeat. <span class="time" data-times="15.53" data-time="326.18">[05:26.18]</span>And then your round, your main <span class="highlight">character</span> who loves success and loves to show off, comes and boasts about succeeding and jokes about the <span class="highlight">flat</span><span class="highlight">character</span>'s defeat in front of others, humiliates the other guy. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="341.71">[05:41.71]</span>The <span class="highlight">flat</span><span class="highlight">character</span> is introduced solely for the purpose of allowing the round <span
