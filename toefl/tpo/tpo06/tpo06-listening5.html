a lecture in a <span class="highlight">creative</span> writing class. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="9.55" data-time="7.58">[00:07.58]</span>Professor: Alright everybody, the topic for today is, well, we're <span class="highlight">gonna</span> take a look at how to start creating the characters for the stories you're writing. <span class="time" data-times="9.7" data-time="17.13">[00:17.13]</span>One way of doing that is to come up with what's called "a <span class="highlight">character</span><span class="highlight">sketch</span>", I don't mean a <span class="highlight">sketch</span> like a drawing, I guess that's <span class="highlight">obvious</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.52" data-time="26.83">[00:26.83]</span>It's um...it's a...a <span class="highlight">sketch</span> is a way of getting started on defining your characters' personalities. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.12" data-time="34.35">[00:34.35]</span>To begin, how do we create fictional characters? <span class="time" data-times="3.13" data-time="39.47">[00:39.47]</span>We don't just pull them from thin <span class="highlight">air</span>, do we? <span class="time" data-times="2.71" data-time="42.6">[00:42.60]</span>I mean we don't create them out of nothing. <span class="time" data-times="12.17" data-time="45.31">[00:45.31]</span>We <span class="highlight">base</span> them, <span class="highlight">consciously</span> or unconsciously, we <span class="highlight">base</span> them on real people, or we <span class="highlight">blend</span> several people's traits, their attributes into one <span class="highlight">character</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.15" data-time="57.48">[00:57.48]</span>But when people think <span class="highlight">fiction</span>, they may <span class="highlight">assume</span> the characters come from the author's imagination. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.06" data-time="63.63">[01:03.63]</span>But the writer's imagination is influenced by... by real people, could be anyone. <span class="time" data-times="13.65" data-time="70.69">[01:10.69]</span>So, <span class="highlight">pay</span><span class="highlight">attention</span> to the people you meet: someone in class, at the <span class="highlight">gym</span>, that guy who is always sitting in the corner at the coffee house, um... your <span class="highlight">cousin</span>, who's always getting into dangerous situations. <span class="time" data-times="5.74" data-time="84.34">[01:24.34]</span>We're pulling from reality, gathering bits and pieces of real people. <span class="time" data-times="10.66" data-time="90.08">[01:30.08]</span>You use these people, and the bits of <span class="highlight">behavior</span> or characteristics as a starting point as you begin to <span class="highlight">sketch</span> out your characters. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.64" data-time="100.74">[01:40.74]</span>Here is what you should think about doing first. <span class="time" data-times="6.8" data-time="104.38">[01:44.38]</span>When you begin to <span class="highlight">formulate</span> a story, make a <span class="highlight">list</span> of interesting people you know or have observed. <span class="time" data-times="4.8" data-time="111.18">[01:51.18]</span><span class="highlight">Consider</span> why they're <span class="highlight">unique</span> or <span class="highlight">annoying</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.65" data-time="115.98">[01:55.98]</span>Then make notes about their unusual or <span class="highlight">dominant</span> attributes. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="12.83" data-time="120.63">[02:00.63]</span>As you create fictional characters, you'll almost always <span class="highlight">combine</span> characteristics from several different people on your <span class="highlight">list</span> to form the <span class="highlight">identity</span> and <span class="highlight">personality</span> of just one <span class="highlight">character</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9.46" data-time="133.46">[02:13.46]</span>Keeping this kind of <span class="highlight">character</span><span class="highlight">sketch</span> can help you <span class="highlight">solidify</span> your <span class="highlight">character</span>'s <span class="highlight">personality</span>, so that it remains <span class="highlight">consistent</span><span class="highlight">throughout</span> your story. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="11.93" data-time="142.92">[02:22.92]</span>You need to <span class="highlight">define</span> your characters, know their personalities so that you can have them <span class="highlight">acting</span> in ways that are <span class="highlight">predictable</span>, <span class="highlight">consistent</span> with their personalities. <span class="time" data-times="2.77" data-time="154.85">[02:34.85]</span>Get to know them like a friend. <span class="time" data-times="5.02" data-time="157.62">[02:37.62]</span>You know your friends well enough to know how they'll act in certain situations, right? </p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.27" data-time="162.64">[02:42.64]</span>Say you have three friends, their car runs out of gas on the highway. <span class="time" data-times="2.15" data-time="167.91">[02:47.91]</span>John gets <span class="highlight">upset</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.5" data-time="170.06">[02:50.06]</span>Mary remains <span class="highlight">calm</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.3" data-time="172.56">[02:52.56]</span>Teresa takes charge of handling the situation. <span class="time" data-times="5.27" data-time="175.86">[02:55.86]</span>And let's say, both John and Mary <span class="highlight">defer</span> to her leadership. <span class="time" data-times="2.96" data-time="181.13">[03:01.13]</span>They call you to explain what happen. <span class="time" data-times="7.63" data-time="184.09">[03:04.09]</span>And when John tells you he got mad, you're not surprised, because he always gets frustrated when things go wrong. <span class="time" data-times="8.43" data-time="191.72">[03:11.72]</span>Then he tells you how Teresa took charge, calmed him down, assigned tasks for each person and got them on their way. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.16" data-time="200.15">[03:20.15]</span>Again, you're not surprised. <span class="time" data-times="1.84" data-time="202.31">[03:22.31]</span>It's exactly what you'd <span class="highlight">expect</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.54" data-time="204.15">[03:24.15]</span>Well, you need to know your characters, like you know your friends. <span class="time" data-times="5.4" data-time="208.69">[03:28.69]</span>If you know a lot about a person's <span class="highlight">character</span>, it's easy to <span class="highlight">predict</span> how they'll <span class="highlight">behave</span>. <span class="time" data-times="12.47" data-time="214.09">[03:34.09]</span>So if your characters' personalities are well defined, it will be easy for you as the writer to <span class="highlight">portray</span> them realistically...er... believably, in any <span class="highlight">given</span> situation. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.41" data-time="226.56">[03:46.56]</span>While writing <span class="highlight">character</span> sketches, do think about details. <span class="time" data-times="4.12" data-time="231.97">[03:51.97]</span>Ask yourself questions, <span class="highlight">even</span> if you don't use the details in your story. <span class="time" data-times="14.71" data-time="236.09">[03:56.09]</span>Um...what does each <span class="highlight">character</span> like to eat, what <span class="highlight">setting</span> does each <span class="highlight">prefer</span>, the mountains, the city, what about educational background, their reactions to success or defeat. <span class="time" data-times="2.03" data-time="250.8">[04:10.80]</span>Write it all down. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.31" data-time="252.83">[04:12.83]</span>But, here I need to warn you about a possible pitfall. <span class="time" data-times="3.54" data-time="257.14">[04:17.14]</span>Don't make your <span

data-time="267.86">[04:27.86]</span>Maybe your <span class="highlight">character</span> loves the mountains and has lived in a <span class="highlight">remote</span> area for years. </p><p><span

techniques for developing short-story plots.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>In the beginning, the professor said that today's topic is about how to create characters in writing stories, and then immediately begin to talk about methods. The other three items are mentioned in the following methods. They are not topics.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor recommend that students pay attention to the people they see every day?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. the behavior and characteristics of these people can be used in character sketches.</p><p>B. observing people in real-life situations can provide ideas for story plots.</p><p>C. it is easier to observe the behavior of familiar people than of new people.</p><p>D. students can gather accurate physical description for their characters.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>(original)</p><p>I mean we don't create them out of nothing. We base t hem, consciously or unconsciously, we base them on real people, or we blend several people's traits, their attributes into one character.</p><p>Because the tasks created did not come out of thin air but depended on the miniatures of real people, the professor suggested that everyone should pay attention to the people they saw in daily life. B is logically correct but not mentioned by the professor and therefore wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The professor discusses an example of three friends who run out of gas What point does he use the example to illustrate?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Writers should know their characters as well as they know their friends.</p><p>B. Writers should create characters that interact in complex ways.</p><p>C. Friends do not always behave the way we expect them to behave.</p><p>D. Friends' behavior is often more predictable than fictional characters' behavior.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>(in the original text) You need to define your characters, know their personalities so that you can have them acting in ways that are predictable, consistent wit h their personalities. Get to know them like a friend, you know your friends well enough to know how t hey'll act in certain situations, right? Say you have three friends, their car runs out of gas on the highway.</p><p>The professor said first that you need to understand the characters you write like your own friends and start talking about the story of the expressway. This is an example to illustrate this point, so it is A. This is not to analyze the mentality among friends, so B is wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What warning does the professor give when he talks about the man who lives on the mountain?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. avoid placing characters in remote settings.</p><p>B. avoid having more than one major character.</p><p>C. avoid using people as models whose lives are unusual.</p><p>D. avoid making characters into stereotypes.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>(original)</p><p>  Maybe your character loves the mountains and has lived in a remote area for years. To make sure he is not a stereotype, ask yourself how he sees life differently from other people who live in that kind of setting. Be careful not to make him int o the cliché of the "ragged mountain dweller".</p><p>The professor said Don't make you character into a stereotype.

They are the only characters able to experience defeat.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>(original)</p><p>  The flat character tends to serve primarily as a motivating factor. The flat character is introduced solely for the purpose of allowing the round character to show off.</p><p>The professor said that flat character is a stimulating factor, and then an example of a protagonist and a supporting actor finally sums up the supporting role is only to let the protagonist show off, which is to help the protagonist to show his character personality, so choose C.</p></div></div><div class="replay" id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor say this?.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

To motivate the students to do better work.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>(original)</p><p>    One way of doing hat is to come up with what's called "a character sketch", I don't mean a sketch like a drawing, I guess that's obvious. It's um...it's a...a sketch as a way of getting started on Defining your characters' personalities.</p><p>The professor deliberately emphasized that I don't mean a sketch like a drawing is to distinguish the difference between this sketch in the field of literary writing and the field of fine arts.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
