              <p>Students want to know if only senior student can participate in career fairy and he is not, so his intention is to understand whether he can be allowed to participate and choose C.</p>

              <p>After the student expressed his desire to be a party volunteer, the professor's speech was that's very thoughtful of you. In the process of listening, this sentence should be used as a reminder for the professor to refuse the student. Next Professor mentioned that it will be pretty low key, nothing flashy. There is no gimmick to say this party, it will be very low-key; also said that actually a couple of the administrative assistants are working on that. You could ask them but I think they've got covered. That is, there are already two students who are responsible for these things. I don't think you need your help anymore. Note that a couple of is the meaning of two students.</p>
