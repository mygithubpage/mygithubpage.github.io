              <span class="time" data-times="5.24" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to a <span class="underline">conversation</span> between a student and a professor. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.22" data-time="5.24">[00:05.24]</span>Student: Professor Martin? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.16" data-time="7.46">[00:07.46]</span>Professor: Uh, hi, Lisa, what can I do for you? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="11.07" data-time="9.62">[00:09.62]</span>Student: Well, I've been thinking about, you know, what you were saying in class last week, about how we shouldn't wait until the last <span class="underline">minute</span> to find an idea and get started working on our <span class="underline">term</span> paper. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.48" data-time="20.69">[00:20.69]</span>Professor: Good, good, and have you come up with anything? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.16" data-time="24.17">[00:24.17]</span>Student: Well, yeah, <span class="underline">sort</span> of. <span class="time" data-times="9.14" data-time="26.33">[00:26.33]</span>See, I've never had a linguistics class before, so I was <span class="underline">sort</span> of, I mean, I was looking over the <span class="underline">course</span> description and a lot of the <span class="underline">stuff</span> you described there. <span class="time" data-times="3.81" data-time="35.47">[00:35.47]</span>I just don't know what it is talking about, you know, or what it means. <span class="time" data-times="2.83" data-time="39.28">[00:39.28]</span>But there was one thing that really did jump out at me. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.27" data-time="42.11">[00:42.11]</span>Professor: Yes? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.78" data-time="43.38">[00:43.38]</span>Student: The <span class="underline">section</span> on dialects, 'cause...like, that's the kind of thing that's always <span class="underline">sort</span> of intrigued me, you know? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.5" data-time="50.16">[00:50.16]</span>Professor: Well, that's certainly an interesting topic. <span class="time" data-times="3.03" data-time="52.66">[00:52.66]</span>But you may not realize, I mean, the <span class="underline">scope</span>... </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.57" data-time="55.69">[00:55.69]</span>Student: Well, especially now, 'cause I've got like one roommate who is from the south and another one from New York. <span class="time" data-times="2.89" data-time="62.26">[01:02.26]</span>And we all talk like totally different, you know. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.01" data-time="65.15">[01:05.15]</span>Professor: Yes, I understand. But... </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.06" data-time="67.16">[01:07.16]</span>Student: But then I was noticing, like, we don't really get into this till the end of the <span class="underline">semester</span>, you know. So I... </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.28" data-time="73.22">[01:13.22]</span>Professor: So, you want some pointers where to go for information on the <span class="underline">subject</span>? <span class="time" data-times="4.55" data-time="77.5">[01:17.50]</span>Well, you could always start by reading the chapter in the book on sociolinguistics. <span class="time" data-times="3.4" data-time="82.05">[01:22.05]</span>That will give you a <span class="underline">basic</span> understanding of the key issues involved here. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.88" data-time="85.45">[01:25.45]</span>Student: Yeah, that's what I thought. <span class="time" data-times="5.59" data-time="87.33">[01:27.33]</span>So I started reading the chapter, you know, about how everyone speaks some <span class="underline">dialect</span> of the language. <span class="time" data-times="5.33" data-time="92.92">[01:32.92]</span>And I'm wondering like, well, how do we <span class="underline">even</span> <span class="underline">manage</span> to understand each other at all? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.35" data-time="98.25">[01:38.25]</span>Professor: Ah, yes, an interesting question. <span class="time" data-times="0.50000000000001" data-time="100.6">[01:40.60]</span>You see... </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.81" data-time="101.1">[01:41.10]</span>Student: So then I read the part about <span class="underline">dialect</span> <span class="underline">accommodation</span>. <span class="time" data-times="13.48" data-time="103.91">[01:43.91]</span>You know, the idea that people <span class="underline">tend</span> to <span class="underline">adapt</span> their speaking to make it closer to the speech of whomever they're talking to, and I'm thinking, yeah, I do that when I talk with my roommates, and without <span class="underline">even</span> thinking about it or anything, you know. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.36" data-time="117.39">[01:57.39]</span>Professor: OK, all right. <span class="time" data-times="3.27" data-time="118.75">[01:58.75]</span> <span class="underline">Dialect</span> <span class="underline">accommodation</span> is a more manageable <span class="underline">sort</span> of topic. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.82" data-time="122.02">[02:02.02]</span>Student: So I was thinking like, I <span class="underline">wonder</span> just how much other people do the same thing. <span class="time" data-times="3.3" data-time="127.84">[02:07.84]</span>I mean, there are students here from all over the place. <span class="time" data-times="4.65" data-time="131.14">[02:11.14]</span>Does everyone change the way they talk to some <span class="underline">degree</span> depending on whom they are talking to? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.51" data-time="135.79">[02:15.79]</span>Professor: You'd be surprised. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.95" data-time="137.3">[02:17.30]</span>Student: So, anyway, my question is, do you think it'd be OK if I did a <span class="underline">project</span> like that for my <span class="underline">term</span> paper? <span class="time" data-times="9.41" data-time="143.25">[02:23.25]</span>You know, find students from different parts of the country, <span class="underline">record</span> them talking to each other in different combinations, <span class="underline">report</span> on how they <span class="underline">accommodate</span> their speech or not, that kind of thing? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.67" data-time="152.66">[02:32.66]</span>Professor: Tell you what, Lisa, write me up a short <span class="underline">proposal</span> for this <span class="underline">project</span> – how you're going to carry out the experiment and everything – a design plan.<span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="161.33">[02:41.33]</span> And I think this'll work out just fine. </p>
