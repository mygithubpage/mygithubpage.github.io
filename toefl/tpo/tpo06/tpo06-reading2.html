He received <span class="highlight question1">rudimentary</span> village schooling, but mostly he roamed his uncle's farm collecting the fossils that were so <span class="highlight">abundant</span> in the rocks of the Cotswold hills. When he grew older, William Smith taught himself surveying from books he bought with his small savings, and at the age of eighteen he was apprenticed to a <span class="highlight">surveyor</span> of the <span class="highlight">local</span> parish. He then proceeded to teach himself <span class="highlight">geology</span>, and when he was twenty-four, he went to work for the <span class="highlight">company</span> that was excavating the Somerset <span class="highlight">Coal</span><span class="highlight">Canal</span> in the south of England.</p><p>This was before the steam <span class="highlight">locomotive</span>, and <span class="highlight">canal</span> building was at its height. The companies building the canals to <span class="highlight">transport</span><span class="highlight">coal</span> needed surveyors to help them find the <span class="highlight">coal</span> deposits <span class="highlight">worth</span><span class="highlight">mining</span> as well as to <span class="highlight">determine</span> the best courses for the canals. This job gave Smith an <span class="highlight">opportunity</span> to study the fresh rock outcrops created by the newly dug <span class="highlight">canal</span>. He later worked on <span class="highlight">similar</span> jobs <span class="highlight">across</span> the length and breadth of England, all the while studying the newly revealed <span class="highlight">strata</span> and collecting all the fossils he could find. Smith used <span class="highlight">mail</span> coaches to travel as much as 10,000 miles per year. In 1815 he published the first modern geological map, "A Map of the <span class="highlight">Strata</span> of England and Wales with a Part of Scotland," a map so <span class="question5">meticulously</span> researched that it can still be used today.</p><p>In 1831 when Smith was finally recognized by the Geological Society of London as the "father of English <span class="highlight">geology</span>," it was not only for his maps but also for something <span class="highlight">even</span> more important. Ever since people had begun to <span class="highlight">catalog</span> the <span class="highlight">strata</span> in <span class="highlight">particular</span> outcrops, there had been the hope that these could somehow be used to <span class="highlight">calculate</span> geological time. <span class="question6">But as more and more accumulations of <span class="highlight">strata</span> were cataloged in more and more places, it became <span class="highlight">clear</span> that the sequences of rocks sometimes differed from <span class="highlight">region</span> to <span class="highlight">region</span> and that no rock type was ever going to become a <span class="highlight">reliable</span> time marker <span class="highlight">throughout</span> the world.</span><span class="highlight">Even</span> without the problem of regional differences, rocks present a difficulty as <span class="highlight">unique</span> time markers. <span class="question7"><span class="highlight">Quartz</span> is <span class="highlight">quartz</span></span>-a <span class="highlight">silicon</span><span class="highlight">ion</span> surrounded by four <span class="highlight">oxygen</span> ions-there's no <span class="highlight">difference</span> at all between two-million-year-old <span class="highlight">Pleistocene</span><span class="highlight">quartz</span> and <span class="highlight">Cambrian</span><span class="highlight">quartz</span> created over 500 million years ago.</p><p>As he collected fossils from <span class="highlight">strata</span><span class="highlight">throughout</span> England, Smith began to see that the fossils told a different story from the rocks. Particularly in the younger <span class="highlight">strata</span>, the rocks were often so <span class="highlight">similar</span> that he had trouble distinguishing the <span class="highlight">strata</span>, but he never had trouble telling the fossils apart. While rock between two <span class="highlight">consistent</span><span class="highlight">strata</span> might in one place be <span class="highlight">shale</span> and in another sandstone, the fossils in that <span class="highlight">shale</span> or sandstone were always the same. Some fossils <span class="question9">endured</span><span class="highlight">through</span> so many millions of years that they <span class="highlight">appear</span> in many <span class="highlight">strata</span>, but others <span class="highlight">occur</span> only in a few <span class="highlight">strata</span>, and a few <span class="highlight">species</span> had their births and extinctions <span class="highlight">within</span> one <span class="highlight">particular</span><span class="highlight">stratum</span>. Fossils are thus identifying markers for <span class="highlight">particular</span> periods in Earth's <span class="highlight">history</span>.</p><p>Not only could Smith <span class="highlight">identify</span> rock <span class="highlight">strata</span> by the fossils they contained, he could also see a <span class="highlight">pattern</span> emerging: certain fossils always <span class="highlight">appear</span> in more <span class="highlight">ancient</span> sediments,
 while others begin to be seen as the <span class="highlight">strata</span> become more recent. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>By following the fossils, Smith was able to put all the <span class="highlight">strata</span> of England's earth into <span class="highlight">relative</span><span class="highlight">temporal</span><span class="highlight">sequence</span>.
  <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>About the same time, Georges Cuvier made the same discovery while studying the rocks around Paris. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>Soon it was realized that this <span class="highlight">principle</span> of faunal (animal) <span class="highlight">succession</span> was
 <span class="highlight">valid</span> not only in England or France but <span class="highlight"><span class="question10">virtually</span></span> everywhere. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>It was actually a <span class="highlight">principle</span> of <span class="highlight">floral</span><span class="highlight">succession</span> as well, because plants showed the same <span class="highlight">transformation</span><span class="highlight">through</span> time as did <span class="highlight">fauna</span>. Limestone may be found in the <span class="highlight">Cambrian</span> or-300 million years later-in the <span class="highlight">Jurassic</span><span class="highlight">strata</span>, but a <span class="question12">trilobite</span>-the ubiquitous <span class="highlight">marine</span><span class="highlight">arthropod</span> that had its birth in the <span class="highlight">Cambrian</span>-will never be found in <span class="highlight">Jurassic</span><span class="highlight">strata</span>, nor a <span class="highlight">dinosaur</span> in the <span class="highlight">Cambrian</span>.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">rudimentary</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. thorough</p><p>B. strict</p><p>C. basic</p><p>D. occasional</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Rudimentary: Basic, preliminary. A is thorough; B is strict; C is basic; D is occasional. So C's basic is the correct answer. Corresponding to the original: He received rudimentary village schooling, but mostly he roamed his uncle's farm collecting the fossils that were so abundant in the rocks of the Cotswold hills. The original sentence said what kind of education smith received, and wandered on his uncle's farm and Fossils are collected, so it is certainly not much to receive education, and in front of him said that he was born in a poor blacksmith home, certainly not much education. Thorough and strict are obviously not right; occasional education does not match, nor is it right.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 1, which of the following statements about William Smith is NOT true?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Smith learned surveying by reading and by apprenticing for a local surveyor.</p><p>B. Smith's family lived in a small English town and possessed little wealth.</p><p>C. Smith learned about fossils from books he borrowed from his uncle.</p><p>D. Smith eventually left his village to work on the excavation of an English canal.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Surveying in A to position 3, correct, not selected: When he grew older, William Smith learned himself surveying from books he bought with his small savings, and at the age of eighteen he was apprenticed to a surveyor of the local parish Speaking of studying and studying from the books and internships, A is correct and does not choose. At the same time, the third sentence says that his books were purchased by him and he did not ask his uncle to borrow them. Therefore, C was wrong and he chose; B. The family is positioning to the first sentence, little wealth is no money, so it is correct, not selected: In 1769 in a little town in Oxfordshire, England, a child with the very ordinary name of William Smith was born into the poor family of a village English canal in blacksmith.D Positioned to the last sentence, correct, not selected: He then proceeded to teach himself geology, and when he was twenty-four, he went to work for the company that was excavating the Somerset Coal Canal in the south Of England.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the following can be inferred from paragraph 2 about canal building?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Canals were built primarily in the south of England rather than in other regions.</p><p>B. Canal building decreased after the steam locomotive was invented.</p><p>C. Canal building made it difficult to study rock strata which often became damaged in the process.</p><p>D. Canal builders hired surveyors like Smith to examine exposed rock strata.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B. With canal building as the key word to the first sentence, said that before the steam locomotive, the canal building reached its climax, that is, after steam locomotive appeared, the heat of the canal building began to decline, so B was the answer. Those who hired smith to help them find coal, not check the exposed rock formations, D wrong; A and C have no relevant information, do not choose.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph2, which of the following is true of the map published by William Smith?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It indicates the locations of England's major canals.</p><p>B. It became most valuable when the steam locomotive made rail travel possible.</p><p>C. The data for the map were collected during Smith's work on canals.</p><p>D. It is no longer regarded as a geological masterpiece.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The keyword is positioned as the map to the last sentence, but this sentence only says that the map is very good and important, there is no answer, but you can know that D said it is reversed; looking up, the previous sentence says he has gone very far, has nothing to do with the map Look further: He later worked on similar jobs across the length and breadth of England, all the while studying the newly revealed strata and collecting all the fossils he could find. Said he collected all the fossils he could find while working , so C is correct; ABD did not say.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question5">meticulously</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. carefully</p><p>B. quickly</p><p>C. frequently</p><p>D. obviously</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" A"><p>Meticulously: Carefully. A is serious; B is fast; Cs is frequently; D is obvious. So the answer is A's carefully. Corresponding to the original: In 1815 he published the first modern geological map, "A Map of the Strata of England and Wales with a Part of Scotland," a map so <span class="question5">meticulously</span> researched that it can still be used today. Maps make it useful today. There is a clear causal relationship here. Since the result is that the map can still be used up to now, it also proves that the map is doing very well. We should choose a forward word. BCD is neutral, and A is positive. After the substitution, causality is established.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The discovery of regional differences in the sequences of rocks led geologists to believe that rock types could someday become reliable time markers.</p><p>B. Careful analysis of strata revealed that rocks cannot establish geological time because the pattern of rock layers varies from place to place.</p><p>C. Smith's catalogs of rock strata indicated that the sequences of rocks are different from place to place and from region to region.</p><p>D. Because people did not catalog regional differences in sequences of rocks, it was believed that rocks could never be reliable time markers.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The original structure of B is that with blablabla, the rock sequence is different, and no rock type can become a reliable time marker. A option is contrary to the original; B is correct; C said smith's classification, the original said the classification, but did not say smith, this original did not say; D's causality is purely irrelevant.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the author use the phrase "<span class="highlight">Quartz is quartz</span>"?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To describe how the differences between Pleistocene and Cambrian quartz reveal information about dating rocks</p><p>B. To point out that the chemical composition of quartz makes it more difficult to date than other rocks</p><p>C. To provide an example of how regional differences in rock sequences can make a particular rock difficult to date</p><p>D. To explain that rocks are difficult to use for dating because their chemical compositions always remain the same over time</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="Quartz is quartz D"><p>After reading the sentence, to adjust the language of the insertion, insert the language and answer: Quartz is quartz-a silicon ion surrounded by four oxygen ions-there's no difference at all between two-million-year-old Pleistocene quartz and Cambrian quartz created over 500 million years ago. There is no difference between quartz two million years ago and quartz six hundred million years ago. Looking ahead, the foregoing says that even if there is no regional difference, stones cannot be used as a time maker. The obvious highlight sentence emphasizes the reason why time maker cannot be done, so the answer is D.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, it was difficult for Smith to distinguish rock strata because</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. the rocks from different strata closely resembled each other</p><p>B. he was often unable to find fossils in the younger rock strata</p><p>C. their similarity to each other made it difficult for him to distinguish one rock type from another</p><p>D. the type of rock between two consistent strata was always the same</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A. Using rocking rock strata as the key word to the second sentence, said that rock is very similar, so it is difficult to distinguish, so A is right; note that C is wrong because the original did not say to distinguish the rock type; A few sentences indicate that B is backward; D did not say.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question9">endured</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. vanished</p><p>B. developed</p><p>C. varied</p><p>D. survived</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" D"><p>Endure: Endure, endurable. A is extinction and demise; B is development; C is change; D is survival and persists from. So D's survive is correct. Corresponding to the original: Some fossils <span class="question9">endured</span> through so many millions of years that they appear in many strata, but others seem only in a few strata, and a few species had their births and extinctions within one particular stratum. Millions of years, the results have emerged in many rock formations, it is definitely a continuation of the meaning, so it should be no change for so many years. Whether it's vanish disappeared, develop or vary has changed, so it's not right.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question10">virtually</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. possibly</p><p>B. absolutely</p><p>C. surprisingly</p><p>D. nearly</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" D"><p>Virtually: In fact, almost. A is possible; B is absolutely; C is amazing; D is almost. So the answer D is almost correct. Corresponding to the original: Soon it was realized that this principle of faunal (animal) succession was valid not only in England or France but <span class="question10">virtually</span> everywhere. The original sentence said that faunal succession is not only valid in the UK and France but also in all places, and is probably too light Absolutely heavy; suprisingly expressed a surprising subjective attitude, the original is not reflected.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>Select the TWO answer choices that are true statements based upon the discussion of the principle of faunal succession in paragraph 5. To receive credit, you must select TWO answers.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It was a principle that applied to fauna but not to flora.</p><p>B. It was discovered independently by two different geologists.</p><p>C. It describes how fossils are distributed in rock strata.</p><p>D. It explains why plants and animals undergo transformations through time.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="BC"><p>BC notes that two items need to be selected; Exclusion method, Flora in A is positioned to the penultimate sentence, that is, succession can be used for flora as well as fauna; B is to find two people, the second sentence and the third sentence are exactly Correct; Strata in C is positioned to the second sentence, correct; original does not explain plants and animals have undergone the same transformation, D is wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>In mentioning "<span class="highlight"><span class="question12">trilobite</span></span>", the author is making which of the following points?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Fossils cannot be found in more than one rock stratum.</p><p>B. Faunal succession can help put rock layers in relative temporal sequence.</p><p>C. Faunal succession cannot be applied to different strata composed of the same kind of rock.</p><p>D. The presence of trilobite fossils makes it difficult to date a rock.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>B. First read the sentence in <span class="question12">trilobite</span>, saying that limestone will appear in the Cambrian or Jurassic period, but creatures in special eras will only appear at certain times. That is, creatures are more reliable than rock types, and B is correct; others do not say.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The findings of these geologists inspired others to examine the rock and fossil records in different parts of the world..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C Three transition points, these geologists, rock and fossil records, and different parts of the world. The roots of these geologists must have geologists before them, so A and B are excluded, and they should first say different parts of the world, and then Then use England and France as specific examples, so C is wrong with D.</p></div></div><div id="question14" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>William Smith's contributions to geology have increased our knowledge of the Earth's history.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.Smith found success easily in his profession because he came from a family of geologists and surveyors.</p><p>B.Smith's work on canals allowed him to collect fossils and study rock layers all over England.</p><p>C.Smith found that fossils are much more reliable indicators of geological time than rock strata are.</p><p>D.Smith was named "the father of English geology" for his maps rather than for his other contributions to the field.</p><p>E.Smith and Cuvier discovered that fossil patterns are easier to observe in ancient rock strata than in younger rock strata.</p><p>F.The discovery of the principle of faunal succession allowed geologists to establish the relative age of Earth's rock layers.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="BCF"><p>The B.C.F Smith found success option is contrary to the first sentence of the first paragraph and is not selected. The Smith's work option corresponds to the third sentence of the second paragraph, correct. The Smith found that option corresponds to the third sentence of the third paragraph and the last sentence of the fourth paragraph, correct. The Smith was named option is the opposite of the first sentence of the third paragraph and is not selected. Smith and Cuvier options did not say the original, do not choose. The discovery option corresponds to the first and second sentence of the fifth paragraph, correct.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
