            <b>William Smith</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>In 1769 in a little town in Oxfordshire, England, a child with the very ordinary name of William Smith was born into the poor family of a village blacksmith. He received <span class="light"><span class="underline">rudimentary</span></span> village schooling, but mostly he roamed his uncle's farm collecting the fossils that were so <span class="underline">abundant</span> in the rocks of the Cotswold hills. When he grew older, William Smith taught himself surveying from books he bought with his small savings, and at the age of eighteen he was apprenticed to a <span class="underline">surveyor</span> of the <span class="underline">local</span> parish. He then proceeded to teach himself <span class="underline">geology</span>, and when he was twenty-four, he went to work for the <span class="underline">company</span> that was excavating the Somerset <span class="underline">Coal</span> <span class="underline">Canal</span> in the south of England.</p>
          <p>This was before the steam <span class="underline">locomotive</span>, and <span class="underline">canal</span> building was at its height. The companies building the canals to <span class="underline">transport</span> <span class="underline">coal</span> needed surveyors to help them find the <span class="underline">coal</span> deposits <span class="underline">worth</span> <span class="underline">mining</span> as well as to <span class="underline">determine</span> the best courses for the canals. This job gave Smith an <span class="underline">opportunity</span> to study the fresh rock outcrops created by the newly dug <span class="underline">canal</span>. He later worked on <span class="underline">similar</span> jobs <span class="underline">across</span> the length and breadth of England, all the while studying the newly revealed <span class="underline">strata</span> and collecting all the fossils he could find. Smith used <span class="underline">mail</span> coaches to travel as much as 10,000 miles per year. In 1815 he published the first modern geological map, "A Map of the <span class="underline">Strata</span> of England and Wales with a Part of Scotland," a map so meticulously researched that it can still be used today.</p>
          <p>In 1831 when Smith was finally recognized by the Geological Society of London as the "father of English <span class="underline">geology</span>," it was not only for his maps but also for something <span class="underline">even</span> more important. Ever since people had begun to <span class="underline">catalog</span> the <span class="underline">strata</span> in <span class="underline">particular</span> outcrops, there had been the hope that these could somehow be used to <span class="underline">calculate</span> geological time. But as more and more accumulations of <span class="underline">strata</span> were cataloged in more and more places, it became <span class="underline">clear</span> that the sequences of rocks sometimes differed from <span class="underline">region</span> to <span class="underline">region</span> and that no rock type was ever going to become a <span class="underline">reliable</span> time marker <span class="underline">throughout</span> the world. <span class="underline">Even</span> without the problem of regional differences, rocks present a difficulty as <span class="underline">unique</span> time markers. <span class="underline">Quartz</span> is <span class="underline">quartz</span>-a <span class="underline">silicon</span> <span class="underline">ion</span> surrounded by four <span class="underline">oxygen</span> ions-there's no <span class="underline">difference</span> at all between two-million-year-old <span class="underline">Pleistocene</span> <span class="underline">quartz</span> and <span class="underline">Cambrian</span> <span class="underline">quartz</span> created over 500 million years ago.</p>
          <p>As he collected fossils from <span class="underline">strata</span> <span class="underline">throughout</span> England, Smith began to see that the fossils told a different story from the rocks. Particularly in the younger <span class="underline">strata</span>, the rocks were often so <span class="underline">similar</span> that he had trouble distinguishing the <span class="underline">strata</span>, but he never had trouble telling the fossils apart. While rock between two <span class="underline">consistent</span> <span class="underline">strata</span> might in one place be <span class="underline">shale</span> and in another sandstone, the fossils in that <span class="underline">shale</span> or sandstone were always the same. Some fossils endured <span class="underline">through</span> so many millions of years that they <span class="underline">appear</span> in many <span class="underline">strata</span>, but others <span class="underline">occur</span> only in a few <span class="underline">strata</span>, and a few <span class="underline">species</span> had their births and extinctions <span class="underline">within</span> one <span class="underline">particular</span> <span class="underline">stratum</span>. Fossils are thus identifying markers for <span class="underline">particular</span> periods in Earth's <span class="underline">history</span>.</p>
          <p>Not only could Smith <span class="underline">identify</span> rock <span class="underline">strata</span> by the fossils they contained, he could also see a <span class="underline">pattern</span> emerging: certain fossils always <span class="underline">appear</span> in more <span class="underline">ancient</span> sediments,
 while others begin to be seen as the <span class="underline">strata</span> become more recent. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>By following the fossils, Smith was able to put all the <span class="underline">strata</span> of England's earth into <span class="underline">relative</span> <span class="underline">temporal</span> <span class="underline">sequence</span>.
  <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>About the same time, Georges Cuvier made the same discovery while studying the rocks around Paris. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>Soon it was realized that this <span class="underline">principle</span> of faunal (animal) <span class="underline">succession</span> was
 <span class="underline">valid</span> not only in England or France but <span class="underline">virtually</span> everywhere. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>It was actually a <span class="underline">principle</span> of <span class="underline">floral</span> <span class="underline">succession</span> as well, because plants showed the same <span class="underline">transformation</span> <span class="underline">through</span> time as did <span class="underline">fauna</span>. Limestone may be found in the <span class="underline">Cambrian</span> or-300 million years later-in the <span class="underline">Jurassic</span> <span class="underline">strata</span>, but a trilobite-the ubiquitous <span class="underline">marine</span> <span class="underline">arthropod</span> that had its birth in the <span class="underline">Cambrian</span>-will never be found in <span class="underline">Jurassic</span> <span class="underline">strata</span>, nor a <span class="underline">dinosaur</span> in the <span class="underline">Cambrian</span>.</p>
