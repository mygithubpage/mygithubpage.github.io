            <b>Powering the Industrial Revolution</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>In Britain one of the most <span class="underline">dramatic</span> changes of the <span class="underline">Industrial</span> <span class="underline">Revolution</span> was the harnessing of power. Until the reign of George ?(1760-1820), <span class="underline">available</span> sources of power for work and travel had not increased since the Middle Ages. There were three sources of power: animal or human muscles; the wind, operating on sail or windmill; and running water. <span class="light">Only the last of these was suited at all to the <span class="underline">continuous</span> operating of machines, and although waterpower abounded in Lancashire and Scotland and ran <span class="underline">grain</span> mills as well as <span class="underline">textile</span> mills, it had one great disadvantage: streams flowed where nature intended them to, and water-driven factories had to be located on their banks whether or not the location was <span class="underline">desirable</span> for other reasons.</span> Furthermore, <span class="underline">even</span> the most <span class="underline">reliable</span> waterpower <span class="underline">varied</span> with the seasons and disappeared in a <span class="underline">drought</span>. The new age of <span class="underline">machinery</span>, in short, could not have been born without a new <span class="underline">source</span> of both movable and <span class="underline">constant</span> power.</p>
          <p>The <span class="underline">source</span> had long been known but not exploited. Early in the eighteenth <span class="underline">century</span>, a <span class="underline">pump</span> had come into use in which expanding steam raised a piston in a <span class="underline">cylinder</span>, and <span class="underline">atmospheric</span> <span class="underline">pressure</span> brought it down again when the steam condensed inside the <span class="underline">cylinder</span> to form a <span class="underline">vacuum</span>. This "<span class="underline">atmospheric</span> <span class="underline">engine</span>," invented by Thomas Savery and vastly improved by his partner, Thomas Newcomen, embodied <span class="underline">revolutionary</span> principles, but it was so slow and wasteful of <span class="underline">fuel</span> that it could not be employed outside the <span class="underline">coal</span> mines for which it had been designed. In the 1760s, James Watt perfected a <span class="underline">separate</span> condenser for the steam, so that the <span class="underline">cylinder</span> did not have to be cooled at every <span class="underline">stroke</span>; then he devised a way to make the piston turn a wheel and thus <span class="underline">convert</span> reciprocating (back and forth) <span class="underline">motion</span> into rotary <span class="underline">motion</span>. He <span class="underline">thereby</span> transformed an inefficient <span class="underline">pump</span> of limited use into a steam <span class="underline">engine</span> of a thousand uses. The final step came when steam was introduced into the <span class="underline">cylinder</span> to <span class="underline">drive</span> the piston backward as well as <span class="underline">forward</span>, <span class="underline">thereby</span> increasing the speed of the <span class="underline">engine</span> and cutting its <span class="underline">fuel</span> <span class="underline">consumption</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A">
            </span>Watt's steam <span class="underline">engine</span> soon showed what it could do. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>It liberated <span class="underline">industry</span> from dependence on running water.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>The <span class="underline">engine</span> eliminated water in the mines by driving <span class="underline">efficient</span> pumps, which made possible deeper and deeper <span class="underline">mining</span>.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>The ready <span class="underline">availability</span> of <span class="underline">coal</span> inspired William Murdoch during the 1790s to develop the first new form of nighttime illumination to be discovered in a <span class="underline">millennium</span> and a half. <span class="underline">Coal</span> gas rivaled smoky oil lamps and flickering candles, and early in the new <span class="underline">century</span>, well-to-do Londoners grew <span class="underline">accustomed</span> to gaslit houses and <span class="underline">even</span> streets. Iron manufacturers, 
 which had starved for <span class="underline">fuel</span> while depending on <span class="underline">charcoal</span>, also benefited from ever-increasing supplies of coal: <span class="underline">blast</span> furnaces with steam-powered <span class="underline">bellows</span> turned out more iron and 
 <span class="underline">steel</span> for the new <span class="underline">machinery</span>. Steam became the <span class="underline">motive</span> force of the <span class="underline">Industrial</span> <span class="underline">Revolution</span> as <span class="underline">coal</span> and iron <span class="underline">ore</span> were the <span class="underline">raw</span> materials.</p>
          <p>By 1800 more than a thousand steam engines were in use in the British Isles, and Britain retained a virtual <span class="underline">monopoly</span> on steam <span class="underline">engine</span> production until the 1830s. Steam power did not merely <span class="underline">spin</span> cotton and <span class="underline">roll</span> iron; early in the new <span class="underline">century</span>, it also multiplied ten times over the <span class="underline">amount</span> of paper that a single worker could produce in a day. At the same time, operators of the first printing presses run by steam rather than by hand found it possible to produce a thousand pages in an hour rather than thirty. Steam also promised to <span class="underline">eliminate</span> a <span class="underline">transportation</span> problem not fully solved by either <span class="underline">canal</span> boats or turnpikes. Boats could carry heavy weights, but canals could not cross hilly <span class="underline">terrain</span>; turnpikes could cross the hills, but the roadbeds could not stand up under great weights. These problems needed still another <span class="underline">solution</span>, and the ingredients for it <span class="underline">lay</span> close at hand. In some <span class="underline">industrial</span> regions, heavily laden wagons, with flanged wheels, were being hauled by horses <span class="underline">along</span> metal rails; and the <span class="underline">stationary</span> steam <span class="underline">engine</span> was puffing in the factory and <span class="underline">mine</span>. Another <span class="underline">generation</span> passed before inventors succeeded in combining these ingredients, by putting the <span class="underline">engine</span> on wheels and the wheels on the rails, so as to provide a machine to take the place of the horse. Thus the <span class="underline">railroad</span> age sprang from what had already happened in the eighteenth <span class="underline">century</span>.</p>
