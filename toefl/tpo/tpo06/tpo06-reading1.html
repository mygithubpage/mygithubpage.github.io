Until the reign of George ?(1760-1820), <span class="highlight">available</span> sources of power for work and travel had not increased since the Middle Ages. There were three sources of power: animal or human muscles; the wind, operating on sail or windmill; and running water. <span class="question1">Only the last of these was suited at all to the <span class="highlight">continuous</span> operating of machines, and although waterpower abounded in Lancashire and Scotland and ran <span class="highlight">grain</span> mills as well as <span class="highlight">textile</span> mills, it had one great disadvantage: streams flowed where nature intended them to, and water-driven factories had to be located on their banks whether or not the location was <span class="highlight">desirable</span> for other reasons.</span> Furthermore, <span class="highlight">even</span> the most <span class="highlight">reliable</span> waterpower <span class="highlight">varied</span> with the seasons and disappeared in a <span class="highlight">drought</span>. The new age of <span class="highlight">machinery</span>, in short, could not have been born without a new <span class="highlight">source</span> of both movable and <span class="highlight">constant</span> power.</p><p>The <span class="highlight">source</span> had long been known but not <span class="question3">exploited</span>. Early in the eighteenth <span class="highlight">century</span>, a <span class="highlight">pump</span> had come into use in which expanding steam raised a piston in a <span class="highlight">cylinder</span>, and <span class="highlight">atmospheric</span><span class="highlight">pressure</span> brought it down again when the steam condensed inside the <span class="highlight">cylinder</span> to form a <span class="highlight">vacuum</span>. This "<span class="question5"><span class="highlight">atmospheric</span><span class="highlight">engine</span></span>," invented by Thomas Savery and <span class="question4">vastly</span> improved by his partner, Thomas Newcomen, embodied <span class="highlight">revolutionary</span> principles, but it was so slow and wasteful of <span class="highlight">fuel</span> that it could not be employed outside the <span class="highlight">coal</span> mines for which it had been designed. In the 1760s, James Watt perfected a <span class="highlight">separate</span> condenser for the steam, so that the <span class="highlight">cylinder</span> did not have to be cooled at every <span class="highlight">stroke</span>; then he devised a way to make the piston turn a wheel and thus <span class="highlight">convert</span> reciprocating (back and forth) <span class="highlight">motion</span> into rotary <span class="highlight">motion</span>. He <span class="highlight">thereby</span> transformed an inefficient <span class="highlight">pump</span> of limited use into a steam <span class="highlight">engine</span> of a thousand uses. The final step came when steam was introduced into the <span class="highlight">cylinder</span> to <span class="highlight">drive</span> the piston backward as well as <span class="highlight">forward</span>, <span class="highlight">thereby</span> increasing the speed of the <span class="highlight">engine</span> and cutting its <span class="highlight">fuel</span><span class="highlight">consumption</span>.</p><p><span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>Watt's steam <span class="highlight">engine</span> soon showed what it could do. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>It liberated <span class="highlight">industry</span> from dependence on running water.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>The <span class="highlight">engine</span> eliminated water in the mines by driving <span class="highlight">efficient</span> pumps, which made possible deeper and deeper <span class="highlight">mining</span>.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>The ready <span class="highlight">availability</span> of <span class="highlight">coal</span> inspired William Murdoch during the 1790s to develop the first new form of nighttime illumination to be discovered in a <span class="highlight">millennium</span> and a half. <span class="highlight">Coal</span> gas rivaled smoky oil lamps and flickering candles, and early in the new <span class="highlight">century</span>, well-to-do Londoners <span class="question8">grew <span class="highlight">accustomed</span> to</span> gaslit houses and <span class="highlight">even</span> streets. Iron manufacturers, 
 which had starved for <span class="highlight">fuel</span> while depending on <span class="highlight">charcoal</span>, also benefited from ever-increasing supplies of coal: <span class="highlight">blast</span> furnaces with steam-powered <span class="highlight">bellows</span> turned out more iron and 
 <span class="highlight">steel</span> for the new <span class="highlight">machinery</span>. Steam became the <span class="highlight">motive</span> force of the <span class="highlight">Industrial</span><span class="highlight">Revolution</span> as <span class="highlight">coal</span> and iron <span class="highlight">ore</span> were the <span class="highlight">raw</span> materials.</p><p>By 1800 more than a thousand steam engines were in use in the British Isles, and Britain <span class="question9">retained</span> a virtual <span class="highlight">monopoly</span> on steam <span class="highlight">engine</span> production until the 1830s. Steam power did not merely <span class="highlight">spin</span> cotton and <span class="highlight">roll</span> iron; early in the new <span class="highlight">century</span>, it also multiplied ten times over the <span class="highlight">amount</span> of paper that a single worker could produce in a day. At the same time, operators of the first printing presses run by steam rather than by hand found it possible to produce a thousand pages in an hour rather than thirty. Steam also promised to <span class="highlight">eliminate</span> a <span class="highlight">transportation</span> problem not fully solved by either <span class="highlight">canal</span> boats or turnpikes. Boats could carry heavy weights, but canals could not cross hilly <span class="highlight">terrain</span>; turnpikes could cross the hills, but the roadbeds could not stand up under great weights. These problems needed still another <span class="highlight">solution</span>, and the ingredients for it <span class="highlight">lay</span> close at hand. In some <span class="highlight">industrial</span> regions, heavily laden wagons, with flanged wheels, were being hauled by horses <span class="highlight">along</span> metal rails; and the <span class="highlight">stationary</span> steam <span class="highlight">engine</span> was puffing in the factory and <span class="highlight">mine</span>. Another <span class="highlight">generation</span> passed before inventors succeeded in combining these ingredients, by putting the <span class="highlight">engine</span> on wheels and the wheels on the rails, so as to provide a machine to take the place of the horse. Thus the <span class="highlight">railroad</span> age sprang from what had already happened in the eighteenth <span class="highlight">century</span>.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Running water was the best power source for factories since it could keep machines operating continuously, but since it was abundant only in Lancashire and Scotland, most mills and factories that were located elsewhere could not be water driven.</p><p>B. The disadvantage of using waterpower is that streams do not necessarily flow in places that are the most suitable for factories, which explains why so many water-powered grain and textile mills were located in undesirable places.</p><p>C. Since machines could be operated continuously only where running water was abundant, grain and textile mills, as well as other factories, tended to be located only in Lancashire and Scotland.</p><p>D. Running water was the only source of power that was suitable for the continuous operation of machines, but to make use of it, factories had to be located where the water was, regardless of whether such locations made sense otherwise.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D. The original sentence is very long. First of all, it is the first comma where the most important sentence should be analyzed. The first half of the sentence is the last one, that is, the previously mentioned water flow can meet the requirement; the structure of the latter half of the sentence is a The major drawback is the blabla; the original text says that L and S have enough water in two places, but they do not say that only these two places are adequate, and A and C are wrong; B is missing the first part of the original sentence, which is an important missing information.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the following best describes the relation of paragraph 2 to paragraph 1?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Paragraph 2 shows how the problem discussed in paragraph 1 arose.</p><p>B. Paragraph 2 explains how the problem presented in paragraph 1 came to be solved.</p><p>C. Paragraph 2 provides a more technical discussion of the problem introduced in paragraph 1.</p><p>D. Paragraph 2 shows why the problem discussed in paragraph 1 was especially important to solve.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B asked the relationship between the second paragraph and the first paragraph. The first paragraph stated the shortcomings of hydropower. This was read on the previous question and raised a question; the second paragraph stated at the beginning that this energy source had long been discovered. That is steam. In the two paragraphs, one raised a question and one proposed a solution, so B is right.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question3">exploited</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. utilized</p><p>B. recognized</p><p>C. examined</p><p>D. fully understood</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" A"><p>Exploit: exploitation, development, utilization, exploitation. So A's utilize is correct. B is cognitive; C is check; D is fully understood. Corresponding to the original: The source had long been known but not <span class="question3">exploited</span>. The original said already know, but not how, so B's recognize is clearly contradicted with known, excluded; and the whole paragraph is talking about how to use, also describes the use of steam The process of advancement was not efficient at first, but it was later improved. Therefore, the alternative of A was in accordance with this context; and the information of fully understood and examine was not, so none of them was selected.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question4">vastly</span></span>" in the passage is closet in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. quickly</p><p>B. ultimately</p><p>C. greatly</p><p>D. initially</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" C"><p>Vastly: Greatly. A is fast; B is the last; C is great; D is the start. So C's is absolutely correct. Corresponding to the original: This "atmospheric engine," invented by Thomas Savery and <span class="question4">vastly</span> improved by his partner, Thomas Newcomen, available revolutionary principles, but it was so slow and wasteful of fuel that it could not be employed outside the coal mines for which it had The original "revolutionary" principle is presented. It can be inferred that the improvement is large and the answer is C. ABD can not echo the revolutionary.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 2, the "<span class="highlight">atmospheric engine</span>" was slow because</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. it had been designed to be used in coal mines</p><p>B. the cylinder had to cool between each stroke</p><p>C. it made use of expanding steam to raise the piston in its cylinder</p><p>D. it could be operated only when a large supply of fuel was available</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="atmospheric engine B"><p>Use keywords drawn by atmospheric engine and slow to read the third sentence of the sentence. But in this sentence, the reason for the slow did not give reasons, look down: In the 1760s, James Watt perfected a separate condenser for the steam, so that the cylinder did not have to be cooled at every stroke; then he devised a Say that in 1760 Watt perfected the steam engine so that no cooling was needed between each stroke, which meant that the previous steam engine was To cool down, so slow, correct answer B.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 2, Watt's steam engine differed from earlier steam engines in each of the following ways EXCEPT:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It used steam to move a piston in a cylinder.</p><p>B. It worked with greater speed.</p><p>C. It was more efficient in its use of fuel.</p><p>D. It could be used in many different ways.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The Pi option of the A option corresponds to the second sentence and the last sentence: Early in the eighteenth century, a pump had come into use in which expanding steam raised a piston in a cylinder, and atmospheric pressure brought it down again when the steam was condensed inside the cylinder To form a vacuum. From the second sentence, I used steam to move piston, and the last sentence said later, so this hasn't changed. So A is wrong, choose. B speed positioning to the last sentence, corresponding to increasing the speed, so B correct, not selected: The final step came when steam was introduced into the cylinder to drive the piston backward as well as forward, deciding increasing the speed of the engine and cutting Its fuel consumption.C's efficient and D's many different ways can all be found in the penultimate sentence: He ollows an inefficient pump of limited use into a steam engine of a thousand uses.</p><p>The CD is correct and not selected.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>In paragraph 3, the author mentions William Murdoch's invention of a new form of nighttime illumination in order to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. indicate one of the important developments made possible by the introduction of Watt's steam engine</p><p>B. make the point that Watt's steam engine was not the only invention of importance to the Industrial Revolution</p><p>C. illustrate how important coal was as a raw material for the Industrial Revolution</p><p>D. provide an example of another eighteenth-century invention that used steam as a power source</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The title of the function, the entire sentence of William Murdoch is an example. Looking ahead, the previous sentence says that the engine can drain, making deep mining possible, but still talking about the role of a machine, not the center, so see the center Sentences, said Watt's steam engine can do a lot of things, William Murdoch's this thing is based on a wat's stuff out, so the answer A.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The phrase "<span class="highlight">grew accustomed to</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. began to prefer</p><p>B. wanted to have</p><p>C. became used to</p><p>D. insisted on</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="grew accustomed to C"><p>Get accustomed to: Used to, so C's became used to be correct. A is starting to tend; B is wanting to own; D is insisting. Corresponding to the original: Coal gas rivaled smoky oil lamps and flickering candles, and early in the new century, well-to-do Londoners grew accustomed to gaslit houses and even streets. The original said that the gas was better than the oil lamps and candles. What happened to the Londoners? Houses and streets illuminated by gas; A prefer's comparison means that the former has already outweighed and there is no need to compare; B said to want to have, the same reason has been said before, so B is wrong; onsist on is insistent, the original Did not say to change, so it has nothing to do with persistence.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question9">retained</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. gained</p><p>B. established</p><p>C. profited from</p><p>D. maintained</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" D"><p>Retain: Keep, keep. A is to get; B is to build; C is to benefit from; D is to keep, insist. So D's maintain is correct. Corresponding to the original: By 1800 more than a thousand steam engines were used in the British Isles, and Britain <span class="question9">retained</span> a virtual monopoly on steam engine production until the 1830s. The original said that there have been a thousand steam engines in the British Isles, and how the United Kingdom The monopoly; gain and establish in the options all have meaning from scratch, and the original text said from the beginning that the reason for the success of the British industrial revolution was to use energy, so it was not from scratch, profit from profit from the original did not say ,wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, which of the following statements about steam engines is true?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They were used for the production of paper but not for printing.</p><p>B. By 1800, significant numbers of them were produced outside of Britain.</p><p>C. They were used in factories before they were used to power trains.</p><p>D. They were used in the construction of canals and turnpikes.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>There are no obvious keywords or exclusions in the problem. The second sentence after the semicolon and in the third sentence indicates that A is wrong, and that the same time, operators of the first printing presses run by steam rather than by hand found it possible to produce a thousand pages in An hour of rather than thirty. B's 1800 keyword positioning to the first sentence, said that until 1830 Britain lost its monopoly on the steam engine, so B reversed: By 1800 more than a thousand steam engines were used in the British Isles , and Britain <span class="question9">retained</span> a virtual monopoly on steam engine production until the 1830s.C corresponds to the penultimate sentence, saying that another generation passed before the steam engine was used on the railway, so C is correct: By 1800 more than a thousand steam engines were in use in The British Isles, and Britain <span class="question9">retained</span> a virtual monopoly on steam engine production until the 1830s. When the fourth sentence of the original text mentioned canal and turnpike, they did not say that the steam engine was used to build them: Steam also promised to eliminate a transportation problem not fully solved by Either canal boats or turnpikes.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, providing a machine to take the place of the horse involved combining which two previously separate ingredients?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Turnpikes and canals</p><p>B. Stationary steam engines and wagons with flanged wheels</p><p>C. Metal rails in roadbeds and wagons capable of carrying heavy loads</p><p>D.

This sentence by the back mentioned two things is wheel and engine. If you are still not sure, you can look ahead and there is an explanation of the previous sentence. The preceding sentence refers to steam engines and carriages respectively, so the answer is B.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The factories did not have to go to the streams when power could come to the factories..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C, the two transition points, factories and stream, correspond to the original's industry and running water. In this case, B or C is correct; but after the B pronoun it refers to the previous Watt's steam engine, which is too tight and does not insert any sentences. C is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>The Industrial Revolution would not have been possible without a new source of power that was efficient, movable, and continuously available.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.In the early eighteenth century, Savery and Newcomen discovered that expanding steam could be used to raise a piston in a cylinder.</p><p>B.Watt's steam engine played a leading role in greatly increasing industrial production of all kinds.</p><p>C.Until the 1830s, Britain was the world's major producer of steam engines.</p><p>D.In the mid-1700s James Watt transformed an inefficient steam pump into a fast, flexible, fuel-efficient engine.</p><p>E.In the 1790s William Murdoch developed a new way of lighting houses and streets using coal gas.</p><p>F.The availability of steam engines was a major factor in the development of railroads, which solved a major transportation problem.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="BDF"><p>The BDF in the early option is a detail in the second paragraph and is not selected. Watt's steam engine option corresponds to the first sentence of the third paragraph of the original text, or the entire third paragraph, correct. The Until option corresponds to the first sentence of the fourth paragraph. However, this sentence is not the central sentence. Therefore, it is a detail and should not be selected. The In the mid option corresponds to the second sentence after the second paragraph, correct. The in 1790s option is a detail in the third paragraph and is not selected. The availability option corresponds to the last three sentences of the original paragraph, correct.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
