            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.52" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in an earth science class.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.32" data-time="5.52">[00:05.52]</span>Professor: We're really just now beginning to understand how quickly <span class="underline">drastic</span> <span class="underline">climate</span> change can take place. <span class="time" data-times="5.51" data-time="14.84">[00:14.84]</span>We can see past occurrences of <span class="underline">climate</span> change that took place over just a few hundred years.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.64" data-time="20.35">[00:20.35]</span>Take uh... the Sahara <span class="underline">Desert</span> in Northern Africa. <span class="time" data-times="5.11" data-time="23.99">[00:23.99]</span>The Sahara was really different 6,000 years ago. <span class="time" data-times="10.35" data-time="29.1">[00:29.10]</span>I mean, you wouldn't call it a <span class="underline">tropical</span> paradise or anything, uh...or maybe you would if you think about how today in some parts of the Sahara it...it only rains about once a <span class="underline">century</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.11" data-time="39.45">[00:39.45]</span>Um... but basically, you had greenery and you had water.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="15.78" data-time="44.56">[00:44.56]</span>And what I find particularly interesting... amazing really, what really indicates how undesert-like the Sahara was thousands of years ago, was something painted on the rock, <span class="underline">prehistoric</span> art – hippopotamuses. <span class="time" data-times="5.25" data-time="60.34">[01:00.34]</span>As you know hippos need a lot of water and hence? <span class="time" data-times="1.45" data-time="65.59">[01:05.59]</span>Hence what?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.48" data-time="67.04">[01:07.04]</span>Student: They need to live near a large <span class="underline">source</span> of water year around.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="0.8" data-time="72.52">[01:12.52]</span>Professor: That's right.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.9" data-time="73.32">[01:13.32]</span>Student: But how is that <span class="underline">proof</span> that the Sahara used to be a lot wetter? <span class="time" data-times="4.87" data-time="77.22">[01:17.22]</span>I mean the people who painted those hippos, well, couldn't they have seen them on their travels?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.07" data-time="82.09">[01:22.09]</span>Professor: Okay, in <span class="underline">principle</span> they could, Karl. <span class="time" data-times="2.97" data-time="85.16">[01:25.16]</span>But the rock paintings aren't the only <span class="underline">evidence</span>. <span class="time" data-times="11.34" data-time="88.13">[01:28.13]</span> <span class="underline">Beneath</span> the Sahara are huge aquifers, basically a sea of fresh water, that's perhaps a million years old filtered <span class="underline">through</span> rock layers. <span class="time" data-times="7.92" data-time="99.47">[01:39.47]</span>And...er...and then there is fossilized <span class="underline">pollen</span>, from low shrubs and grasses that once grew in the Sahara.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.29" data-time="107.39">[01:47.39]</span>In fact these plants still grow, er...but hundreds of miles away, in more vegetated areas. <span class="time" data-times="16.91" data-time="113.68">[01:53.68]</span>Anyway, it's this fossilized <span class="underline">pollen</span> <span class="underline">along</span> with the aquifers and the rock paintings, these three things are all <span class="underline">evidence</span> that the Sahara was once much greener than it is today, that there were hippos and probably elephants and giraffes and so on.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.25" data-time="130.59">[02:10.59]</span>Student: So what happened?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.72" data-time="131.84">[02:11.84]</span>Professor: How did it happen? <span class="time" data-times="5.54" data-time="133.56">[02:13.56]</span>Well, Now, we're so used to hearing about how human activities are affecting the <span class="underline">climate</span>, right? <span class="time" data-times="7.45" data-time="139.1">[02:19.10]</span>But that takes the <span class="underline">focus</span> away from the natural variations in the earth <span class="underline">climate</span>, like the Ice Age, right? <span class="time" data-times="4.12" data-time="146.55">[02:26.55]</span>The <span class="underline">planet</span> was <span class="underline">practically</span> covered in ice just a few thousand years ago. <span class="time" data-times="9.15" data-time="150.67">[02:30.67]</span>Now as far as the Sahara goes, there is some recent <span class="underline">literature</span> that points to the <span class="underline">migration</span> of the monsoon in that area</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="0.73000000000001" data-time="159.82">[02:39.82]</span>Students: Huh?????</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.04" data-time="160.55">[02:40.55]</span>Professor: What do I mean? <span class="time" data-times="6.38" data-time="161.59">[02:41.59]</span>Okay, a monsoon is a <span class="underline">seasonal</span> wind that can bring in a large <span class="underline">amount</span> of <span class="underline">rainfall</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.42" data-time="167.97">[02:47.97]</span>Now if the monsoon migrates, well, that means that the rains move to another area, right?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.24" data-time="174.39">[02:54.39]</span>So what caused the monsoon to <span class="underline">migrate</span>? <span class="time" data-times="6.79" data-time="178.63">[02:58.63]</span>Well, the answer is: the dynamics of earth's motions, the same thing that caused the Ice Age by the way. <span class="time" data-times="7.23" data-time="185.42">[03:05.42]</span>The earth's not always the same distance from the sun, and it's not always tilting toward the sun at the same <span class="underline">angle</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.03" data-time="192.65">[03:12.65]</span>There are <span class="underline">slight</span> variations in these two parameters. <span class="time" data-times="3.97" data-time="195.68">[03:15.68]</span>They're <span class="underline">gradual</span> variations but their effects can be <span class="underline">pretty</span> <span class="underline">abrupt</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.86" data-time="199.65">[03:19.65]</span>And can cause the <span class="underline">climate</span> to change in just a few hundred years.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.88" data-time="204.51">[03:24.51]</span>Student: That's <span class="underline">abrupt</span>?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.02" data-time="206.39">[03:26.39]</span>Professor: Well, yeah, considering that other <span class="underline">climate</span> shifts take thousands of years, this one is <span class="underline">pretty</span> <span class="underline">abrupt</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.64" data-time="211.41">[03:31.41]</span>So these changes in the <span class="underline">planet</span>'s motions, they caused the <span class="underline">climate</span> to change.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.82" data-time="217.05">[03:37.05]</span>But it was also compounded. <span class="time" data-times="7.68" data-time="219.87">[03:39.87]</span>What the Sahara experienced was uh...a <span class="underline">sort</span> of "runaway drying effect". <span class="time" data-times="5.33" data-time="227.55">[03:47.55]</span>As I said the monsoon migrated itself, so there was less rain in the Sahara. <span class="time" data-times="10.14" data-time="232.88">[03:52.88]</span>the land started to get drier, which in turn caused a huge <span class="underline">decrease</span> in the <span class="underline">amount</span> of <span class="underline">vegetation</span>, because <span class="underline">vegetation</span> doesn't grow as well in dry soil, right?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.09" data-time="243.02">[04:03.02]</span>And then, less <span class="underline">vegetation</span> means the soil can't hold water as well, the soil loses its <span class="underline">ability</span> to <span class="underline">retain</span> water when it does rain. <span class="time" data-times="6.63" data-time="252.11">[04:12.11]</span>So then you have less <span class="underline">moisture</span> to help clouds form, nothing to <span class="underline">evaporate</span> for cloud <span class="underline">formation</span>.<span class="time" data-times="8.89" data-time="258.74">[04:18.74]</span> And then the <span class="underline">cycle</span> continues, less rain, drier soil, less <span class="underline">vegetation</span>, fewer clouds, less rain etc. etc.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.87" data-time="267.63">[04:27.63]</span>Student: But, what about the people who made the rock paintings?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.25" data-time="270.5">[04:30.50]</span>Professor: Good question. No one really knows. <span class="time" data-times="3.02" data-time="273.75">[04:33.75]</span>But there might be some connections to <span class="underline">ancient</span> Egypt.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="0.49000000000002" data-time="276.77">[04:36.77]</span>Student: oh...</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.61" data-time="277.26">[04:37.26]</span>At about the same time that the Sahara was becoming a <span class="underline">desert</span>...hmm ...5,000 years ago, Egypt really began to <span class="underline">flourish</span> out in the Nile River <span class="underline">valley</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.15" data-time="287.87">[04:47.87]</span>And that's not that far away. <span class="time" data-times="10.75" data-time="290.02">[04:50.02]</span>So it's only <span class="underline">logical</span> to <span class="underline">hypothesize</span> that a lot of these people migrated to the Nile <span class="underline">valley</span> when they realized that this was more than a <span class="underline">temporary</span> <span class="underline">drought</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.19" data-time="300.77">[05:00.77]</span>And some people take this a step further. <span class="time" data-times="10.92" data-time="303.96">[05:03.96]</span>And that's okay, that's science and they <span class="underline">hypothesize</span> that this <span class="underline">migration</span> actually provided an important <span class="underline">impetus</span> in the <span class="underline">development</span> of <span class="underline">ancient</span> Egypt. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="314.88">[05:14.88]</span>Well, we'll stay tuned on that. </p>
