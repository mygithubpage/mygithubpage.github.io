          <h4 class="w3-center">History Seminars Should Be Shorter</h4>
          <p>Currently, all of the seminar classes in the history department are three hours long. I would like to propose that history seminars be shortened to two hours. I make this proposal for two reasons. First, most students just cannot concentrate for three hours straight. I myself have taken these three-hour seminars and found them tiring and sometimes boring. Also, when a seminar lasts that long, people stop concentrating and stop learning, so the third hour of a three-hour seminar is a waste of everyone's time. Two-hour seminars would be much more efficient.</p>

          <p>Now listen to two students discussing the letter.</p>
          <p>(woman) I totally disagree with Tim's proposal.</p>
          <p>(man) Why?</p>
          <p>(woman) Well, look, Tim's my friend but he's not your typical student. He stays up late partying every night, week nights, too.</p>
          <p>(man) If he parties every night no wonder he can't pay attention.</p>
          <p>(woman) Yes, and most students aren't like that. They come to class prepared and rested and they can concentrate.</p>
          <p>(man) So, you're saying that problem is really Tim.</p>
          <p>(woman) Yes. He was in one of my classes last year and whenever I looked at him he was actually sleeping.</p>
          <p>(man) I guess if he was sleeping, he can't really know what's happening, what other people in class are doing.</p>
          <p>(woman) Right! And you want to know what does happen in that last hour of seminar?</p>
          <p>In a lot of seminars that I've been in, that's when things get interesting.</p>
          <p>(man) Really?</p>
          <p>(woman) Yes, that's usually when students get really involved in the discussion and start exchanging important ideas, and if the History department actually did what Tim suggests, well if they did that, what would happen is you'd lose what might be the most worthwhile part of the seminar.</p>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>Well, the woman strongly disagrees with the proposal for two main reasons. Firstly, she believes that the problem of concentration is not typically shared by most of the students who just have regular routines of study and rests. Instead, the problem only lies in Tim's individual habits due to his partying late at night. Secondly, the woman feels that the last hour of seminar is the most worthwhile part of everything, for the reason that students usually get involved in the discussion and start exchanging important ideas. So based on all that reasons, the woman is strongly against the proposal. (103 words)</p>
