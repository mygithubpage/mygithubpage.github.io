Other people do different kinds of work at different points in their lives. Which do you think is better? Explain why.</p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>I think having different kinds of work at different points in lives is better. Life has different stages and in each stage people might want to do different things. For example, I have a friend who became a programmer when he just graduated from the college. After three-years programming, he got bored with it and wanted to be a designer. Then he changed his job to design the appearance of computers. After four-year's designing career, he suddenly wanted to be a writer. Since he never stopped reading and he loved novels, he was good at writing stories. Guess what? Now, he is a freelancer and has published several articles. He believes he has experienced enough and wants to write something out. Life is a long, long journey in which we go to many different places and in each place we do different things.</p></article></div></main></body></html>
