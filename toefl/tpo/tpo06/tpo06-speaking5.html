We are not getting much studying done, and, you know, none of us did very well on your last quiz.</p><p>(man) Hmmm, what's the problem?</p><p>(woman) Well, we've all become good friends and we joke around a lot instead of studying.</p><p>(man) Hmmm. Sara, let me ask you this. When do you meet?</p><p>(woman) Every Friday afternoon.</p><p>(man) Have you thought about changing to another day? By the time Friday afternoon rolls around, all of you are probably exhausted and all you want to do was relax and unwind. It's hard to stay focused at the very end of the week.</p><p>(woman) Good point, although things have gotten so out of hand that I'm not sure changing days would help. And we'd lose one or two people if we change days, Friday afternoon is the only time everyone's available, but it's worth considering.</p><p>(man) OK. But just a second, another possibility is, does your group have a leader?</p><p>(woman) No?</p><p>(man) Well, if you had a leader that would help enormously. Someone to set an agenda in advance, email it to everyone before the meeting and then make sure when you meet that you stay focused on your goals. And since you've seemed to be concerned enough about the problem to have come see me, I think that someone might be you.</p><p>(woman) I guess I can take on that role. But it sounds like work.</p><p>(man) You don't have to do it for the whole semester, Sara. You can start if off and then, perhaps, someone else can take over.</p></article><section id="question"><h4>Question</h4><p>The professor proposes two solutions to the problem the woman describes. Briefly summarize the problem then state which solution you recommend and explain why. </p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>Well the woman's problem is that the members of her study group have become very good friends but they are just joking around instead of studying and they don't get much study work done. Accordingly, the man offers two solutions: first she could probably have her study group meet on another day instead of Friday; and second, her study group should have a leader. In my opinion, the woman's 'study group should have a leader. Firstly, a leader of a study group could organize a clear and effective schedule for studying, and each time members meet, all they need to do is to follow the schedule and the leader will do the final check for the result of the group. Secondly, members could take turns to be a leader to make the study schedule of the group, which will be a better motivation for all members. (146 words)</p></article></div></main></body></html>
