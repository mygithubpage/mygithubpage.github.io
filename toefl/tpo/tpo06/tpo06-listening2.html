              <span class="time" data-times="3.98" data-time="8.45">[00:08.45]</span>Professor: Now when I <span class="underline">mention</span> the terms "<span class="underline">boom</span> and <span class="underline">bust</span>", what does that bring to <span class="underline">mind</span>?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.89" data-time="12.43">[00:12.43]</span>Student: The dot-com <span class="underline">crash</span> of the '90s.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.77" data-time="14.32">[00:14.32]</span>Professor: Ok. The <span class="underline">boom</span> in the late 1990s when all those new Internet companies sprang up and were then sold for huge amounts of money. <span class="time" data-times="8.06" data-time="22.09">[00:22.09]</span>Then the <span class="underline">bust</span> around 2000...2001 when many of those same Internet companies went out of business. <span class="time" data-times="2.92" data-time="30.15">[00:30.15]</span>Of <span class="underline">course</span>, booms aren't always followed by busts. <span class="time" data-times="6.49" data-time="33.07">[00:33.07]</span>We've certainly seen times when <span class="underline">local</span> economies expanded rapidly for a while and then went back to a normal pace of growth.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.66" data-time="39.56">[00:39.56]</span>But, there's a type of rapid <span class="underline">expansion</span>, what might be called a hysterical or irrational <span class="underline">boom</span> that <span class="underline">pretty</span> much always leads to a <span class="underline">bust</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9.77" data-time="48.22">[00:48.22]</span>See, people often create and <span class="underline">intensify</span> a <span class="underline">boom</span> when they get carried away by some new <span class="underline">industry</span> that seems like it will make them lots of money fast. <span class="time" data-times="3.92" data-time="57.99">[00:57.99]</span>You'd think that by the 90s, people would have learned from the past. <span class="time" data-times="3.55" data-time="61.91">[01:01.91]</span>If they did, well, look at tulips.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.84" data-time="65.46">[01:05.46]</span>Student: Tulips? You mean like the flower?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.46" data-time="68.3">[01:08.30]</span>Professor: Exactly. For <span class="underline">instance</span>, do you have any idea where tulips are from? <span class="time" data-times="1.32" data-time="72.76">[01:12.76]</span>Originally I mean.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.88" data-time="74.08">[01:14.08]</span>Student: Well, the Netherlands, right?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.37" data-time="75.96">[01:15.96]</span>Professor: That's what most people think, but no. <span class="time" data-times="3.03" data-time="78.33">[01:18.33]</span>They are not native to the Netherlands, or <span class="underline">even</span> Europe. <span class="time" data-times="9.47" data-time="81.36">[01:21.36]</span>Tulips actually <span class="underline">hail</span> from an area that Chinese call the Celestial Mountains in Central Asia, a very <span class="underline">remote</span> <span class="underline">mountainous</span> <span class="underline">region</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.92" data-time="90.83">[01:30.83]</span>It was Turkish nomads who first discovered tulips and <span class="underline">spread</span> them slowly westward.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.29" data-time="96.75">[01:36.75]</span>Now, around the 16th <span class="underline">century</span>, Europeans were traveling to Istanbul and <span class="underline">Turkey</span> as merchants and diplomats. <span class="time" data-times="6.01" data-time="105.04">[01:45.04]</span>And the Turks often gave the Europeans <span class="underline">tulip</span> bulbs as gifts which they would carry home with them. <span class="time" data-times="4.73" data-time="111.05">[01:51.05]</span>For the Europeans, tulips were totally unheard of, Er...a great <span class="underline">novelty</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.3" data-time="115.78">[01:55.78]</span>The first bulbs to show up in the Netherlands, the <span class="underline">merchant</span> who received them roasted and ate them! <span class="time" data-times="1.81" data-time="121.08">[02:01.08]</span>He thought they were kind of onion.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5" data-time="122.89">[02:02.89]</span>It turns out that the Netherlands was an <span class="underline">ideal</span> country for growing tulips. <span class="time" data-times="10.2" data-time="127.89">[02:07.89]</span>It had the right kind of sandy soil for one thing, but also, it was a wealthy nation with a growing <span class="underline">economy</span>, willing to spend lots of money on new <span class="underline">exotic</span> things. <span class="time" data-times="2.7" data-time="138.09">[02:18.09]</span>Plus, the Dutch had a <span class="underline">history</span> of gardening. <span class="time" data-times="6.8" data-time="140.79">[02:20.79]</span>Wealthy people would <span class="underline">compete</span>, spending <span class="underline">enormous</span> amounts of money to buy the rarest flowers for their gardens.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.18" data-time="147.59">[02:27.59]</span>Soon tulips were beginning to show up in different colors as growers tried to <span class="underline">breed</span> them <span class="underline">specifically</span> for colors which would make them <span class="underline">even</span> more <span class="underline">valuable</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.89" data-time="156.77">[02:36.77]</span>But they were never completely sure what they would get. <span class="time" data-times="10.87" data-time="159.66">[02:39.66]</span>Some of the most prized tulips were white with <span class="underline">purple</span> streaks, or red with yellow streaks on the petals, <span class="underline">even</span> a dark <span class="underline">purple</span> <span class="underline">tulip</span> that was very much prized.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.6" data-time="170.53">[02:50.53]</span>What happened then was a craze for these <span class="underline">specialized</span> tulips. <span class="time" data-times="2.56" data-time="175.13">[02:55.13]</span>We called that craze "<span class="underline">tulip</span> <span class="underline">mania</span>". <span class="time" data-times="15.47" data-time="177.69">[02:57.69]</span>So, here we've got all the conditions for an irrational boom: a prospering <span class="underline">economy</span>, so more people had more disposable income – money to spend on luxuries, but they weren't experienced at investing their new wealth.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.99" data-time="193.16">[03:13.16]</span>Then <span class="underline">along</span> comes a thrilling new <span class="underline">commodity</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.99" data-time="196.15">[03:16.15]</span>Sure the first specimens were just <span class="underline">plain</span> old red tulips, but they could be bred into some <span class="underline">extraordinary</span> variations, like the dark <span class="underline">purple</span> <span class="underline">tulip</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.15" data-time="204.14">[03:24.14]</span>And finally, you have an unregulated <span class="underline">market</span> place, no <span class="underline">government</span> constraints, where prices could <span class="underline">explode</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.02" data-time="212.29">[03:32.29]</span>And <span class="underline">explode</span> they did, starting in the 1630s.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.69" data-time="216.31">[03:36.31]</span>There was always much more demand for tulips than <span class="underline">supply</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.3" data-time="220">[03:40.00]</span>Tulips didn't <span class="underline">bloom</span> frequently like roses. <span class="time" data-times="2.61" data-time="223.3">[03:43.30]</span>Tulips bloomed once in the early <span class="underline">spring</span>.<span class="time" data-times="2.06" data-time="225.91">[03:45.91]</span> And that was it for the year. <span class="time" data-times="5.54" data-time="227.97">[03:47.97]</span>Eventually, specially-bred multicolored tulips became so <span class="underline">valuable</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.93" data-time="233.51">[03:53.51]</span>Well, according to records, one <span class="underline">tulip</span> <span class="underline">bulb</span> was <span class="underline">worth</span> 24 tons of wheat, or a thousand pounds of cheese. <span class="time" data-times="4.63" data-time="242.44">[04:02.44]</span>One <span class="underline">particular</span> <span class="underline">tulip</span> <span class="underline">bulb</span> was sold and exchanged for a small ship. <span class="time" data-times="4.93" data-time="247.07">[04:07.07]</span>In other words, tulips were <span class="underline">literally</span> <span class="underline">worth</span> their weight in gold.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.83" data-time="252">[04:12.00]</span>As demand grew, people began selling promissory notes guaranteeing the future delivery of prized <span class="underline">tulip</span> bulbs. <span class="time" data-times="4.45" data-time="260.83">[04:20.83]</span>The buyers of these pieces of paper would resell the notes at <span class="underline">marked</span> up prices. <span class="time" data-times="6.47" data-time="265.28">[04:25.28]</span>These promissory notes kept changing hands from buyer to buyer until the <span class="underline">tulip</span> was ready for delivery.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.68" data-time="271.75">[04:31.75]</span>But it was all <span class="underline">pure</span> speculation because as I said, there was no way to know if the <span class="underline">bulb</span> was really going to produce the <span class="underline">variety</span>, the color that was promised. <span class="time" data-times="2.69" data-time="280.43">[04:40.43]</span>But that didn't matter to the owner of the note. <span class="time" data-times="5.09" data-time="283.12">[04:43.12]</span>The owner only cared about having that piece of paper so it could be traded later at a profit. <span class="time" data-times="9.98" data-time="288.21">[04:48.21]</span>And people were borrowing, mortgaging their homes in many cases to <span class="underline">obtain</span> those bits of paper because they were sure they found an easy way to make money.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.05" data-time="298.19">[04:58.19]</span>So now, you've got all the ingredients for a huge <span class="underline">bust</span>. <span class="time" data-times="11.13" data-time="302.24">[05:02.24]</span>And <span class="underline">bust</span> it did, when one cold February morning in 1637, a group of <span class="underline">bulb</span> traders got together and discovered that suddenly there were no bidders. <span class="time" data-times="2.14" data-time="313.37">[05:13.37]</span>Nobody <span class="underline">wanted</span> to buy. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="315.51">[05:15.51]</span> <span class="underline">Panic</span> <span class="underline">spread</span> like wild fire and the <span class="underline">tulip</span> <span class="underline">market</span> collapsed totally.</p>
