The <span class="highlight">boom</span> in the late 1990s when all those new Internet companies sprang up and were then sold for huge amounts of money. <span class="time" data-times="8.06" data-time="22.09">[00:22.09]</span>Then the <span class="highlight">bust</span> around 2000...2001 when many of those same Internet companies went out of business. <span class="time" data-times="2.92" data-time="30.15">[00:30.15]</span>Of <span class="highlight">course</span>, booms aren't always followed by busts. <span class="time" data-times="6.49" data-time="33.07">[00:33.07]</span>We've certainly seen times when <span class="highlight">local</span> economies expanded rapidly for a while and then went back to a normal pace of growth.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="8.66" data-time="39.56">[00:39.56]</span>But, there's a type of rapid <span class="highlight">expansion</span>, what might be called a hysterical or irrational <span class="highlight">boom</span> that <span class="highlight">pretty</span> much always leads to a <span class="highlight">bust</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9.77" data-time="48.22">[00:48.22]</span>See, people often create and <span class="highlight">intensify</span> a <span class="highlight">boom</span> when they get carried away by some new <span class="highlight">industry</span> that seems like it will make them lots of money fast. <span class="time" data-times="3.92" data-time="57.99">[00:57.99]</span>You'd think that by the 90s, people would have learned from the past. <span class="time" data-times="3.55" data-time="61.91">[01:01.91]</span>If they did, well, look at tulips.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.84" data-time="65.46">[01:05.46]</span>Student: Tulips?

Turkish nomads who first discovered tulips and <span class="highlight">spread</span> them slowly westward.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="8.29" data-time="96.75">[01:36.75]</span>Now, around the 16th <span class="highlight">century</span>, Europeans were traveling to Istanbul and <span class="highlight">Turkey</span> as merchants and diplomats. <span class="time" data-times="6.01" data-time="105.04">[01:45.04]</span>And the Turks often gave the Europeans <span class="highlight">tulip</span> bulbs as gifts which they would carry home with them. <span class="time" data-times="4.73" data-time="111.05">[01:51.05]</span>For the Europeans, tulips were totally unheard of, Er...a great <span class="highlight">novelty</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.3" data-time="115.78">[01:55.78]</span>The first bulbs to show up in the Netherlands, the <span class="highlight">merchant</span> who received them roasted and ate them! <span class="time"

was an <span class="highlight">ideal</span> country for growing tulips. <span class="time" data-times="10.2" data-time="127.89">[02:07.89]</span>It had the right kind of sandy soil for one thing, but also, it was a wealthy nation with a growing <span class="highlight">economy</span>, willing to spend lots of money on new <span class="highlight">exotic</span> things. <span class="time" data-times="2.7" data-time="138.09">[02:18.09]</span>Plus, the Dutch had a <span class="highlight">history</span> of gardening. <span class="time" data-times="6.8" data-time="140.79">[02:20.79]</span>Wealthy people would <span class="highlight">compete</span>, spending <span class="highlight">enormous</span> amounts of money to buy the rarest flowers for their gardens.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="9.18" data-time="147.59">[02:27.59]</span>Soon tulips were beginning to show up in different colors as growers tried to <span

class="time" data-times="2.89" data-time="156.77">[02:36.77]</span>But they were never completely sure what they would get. <span class="time" data-times="10.87" data-time="159.66">[02:39.66]</span>Some of the most prized tulips were white with <span class="highlight">purple</span> streaks, or red with yellow streaks on the petals, <span

data-time="170.53">[02:50.53]</span>What happened then was a craze for these <span class="highlight">specialized</span> tulips. <span class="time" data-times="2.56"

data-time="177.69">[02:57.69]</span>So, here we've got all the conditions for an irrational boom: a prospering <span class="highlight">economy</span>, so more people had more disposable income – money to spend on luxuries, but they weren't experienced at investing their new wealth.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.99" data-time="193.16">[03:13.16]</span>Then <span

data-time="212.29">[03:32.29]</span>And <span class="highlight">explode</span> they did, starting in the 1630s.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.69" data-time="216.31">[03:36.31]</span>There was

data-times="2.06" data-time="225.91">[03:45.91]</span> And that was it for the year. <span class="time" data-times="5.54" data-time="227.97">[03:47.97]</span>Eventually, specially-bred multicolored tulips became so <span class="highlight">valuable</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.93" data-time="233.51">[03:53.51]</span>Well, according to records, one <span class="highlight">tulip</span><span class="highlight">bulb</span> was <span class="highlight">worth</span> 24 tons of wheat, or a thousand pounds of cheese. <span class="time" data-times="4.63" data-time="242.44">[04:02.44]</span>One <span class="highlight">particular</span><span class="highlight">tulip</span><span class="highlight">bulb</span> was sold and exchanged for a small ship. <span

gold.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="8.83" data-time="252">[04:12.00]</span>As demand grew, people began selling promissory notes guaranteeing the future delivery of prized <span

only cared about having that piece of paper so it could be traded later at a profit. <span class="time" data-times="9.98" data-time="288.21">[04:48.21]</span>And people were borrowing, mortgaging their homes in many cases to <span class="highlight">obtain</span> those bits of paper because they were sure they found an easy way to make money.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.05" data-time="298.19">[04:58.19]</span>So now, you've got all the ingredients for a huge <span class="highlight">bust</span>. <span class="time" data-times="11.13" data-time="302.24">[05:02.24]</span>And <span class="highlight">bust</span> it did, when one cold February morning in 1637, a group of <span class="highlight">bulb</span> traders got together and discovered that suddenly there were no
