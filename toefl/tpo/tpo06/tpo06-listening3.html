Um... it remained hidden for so long because it's so <span class="highlight">rare</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.89" data-time="29.55">[00:29.55]</span>There are only about 200 of them in <span class="highlight">existence</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.85" data-time="33.44">[00:33.44]</span>They grow in a rain forest, in a mountain <span class="highlight">range</span>...<span class="highlight">range</span> in the north part of New South Wales which is uh... a <span class="highlight">state</span> in Australia. <span class="time" data-times="4.31" data-time="42.29">[00:42.29]</span>So just 200 <span class="highlight">individual</span> trees in all. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="13.46" data-time="46.6">[00:46.60]</span>Now another interesting thing about the Nightcap Oak is that it is...it represents...uh...a very old type...uh...kind of tree that grew a hundred million years ago. <span class="time" data-times="5.06" data-time="60.06">[01:00.06]</span>Um, we found fossils that old that <span class="highlight">bear</span><span class="highlight">remarkable</span> resemblance to the tree. <span class="time" data-times="2.54" data-time="65.12">[01:05.12]</span>So, it's a <span class="highlight">primitive</span> tree. <span class="time" data-times="2.11" data-time="67.66">[01:07.66]</span>A...a living <span class="highlight">fossil</span> you might say. <span class="time" data-times="5.8" data-time="69.77">[01:09.77]</span>It's <span class="highlight">relic</span> from earlier times and it has survived all these years without much change. <span class="time" data-times="6.72" data-time="75.57">[01:15.57]</span>And it...it's probably a kind of tree from which other trees that grow in Australia today evolved. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.37" data-time="82.29">[01:22.29]</span>Just to give you an idea of what we are talking about. <span class="time" data-times="3.03" data-time="84.66">[01:24.66]</span>Here's a picture of the leaves of the tree and its flowers. <span class="time" data-times="3.08" data-time="87.69">[01:27.69]</span>I don't know how well you can see the flowers. <span class="time" data-times="3.97" data-time="90.77">[01:30.77]</span>They're those little clusters sitting at the <span class="highlight">base</span> of the leaves. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.31" data-time="94.74">[01:34.74]</span>Okay, what have we tried to find out about the tree since we've discovered it? <span class="time" data-times="4.74" data-time="100.05">[01:40.05]</span>Hmm...or how...why is...is it so <span class="highlight">rare</span>? <span class="time" data-times="1.42" data-time="104.79">[01:44.79]</span>It's one of the first questions. <span class="time" data-times="4.29" data-time="106.21">[01:46.21]</span>Um... how is it...um...how does it <span class="highlight">reproduce</span>? <span class="time" data-times="0.98" data-time="110.5">[01:50.50]</span>It's another question. <span class="time" data-times="5.21" data-time="111.48">[01:51.48]</span>Um, maybe those two questions are actually related. Jim? </p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.19" data-time="116.69">[01:56.69]</span>Student: Hmm ...I don't know. <span class="time" data-times="5.36" data-time="118.88">[01:58.88]</span>But I can imagine that...for <span class="highlight">instance</span>, seed <span class="highlight">dispersal</span> might be a <span class="highlight">factor</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.31" data-time="124.24">[02:04.24]</span>I mean if the...er...you know, if the seeds cannot really <span class="highlight">disperse</span> in the wild area, then, you know, the tree may not <span class="highlight">colonize</span> new areas. <span class="time" data-times="2.56" data-time="132.55">[02:12.55]</span>It can't <span class="highlight">spread</span> from the area where it's growing. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.13" data-time="135.11">[02:15.11]</span>Professor: Right. That's...that's actually a very good answer. <span class="time" data-times="11.19" data-time="138.24">[02:18.24]</span>Uh, of <span class="highlight">course</span>, you might think there might not be many areas where the tree could <span class="highlight">spread</span> into, er...because...um...well, it's very <span class="highlight">specialized</span> in terms of the <span class="highlight">habitat</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.47" data-time="149.43">[02:29.43]</span>But, that's not really the case here. <span class="time" data-times="8.86" data-time="151.9">[02:31.90]</span>Um...the <span class="highlight">suitable</span><span class="highlight">habitat</span>, that is, the actual rainforest is much larger than the few hectares where the Nightcap Oak grows </p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.18" data-time="160.76">[02:40.76]</span>Now this tree is a flowering tree as I showed you. <span class="time" data-times="4.58" data-time="163.94">[02:43.94]</span>Um...um...it produces a fruit, much like a plum. <span class="time" data-times="3.03" data-time="168.52">[02:48.52]</span>On the inci...inside there's a seed with a hard <span class="highlight">shell</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.79" data-time="171.55">[02:51.55]</span>It...it appears that the <span class="highlight">shell</span> has to <span class="highlight">crack</span> open or <span class="highlight">break</span> down <span class="highlight">somewhat</span> to allow the seed to <span class="highlight">soak</span> up water. <span class="time" data-times="6.95" data-time="178.34">[02:58.34]</span>If the Nightcap Oak remains...if their seeds <span class="highlight">remain</span> locked inside their <span class="highlight">shell</span>, they will not <span class="highlight">germinate</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.56" data-time="185.29">[03:05.29]</span>Actually, the seeds...er...they don't <span class="highlight">retain</span> the power to <span class="highlight">germinate</span> for very long, maybe two years. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.4" data-time="192.85">[03:12.85]</span>So there's actually quite a short window of <span class="highlight">opportunity</span> for the seed to <span class="highlight">germinate</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.26" data-time="197.25">[03:17.25]</span>So the <span class="highlight">shell</span> somehow has to be broken down before this...um...germination <span class="highlight">ability</span> expires. <span class="time" data-times="4.47" data-time="204.51">[03:24.51]</span>And...and then there's a kind of rat that likes to feed on the seeds as well. <span class="time" data-times="6.48" data-time="208.98">[03:28.98]</span>So, <span class="highlight">given</span> all these limitations, not many seeds that the tree produces will actually <span class="highlight">germinate</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.75" data-time="215.46">[03:35.46]</span>So this is a possible explanation for why the tree does not <span class="highlight">spread</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.43" data-time="220.21">[03:40.21]</span>It doesn't necessarily explain how it became so <span class="highlight">rare</span>, but it explains why it doesn't increase. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.37" data-time="226.64">[03:46.64]</span>OK, so it seems to be the case that the <span class="highlight">species</span>, this Nightcap Oak is not very good at spreading. <span class="time" data-times="8.09" data-time="234.01">[03:54.01]</span>However, it seems, though we can't be sure, that it's very good at persisting as a <span class="highlight">population</span>. <span class="time" data-times="12.28" data-time="242.1">[04:02.10]</span>Um...we...there's some indications to suggest that the <span class="highlight">population</span> of the Nightcap Oak has not declined over the last. er...you know, many hundreds of years. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.77" data-time="254.38">[04:14.38]</span>So it's stayed quite <span class="highlight">stable</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.79" data-time="257.15">[04:17.15]</span>It's not a <span class="highlight">remnant</span> of some huge <span class="highlight">population</span> that is dwindled in the last few hundred years for some <span class="highlight">reason</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.04" data-time="263.94">[04:23.94]</span>It's not necessarily a <span class="highlight">species</span> in <span class="highlight">retreat</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.73" data-time="266.98">[04:26.98]</span>Ok, so it cannot <span class="highlight">spread</span> very well, but it's good at maintaining itself. <span class="time" data-times="3.14" data-time="272.71">[04:32.71]</span>It's <span class="highlight">rare</span>, but it's not disappearing. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="8.15" data-time="275.85">[04:35.85]</span>Ok, the next thing we might want to ask about a plant like that is: What chances does it have to <span class="highlight">survive</span> into the future? <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="284">[04:44.00]</span>Let's look at that. </p></p></article></section><div id="question"><div id="question1"><p>What topic related to the Nightcap Oak does the professor mainly
