It's our big family photo. It was taken in one Spring Festival when all relatives gathered together. It's very hard to unite all the family members since my aunts and uncles all live in another city. Usually, some uncles or aunts wouldn't come back home to spend spring festival. But at that time, they all came back. In the photo I can see myself standing at the third row with my parents beside me and all my aunts, uncles and cousins standing in rows. In the front row sit my grandparents. They were very happy. We all got our huge smiles on our faces. It was an unforgettable moment and the photograph captured it.</p></article></div></main></body></html>
