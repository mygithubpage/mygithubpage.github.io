Ellen? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.22" data-time="38.8">[00:38.80]</span>
              <span class="underline">Female</span> Student: It's the deepest <span class="underline">limestone</span> cave in the US? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.49" data-time="43.02">[00:43.02]</span>Professor: That's right. It's one of the longest and deepest <span class="underline">limestone</span> caves not just in the country but in the world. <span class="time" data-times="1.29" data-time="50.51">[00:50.51]</span>Now, what else? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.87" data-time="51.8">[00:51.80]</span>
              <span class="underline">Female</span> student: Well, it was formed because of sulfuric <span class="underline">acid</span>, right? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.62" data-time="55.67">[00:55.67]</span>Professor: That's it, yeah, what happens is you have deep <span class="underline">underground</span> oil deposits and there are <span class="underline">bacteria</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.95" data-time="63.29">[01:03.29]</span>Here, let me <span class="underline">draw</span> a <span class="underline">diagram</span>. (Surface, Rock, Rock and water, Oil and <span class="underline">bacteria</span>) </p>

              <span class="time" data-times="8.51" data-time="66.24">[01:06.24]</span>Part of the <span class="underline">limestone</span> rock layers permeated by water from below, those curly lines are supposed to be cracks in the rocks. <span class="time" data-times="4.4" data-time="74.75">[01:14.75]</span>Below the water table and rock is oil. <span class="time" data-times="4.96" data-time="79.15">[01:19.15]</span> <span class="underline">Bacteria</span> feed on this oil and <span class="underline">release</span> <span class="underline">hydrogen</span> <span class="underline">sulfide</span> gas. <span class="time" data-times="9.67" data-time="84.11">[01:24.11]</span>This gas is <span class="underline">hydrogen</span> <span class="underline">sulfide</span>, rises up and mixes with <span class="underline">oxygen</span> and the <span class="underline">underground</span> water that sits in the cracks and fissures in the <span class="underline">limestone</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.97" data-time="93.78">[01:33.78]</span>And when <span class="underline">hydrogen</span> <span class="underline">sulfide</span> reacts with the <span class="underline">oxygen</span> in the water, the result of that is sulfuric <span class="underline">acid</span>. OK? <span class="time" data-times="13.81" data-time="102.75">[01:42.75]</span>Sulfuric <span class="underline">acid</span> eats away at <span class="underline">limestone</span> very aggressively, so you get bigger cracks and then <span class="underline">passage</span> ways being formed <span class="underline">along</span> the openings in the rock, and it's all <span class="underline">underground</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.23" data-time="116.56">[01:56.56]</span>Uh, yes, Paul? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.06" data-time="118.79">[01:58.79]</span>
              <span class="underline">Male</span> student : So that water's not flowing, right? It's still? </p>

              <span class="time" data-times="3.97" data-time="122.85">[02:02.85]</span>Professor: Yes, so there's two kinds of <span class="underline">limestone</span> caves. <span class="time" data-times="10.56" data-time="126.82">[02:06.82]</span>In about 90 percent of them, you have water from the surface, streams, waterfall, whatever, moving water that flows <span class="underline">through</span> cracks found in <span class="underline">limestone</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.14" data-time="137.38">[02:17.38]</span>It's the moving water itself that wears away at the rock and make <span class="underline">passage</span> ways. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="11.6" data-time="142.52">[02:22.52]</span>Also, in surface water there's a weak <span class="underline">acid</span>, <span class="underline">carbonic</span> <span class="underline">acid</span>, not sulfuric <span class="underline">acid</span> but <span class="underline">carbonic</span> <span class="underline">acid</span> that help <span class="underline">dissolve</span> the rock. <span class="time" data-times="7.68" data-time="154.12">[02:34.12]</span>With a little help from this <span class="underline">carbonic</span> <span class="underline">acid</span>, moving water forms most the world's <span class="underline">limestone</span> caves. </p>

              <span class="time" data-times="11.08" data-time="161.8">[02:41.80]</span>When I was researching this for a study a few years ago, I visited a <span class="underline">couple</span> of these <span class="underline">typical</span> <span class="underline">limestone</span> caves, and they were all very wet, you know, from streams and rivers. <span class="time" data-times="4.96" data-time="172.88">[02:52.88]</span>This flowing water carved out the caves and the structures inside them. </p>

            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.78" data-time="210.31">[03:30.31]</span>And since they were created <span class="underline">underground</span>, and not from flowing surface water, not all these <span class="underline">passage</span> ways have an opening to the outside world. <span class="time" data-times="6.06" data-time="219.09">[03:39.09]</span>And, and there's other <span class="underline">evidence</span> that flowing water wasn't involved in Lechuguilla. <span class="time" data-times="4.23" data-time="225.15">[03:45.15]</span>We've said that sulfuric <span class="underline">acid</span> dissolves <span class="underline">limestone</span>, right? <span class="time" data-times="2.04" data-time="229.38">[03:49.38]</span>And forms the <span class="underline">passage</span> ways? <span class="time" data-times="5.01" data-time="231.42">[03:51.42]</span>What else does sulfuric <span class="underline">acid</span> do?

              <span class="underline">Female</span> student: Gypsum, right? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.39" data-time="240.43">[04:00.43]</span>Professor: Yeah. You'll find lots of gypsum deposited at Lechuguilla. <span class="time" data-times="8.46" data-time="244.82">[04:04.82]</span>And as we know, gypsum is <span class="underline">soluble</span> in water, so if there were flowing water in the cave, it would <span class="underline">dissolve</span> the gypsum. <span class="time" data-times="7.32" data-time="253.28">[04:13.28]</span>This is part of what led us to the <span class="underline">realization</span> that Lechuguilla is in that small group of waterless caves. <span class="time" data-times="3.92" data-time="260.6">[04:20.60]</span>And Lechuguilla's <span class="underline">pretty</span> much <span class="underline">dormant</span> now. <span class="time" data-times="2.4" data-time="264.52">[04:24.52]</span>It's not really forming any more. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.1" data-time="266.92">[04:26.92]</span>But, there's other ones like it, for example, in Mexico, that are forming. <span class="time" data-times="8.4" data-time="273.02">[04:33.02]</span>And when cave researchers go to <span class="underline">explore</span> them, they see and smell the sulfuric <span class="underline">acid</span> and gases at work. <span class="time" data-times="4.3" data-time="281.42">[04:41.42]</span>Phew, now, something else, think of rotten eggs. <span class="time" data-times="10.12" data-time="285.72">[04:45.72]</span>And it's not just the smell, explorers <span class="underline">even</span> need to <span class="underline">wear</span> <span class="underline">special</span> masks to protect themselves from gases in these caves. OK, um, Paul? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.5" data-time="295.84">[04:55.84]</span>
              <span class="underline">Male</span> student: Yeah, how about what these caves look like on the inside? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.45" data-time="299.34">[04:59.34]</span>Professor: Well, the formations are really something. <span class="time" data-times="4.28" data-time="302.79">[05:02.79]</span>Um, there are such varieties there, like, nothing anywhere else in the world. <span class="time" data-times="7.68" data-time="307.07">[05:07.07]</span>Some of them are <span class="underline">elaborate</span> looking like decorations, and a lot of them are made of gypsum and could be up to twenty feet long. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="314.75">[05:14.75]</span>It's <span class="underline">pretty</span> <span class="underline">impressive</span>. </p>
