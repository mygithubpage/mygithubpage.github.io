        <article>
          <p>Now listen to a conversation between two students.</p>
          <p>Woman: Hey Steve, did you get that book on the Russian Revolution that Professor Harper wants us to read?</p>
          <p>Man: No, none of the bookstores in the campus area had it in stock. They'll get it in about two weeks.</p>
          <p>Woman: Hm...so what are you going to do in the meantime? Remember, that we're going to be discussing the book starting next Tuesday.</p>
          <p>Man: I was thinking of placing a rush order with a bookseller on the internet, so I'd have the book in about a day or two.Woman: Yeah, but rush order delivery is expensive. You could easily spend twice as much money for the book that way.</p>
          <p>Man: I know, but what choice do I have?</p>
          <p>Woman: Well, since we only have to read a couple of chapters at a time, you're welcome to share my copy for a few weeks. You know, until you can get yours at the bookstore.</p>
          <p>Man: You mean...you would read the chapters assigned, give the book to me, I'd read those chapters, then give the book back to you to read the next set of chapters, and so on.</p>
          <p>Woman: Exactly.Man: Thanks! But, what if I don't get the book back to you in time. Wouldn't you get behind in your reading?</p>
          <p>Woman: Yeah maybe. Bu t it should work if we're careful.</p>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>Well, the man's problem is that he needs to read a book for the class discussion but he could get a copy. Accordingly there're two solutions for the man: he could place a rush order online or he could share the woman's copy. I think the man should share the woman's copy simply because the double-priced rush order is way too expensive. Besides, to share reading always means sharing thoughts and sometimes inspirations come out. By careful schedule and regular meetings, the man and the woman could have enough time to discuss and share ideas and insights together, which will be perfect preparation for their discussion in class. In a nut shell, I prefer the second solution for the man. (122 words)</p>
