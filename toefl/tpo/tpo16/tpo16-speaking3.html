          <h4 class="w3-center">Student Health Services Need Improvement</h4>
          <p>The situation at the health center is unacceptable: you sit in a crowded waiting room for hours waiting to get treatment for minor ailments. Then when it's your turn, you get about three minutes with an overworked doctor. I have two suggestions first, the health center needs to hire more doctors so that each patient receives quality treatment. And as far as the wait time issue is concerned, the health center is currently open only Monday through Fridays, which means that people who get sick over the weekend wait until the following week to get treatment So, opening the health center on weekends should solve that problem too.Sincerely,Megan Finch</p>

        <h3>Listening Text</h3>
        <article>
          <p>Now listen to two students discussing the letter.</p>
          <p>Woman: Did you read that letter in the paper?</p>
          <p>Man: Sure, and though she's right about the problems, I don't think what she proposes will do much good.</p>
          <p>Woman: Really?</p>
          <p>Man: Yeah. Take her first suggestion: I mean, have you seen the health center Woman: Of course! Why?</p>
          <p>Man: Well...it's tiny. It suffers from lack of space, so, unless they build more</p>
          <p>treatment rooms or offices or something...</p>
          <p>Woman: Oh, I see...</p>
          <p>Man: And also, her second suggestion.</p>
          <p>Woman: It seems like that'll help things out...</p>
          <p>Man: Well...not necessarily...I mean...think about it. A lot of students aren't even here on the weekends.</p>
          <p>Woman: That's true.</p>
          <p>Man: They leave town and get away; there's not a lot of people here.</p>
          <p>Woman: Yeah, like me, I got home probably...at least twice a month.</p>
          <p>Man: Right, and a lot of us leave campus for the weekend even more often than that.</p>
          <p>So there's just not a lot of demand for treatment then. See what I mean?</p>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>Well, the man disagrees with the suggestions in the letter for two major reasons. First of all, he thinks that hiring more doctors won't solve the problem simply because the health center is tiny and therefore wouldn't support more doctors or patients. So he believes that there should be more room before hiring more doctors. Secondly, he says that opening the health center on weekends wouldn't fix the problem either, since students are generally away on weekends-there won't be many students there. Opening the health center on weekends makes no point at all. So the man disagrees with the suggestions in the letter. (104 words)</p>
