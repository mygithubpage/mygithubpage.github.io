An estimated 99.85 percent of the <span class="highlight">mass</span> of our <span class="highlight">solar</span> system is contained <span class="highlight">within</span> the Sun, while the planets <span class="highlight">collectively</span> make up most of the <span class="highlight">remaining</span> 0.15 percent. The planets, in order of their distance from the Sun, are <span class="highlight">Mercury</span>, <span class="highlight">Venus</span>, Earth, Mars, <span class="highlight">Jupiter</span>, <span class="highlight">Saturn</span>, Uranus, Neptune, and <span class="highlight">Pluto</span>. Under the control of the Sun's <span class="highlight">gravitational</span> force, each <span class="highlight">planet</span> maintains an <span class="highlight">elliptical</span><span class="highlight">orbit</span> and all of them travel in the same direction.</p><p>The planets in our <span class="highlight">solar</span> system fall into two groups: the <span class="highlight">terrestrial</span> (Earth-like) planets (<span class="highlight">Mercury</span>, <span class="highlight">Venus</span>, Earth, and Mars) and the Jovian (Jupiter-like) planets (<span class="highlight">Jupiter</span>, <span class="highlight">Saturn</span>, Uranus, and Neptune). <span class="highlight">Pluto</span> is not included in either <span class="highlight">category</span>, because its great distance from Earth and its small size make this <span class="highlight">planet</span>'s true nature a mystery. The most <span class="highlight">obvious</span><span class="highlight">difference</span> between the <span class="highlight">terrestrial</span> and the Jovian planets is their size. The largest <span class="highlight">terrestrial</span><span class="highlight">planet</span>, Earth has a <span class="highlight">diameter</span> only one quarter as great as the <span class="highlight">diameter</span> of the smallest Jovian <span class="highlight">planet</span>, Neptune, and its <span class="highlight">mass</span> is only one seventeenth as great. Hence, the Jovian planets are often called giants. Also, because of their <span class="highlight">relative</span> locations, the four Jovian planets are known as the outer planets, while the <span class="highlight">terrestrial</span> planets are known as the <span class="highlight">inner</span> planets. There appears to be a correlation between the positions of these planets and their sizes.</p><p>Other dimensions <span class="highlight">along</span> which the two groups differ <span class="highlight"><span class="question2">markedly</span></span> are <span class="highlight">density</span> and <span class="highlight">composition</span>. The densities of the <span class="highlight">terrestrial</span> planets <span class="highlight">average</span> about 5 times the <span class="highlight">density</span> of water, whereas the Jovian planets have densities that <span class="highlight">average</span> only 1.5 times the <span class="highlight">density</span> of water. One of the outer planets, <span class="highlight">Saturn</span>, has a <span class="highlight">density</span> of only 0.7 that of water, which means that <span class="highlight">Saturn</span> would <span class="highlight">float</span> in water. Variations in the <span class="highlight">composition</span> of the planets are largely <span class="highlight">responsible</span> for the <span class="highlight">density</span> differences. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>The substances that make up both groups of planets are divided into three groups-gases, rocks, and ices-based on their <span class="highlight">melting</span> points. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>The <span class="highlight">terrestrial</span> planets are mostly rocks: <span class="highlight"><span class="highlight">dense</span></span><span class="highlight">rocky</span> and <span class="highlight">metallic</span><span class="highlight">material</span>, with <span class="highlight">minor</span> amounts of gases. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>The Jovian planets, on the other hand, <span class="highlight">contain</span> a large percentage of the gases <span class="highlight">hydrogen</span> and <span class="highlight">helium</span>, with varying amounts of ices: mostly water, <span class="highlight">ammonia</span>, and <span class="highlight">methane</span> ices. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p><p>The Jovian planets have very thick atmospheres consisting of varying amounts of <span class="highlight">hydrogen</span>, <span class="highlight">helium</span>, <span class="highlight">methane</span>, and <span class="highlight">ammonia</span>. By <span class="highlight">comparison</span>, the <span class="highlight">terrestrial</span> planets have <span class="highlight"><span class="question5">meager</span></span> atmospheres at best. A <span class="highlight">planet</span>'s <span class="highlight">ability</span> to <span class="highlight">retain</span> an <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span> depends on its <span class="highlight">temperature</span> and <span class="highlight">mass</span>. <span class="highlight">Simply</span> stated, a gas <span class="highlight">molecule</span> can "evaporate" from a <span class="highlight">planet</span> if it reaches a speed known as the <span class="highlight">escape</span><span class="highlight">velocity</span>. For Earth, this <span class="highlight">velocity</span> is 11 kilometers per <span class="highlight">second</span>. Any <span class="highlight">material</span>, including a rocket, must <span class="highlight">reach</span> this speed before it can leave Earth and go into <span class="highlight">space</span>. The Jovian planets, because of their greater masses and thus higher surface gravities, have higher <span class="highlight">escape</span> velocities (21-60 kilometers per <span class="highlight">second</span>) than the <span class="highlight">terrestrial</span> planets. Consequently, it is more difficult for gases to "evaporate" from them. Also, because the molecular <span class="highlight">motion</span> of a gas depends on <span class="highlight">temperature</span>, at the low temperatures of the Jovian planets <span class="highlight">even</span> the lightest gases are <span class="highlight">unlikely</span> to <span class="highlight">acquire</span> the speed needed to <span class="highlight">escape</span>. On the other hand, a <span class="highlight">comparatively</span> warm body with a small surface <span class="highlight">gravity</span>, like Earth's moon, is unable to hold <span class="highlight">even</span> the heaviest gas and thus lacks an <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span>. The <span class="highlight">slightly</span> larger <span class="highlight">terrestrial</span> planets Earth, <span class="highlight">Venus</span>, and Mars <span class="highlight">retain</span> some heavy gases like <span class="highlight">carbon</span><span class="highlight">dioxide</span>, but <span class="highlight">even</span> their atmospheres make up only an infinitesimally small <span class="highlight">portion</span> of their total <span class="highlight">mass</span>.</p><p>The orderly nature of our <span class="highlight">solar</span> system leads most astronomers to <span class="highlight">conclude</span> that the planets formed at <span class="highlight">essentially</span> the same time and from the same <span class="highlight">material</span> as the Sun. It is hypothesized that the <span class="highlight"><span class="question9">primordial</span></span> cloud of dust and gas from which all the planets are thought to have condensed had a <span class="highlight">composition</span><span class="highlight">somewhat</span><span class="highlight">similar</span> to that of <span class="highlight">Jupiter</span>. However, unlike <span class="highlight">Jupiter</span>, the <span class="highlight">terrestrial</span> planets today are nearly void of light gases and ices. The explanation may be that the <span class="highlight">terrestrial</span> planets were once much larger and richer in these materials but <span class="highlight"><span class="question10">eventually</span></span> lost them because of these bodies' <span class="highlight">relative</span> closeness to the Sun, which meant that their temperatures were <span class="highlight">relatively</span> high.</p><p>The orderly nature of our <span class="highlight">solar</span> system leads most astronomers to <span class="highlight">conclude</span> that the planets formed at <span class="highlight">essentially</span> the same time and from the same <span class="highlight">material</span> as the Sun.

Terrestrial planets are closer to the Sun than Jovian planets.</p><p>B. Terrestrial planets have smaller diameters than Jovian planets.</p><p>C. Terrestrial planets have smaller masses than Jovian planets.</p><p>D. Terrestrial planets travel in a different direction than Jovian planets do.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D EXCEPT questions, exclusion methods, ask the entire article, so we should pay attention to the beginning of each paragraph. The second paragraph mentions that it is divided into two categories. The third and fourth paragraphs describe the difference; A closer's keyword is positioned to the second to last sentence of the third paragraph. It is correct and not selected; B's diameter is targeted to the third paragraph. The second sentence, correct, not selected; C's smaller masses do keyword positioning to the size of the first sentence of the third paragraph, correct, not selected; D and the original sentence of the first paragraph of the end of the sentence, wrong, election.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word |<span class="question2">markedly</span>|in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Essentially</p><p>B. Typically</p><p>C. Consistently</p><p>D. noticeably</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D <span class="question2">markedly</span>: Significant. A is essential, essentially; B is typically; C is consistently, consistently; D is significant. So the answer is D's noticeably.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Paragraph 3 mentions which of the following as a reason why terrestrial planets are dense?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They are made up of three groups of substances.</p><p>B. They are composed mainly of rocky and metallic materials.</p><p>C. They contain more ice than Jovian planets.</p><p>D. They contain relatively small amounts of water.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B. Use dense as the key word to locate the first sentence. But this sentence is simply to say that the terrestrial planets are denser than the woody planets, and no reason is given. The correct answer is in the third sentence of the density difference. The difference in density, so the answer is B, mainly composed of metal and rock. A is not the cause. C did not say D.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Paragraph 3 supports each of the following statements about Saturn EXCEPT:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It is less dense than any of the terrestrial planets.</p><p>B. It contains no rocky material.</p><p>C. It contains ices.</p><p>D. It contains a large percentage of gases.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B EXCEPT questions, elimination methods, A's senses are targeted to the first and second sentence, said that the density of terrestrial planets is roughly five times that of water and Saturn is 0.7 times that of water, so A says Saturn is better than any kind of land. The density of the planets is small and correct, and they are not selected. The rocky material of B is targeted to the countdown phrase. It is said that the terrestrial planets are mainly composed of stony materials, and the woody planets are mainly composed of gaseous substances. It is not said that the planets belong to the woody planets of Saturn. No stone material, wrong, selected; also proved that C and D are correct and not selected.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word |<span class="question5">meager</span>|in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. rich</p><p>B. thin</p><p>C. unique</p><p>D. complex</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B <span class="question5">meager</span>: rare, thin. A is rich; B is thin; C is unique; D is complicated. So answer B is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, which of the following statements is true of both Jovian and terrestrial planets?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The thicker the atmosphere, the smaller the planet's mass</p><p>B. The more varied the gases in the atmosphere, the higher the temperature</p><p>C. The higher the surface gravity, the higher the escape velocity</p><p>D. The less the atmosphere contributes to the total mass, the lower the temperature</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C Because we asked two kinds of stars at the same time, we couldn't find any one of them. Then we looked down and said that the ability of the planet to maintain its atmosphere depends on its temperature and volume. The following is a description of the larger the volume and the lower the temperature. The more difficult it is for the gas to escape, that is, the greater the escape velocity, the thicker the atmosphere. So A and D said the opposite, B did not say, the answer is C. We can use exclusion method if we cannot choose.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, what is a major reason that Jovian planets have much thicker atmospheres than terrestrial planets do?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Jovian planets have lower surface gravities</p><p>B. Jovian planets have lower temperatures</p><p>C. Jovian planets have lower escape velocities</p><p>D. Jovian planets' gas molecules have higher average speeds</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B connected to the title, wood-like planets are large, low temperature, large gravity, large escape speed, so A and C said the opposite; B correct. The penultimate sentence of the original text says that the speed of movement of gas molecules depends on the temperature. The lower the temperature, the lower the speed of movement of the molecules, so D and B are actually anti-D, so D also said the opposite.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Paragraph 4 supports which of the following statements about the ability of planets to retain gases?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. More-massive planets are less able to retain gases than less-massive ones.</p><p>B. Planets are more likely to retain heavy gases than light gases.</p><p>C. Jovian planets are unlikely to retain the lightest gases.</p><p>D. Only terrestrial planets have been able to retain carbon dioxide.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B connected to the question, wood-like planets are large, low temperature, large gravity, escape speed, more likely to have a thick atmosphere, so A and C said the opposite; and D is obviously wrong, so the correct answer is B.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>In calling the cloud of gas and dust from which the Sun and all the planets are thought to have condensed "<span class="highlight">primordial</span>" the author means that the cloud was</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. immense in size</p><p>B. composed of similar particles</p><p>C. present at the very beginning of our solar system's formation</p><p>D. created from a great variety of different materials</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C. The rhetorical purpose question and the sentence where the rhetorical point is located merely speak of a fact. In the past, the former said that the orderliness of the solar system made astronomers believe that the solar system and the sun itself were formed at the same time. Since it is orderly, afterwards must start to say this order, so the answer is C, the first time the solar system was formed, and the entire paragraph has been emphasizing the concept of time, so C is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word |eventually|in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. over time</p><p>B. long ago</p><p>C. simply</p><p>D. certainly</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A finally: Finally, finally. A is over time; B was long ago; C is simply; D is of course. So A's over time is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 5, what is a possible explanation for the lack of light gases and ices on terrestrial planets?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The location of terrestrial planets caused them to lose some of the materials they once contained.</p><p>B. Terrestrial planets were formed much later than Jovian planets.</p><p>C. The composition of terrestrial planets was different from that of Jupiter.</p><p>D. Terrestrial planets were formed out of different material than the Sun was.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A. Use lack of gases and ices as the key words to locate the second last sentence. This sentence is simply a phenomenon. The last sentence is an explanation, and this sentence has already been said, saying that because of the distance from the sun, terrestrial planets eventually These gaseous substances were lost, so the answer is A. The rest of the answers are contrary to the first sentence of this paragraph.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>This explains their relatively low densities..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D, the three transition points, are the pronouns this, verbs explain the expression of causality and nouns low density; original penultimate sentence that the type of planet density, then said that the woody planet density is small, corresponding to low density, is a Synonymous substitutions that are not easily identifiable, so C or D is the answer, and causality proves that D is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="table"><div class="question"><p>From the seven answer choices below, select the two phrases that correctly characterize the terrestrial planets and the three phrases that correctly characterize the Jovian planets.

It should be noted that the paragraphs 345 and 4-5 respectively describe the differences between terrestrial planets and woody planets, mainly in terms of size, density and composition. The comparatively small size option corresponds to the second sentence of the third paragraph and should belong to the terrestrial planets; the contain option corresponds to the last sentence of the fourth paragraph and belongs to the class of Jupiter; the temperatures option corresponds to the third sentence of the fifth paragraph. The higher the temperature, the escape velocity. The smaller, the worse the ability to collect gas, so it should belong to terrestrial planets; density options are somewhat confusing, the fourth paragraph of the original said that the type of planet density of large wood planet density is small, that is, the average density of woody planets It is 1.5 times that of water. Only Saturn is smaller than water, so this option is wrong and does not belong to any column; the escape velocity corresponds to the third and fourth sentences of the fifth paragraph and belongs to the class of Jupiter; the composition option corresponds to the sixth paragraph of the original text. Two sentences belong to the class of Jupiter.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
