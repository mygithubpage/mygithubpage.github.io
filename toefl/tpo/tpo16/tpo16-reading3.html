            <b>Planets in Our Solar System</b>
          </h4>
          <p>The Sun is the hub of a huge rotating system consisting of nine planets, their satellites, and <span class="underline">numerous</span> small bodies, including asteroids, comets, and meteoroids. An estimated 99.85 percent of the <span class="underline">mass</span> of our <span class="underline">solar</span> system is contained <span class="underline">within</span> the Sun, while the planets <span class="underline">collectively</span> make up most of the <span class="underline">remaining</span> 0.15 percent. The planets, in order of their distance from the Sun, are <span class="underline">Mercury</span>, <span class="underline">Venus</span>, Earth, Mars, <span class="underline">Jupiter</span>, <span class="underline">Saturn</span>, Uranus, Neptune, and <span class="underline">Pluto</span>. Under the control of the Sun's <span class="underline">gravitational</span> force, each <span class="underline">planet</span> maintains an <span class="underline">elliptical</span> <span class="underline">orbit</span> and all of them travel in the same direction.</p>
          <p>The planets in our <span class="underline">solar</span> system fall into two groups: the <span class="underline">terrestrial</span> (Earth-like) planets (<span class="underline">Mercury</span>, <span class="underline">Venus</span>, Earth, and Mars) and the Jovian (Jupiter-like) planets (<span class="underline">Jupiter</span>, <span class="underline">Saturn</span>, Uranus, and Neptune). <span class="underline">Pluto</span> is not included in either <span class="underline">category</span>, because its great distance from Earth and its small size make this <span class="underline">planet</span>'s true nature a mystery. The most <span class="underline">obvious</span> <span class="underline">difference</span> between the <span class="underline">terrestrial</span> and the Jovian planets is their size. The largest <span class="underline">terrestrial</span> <span class="underline">planet</span>, Earth has a <span class="underline">diameter</span> only one quarter as great as the <span class="underline">diameter</span> of the smallest Jovian <span class="underline">planet</span>, Neptune, and its <span class="underline">mass</span> is only one seventeenth as great. Hence, the Jovian planets are often called giants. Also, because of their <span class="underline">relative</span> locations, the four Jovian planets are known as the outer planets, while the <span class="underline">terrestrial</span> planets are known as the <span class="underline">inner</span> planets. There appears to be a correlation between the positions of these planets and their sizes.</p>
          <p>Other dimensions <span class="underline">along</span> which the two groups differ <span class="underline">markedly</span> are <span class="underline">density</span> and <span class="underline">composition</span>. The densities of the <span class="underline">terrestrial</span> planets <span class="underline">average</span> about 5 times the <span class="underline">density</span> of water, whereas the Jovian planets have densities that <span class="underline">average</span> only 1.5 times the <span class="underline">density</span> of water. One of the outer planets, <span class="underline">Saturn</span>, has a <span class="underline">density</span> of only 0.7 that of water, which means that <span class="underline">Saturn</span> would <span class="underline">float</span> in water. Variations in the <span class="underline">composition</span> of the planets are largely <span class="underline">responsible</span> for the <span class="underline">density</span> differences. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>The substances that make up both groups of planets are divided into three groups-gases, rocks, and ices-based on their <span class="underline">melting</span> points. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>The <span class="underline">terrestrial</span> planets are mostly rocks: <span class="underline"><span class="underline">dense</span></span> <span class="underline">rocky</span> and <span class="underline">metallic</span> <span class="underline">material</span>, with <span class="underline">minor</span> amounts of gases. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>The Jovian planets, on the other hand, <span class="underline">contain</span> a large percentage of the gases <span class="underline">hydrogen</span> and <span class="underline">helium</span>, with varying amounts of ices: mostly water, <span class="underline">ammonia</span>, and <span class="underline">methane</span> ices. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p>
          <p>The Jovian planets have very thick atmospheres consisting of varying amounts of <span class="underline">hydrogen</span>, <span class="underline">helium</span>, <span class="underline">methane</span>, and <span class="underline">ammonia</span>. By <span class="underline">comparison</span>, the <span class="underline">terrestrial</span> planets have <span class="underline">meager</span> atmospheres at best. A <span class="underline">planet</span>'s <span class="underline">ability</span> to <span class="underline">retain</span> an <span class="underline">atmosphere</span> depends on its <span class="underline">temperature</span> and <span class="underline">mass</span>. <span class="underline">Simply</span> stated, a gas <span class="underline">molecule</span> can "evaporate" from a <span class="underline">planet</span> if it reaches a speed known as the <span class="underline">escape</span> <span class="underline">velocity</span>. For Earth, this <span class="underline">velocity</span> is 11 kilometers per <span class="underline">second</span>. Any <span class="underline">material</span>, including a rocket, must <span class="underline">reach</span> this speed before it can leave Earth and go into <span class="underline">space</span>. The Jovian planets, because of their greater masses and thus higher surface gravities, have higher <span class="underline">escape</span> velocities (21-60 kilometers per <span class="underline">second</span>) than the <span class="underline">terrestrial</span> planets. Consequently, it is more difficult for gases to "evaporate" from them. Also, because the molecular <span class="underline">motion</span> of a gas depends on <span class="underline">temperature</span>, at the low temperatures of the Jovian planets <span class="underline">even</span> the lightest gases are <span class="underline">unlikely</span> to <span class="underline">acquire</span> the speed needed to <span class="underline">escape</span>. On the other hand, a <span class="underline">comparatively</span> warm body with a small surface <span class="underline">gravity</span>, like Earth's moon, is unable to hold <span class="underline">even</span> the heaviest gas and thus lacks an <span class="underline">atmosphere</span>. The <span class="underline">slightly</span> larger <span class="underline">terrestrial</span> planets Earth, <span class="underline">Venus</span>, and Mars <span class="underline">retain</span> some heavy gases like <span class="underline">carbon</span> <span class="underline">dioxide</span>, but <span class="underline">even</span> their atmospheres make up only an infinitesimally small <span class="underline">portion</span> of their total <span class="underline">mass</span>.</p>
          <p>The orderly nature of our <span class="underline">solar</span> system leads most astronomers to <span class="underline">conclude</span> that the planets formed at <span class="underline">essentially</span> the same time and from the same <span class="underline">material</span> as the Sun. It is hypothesized that the <span class="underline">primordial</span> cloud of dust and gas from which all the planets are thought to have condensed had a <span class="underline">composition</span> <span class="underline">somewhat</span> <span class="underline">similar</span> to that of <span class="underline">Jupiter</span>. However, unlike <span class="underline">Jupiter</span>, the <span class="underline">terrestrial</span> planets today are nearly void of light gases and ices. The explanation may be that the <span class="underline">terrestrial</span> planets were once much larger and richer in these materials but <span class="underline">eventually</span> lost them because of these bodies' <span class="underline">relative</span> closeness to the Sun, which meant that their temperatures were <span class="underline">relatively</span> high.</p>
