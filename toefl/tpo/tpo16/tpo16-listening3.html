in a music <span class="highlight">history</span> class.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="15.64" data-time="5.36">[00:05.36]</span>Up until now in our discussions and readings about the Baroque early <span class="highlight">classic</span> periods, we've been talking about the <span class="highlight">development</span> of music styles and genres <span class="highlight">within</span> the <span class="highlight">relatively</span> narrow social contexts of its <span class="highlight">patronage</span> by the upper classes. <span class="time" data-times="18.05" data-time="21">[00:21.00]</span>Composers, after all, had to earn a living, and those who were employed in the services of a <span class="highlight">specific</span><span class="highlight">patron</span>, well, I don't have to spell it out for you, the likes and dislikes of that <span class="highlight">patron</span>, this would have an effect on what was being composed and performed.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="8.51" data-time="39.05">[00:39.05]</span>Now, of <span class="highlight">course</span>, there were many other influence on composers, uh, such as the <span class="highlight">technical</span> advances we've seen in the developments of some of the instruments. <span class="time" data-times="4" data-time="47.56">[00:47.56]</span>You remember the transverse flute, the clarinet and so on. <span class="time" data-times="18" data-time="51.56">[00:51.56]</span>But I think, if I were asked to <span class="highlight">identify</span> a single, <span class="highlight">crucial</span><span class="highlight">development</span> in European music of this time, it would be the invention of the piano, which, interestingly enough, also had a <span class="highlight">significant</span> effect on European society of that time and I'll get to that in a <span class="highlight">minute</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.97" data-time="69.56">[01:09.56]</span>Now, as we know, <span class="highlight">keyboard</span> instruments existed long before the piano. <span class="time" data-times="9.32" data-time="74.53">[01:14.53]</span>The organ, which dates back to the Middle Ages, as do other <span class="highlight">keyboard</span> instruments, such as the <span class="highlight">harpsichord</span> which is still <span class="highlight">popular</span> today with some musicians. <span class="time" data-times="4.76" data-time="83.85">[01:23.85]</span>But none of these has had a <span class="highlight">profound</span><span class="highlight">impact</span> as the piano.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.7" data-time="88.61">[01:28.61]</span>Uh, the piano was invented in Italy in 1709. <span class="time" data-times="8.52" data-time="93.31">[01:33.31]</span>The word "piano" is short for "pianoforte", a <span class="highlight">combination</span> of the Italian words for <span class="highlight">soft</span> and loud. <span class="time" data-times="7.31" data-time="101.83">[01:41.83]</span>Now, unlike the <span class="highlight">harpsichord</span>, which came before it, the piano is a <span class="highlight">percussion</span><span class="highlight">instrument</span>. <span class="time" data-times="19.13" data-time="109.14">[01:49.14]</span>You see, the <span class="highlight">harpsichord</span> is actually classified as a <span class="highlight">string</span><span class="highlight">instrument</span>, since pressing a key of a <span class="highlight">harpsichord</span> causes a tiny quill that's connected to the key to pluck the strings that are inside the <span class="highlight">instrument</span>, much the same as a guitar pick plucks the strings of a guitar.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="11.43" data-time="128.27">[02:08.27]</span>But pressing the key of a piano causes tiny felt-covered hammers to <span class="highlight">strike</span> the strings inside the <span class="highlight">instrument</span>, like drumsticks <span class="highlight">striking</span> the head of a drum. <span class="time" data-times="6.43" data-time="139.7">[02:19.70]</span>This <span class="highlight">striking</span><span class="highlight">action</span> is why the piano is a <span class="highlight">percussion</span><span class="highlight">instrument</span><span class="highlight">instead</span> of a <span class="highlight">string</span><span class="highlight">instrument</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.39" data-time="146.13">[02:26.13]</span>OK, so why is this so important? <span class="time" data-times="19.26" data-time="149.52">[02:29.52]</span>Well, the percussive effect of those little hammers means the pianist, unlike the harpsichordist, can control the dynamics of the <span class="highlight">sound</span>, how softly or loudly each note is struck, hence the name "pianoforte", <span class="highlight">soft</span> and loud.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.27" data-time="168.78">[02:48.78]</span>Now, artistically, for both composers and performers, this was a <span class="highlight">major</span> turning point. <span class="time" data-times="10.03" data-time="175.05">[02:55.05]</span>This <span class="highlight">brand</span> new <span class="highlight">instrument</span>, <span class="highlight">capable</span> of producing loud and <span class="highlight">soft</span> tones, greatly expanded the possibilities for conveying <span class="highlight">emotion</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9.35" data-time="185.08">[03:05.08]</span>This <span class="highlight">capacity</span> for increased expressiveness, in fact, was <span class="highlight">essential</span> to the <span class="highlight">romantic</span> styles that dominated 19th <span class="highlight">century</span> music. <span class="time" data-times="2.17" data-time="194.43">[03:14.43]</span>But I am getting ahead of myself.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="8.41" data-time="196.6">[03:16.60]</span>Um, before we get back to the <span class="highlight">musical</span><span class="highlight">impact</span> of this <span class="highlight">development</span>, I want to take a look at the social <span class="highlight">impact</span> that I mentioned earlier. <span class="time" data-times="9.93" data-time="205.01">[03:25.01]</span>Now, in the late 1700s and the early 1800s, the <span class="highlight">development</span> of the piano coincided with the growth of the middle class in Western Europe. <span class="time" data-times="18.5" data-time="214.94">[03:34.94]</span>Of <span class="highlight">course</span>, folk music, <span class="highlight">traditional</span> songs and dances had always been part of everyday life, but as <span class="highlight">mass</span> production techniques were <span class="highlight">refined</span> in the 19th <span class="highlight">century</span>, the price of pianos dropped to the point that a larger <span class="highlight">proportion</span> of the <span class="highlight">population</span> could <span class="highlight">afford</span> to own them.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="13.05" data-time="233.44">[03:53.44]</span>As pianos became more <span class="highlight">available</span>, they brought <span class="highlight">classical</span> music, the music which <span class="highlight">previously</span> had been composed only for the upper classes, into the lives of middle class people as well. <span class="time" data-times="8.53" data-time="246.49">[04:06.49]</span>One way in <span class="highlight">particular</span> that we can see the social <span class="highlight">impact</span> of this <span class="highlight">instrument</span> is its role in the lives of the women of the time. <span class="time" data-times="8.11" data-time="255.02">[04:15.02]</span><span class="highlight">Previously</span> it was, uh, quite <span class="highlight">rare</span> for a woman to <span class="highlight">perform</span> on anything but, maybe, a harp or maybe she sang.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="17.97" data-time="263.13">[04:23.13]</span>But, suddenly, in the 19th <span class="highlight">century</span>, it became quite <span class="highlight">acceptable</span>, <span class="highlight">even</span> to some <span class="highlight">extent</span>, almost expected for a middle-class European woman to be able to play the piano, <span class="highlight">partly</span> because among upper-middle-class women, it was a sign of <span class="highlight">refinement</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.52" data-time="281.1">[04:41.10]</span>But it was also an excellent way for some women to earn money by giving piano lessons.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="9.24" data-time="286.62">[04:46.62]</span>And some women, those few who had <span class="highlight">exceptional</span><span class="highlight">talent</span> and the <span class="highlight">opportunity</span> to develop it, their lives were <span class="highlight">dramatically</span> affected. <span class="time" data-times="9.81" data-time="295.86">[04:55.86]</span>Later we'll be listening to works by a <span class="highlight">composer</span> named Robert Schumann, but let's now talk about his wife Clara Schumann.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.43" data-time="305.67">[05:05.67]</span>Clara Schumann was born in Germany in 1819. <span class="time" data-times="2.65" data-time="310.1">[05:10.10]</span>Uh, she grew up surrounded by pianos. <span class="time" data-times="5.34" data-time="312.75">[05:12.75]</span>Her father sold pianos and both her parents were respected piano teachers. <span class="time" data-times="6.98" data-time="318.09">[05:18.09]</span>She learned to play the <span class="highlight">instrument</span> when she was a small child and gave her first public <span class="highlight">recital</span> at age 9. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="325.07">[05:25.07]</span>Clara grew up to become a well-known and respected piano virtuoso, a performer with <span class="highlight">extraordinary</span> skill, who not only gave concerts <span class="highlight">across</span> Europe but also was one of the first important <span class="highlight">female</span> composers for the <span class="highlight">instrument</span>.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the lecture mainly about?</p></div><div

Composers, after all, had to earn a living and those who were employed in the services of a specific patron, Well, I don't have to spell it out for you, the likes and dislikes of that patron, this would've had an effect on what was being composed and performed.</p><p>From the lecture, we learned that the upper class has a preference for a certain musical instrument.
