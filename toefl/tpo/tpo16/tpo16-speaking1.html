        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>If I could have any job I wanted, I would choose to be a writer. There are a couple of reasons why I want to be writer. Firstly, being a writer doesn't need to go to office or a place full of many other people.Writers usually stay at a quiet place and write articles or books. I enjoy being alone, thinking alone and writing things alone. Every time I am alone, I write stories. Secondly, I love the art of telling stories. Writing stories not only pleases myself but may entertain other people, the readers, as well. I especially like the scene in which people laugh and think when they are reading my stories.</p>
