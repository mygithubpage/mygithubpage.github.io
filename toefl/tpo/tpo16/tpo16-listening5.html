<span class="time" data-times="9.24" data-time="24.82">[00:24.82]</span>I mean, no one really thinks that, say, a bee goes <span class="highlight">through</span> weighing the pros and cons of pollinating this flower or that flower. <span class="time" data-times="7.42" data-time="34.06">[00:34.06]</span>But then, how do animals solve <span class="highlight">complex</span> questions, questions that <span class="highlight">seem</span> to <span class="highlight">require</span> decision making?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.2" data-time="41.48">[00:41.48]</span>The answer we <span class="highlight">propose</span>, of <span class="highlight">course</span>, is that their <span class="highlight">behavior</span> is largely a matter of natural <span class="highlight">selection</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.02" data-time="48.68">[00:48.68]</span>As an example, let's look at foraging <span class="highlight">behavior</span> among beavers. <span class="time" data-times="10.56" data-time="53.7">[00:53.70]</span>Beavers eat plants, mostly trees, and they also use trees and tree branches to <span class="highlight">construct</span> their homes in streams and lakes. <span class="time" data-times="9.3" data-time="64.26">[01:04.26]</span>So when they do <span class="highlight">forage</span> for food and for <span class="highlight">shelter</span> materials, they have to leave their homes and go up on land, where their main predators are. <span class="time" data-times="5.04" data-time="73.56">[01:13.56]</span>So there are a number of choices that have to be made of foraging.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.74" data-time="78.6">[01:18.60]</span>So, for example, uh, they need to decide what kind of tree they should cut down. <span class="time" data-times="11.04" data-time="86.34">[01:26.34]</span>Some trees have higher nutritional values than others, and some are better for building <span class="highlight">material</span>, and some are good for both, um, <span class="highlight">aspen</span> trees. <span class="time" data-times="6.59" data-time="97.38">[01:37.38]</span>Beavers peel of the <span class="highlight">bark</span> to eat and they also use the branches for building their shelters. <span class="time" data-times="2.51" data-time="103.97">[01:43.97]</span>So aspens do double duty. <span class="time" data-times="4.91" data-time="106.48">[01:46.48]</span>But ash trees, beavers use ash trees only for <span class="highlight">construction</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="10.03" data-time="111.39">[01:51.39]</span>Another decision is when to <span class="highlight">forage</span> for food, should they go out during the day time when it's hotter outside and they have to expend more energy? <span class="time" data-times="4.86" data-time="121.42">[02:01.42]</span>Or at night when the weather is cooler but predators are more active?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.84" data-time="126.28">[02:06.28]</span>OK, but there are two more important issues, really the most central, the most, uh, important, OK? <span class="time" data-times="10.49" data-time="134.12">[02:14.12]</span>First, let's say a <span class="highlight">beaver</span> could get the same <span class="highlight">amount</span> of wood from a single large tree when it has lots of branches as it could get from three small trees. <span class="time" data-times="1.6" data-time="144.61">[02:24.61]</span>Which should it choose? <span class="time" data-times="11.96" data-time="146.21">[02:26.21]</span>If it chooses one large tree, it'll have to carry that large piece of wood back home, and lugging a big piece of wood forty or fifty yards is hard work, takes a lot of energy. <span class="time" data-times="4.83" data-time="158.17">[02:38.17]</span>Of <span class="highlight">course</span>, it'll have to only make one <span class="highlight">trip</span> to get the wood back to the water.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="13.33" data-time="163">[02:43.00]</span>On the other hand, if it goes for three small trees <span class="highlight">instead</span>, it'll take less energy per tree to get the wood back home, but it'll have to make three trips back and forth for these three trees. <span class="time" data-times="6.74" data-time="176.33">[02:56.33]</span>And <span class="highlight">presumably</span>, the more often it wanders for home, the more it's likely to be <span class="highlight">exposed</span> to predators. <span class="time" data-times="5.45" data-time="183.07">[03:03.07]</span>So which is better: a single large tree or three small trees?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="9.52" data-time="188.52">[03:08.52]</span>Another <span class="highlight">critical</span><span class="highlight">issue</span>, and it's related to the first, to the size <span class="highlight">issue</span>, is how far from the water should it go to get trees? <span class="time" data-times="6.39" data-time="198.04">[03:18.04]</span>Should it be willing to travel a greater distance for a large tree since it'll get so much wood from it? <span class="time" data-times="5.07" data-time="204.43">[03:24.43]</span>Beavers certainly go farther from the water to an <span class="highlight">Aspen</span> tree than for an Ash tree. <span class="time" data-times="4.49" data-time="209.5">[03:29.50]</span>That reflects their <span class="highlight">relative</span> values, but what about size? <span class="time" data-times="4.19" data-time="213.99">[03:33.99]</span>Will it travel farther for a larger tree than it will for a smaller tree?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.96" data-time="218.18">[03:38.18]</span>Now, I would've thought the bigger the tree, the farther the <span class="highlight">beaver</span> would be willing to travel for it. <span class="time" data-times="1.94" data-time="225.14">[03:45.14]</span>That'll make <span class="highlight">sense</span>, right? <span class="time" data-times="5.07" data-time="227.08">[03:47.08]</span>If you're going to travel far, make the <span class="highlight">trip</span><span class="highlight">worth</span> it by bringing back the most wood possible. <span class="time" data-times="3.29" data-time="232.15">[03:52.15]</span>But actually, the <span class="highlight">opposite</span> is true! <span class="time" data-times="4.97" data-time="235.44">[03:55.44]</span>Beavers will cut down only large trees that are close to the water. <span class="time" data-times="7.47" data-time="240.41">[04:00.41]</span>They'll travel far only to cut down certain small trees that they can cut down quickly and <span class="highlight">drag</span> back home quickly.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.71" data-time="247.88">[04:07.88]</span>Generally, the farther they go from the water, the smaller the tree they'll cut down. <span class="time" data-times="8.08" data-time="253.59">[04:13.59]</span>They're willing to make more trips to <span class="highlight">haul</span> back less wood, which carries a greater risk of being <span class="highlight">exposed</span> to predators. <span class="time" data-times="14.63" data-time="261.67">[04:21.67]</span>So, it looks as though beavers are less interested in minimizing their <span class="highlight">exposure</span> to predators, and more interested in <span class="highlight">saving</span> energy when foraging for wood, which may also explain why beavers <span class="highlight">forage</span><span class="highlight">primarily</span> during the evenings.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="9.99" data-time="276.3">[04:36.30]</span>OK, so why does their <span class="highlight">behavior</span><span class="highlight">indicate</span> more of a <span class="highlight">concern</span> with how much energy they <span class="highlight">expand</span> than with being <span class="highlight">exposed</span> to predators? <span class="time" data-times="5.6" data-time="286.29">[04:46.29]</span>No one believes a <span class="highlight">beaver</span> conscientiously weighs the pros and cons of each of these elements. <span class="time" data-times="9.22" data-time="291.89">[04:51.89]</span>The answer that some give is that their <span class="highlight">behavior</span> has evolved over time, it's been shaped by <span class="highlight">constraint</span> over <span class="highlight">vast</span> stretches of time. <span class="time" data-times="7.45" data-time="301.11">[05:01.11]</span>All of which comes down to the fact that the best foraging <span class="highlight">strategy</span> for beavers isn't the one that yields the most food or wood. <span class="time" data-times="5.25" data-time="308.56">[05:08.56]</span>It's the one that results in the most descendants, the most <span class="highlight">offspring</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="313.81">[05:13.81]</span>So, let's discuss how this idea works.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the lecture mainly about?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Different foraging strategies among animals.</p><p>B. Methods beavers use to gather building materials.</p><p>C. Decisions beavers make about where to live.</p><p>D. Choices beavers face when foraging.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>OK. Let's continue our discussion about animal behavior by talking about decisions that animals face, complex ones.</p><p>From the lecture, we mainly introduce the choices that Beaver has to make in different situations. A has nothing to do with the article, BC is too one-sided.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What difference between aspen trees and ash trees does the professor point out?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Aspen trees are easier to transport.</p><p>B. Aspen trees provide better wood for construction.</p><p>C. Aspen trees provide less nutrition for beavers.</p><p>D. Aspen trees have more overall value to beavers.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>So aspens do double duty. But ash trees, beavers use ash trees only for construction. Is there a tree with two uses, and a tree with only one? From the speech, aspens has a double duty.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor identify as the two central issues involved in beavers foraging behavior?Click on 2 answers.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. How far from home to forage.</p><p>B. How to cope with competition.</p><p>C. What size tree to cut down.</p><p>D. What time of year material for construction is available.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="AC"><p>So that is better, a single large tree or three small trees? Another critical issue and it's related to the first, to the size issue, is how far from the water should it go to get trees.</p><p>It was learned from the lecture that the two beavers to consider were the large tree or small tree, which echoed the C option; the second thing to consider was the How far and A options.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor say about the cutting down of large trees?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Beavers generally prefer cutting down large trees to small trees.</p><p>B. Beavers generally do not travel long distances to cut down large trees.</p><p>C. Beavers will not cut down large trees of certain species.</p><p>D. Beavers use large trees mainly for the purpose of building shelters.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>But actually, the opposite is true. Beavers will cut down only large trees that are close to the water. They will travel far only to cut down certain small trees that they can cut down quickly and drag back home quickly.</p><p>It was learned from the lecture that the hypothetical cutting down large trees appeared many times in the chapter, but the final conclusion was only one, but the opposite was true in the actual situation.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor, why do beavers generally forage at night?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Beavers are safer from predators if they forage at night.</p><p>B. Foraging at night requires less energy than foraging in the daytime.</p><p>C. Beavers stay with their offspring during the daytime.</p><p>D. Beavers face less competition for food from other animals during the night.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>So it looks as though beavers are less interested in minimizing their exposure to predators and more interested in saving energy when foraging for wood, which may also explain why beavers forage temperament during the evenings.</p><p>Another reason for the article's explanation of an important phenomenon, led by So, pointed out that Beaver prefers hunting at night because it saves energy.</p></div></div><div class="replay" id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor say this?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To explain her reasoning.</p><p>B. To indicate why her belief was wrong.</p><p>C. To give an example of a decision beavers make.</p><p>D. To explain the reason beavers travel far for wood.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>Will it travel farther for a larger tree than It will for a smaller tree? Now I would have thought the bigger the tree, the farther the beaver would be willing to travel for it. That would make sense, right? The content is obviously the logic that states the author thinks.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
