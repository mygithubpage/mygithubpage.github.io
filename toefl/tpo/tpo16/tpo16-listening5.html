            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.56" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in a <span class="underline">biology</span> class.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.9" data-time="6.56">[00:06.56]</span>Professor: OK, let's continue our discussion about animal <span class="underline">behavior</span> by talking about decisions that animals face, <span class="underline">complex</span> ones. <span class="time" data-times="7.45" data-time="15.46">[00:15.46]</span>Animals, <span class="underline">even</span> insects, carry out what look like very <span class="underline">complex</span> decision-making processes. <span class="time" data-times="1.91" data-time="22.91">[00:22.91]</span>The question is: how? <span class="time" data-times="9.24" data-time="24.82">[00:24.82]</span>I mean, no one really thinks that, say, a bee goes <span class="underline">through</span> weighing the pros and cons of pollinating this flower or that flower. <span class="time" data-times="7.42" data-time="34.06">[00:34.06]</span>But then, how do animals solve <span class="underline">complex</span> questions, questions that <span class="underline">seem</span> to <span class="underline">require</span> decision making?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.2" data-time="41.48">[00:41.48]</span>The answer we <span class="underline">propose</span>, of <span class="underline">course</span>, is that their <span class="underline">behavior</span> is largely a matter of natural <span class="underline">selection</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.02" data-time="48.68">[00:48.68]</span>As an example, let's look at foraging <span class="underline">behavior</span> among beavers. <span class="time" data-times="10.56" data-time="53.7">[00:53.70]</span>Beavers eat plants, mostly trees, and they also use trees and tree branches to <span class="underline">construct</span> their homes in streams and lakes. <span class="time" data-times="9.3" data-time="64.26">[01:04.26]</span>So when they do <span class="underline">forage</span> for food and for <span class="underline">shelter</span> materials, they have to leave their homes and go up on land, where their main predators are. <span class="time" data-times="5.04" data-time="73.56">[01:13.56]</span>So there are a number of choices that have to be made of foraging.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.74" data-time="78.6">[01:18.60]</span>So, for example, uh, they need to decide what kind of tree they should cut down. <span class="time" data-times="11.04" data-time="86.34">[01:26.34]</span>Some trees have higher nutritional values than others, and some are better for building <span class="underline">material</span>, and some are good for both, um, <span class="underline">aspen</span> trees. <span class="time" data-times="6.59" data-time="97.38">[01:37.38]</span>Beavers peel of the <span class="underline">bark</span> to eat and they also use the branches for building their shelters. <span class="time" data-times="2.51" data-time="103.97">[01:43.97]</span>So aspens do double duty. <span class="time" data-times="4.91" data-time="106.48">[01:46.48]</span>But ash trees, beavers use ash trees only for <span class="underline">construction</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.03" data-time="111.39">[01:51.39]</span>Another decision is when to <span class="underline">forage</span> for food, should they go out during the day time when it's hotter outside and they have to expend more energy? <span class="time" data-times="4.86" data-time="121.42">[02:01.42]</span>Or at night when the weather is cooler but predators are more active?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.84" data-time="126.28">[02:06.28]</span>OK, but there are two more important issues, really the most central, the most, uh, important, OK? <span class="time" data-times="10.49" data-time="134.12">[02:14.12]</span>First, let's say a <span class="underline">beaver</span> could get the same <span class="underline">amount</span> of wood from a single large tree when it has lots of branches as it could get from three small trees. <span class="time" data-times="1.6" data-time="144.61">[02:24.61]</span>Which should it choose? <span class="time" data-times="11.96" data-time="146.21">[02:26.21]</span>If it chooses one large tree, it'll have to carry that large piece of wood back home, and lugging a big piece of wood forty or fifty yards is hard work, takes a lot of energy. <span class="time" data-times="4.83" data-time="158.17">[02:38.17]</span>Of <span class="underline">course</span>, it'll have to only make one <span class="underline">trip</span> to get the wood back to the water.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="13.33" data-time="163">[02:43.00]</span>On the other hand, if it goes for three small trees <span class="underline">instead</span>, it'll take less energy per tree to get the wood back home, but it'll have to make three trips back and forth for these three trees. <span class="time" data-times="6.74" data-time="176.33">[02:56.33]</span>And <span class="underline">presumably</span>, the more often it wanders for home, the more it's likely to be <span class="underline">exposed</span> to predators. <span class="time" data-times="5.45" data-time="183.07">[03:03.07]</span>So which is better: a single large tree or three small trees?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.52" data-time="188.52">[03:08.52]</span>Another <span class="underline">critical</span> <span class="underline">issue</span>, and it's related to the first, to the size <span class="underline">issue</span>, is how far from the water should it go to get trees? <span class="time" data-times="6.39" data-time="198.04">[03:18.04]</span>Should it be willing to travel a greater distance for a large tree since it'll get so much wood from it? <span class="time" data-times="5.07" data-time="204.43">[03:24.43]</span>Beavers certainly go farther from the water to an <span class="underline">Aspen</span> tree than for an Ash tree. <span class="time" data-times="4.49" data-time="209.5">[03:29.50]</span>That reflects their <span class="underline">relative</span> values, but what about size? <span class="time" data-times="4.19" data-time="213.99">[03:33.99]</span>Will it travel farther for a larger tree than it will for a smaller tree?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.96" data-time="218.18">[03:38.18]</span>Now, I would've thought the bigger the tree, the farther the <span class="underline">beaver</span> would be willing to travel for it. <span class="time" data-times="1.94" data-time="225.14">[03:45.14]</span>That'll make <span class="underline">sense</span>, right? <span class="time" data-times="5.07" data-time="227.08">[03:47.08]</span>If you're going to travel far, make the <span class="underline">trip</span> <span class="underline">worth</span> it by bringing back the most wood possible. <span class="time" data-times="3.29" data-time="232.15">[03:52.15]</span>But actually, the <span class="underline">opposite</span> is true! <span class="time" data-times="4.97" data-time="235.44">[03:55.44]</span>Beavers will cut down only large trees that are close to the water. <span class="time" data-times="7.47" data-time="240.41">[04:00.41]</span>They'll travel far only to cut down certain small trees that they can cut down quickly and <span class="underline">drag</span> back home quickly.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.71" data-time="247.88">[04:07.88]</span>Generally, the farther they go from the water, the smaller the tree they'll cut down. <span class="time" data-times="8.08" data-time="253.59">[04:13.59]</span>They're willing to make more trips to <span class="underline">haul</span> back less wood, which carries a greater risk of being <span class="underline">exposed</span> to predators. <span class="time" data-times="14.63" data-time="261.67">[04:21.67]</span>So, it looks as though beavers are less interested in minimizing their <span class="underline">exposure</span> to predators, and more interested in <span class="underline">saving</span> energy when foraging for wood, which may also explain why beavers <span class="underline">forage</span> <span class="underline">primarily</span> during the evenings.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.99" data-time="276.3">[04:36.30]</span>OK, so why does their <span class="underline">behavior</span> <span class="underline">indicate</span> more of a <span class="underline">concern</span> with how much energy they <span class="underline">expand</span> than with being <span class="underline">exposed</span> to predators? <span class="time" data-times="5.6" data-time="286.29">[04:46.29]</span>No one believes a <span class="underline">beaver</span> conscientiously weighs the pros and cons of each of these elements. <span class="time" data-times="9.22" data-time="291.89">[04:51.89]</span>The answer that some give is that their <span class="underline">behavior</span> has evolved over time, it's been shaped by <span class="underline">constraint</span> over <span class="underline">vast</span> stretches of time. <span class="time" data-times="7.45" data-time="301.11">[05:01.11]</span>All of which comes down to the fact that the best foraging <span class="underline">strategy</span> for beavers isn't the one that yields the most food or wood. <span class="time" data-times="5.25" data-time="308.56">[05:08.56]</span>It's the one that results in the most descendants, the most <span class="underline">offspring</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="313.81">[05:13.81]</span>So, let's discuss how this idea works.</p>
