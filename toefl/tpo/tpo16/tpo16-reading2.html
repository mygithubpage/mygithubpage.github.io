(the number of protons in the <span class="highlight">nucleus</span>). It is a <span class="highlight">monumental</span><span class="highlight">scientific</span> achievement, and its <span class="highlight">development</span> illustrates the <span class="highlight">essential</span><span class="highlight question1">interplay</span> between <span class="highlight">observation</span>, 
prediction, and testing required for <span class="highlight">scientific</span> progress. In the 1800's scientists were searching for new elements. By the late 1860's more than 60 chemical elements had been identified,
and much was known about their <span class="highlight">descriptive</span> chemistry. Various proposals were put forth to <span class="highlight">arrange</span> the elements into groups based on similarities in chemical and <span class="highlight">physical</span> properties. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>The next step was to <span class="highlight">recognize</span> a connection between group properties (<span class="highlight">physical</span> or chemical similarities) and <span class="highlight">atomic</span><span class="highlight">mass</span> (the measured <span class="highlight">mass</span> of an <span class="highlight">individual</span><span class="highlight">atom</span> of an <span class="highlight">element</span>).
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>When the elements known at the time were ordered by increasing <span class="highlight">atomic</span><span class="highlight">mass</span>, it was found that <span class="highlight">successive</span> elements belonged to different chemical groups and that the order of the groups 
in this <span class="highlight">sequence</span> was fixed and repeated itself at <span class="highlight">regular</span> intervals. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>Thus when the <span class="highlight">series</span> of elements was written so as to begin a new <span class="highlight">horizontal</span> row with each <span class="highlight">alkali</span> metal, 
elements of the same groups were automatically assembled in <span class="highlight">vertical</span> columns in a <span class="highlight">periodic</span> table of the elements. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>This table was the <span class="highlight">forerunner</span> of the modern table.</p><p>When the German chemist Lothar Meyer and (independently) the Russian Dmitry Mendeleyev first introduced the <span class="highlight">periodic</span> table in 1869-70, one-third of the naturally occurring chemical elements had not yet been discovered. Yet both chemists were <span class="highlight">sufficiently</span> farsighted to leave gaps where their analyses of <span class="highlight">periodic</span><span class="highlight">physical</span> and chemical properties indicated that new elements should be located. <span class="question4">Mendeleyev was bolder than Meyer</span> and <span class="highlight">even</span> assumed that if a measured <span class="highlight">atomic</span><span class="highlight">mass</span> put an <span class="highlight">element</span> in the wrong place in the table, the <span class="highlight">atomic</span><span class="highlight">mass</span> was wrong. In some cases this was true. Indium, for example, had <span class="highlight">previously</span> been assigned an <span class="highlight">atomic</span><span class="highlight">mass</span> between those of <span class="highlight">arsenic</span> and selenium. Because there is no <span class="highlight">space</span> in the <span class="highlight">periodic</span> table between these two elements, Mendeleyev suggested that the <span class="highlight">atomic</span><span class="highlight">mass</span> of indium be changed to a completely different value, where it would fill an empty <span class="highlight">space</span> between cadmium and tin. In fact, <span class="highlight">subsequent</span> work has shown that in a <span class="highlight">periodic</span> table, elements should not be ordered strictly by <span class="highlight">atomic</span><span class="highlight">mass</span>. For example, tellurium comes before iodine in the <span class="highlight">periodic</span> table, <span class="highlight">even</span> though its <span class="highlight">atomic</span><span class="highlight">mass</span> is <span class="highlight">slightly</span> greater. Such anomalies are <span class="highlight">due</span> to the <span class="highlight">relative</span><span class="highlight"><span class="question7">abundance</span></span> of the "isotopes" or varieties of each <span class="highlight">element</span>. All the isotopes of a <span class="highlight">given</span><span class="highlight">element</span> have the same number of protons, but differ in their number of neutrons, and hence in their <span class="highlight">atomic</span><span class="highlight">mass</span>. The isotopes of a <span class="highlight">given</span><span class="highlight">element</span> have the same chemical properties but <span class="highlight">slightly</span> different <span class="highlight">physical</span> properties. We now know that <span class="highlight">atomic</span> number (the number of protons in the <span class="highlight">nucleus</span>), not <span class="highlight">atomic</span><span class="highlight">mass</span> number (the number of protons and neutrons), determines chemical <span class="highlight">behavior</span>.</p><p>Mendeleyev went further than Meyer in another respect: he predicted the properties of six elements yet to be discovered. For example, a <span class="highlight">gap</span> just below <span class="highlight">aluminum</span> suggested a new <span class="highlight">element</span> would be found with properties <span class="question8"><span class="highlight">analogous</span> to</span> those of <span class="highlight">aluminum</span>. Mendeleyev designated this <span class="highlight">element</span> "eka-aluminum" (eka is the Sanskrit word for  "next") and predicted its properties. Just five years later an <span class="highlight">element</span> with the <span class="highlight">proper</span><span class="highlight">atomic</span><span class="highlight">mass</span> was <span class="highlight">isolated</span> and named gallium by its discoverer. The close <span class="highlight">correspondence</span> between the observed properties of gallium and Mendeleye Vs predictions for eka-aluminum lent strong support to the <span class="highlight">periodic</span> law. <span class="highlight">Additional</span> support came in 1885 when eka-silicon, which had also been described in <span class="highlight">advance</span> by Mendeleyev, was discovered and named germanium.</p><p>The structure of the <span class="highlight">periodic</span> table appeared to limit the number of possible elements. It was <span class="highlight">therefore</span> quite surprising when John William Strut( Lord Rayleigh, discovered a <span class="highlight">gaseous</span><span class="highlight">element</span> in 1894 that did not fit into the <span class="highlight">previous</span><span class="highlight">classification</span><span class="highlight">scheme</span>. A <span class="highlight">century</span> earlier, Henry Cavendish had <span class="highlight">noted</span> the <span class="highlight">existence</span> of a residual gas when <span class="highlight">oxygen</span> and <span class="highlight">nitrogen</span> are removed from <span class="highlight">air</span>, but its importance had not been realized. Together with William Ramsay, Rayleigh <span class="highlight">isolated</span> the gas (separating it from other substances into its <span class="highlight">pure</span><span class="highlight">state</span>) and named it <span class="highlight">argon</span>. <span class="question11">Ramsay then studied a gas that was present in natural gas deposits and discovered that it was <span class="highlight">helium</span>, an <span class="highlight">element</span> whose presence in the Sun had been <span class="highlight">noted</span> earlier in the <span class="highlight">spectrum</span> of sunlight but that had not <span class="highlight">previously</span> been known on Earth.</span> Rayleigh and Ramsay <span class="question12">postulated</span> the <span class="highlight">existence</span> of a new group of elements, and in 1898 other members of the <span class="highlight">series</span> (<span class="highlight">neon</span>, krypton, and xenon) were <span class="highlight">isolated</span>.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The phrase |interplay|in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. sequence</p><p>B. interpretation</p><p>C. requirement</p><p>D. interaction</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D interplay: interaction. A is the order; B is the translation, interpretation; C is the requirement; D is the interaction. So D's interaction is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 1, what pattern did scientists notice when the known elements were written in order of increasing atomic mass?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The elements of the group of alkali metals were the first elements in the order of increasing atomic mass.</p><p>B. Repetition of the same atomic masses for elements in different groups appeared.</p><p>C. Elements with similar chemical properties appeared in the listing at regular intervals.</p><p>D. Elements were chemically most similar to those just before and after them in the order.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C. Using keywords of increasing atomic mass to locate the third sentence of the penultimate sentence, saying that the elements are arranged in the order of increasing atomic weight. It is found that adjacent elements belong to different families, the order of the family is fixed, and every fixed number of elements will weigh. Now. So the correct answer is C. Alkali metals of A, B did not say the same atomic mass; D said that the adjacent elements are of the same nature as the original.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>In paragraph 2, what is the author's purpose in presenting the information about the decision by Meyer and Mendeleyev to leave gaps in the periodic table?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To illustrate their confidence that the organizing principles of the periodic table would govern the occurrence of all chemical elements</p><p>B. To indicate that some of their analyses of periodic physical and chemical properties were later found to be wrong</p><p>C. To support the idea that they were unwilling to place new elements in the periodic table</p><p>D. To indicate how they handled their disagreement about where to place new elements</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A. In rhetorical questions, first find two names. Say that both are very far-sighted. Leave gaps in the periodic table for elements that were not found. That is, A said that they are confident enough that the elemental law applies to all elements; Both B's wrong and C's unwilling are contrary to the original; D's disagreement is not stated.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What reason does the author provide for the claim that |<span class="question4">Mendeleyev was bolder than Meyer</span>|</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Mendeleyev corrected incorrect information Meyer had proposed.</p><p>B. Mendeleyev assumed that some information believed to be true about the elements was incorrect.</p><p>C. Mendeleyev argued that Meyer had not left enough gaps in the periodic table.</p><p>D. Mendeleyev realized that elements were not ordered by atomic mass in the periodic table.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="Mendeleyev was bolder than Meyer B"><p>B first find two names, said Mendeleev is more bold and big than Mayer, he speculated that if the amount of atoms used to sort in the periodic table and the elemental periodicity conflict with each other, it means that the atomic weight is wrong, that is, Option B said Mendeleev believed that something that was previously recognized by everyone was wrong. The opinions of the two people are the same, but Mendeleev went further, so A and C said that the opinions of the two are not the same; D said that it is not an error sorted by atomic weight.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 2, why did Mendeleyev suggest changing the atomic mass of indium?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Because indium did not fit into the periodic table in the place predicted by its atomic mass.</p><p>B. Because there was experimental evidence that the atomic mass that had been assigned to indium was incorrect.</p><p>C. Because there was an empty space between cadmium and tin in the periodic table.</p><p>D. Because the chemical properties of indium were similar to those of arsenic and selenium.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A. Positioning to the sixth sentence with the keywords of changing the atomic mass of indium, said that due to the absence of vacancies between arsenic and selenium in the periodic table, the atomic weight of indium is wrong. Because in front of that if the atomic weight puts the element in the wrong position, it means that the atomic weight is wrong. The latter sentence is to prove this point, so the answer is A. B's experimental evidence and D's chemical properties are similar to the original; C has the opposite of space and the original.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>It can be inferred from paragraph 2 that tellurium comes before iodine in the periodic table even though tellurium's atomic mass is slightly greater because</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. iodine is less common than tellurium</p><p>B. both iodine and tellurium have no isotopes</p><p>C. the chemical behavior of tellurium is highly variable</p><p>D. the atomic number of tellurium is smaller than that of iodine</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D. Use the Tellerium coms before iodine keyword to locate the penultimate sentence for example, but this sentence is just an example. In the past, the elements should not be listed strictly according to the atomic weight, and the last sentence also states that the chemical properties of the elements are to be determined. Is the atomic number, not the atomic weight, that is, should be arranged according to the original number, so the answer D is correct. A common person who is not common, B is there is no isotope, and C is chemically changeable. No information can be introduced.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The phrase "<span class="highlight"><span class="question7">abundance</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. weight</p><p>B. requirement</p><p>C. plenty</p><p>D. sequence</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" C"><p>C <span class="question7">abundance</span>: Ample, rich. A is the weight; B is the requirement; C is the mass, the mass; C is the order. The answer is C's plenty.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The phrase "<span class="highlight">analogous to</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. predicted by</p><p>B. expected of</p><p>C. similar to</p><p>D. superior to</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="analogous to C"><p>C analogous to: analogy, similar. A is predicted by... B is expecting from... C is similar to... D is superior to... So the answer C is similar to correct.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Paragraph 3 suggests that Mendeleyev predicted the properties of eka-aluminum on the basis of</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. the atomic mass of aluminum</p><p>B. the position of the gap in the periodic table that eka-aluminum was predicted to fill</p><p>C. the similarity of eka-aluminum to the other five missing elements</p><p>D. observation of the properties of gallium</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B. Using eka-aluminum as the key word to locate the third sentence, but this sentence only said that the nature of eka was predicted. It did not say what to predict. Look at it and say that eka is the element in the space under aluminum. , and is similar in nature to aluminum, so the answer is B, the space that eka fills. A atomic weight of aluminum C Another five elements not found D Gallium of the original did not say.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>It can be inferred from paragraph 3 that the significance of the discovery of gallium was that it supported which of the following?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The idea that aluminum was correctly placed in the periodic table.</p><p>B. Mendeleyev's prediction that eka-silicon would be discovered next.</p><p>C. The organizing principle of the periodic table.</p><p>D. The idea that unknown elements existed.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C Gallium did the keyword positioning to the penultimate sentence, but this sentence just said to be named GA, did not say what to support, look down to say that GA's discovery supports the elemental cycle law, and the problem happens to be to ask GA's discovery support What is the answer, so the answer is C, the regularity of the periodic table of elements, that is, the periodicity of the elements.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Ramsay found evidence of helium in the spectrum of sunlight before he discovered that the element was also contained in natural gas deposits on Earth.</p><p>B. Ramsay thought he had discovered a new element present in natural gas deposits, but he was wrong since that element had been previously observed elsewhere on Earth.</p><p>C.

Ramsay later discovered that helium, an element that was already known to be present in the Sun, was also present in natural gas deposits on Earth.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D: The structure of the original text is that R studied a gas, and found that this gas is helium, so the answer is D. A completely confuses the structure of the original text, which is not found in the solar spectrum by R; B's transition is wrong; C and A's are similar in error, and helium is not found in the solar spectrum by R.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question12">postulated</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. hypothesized</p><p>B. discovered</p><p>C. reported</p><p>D. generated</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" A"><p>A, postulate: Infer, assume.

So B is excluded and the answer is C.</p></div></div><div id="question14" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>The periodic table introduced by Meyer and Mendeleyev was the forerunner of the modern table of elements.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.Lord Rayleigh provided evidence that the structure of the periodic table limited the potential number of elements.</p><p>B.Mendeleyev and Meyer organized the known elements into a chart that revealed periodic recurrences of chemical and physical properties.</p><p>C.Mendeleyev's successful prediction of the properties of then unknown elements lent support to the acceptance of the periodic law.</p><p>D.Ramsay and Lord Rayleigh challenged the importance of the chemical research that Henry Cavendish had done a century earlier.</p><p>E.Isotopes of a given element have exactly the same physical properties, but their chemical properties are slightly different.</p><p>F.In the 1890's, Ramsay and Lord Rayleigh isolated argon and proposed the existence of a new series of elements.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="BCF"><p>The BCF Lord option was wrong. The original did not say that his study provided evidence of the limit of the number of elements in the periodic table. The Ramsay and Lord options are wrong. The original did not say that they both challenged Cavendish and did not choose. The Isotopes option is a detail in the second paragraph of the original text and is not selected. The Mendeleyev and Meyer options correspond to the second half of the original paragraph, correct. The Mendeleyevs option corresponds to the last two sentences of the third paragraph of the original text, correct. The In the 1890's option corresponds to the last sentence of the full text, correct.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
