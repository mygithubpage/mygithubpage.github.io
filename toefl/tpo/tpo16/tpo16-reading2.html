          <h4 class="w3-center">Development of the Periodic Table</h4>
          <p>The <span class="highlight">periodic</span> table is a <span class="highlight">chart</span> that reflects the <span class="highlight">periodic</span> recurrence of chemical and <span class="highlight">physical</span> properties of the elements when the elements are arranged in order of increasing <span class="highlight">atomic</span> number
(the number of protons in the <span class="highlight">nucleus</span>). It is a <span class="highlight">monumental</span> <span class="highlight">scientific</span> achievement, and its <span class="highlight">development</span> illustrates the <span class="highlight">essential</span><span class="highlight question1">interplay</span> between <span class="highlight">observation</span>, 
prediction, and testing required for <span class="highlight">scientific</span> progress. In the 1800's scientists were searching for new elements. By the late 1860's more than 60 chemical elements had been identified,
and much was known about their <span class="highlight">descriptive</span> chemistry. Various proposals were put forth to <span class="highlight">arrange</span> the elements into groups based on similarities in chemical and <span class="highlight">physical</span> properties. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>The next step was to <span class="highlight">recognize</span> a connection between group properties (<span class="highlight">physical</span> or chemical similarities) and <span class="highlight">atomic</span> <span class="highlight">mass</span> (the measured <span class="highlight">mass</span> of an <span class="highlight">individual</span> <span class="highlight">atom</span> of an <span class="highlight">element</span>).
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>When the elements known at the time were ordered by increasing <span class="highlight">atomic</span> <span class="highlight">mass</span>, it was found that <span class="highlight">successive</span> elements belonged to different chemical groups and that the order of the groups 
in this <span class="highlight">sequence</span> was fixed and repeated itself at <span class="highlight">regular</span> intervals. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>Thus when the <span class="highlight">series</span> of elements was written so as to begin a new <span class="highlight">horizontal</span> row with each <span class="highlight">alkali</span> metal, 
elements of the same groups were automatically assembled in <span class="highlight">vertical</span> columns in a <span class="highlight">periodic</span> table of the elements. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>This table was the <span class="highlight">forerunner</span> of the modern table.</p>
          <p>When the German chemist Lothar Meyer and (independently) the Russian Dmitry Mendeleyev first introduced the <span class="highlight">periodic</span> table in 1869-70, one-third of the naturally occurring chemical elements had not yet been discovered. Yet both chemists were <span class="highlight">sufficiently</span> farsighted to leave gaps where their analyses of <span class="highlight">periodic</span> <span class="highlight">physical</span> and chemical properties indicated that new elements should be located. <span class="question4">Mendeleyev was bolder than Meyer</span> and <span class="highlight">even</span> assumed that if a measured <span class="highlight">atomic</span> <span class="highlight">mass</span> put an <span class="highlight">element</span> in the wrong place in the table, the <span class="highlight">atomic</span> <span class="highlight">mass</span> was wrong. In some cases this was true. Indium, for example, had <span class="highlight">previously</span> been assigned an <span class="highlight">atomic</span> <span class="highlight">mass</span> between those of <span class="highlight">arsenic</span> and selenium. Because there is no <span class="highlight">space</span> in the <span class="highlight">periodic</span> table between these two elements, Mendeleyev suggested that the <span class="highlight">atomic</span> <span class="highlight">mass</span> of indium be changed to a completely different value, where it would fill an empty <span class="highlight">space</span> between cadmium and tin. In fact, <span class="highlight">subsequent</span> work has shown that in a <span class="highlight">periodic</span> table, elements should not be ordered strictly by <span class="highlight">atomic</span> <span class="highlight">mass</span>. For example, tellurium comes before iodine in the <span class="highlight">periodic</span> table, <span class="highlight">even</span> though its <span class="highlight">atomic</span> <span class="highlight">mass</span> is <span class="highlight">slightly</span> greater. Such anomalies are <span class="highlight">due</span> to the <span class="highlight">relative</span> <span class="highlight"><span class="question7">abundance</span></span> of the "isotopes" or varieties of each <span class="highlight">element</span>. All the isotopes of a <span class="highlight">given</span> <span class="highlight">element</span> have the same number of protons, but differ in their number of neutrons, and hence in their <span class="highlight">atomic</span> <span class="highlight">mass</span>. The isotopes of a <span class="highlight">given</span> <span class="highlight">element</span> have the same chemical properties but <span class="highlight">slightly</span> different <span class="highlight">physical</span> properties. We now know that <span class="highlight">atomic</span> number (the number of protons in the <span class="highlight">nucleus</span>), not <span class="highlight">atomic</span> <span class="highlight">mass</span> number (the number of protons and neutrons), determines chemical <span class="highlight">behavior</span>.</p>
          <p>Mendeleyev went further than Meyer in another respect: he predicted the properties of six elements yet to be discovered. For example, a <span class="highlight">gap</span> just below <span class="highlight">aluminum</span> suggested a new <span class="highlight">element</span> would be found with properties <span class="question8"><span class="highlight">analogous</span> to</span> those of <span class="highlight">aluminum</span>. Mendeleyev designated this <span class="highlight">element</span> "eka-aluminum" (eka is the Sanskrit word for  "next") and predicted its properties. Just five years later an <span class="highlight">element</span> with the <span class="highlight">proper</span> <span class="highlight">atomic</span> <span class="highlight">mass</span> was <span class="highlight">isolated</span> and named gallium by its discoverer. The close <span class="highlight">correspondence</span> between the observed properties of gallium and Mendeleye Vs predictions for eka-aluminum lent strong support to the <span class="highlight">periodic</span> law. <span class="highlight">Additional</span> support came in 1885 when eka-silicon, which had also been described in <span class="highlight">advance</span> by Mendeleyev, was discovered and named germanium.</p>
          <p>The structure of the <span class="highlight">periodic</span> table appeared to limit the number of possible elements. It was <span class="highlight">therefore</span> quite surprising when John William Strut( Lord Rayleigh, discovered a <span class="highlight">gaseous</span> <span class="highlight">element</span> in 1894 that did not fit into the <span class="highlight">previous</span> <span class="highlight">classification</span> <span class="highlight">scheme</span>. A <span class="highlight">century</span> earlier, Henry Cavendish had <span class="highlight">noted</span> the <span class="highlight">existence</span> of a residual gas when <span class="highlight">oxygen</span> and <span class="highlight">nitrogen</span> are removed from <span class="highlight">air</span>, but its importance had not been realized. Together with William Ramsay, Rayleigh <span class="highlight">isolated</span> the gas (separating it from other substances into its <span class="highlight">pure</span> <span class="highlight">state</span>) and named it <span class="highlight">argon</span>. <span class="question11">Ramsay then studied a gas that was present in natural gas deposits and discovered that it was <span class="highlight">helium</span>, an <span class="highlight">element</span> whose presence in the Sun had been <span class="highlight">noted</span> earlier in the <span class="highlight">spectrum</span> of sunlight but that had not <span class="highlight">previously</span> been known on Earth.</span> Rayleigh and Ramsay <span class="question12">postulated</span> the <span class="highlight">existence</span> of a new group of elements, and in 1898 other members of the <span class="highlight">series</span> (<span class="highlight">neon</span>, krypton, and xenon) were <span class="highlight">isolated</span>.</p>
