To find out his grade on the midterm exam.</p><p>B. To explain why he missed a class.</p><p>C. To get help writing an essay.</p><p>D. To ask to take a test at a different time.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>So, well, I was thinking maybe I could take the test on a different day like Monday as during your office hours?</p><p>It was learned from the dialogue that the students went to see that the professor wanted to take a trip to a French class and that the time was exactly the same, so I wanted to take another test time.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor congratulate the student?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. He received the highest grade on a recent test.</p><p>B. He recently won an award.</p><p>C. He was accepted into a history program in France.</p><p>D. He wrote an essay that was published in a magazine.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Jeff, I'm glad you drop by. I've been meaning to congratulate you on the class leadership award. I learned from the conversation that the student had come to visit. The professor was very happy and congratulated him on winning the leadership award.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What will the student do this weekend?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

How much information from the textbook they include.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="BC"><p>Uh state and defend your opinion, analyze the issues, speculate about how things might have turned out differently. So, you see, I don't care if you look updates and that kind of thing. What I want is for you to synthesize information To reflect back on what we've read and discussed and to form your own ideas, not just repeat points from the textbook. Does that make sense?</p><p>A has certain doubts, but factual details in historical events are also equivalent to repeat points in textbooks. The D option is obviously wrong.</p></div></div><div class="replay" id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor imply when she says this?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.
