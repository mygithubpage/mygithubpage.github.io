This has been so since <span class="highlight">ancient</span> times, <span class="highlight">partly</span><span class="highlight">due</span> to the <span class="highlight">geology</span> of the area, which is mostly <span class="highlight">limestone</span> and sandstone, with few deposits of <span class="highlight">metallic</span><span class="highlight">ore</span> and other useful materials. <span class="highlight">Ancient</span> demands for <span class="highlight">obsidian</span> (a black <span class="highlight">volcanic</span> rock useful for making mirrors and tools) led to <span class="highlight">trade</span> with Armenia to the north, while <span class="highlight">jade</span> for cutting tools was brought from Turkistan, and the <span class="highlight">precious</span> stone lapis lazuli was imported from Afghanistan. One can <span class="highlight">trace</span> such expeditions back to <span class="highlight">ancient</span> Sumeria, the earliest known Middle Eastern <span class="highlight">civilization</span>. Records show <span class="highlight">merchant</span> caravans and trading posts set up by the Sumerians in the surrounding mountains and deserts of <span class="highlight">Persia</span> and Arabia, where they traded <span class="highlight">grain</span> for <span class="highlight">raw</span> materials, such as <span class="highlight">timber</span> and stones, as well as for metals and gems.</p><p>Reliance on <span class="highlight">trade</span> had several important consequences. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>Production was generally in the hands of skilled <span class="highlight">individual</span> artisans doing piecework under the tutelage of a master who was also the shop owner. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>In these shops differences of <span class="highlight">rank</span> were blurred as artisans and masters labored side by side in the same <span class="highlight">modest</span><span class="highlight">establishment</span>, were usually members of the same <span class="highlight">guild</span> and <span class="highlight">religious</span> sect, lived in the same neighborhoods, and often had assumed (or real) kinship relationships. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>The worker was <span class="highlight">bound</span> to the master by a <span class="highlight">mutual</span><span class="highlight">contract</span> that either one could <span class="question2">repudiate</span>, and the relationship was conceptualized as one of <span class="highlight">partnership</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p><p>This <span class="highlight">mode</span> of <span class="highlight">craft</span> production <span class="highlight">favored</span> the growth of self-governing and ideologically egalitarian <span class="highlight">craft</span> guilds everywhere in the Middle Eastern city. These were <span class="highlight">essentially</span><span class="highlight">professional</span> associations that provided for the <span class="highlight">mutual</span> aid and protection of their members, and allowed for the <span class="highlight">maintenance</span> of <span class="highlight">professional</span> standards. The growth of <span class="highlight">independent</span> guilds was furthered by the fact that <span class="question4"><span class="highlight">surplus</span> was not a result of <span class="highlight">domestic</span><span class="highlight">craft</span> production but resulted <span class="highlight">primarily</span> from international trading</span>; the <span class="highlight">government</span> left working people to <span class="highlight">govern</span> themselves, much as shepherds of <span class="highlight">tribal</span> confederacies were left alone by their leaders. In the multiplicity of small-scale <span class="highlight">local</span> egalitarian or quasi-egalitarian organizations for <span class="highlight">fellowship</span>, worship, and production that flourished in this laissez-faire environment, individuals could <span class="highlight">interact</span> with one another <span class="highlight">within</span> a <span class="highlight">community</span> of <span class="highlight">harmony</span> and <span class="highlight">ideological</span><span class="highlight">equality</span>, following their own popularly elected leaders and governing themselves by shared <span class="highlight"><span class="question6">consensus</span></span> while minimizing distinctions of wealth and power.</p><p>The <span class="highlight">mercantile</span><span class="highlight">economy</span> was also characterized by a <span class="highlight">peculiar</span><span class="highlight">moral</span><span class="highlight">stance</span> that is <span class="highlight">typical</span> of people who live by <span class="highlight">trade</span>-an attitude that is individualistic, calculating, risk taking, and <span class="highlight">adaptive</span> to circumstances. <span class="question8">As among tribes people, <span class="highlight">personal</span> relationships and a careful weighing of <span class="highlight">character</span> have always been <span class="highlight">crucial</span> in a <span class="highlight">mercantile</span><span class="highlight">economy</span> with little regulation, where one's word is one's <span class="highlight">bond</span> and where informal ties of trust <span class="highlight">cement</span> together an international <span class="highlight">trade</span> network.</span> Nor have merchants and artisans ever had much tolerance for aristocratic professions of <span class="highlight">moral</span> superiority, favoring <span class="highlight">instead</span> an egalitarian <span class="highlight"><span class="question9">ethic</span></span> of the open <span class="highlight">market</span>, where <span class="highlight">steady</span> hard work, the loyalty of one's fellows, and <span class="highlight">entrepreneurial</span> skill make all the <span class="highlight">difference</span>. And, like the pastoralists, Middle Eastern merchants and artisans unhappy with their environment could <span class="highlight">simply</span><span class="highlight">pack</span> up and leave for greener pastures-an act of self-assertion wholly impossible in most other civilizations <span class="highlight">throughout</span><span class="highlight">history</span>.</p><p>Dependence on long-distance <span class="highlight">trade</span> also meant that the great empires of the Middle East were built both <span class="highlight">literally</span> and figuratively on shifting sand. The central <span class="highlight">state</span>, though often very rich and very populous, was <span class="question11">intrinsically</span><span class="highlight">fragile</span>, since the <span class="highlight">development</span> of new international <span class="highlight">trade</span> routes could undermine the monetary <span class="highlight">base</span> and <span class="highlight">erode</span><span class="highlight">state</span> power, as occurred when European seafarers circumvented Middle Eastern merchants after Vasco da  Gama's <span class="highlight">voyage</span> around Africa in the late fifteenth <span class="highlight">century</span> opened up a southern <span class="highlight">route</span>. The <span class="highlight">ecology</span> of the <span class="highlight">region</span> also permitted armed predators to prowl the surrounding barrens, which were almost impossible for a <span class="highlight">state</span> to control. <span class="highlight">Peripheral</span> peoples <span class="highlight">therefore</span> had a great <span class="highlight">advantage</span> in their dealings with the center, making <span class="highlight">government</span><span class="highlight">authority</span> insecure and <span class="highlight">anxious</span>.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 1, why has trade been so important throughout the history of the Middle East</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

A said that there is a material in the Middle East and it is obviously contrary to the original; B's Middle East is very poor and D's frequent travel has not said the original.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question2">repudiate</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. respect</p><p>B. reject</p><p>C. review</p><p>D. revise</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>B <span class="question2">repudiate</span>: Severe relationship with ..., refute.

A's workers rank did not say; B said that different workers have different attitudes, contrary to the original; C's unbreakable contract is contrary to the last sentence.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The author includes the information that |surplus was not a result of domestic craft production but resulted primarily from international trading|in order to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. support the claim that the mode of production made possible by the craft guilds w very good for trade</p><p>B. contrast the economic base of the city government with that of the tribal confederacies</p><p>C. provide a reason why the government allowed the guilds to be self-controlled</p><p>D. suggest that the government was missing out on a valuable opportunity to tax the guilds</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The purpose of the function, first look at the sentence where the rhetorical point is, just an example, give up; look forward, that there are trade associations mutual assistance and reciprocity, but this is obviously still an example, so look at the central sentence of this paragraph, saying that this production method tends to The development of peer associations that promote equal self-discipline, so the answer is C.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 3, all of the following are true of the Middle Eastern craft guilds EXCEPT:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.
