          <h4 class="w3-center">Trade and the Ancient Middle East</h4>
          <p>
            <span class="highlight">Trade</span> was the <span class="highlight">mainstay</span> of the <span class="highlight">urban</span> <span class="highlight">economy</span> in the Middle East, as caravans negotiated the surrounding <span class="highlight">desert</span>, <span class="highlight">restricted</span> only by <span class="highlight">access</span> to water and by mountain ranges. This has been so since <span class="highlight">ancient</span> times, <span class="highlight">partly</span> <span class="highlight">due</span> to the <span class="highlight">geology</span> of the area, which is mostly <span class="highlight">limestone</span> and sandstone, with few deposits of <span class="highlight">metallic</span> <span class="highlight">ore</span> and other useful materials. <span class="highlight">Ancient</span> demands for <span class="highlight">obsidian</span> (a black <span class="highlight">volcanic</span> rock useful for making mirrors and tools) led to <span class="highlight">trade</span> with Armenia to the north, while <span class="highlight">jade</span> for cutting tools was brought from Turkistan, and the <span class="highlight">precious</span> stone lapis lazuli was imported from Afghanistan. One can <span class="highlight">trace</span> such expeditions back to <span class="highlight">ancient</span> Sumeria, the earliest known Middle Eastern <span class="highlight">civilization</span>. Records show <span class="highlight">merchant</span> caravans and trading posts set up by the Sumerians in the surrounding mountains and deserts of <span class="highlight">Persia</span> and Arabia, where they traded <span class="highlight">grain</span> for <span class="highlight">raw</span> materials, such as <span class="highlight">timber</span> and stones, as well as for metals and gems.</p>
          <p>Reliance on <span class="highlight">trade</span> had several important consequences. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>Production was generally in the hands of skilled <span class="highlight">individual</span> artisans doing piecework under the tutelage of a master who was also the shop owner. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>In these shops differences of <span class="highlight">rank</span> were blurred as artisans and masters labored side by side in the same <span class="highlight">modest</span> <span class="highlight">establishment</span>, were usually members of the same <span class="highlight">guild</span> and <span class="highlight">religious</span> sect, lived in the same neighborhoods, and often had assumed (or real) kinship relationships. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>The worker was <span class="highlight">bound</span> to the master by a <span class="highlight">mutual</span> <span class="highlight">contract</span> that either one could <span class="question2">repudiate</span>, and the relationship was conceptualized as one of <span class="highlight">partnership</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p>
          <p>This <span class="highlight">mode</span> of <span class="highlight">craft</span> production <span class="highlight">favored</span> the growth of self-governing and ideologically egalitarian <span class="highlight">craft</span> guilds everywhere in the Middle Eastern city. These were <span class="highlight">essentially</span> <span class="highlight">professional</span> associations that provided for the <span class="highlight">mutual</span> aid and protection of their members, and allowed for the <span class="highlight">maintenance</span> of <span class="highlight">professional</span> standards. The growth of <span class="highlight">independent</span> guilds was furthered by the fact that <span class="question4"><span class="highlight">surplus</span> was not a result of <span class="highlight">domestic</span> <span class="highlight">craft</span> production but resulted <span class="highlight">primarily</span> from international trading</span>; the <span class="highlight">government</span> left working people to <span class="highlight">govern</span> themselves, much as shepherds of <span class="highlight">tribal</span> confederacies were left alone by their leaders. In the multiplicity of small-scale <span class="highlight">local</span> egalitarian or quasi-egalitarian organizations for <span class="highlight">fellowship</span>, worship, and production that flourished in this laissez-faire environment, individuals could <span class="highlight">interact</span> with one another <span class="highlight">within</span> a <span class="highlight">community</span> of <span class="highlight">harmony</span> and <span class="highlight">ideological</span> <span class="highlight">equality</span>, following their own popularly elected leaders and governing themselves by shared <span class="highlight"><span class="question6">consensus</span></span> while minimizing distinctions of wealth and power.</p>
          <p>The <span class="highlight">mercantile</span> <span class="highlight">economy</span> was also characterized by a <span class="highlight">peculiar</span> <span class="highlight">moral</span> <span class="highlight">stance</span> that is <span class="highlight">typical</span> of people who live by <span class="highlight">trade</span>-an attitude that is individualistic, calculating, risk taking, and <span class="highlight">adaptive</span> to circumstances. <span class="question8">As among tribes people, <span class="highlight">personal</span> relationships and a careful weighing of <span class="highlight">character</span> have always been <span class="highlight">crucial</span> in a <span class="highlight">mercantile</span> <span class="highlight">economy</span> with little regulation, where one's word is one's <span class="highlight">bond</span> and where informal ties of trust <span class="highlight">cement</span> together an international <span class="highlight">trade</span> network.</span> Nor have merchants and artisans ever had much tolerance for aristocratic professions of <span class="highlight">moral</span> superiority, favoring <span class="highlight">instead</span> an egalitarian <span class="highlight"><span class="question9">ethic</span></span> of the open <span class="highlight">market</span>, where <span class="highlight">steady</span> hard work, the loyalty of one's fellows, and <span class="highlight">entrepreneurial</span> skill make all the <span class="highlight">difference</span>. And, like the pastoralists, Middle Eastern merchants and artisans unhappy with their environment could <span class="highlight">simply</span> <span class="highlight">pack</span> up and leave for greener pastures-an act of self-assertion wholly impossible in most other civilizations <span class="highlight">throughout</span> <span class="highlight">history</span>.</p>
          <p>Dependence on long-distance <span class="highlight">trade</span> also meant that the great empires of the Middle East were built both <span class="highlight">literally</span> and figuratively on shifting sand. The central <span class="highlight">state</span>, though often very rich and very populous, was <span class="question11">intrinsically</span> <span class="highlight">fragile</span>, since the <span class="highlight">development</span> of new international <span class="highlight">trade</span> routes could undermine the monetary <span class="highlight">base</span> and <span class="highlight">erode</span> <span class="highlight">state</span> power, as occurred when European seafarers circumvented Middle Eastern merchants after Vasco da  Gama's <span class="highlight">voyage</span> around Africa in the late fifteenth <span class="highlight">century</span> opened up a southern <span class="highlight">route</span>. The <span class="highlight">ecology</span> of the <span class="highlight">region</span> also permitted armed predators to prowl the surrounding barrens, which were almost impossible for a <span class="highlight">state</span> to control. <span class="highlight">Peripheral</span> peoples <span class="highlight">therefore</span> had a great <span class="highlight">advantage</span> in their dealings with the center, making <span class="highlight">government</span> <span class="highlight">authority</span> insecure and <span class="highlight">anxious</span>.</p>

People and people they know do business, not people rely on promises to do business; C wrong, the original said there is no regulation, C said anti; D wrong, Because only the original never said.</p>
