              <span class="time" data-times="5.95" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in an art history class.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.51" data-time="5.95">[00:05.95]</span>Male professor: OK, now, um, a sort of paradigmatic art form of the Middle Age was stained-glass art. <span class="time" data-times="10.22" data-time="14.46">[00:14.46]</span>Stained glass, of course, is simply glass that has been colored and, uh, cut into pieces and re-assembled to form a picture or decorative design.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="12.58" data-time="24.68">[00:24.68]</span>To truly experience the beauty of this decorative glass, you should see it with light passing through it, uh, especially sun light, which is why stained-glass is usually used for windows. <span class="time" data-times="3.96" data-time="37.26">[00:37.26]</span>But, of course, it has other uses especially nowadays. <span class="time" data-times="10.45" data-time="41.22">[00:41.22]</span>Um, anyway, the art of making stained-glass windows developed in Europe, um, during the middle Ages, and was closely related to church buildings.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="17.41" data-time="51.67">[00:51.67]</span>In the early 1100s, a church building <span class="highlight">method</span> was developed that reduced the <span class="highlight">stress</span> on the walls, so more <span class="highlight">space</span> could be used for window openings, allowing for large and quite <span class="highlight">elaborate</span> window designs. <span class="time" data-times="7.09" data-time="69.08">[01:09.08]</span>Um, back then, the artists made their own glass, but first, they came up with the design. <span class="time" data-times="8" data-time="76.17">[01:16.17]</span>Uh, paper was <span class="highlight">scarce</span> and expensive so typically they drew the design onto a white table top. <span class="time" data-times="10.65" data-time="84.17">[01:24.17]</span>They <span class="highlight">draw</span> the <span class="highlight">principal</span> <span class="highlight">outline</span> but also <span class="highlight">outline</span> the <span class="highlight">shape</span> of each piece of glass to be used, and, uh, <span class="highlight">indicate</span> its color.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="13.65" data-time="94.82">[01:34.82]</span>Now, in the window itself, the pieces of glass would be held together by strips of <span class="highlight">lead</span> so, uh, so in the drawing the artist would also <span class="highlight">indicate</span> the locations of the <span class="highlight">lead</span> strips. <span class="time" data-times="13.34" data-time="108.47">[01:48.47]</span>Then you could put a big piece of glass on the table top and see the design right <span class="highlight">through</span> it, and use it to guide the cutting of the glass into smaller pieces.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.26" data-time="121.81">[02:01.81]</span>
              <span class="highlight">Male</span> student: And the <span class="highlight">lead</span>, that was just to hold the whole piece glass together?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.5" data-time="125.07">[02:05.07]</span>
              <span class="highlight">Male</span> professor: Well, uh, <span class="highlight">lead</span> is strong and <span class="highlight">flexible</span> so it's <span class="highlight">ideal</span> for joining pieces of glass cut in different shapes and sizes. <span class="time" data-times="5.92" data-time="133.57">[02:13.57]</span>Uh, but up to the 15th <span class="highlight">century</span>, the <span class="highlight">lead</span> strips also helped created the design. <span class="time" data-times="4.18" data-time="139.49">[02:19.49]</span>They were worked into the window as part of the <span class="highlight">composition</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9.2" data-time="143.67">[02:23.67]</span>Uh, they were used to <span class="highlight">outline</span> figures to show boundaries, just like you might use <span class="highlight">solid</span> <span class="highlight">line</span> in a pencil drawing.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.36" data-time="152.87">[02:32.87]</span>
              <span class="highlight">Male</span> student: How did they get the color? <span class="time" data-times="2.72" data-time="154.23">[02:34.23]</span>I mean, how did they color the glass?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.44" data-time="156.95">[02:36.95]</span>
              <span class="highlight">Male</span> professor: Well, up until the 16th <span class="highlight">century</span>, stained-glass was colored during the glass making <span class="highlight">process</span> itself. <span class="time" data-times="7.94" data-time="164.39">[02:44.39]</span>Uh, you got <span class="highlight">specific</span> colors by adding <span class="highlight">metallic</span> compounds to the other glass-making ingredients. <span class="time" data-times="4.13" data-time="172.33">[02:52.33]</span>So, uh, if you <span class="highlight">wanted</span> red, you added <span class="highlight">copper</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.68" data-time="176.46">[02:56.46]</span>If you <span class="highlight">wanted</span> green, you added iron. <span class="time" data-times="5.55" data-time="179.14">[02:59.14]</span>You just added these compounds to the other ingredients that the glass was made of.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.03" data-time="184.69">[03:04.69]</span>
              <span class="highlight">Female</span> student: So each piece of glass is just one color?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.13" data-time="187.72">[03:07.72]</span>
              <span class="highlight">Male</span> professor: Yes, uh, at <span class="highlight">least</span> up until the 16th <span class="highlight">century</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.59" data-time="190.85">[03:10.85]</span>Uh, then they started, uh, you started to get painted-glass. <span class="time" data-times="12.17" data-time="196.44">[03:16.44]</span>Painted-glass windows are still referred to as stained-glass, but the colors were, actually, painted directly onto <span class="highlight">clear</span> glass after the glass was made. <span class="time" data-times="7.37" data-time="208.61">[03:28.61]</span>So, um, with this kind of stained-glass, you could, uh, paint a piece of glass with more than one color.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.4" data-time="215.98">[03:35.98]</span>
              <span class="highlight">Female</span> student: And with painted-glass they still used the <span class="highlight">lead</span> strips?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.29" data-time="219.38">[03:39.38]</span>
              <span class="highlight">Male</span> professor: Yes, with really large windows it took more than one piece of glass, so you still needed <span class="highlight">lead</span> strips to hold the pieces together. <span class="time" data-times="20.27" data-time="229.67">[03:49.67]</span>But the painters actually tried to <span class="highlight">hide</span> them, so it was different from before when the <span class="highlight">lead</span> strips were part of the design and it's different because with painted-glass the idea of light coming <span class="highlight">through</span> to create the, uh, magical effect wasn't the <span class="highlight">focus</span> anymore.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.21" data-time="249.94">[04:09.94]</span>The paint work was, and painted-glass windows became very <span class="highlight">popular</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.06" data-time="257.15">[04:17.15]</span>In the 19th <span class="highlight">century</span>, people started using them in private houses and public buildings. <span class="time" data-times="13.26" data-time="264.21">[04:24.21]</span> <span class="highlight">Unfortunately</span>, many of the <span class="highlight">original</span> stained-glass windows were thought to be old fashioned, and they were actually destroyed, replaced by painted-glass.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.76" data-time="277.47">[04:37.47]</span>
              <span class="highlight">Female</span> student: They actually broke them? <span class="time" data-times="3.75" data-time="279.23">[04:39.23]</span>That showed good judgment, real foresight, didn't it?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.37" data-time="282.98">[04:42.98]</span>
              <span class="highlight">Male</span> professor: Yes! If only they had known! <span class="time" data-times="8.03" data-time="286.35">[04:46.35]</span>Uh, and it's not just that old stained-glass is really <span class="highlight">valuable</span> today, we lost, possibly, great art work. <span class="time" data-times="13.83" data-time="294.38">[04:54.38]</span>But, luckily, there was a <span class="highlight">revival</span> of the early techniques in the mid-1800s and artists went back creating colored glass and using the <span class="highlight">lead</span> strips in their designs.<span class="time" data-times="4" data-time="308.21">[05:08.21]</span> The effects are much more beautiful.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.96" data-time="312.21">[05:12.21]</span>In the 19th <span class="highlight">century</span>, uh, Louis Tiffany came up with methods to create beautiful effects without having to paint the glass. <span class="time" data-times="14.99" data-time="322.17">[05:22.17]</span>He layered pieces of glass and used thin <span class="highlight">copper</span> strips <span class="highlight">instead</span> of <span class="highlight">lead</span>, which let him make these really <span class="highlight">intricate</span> flowery designs for stained-glass, which he used in lamp shades. <span class="time" data-times="2.89" data-time="337.16">[05:37.16]</span>You've heard of Tiffany lamp shades, right? <span class="time" data-times="4.87" data-time="340.05">[05:40.05]</span>These, of <span class="highlight">course</span>, took <span class="highlight">advantage</span> of the new <span class="highlight">innovation</span> of electric lighting.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.41" data-time="344.92">[05:44.92]</span>Electric light bulbs don't give quite the same effect as sunlight streaming <span class="highlight">through</span> stained-glass but it's close. <span class="time" data-times="7.23" data-time="353.33">[05:53.33]</span>So, layered glass, Tiffany glass, became very <span class="highlight">popular</span> and still is today. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="360.56">[06:00.56]</span>So, um, let's look at some examples of different types of stained-glass from each <span class="highlight">era</span>.</p>
