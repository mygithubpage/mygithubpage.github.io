Spending large amount of money for pleasure only is not a wise way to handle money. It'll only make people want to spend more because human desire is insatiable. If you buy a big house, there will be a bigger house. If you buy a large company, there will be a larger company. So wiser people should spend the money on practical things such as setting up a fund for charity, helping those who are in urgent need of food and sanitation, building schools for kids who live in the rural areas and so on. Even opening a bookstore is better than just spending the money only for pleasure.</p></article></div></main></body></html>
