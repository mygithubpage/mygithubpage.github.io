The <span class="highlight">Choir</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.29" data-time="14.76">[00:14.76]</span>It's nice to finally meet you in person. <span class="time" data-times="2.41" data-time="17.05">[00:17.05]</span>So, you're having problem with?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.47" data-time="19.46">[00:19.46]</span>Woman: Noise, like I explained on the phone, we've always had our rehearsals in the Lincoln <span class="highlight">Auditorium</span>, every day at three o'clock, and it's always worked just great. <span class="time" data-times="6.55" data-time="27.93">[00:27.93]</span>But the past few weeks, with the noise, it's been a total <span class="highlight">nightmare</span>, since <span class="highlight">construction</span> started next door on the Science Hall.</p>

              <span class="time" data-times="6.03" data-time="37.67">[00:37.67]</span>Woman: Exactly! Anyway, ever since they started working on it, it's been so noisy that we can <span class="highlight">barely</span> hear ourselves sing!</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.2" data-time="43.7">[00:43.70]</span>Man: Let alone singing!</p>

            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.41" data-time="57">[00:57.00]</span>Man: Well, that's not good. <span class="time" data-times="3.19" data-time="58.41">[00:58.41]</span>I'm assuming you've tried to <span class="highlight">reschedule</span> your rehearsals? <span class="time" data-times="2.05" data-time="61.6">[01:01.60]</span>They don't do <span class="highlight">construction</span> work at night.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.29" data-time="63.65">[01:03.65]</span>Woman: I ran that by the group, but there were just too many, I mean, evenings are really hard. <span class="time" data-times="4.86" data-time="68.94">[01:08.94]</span>It seems like every one in the <span class="highlight">Choir</span> already has plans, and some <span class="highlight">even</span> has classes at night.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.77" data-time="73.8">[01:13.80]</span>Man: And what about the music building?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.72" data-time="75.57">[01:15.57]</span>Woman: You know, originally we were booked in one of the rehearsal rooms in the music building, but then we switched with the jazz ensemble. <span class="time" data-times="5.56" data-time="82.29">[01:22.29]</span>They are a much smaller group and they said the acoustics, the <span class="highlight">sound</span> in that room, was better for them. <span class="time" data-times="5.28" data-time="87.85">[01:27.85]</span>So having us move to a bigger <span class="highlight">space</span>, like the Lincoln <span class="highlight">Auditorium</span>, seems like a <span class="highlight">reasonable</span> idea.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.29" data-time="93.13">[01:33.13]</span>Man: But, now?</p>

              <span class="time" data-times="2.96" data-time="94.42">[01:34.42]</span>Woman: All that noise! I don't know. <span class="time" data-times="4.13" data-time="97.38">[01:37.38]</span>I just <span class="highlight">wonder</span> if the jazz ensemble knew what was going to happen.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.78" data-time="101.51">[01:41.51]</span>Man: Well, that wouldn't be very nice.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.39" data-time="103.29">[01:43.29]</span>Woman: No, but it really was quite a coincidence. <span class="time" data-times="4.97" data-time="106.68">[01:46.68]</span>Anyway, now the music building's fully booked, mornings, afternoons, everything. <span class="time" data-times="3.33" data-time="111.65">[01:51.65]</span>We just need a quite <span class="highlight">space</span>, and it has to have a piano.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.91" data-time="114.98">[01:54.98]</span>Man: A piano! Of <span class="highlight">course</span>, uh, some of the other auditoriums have pianos but that's not going to be easy.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.38" data-time="121.89">[02:01.89]</span>Woman: You think they're <span class="highlight">pretty</span> booked up?</p>

            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.87" data-time="129.78">[02:09.78]</span>Woman: At this point, we'd be grateful for any quite place.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3" data-time="132.65">[02:12.65]</span>Man: Can you, how <span class="highlight">flexible</span> can you be on times? <span class="time" data-times="4.09" data-time="135.65">[02:15.65]</span>You said no evenings, but what if I can't find something open at three o'clock? <span class="time" data-times="1.84" data-time="139.74">[02:19.74]</span>Can you move earlier, or later?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.71" data-time="141.58">[02:21.58]</span>Woman: I wish I could say another time would be OK, but, you know how it is – everybody's already got commitments for the whole <span class="highlight">semester</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.41" data-time="149.29">[02:29.29]</span>2:30 or 3:30 would probably be OK, but I don't think we could go much outside that.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.34" data-time="154.7">[02:34.70]</span>Man: Well, <span class="highlight">check</span> with me tomorrow morning. <span class="time" data-times="2.41" data-time="156.04">[02:36.4]</span>I should've found something by then. <span class="time" data-times="2.1" data-time="158.45">[02:38.45]</span>It might not be <span class="highlight">ideal</span>.</p>
