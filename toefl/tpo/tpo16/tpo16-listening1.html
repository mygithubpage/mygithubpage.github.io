        <h3>Listening Text</h3>
        <article>
          <p>Narrator: Listen to a conversation between a student and a facility manager at the university.</p>
          <p>:Woman: Hi, I am Melanie, the one who's been calling?</p>
          <p>:Man: From the Singing Group, right?</p>
          <p>:Woman: From the Choir.</p>
          <p>:Man: Right! The Choir. It's nice to finally meet you in person. So, you're having problem with?</p>
          <p>:Woman: Noise, like I explained on the phone, we've always had our rehearsals in the Lincoln Auditorium, every day at three o'clock, and it's always worked just great. But the past few weeks, with the noise, it's been a total nightmare, since construction started next door on the Science Hall.</p>
          <p>:Man: Oh, that's right! They're building that addition for new laboratory.</p>
          <p>:Woman: Exactly! Anyway, ever since they started working on it, it's been so noisy that we can barely hear ourselves sing!</p>
          <p>:Man: Let alone singing!</p>
          <p>:Woman: Forget about singing! I mean we keep the windows down and everything, but once those bulldozers get going, I mean those machines are loud. We've already had to cut short two rehearsals and we've got a concert in six weeks.</p>
          <p>:Man: Well, that's not good. I'm assuming you've tried to reschedule your rehearsals? They don't do construction work at night.</p>
          <p>:Woman: I ran that by the group, but there were just too many, I mean, evenings are really hard. It seems like every one in the Choir already has plans, and some even has classes at night.</p>
          <p>:Man: And what about the music building?</p>
          <p>:Woman: You know, originally we were booked in one of the rehearsal rooms in the music building, but then we switched with the jazz ensemble. They are a much smaller group and they said the acoustics, the sound in that room, was better for them. So having us move to a bigger space, like the Lincoln Auditorium, seems like a reasonable idea.</p>
          <p>:Man: But, now?</p>
          <p>:Woman: All that noise! I don't know. I just wonder if the jazz ensemble knew what was going to happen.</p>
          <p>:Man: Well, that wouldn't be very nice.</p>
          <p>:Woman: No, but it really was quite a coincidence. Anyway, now the music building's fully booked, mornings, afternoons, everything. We just need a quite space, and it has to have a piano.</p>
          <p>:Man: A piano! Of course, uh, some of the other auditoriums have pianos but that's not going to be easy.</p>
          <p>:Woman: You think they're pretty booked up?</p>
          <p>:Man: Probably, but it can't hurt to check, what about Bradford Hall? I remember a piano in the old student center there.</p>
          <p>:Woman: At this point, we'd be grateful for any quite place.</p>
          <p>:Man: Can you, how flexible can you be on times? You said no evenings, but what if I can't find something open at three o'clock? Can you move earlier, or later?</p>
          <p>:Woman: I wish I could say another time would be OK, but, you know how it is - everybody's already got commitments for the whole semester. 2:30 or 3:30 would probably be OK, but I don't think we could go much outside that.</p>
          <p>:Man: Well, check with me tomorrow morning. [02:36.4]I should've found something by then. It might not be ideal.</p>
          <p>:Woman: As long as it's got a piano and nobody's putting up a building next door, we'll be happy.</p>
