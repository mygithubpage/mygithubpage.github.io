Postpone a choir performance to allow more time for rehearsals.</p><p>B. Change the rehearsal schedule at the music building.</p><p>C. Give approval for her group to move a piano to a different room.</p><p>D. Help her reserve a rehearsal space on campus.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>We just need a quiet space. And it has to have a piano.</p><p>We learned from the conversation that due to their current Lincoln Auditorium decoration, they were particularly noisy and unable to rehearse. So they asked for a place.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What problem concerning Lincoln Auditorium is mentioned?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. There is no piano in the auditorium.</p><p>B. The auditorium has been booked by the jazz ensemble.</p><p>C. The auditorium is located near a construction site.</p><p>D. The auditoriums stage is not large enough to hold the whole choir.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>But the past few weeks with the noise, it's been a total nightmare since constructions started next door on the science hall.</p><p>I learned from the conversation that the construction of the nearby Lincoln Auditorium is now very noisy and can not be rehearsed.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the woman imply about having 6rehearsals in the evening?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Most auditoriums are already reserved in the evening for performances</p><p>B. Groups must finish rehearsals before campus buildings close.</p><p>C. Students are usually too tired to rehearse in the evening.</p><p>D. Many students are not available in the evening.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>I mean evenings are really hard. It seems like everyone in the choir already has plans and some even have classes at night. Learned from the conversation that many people have arrangements at night and cannot rehearse.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the woman's attitude toward the jazz ensemble?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

I just wonder if the jazz ensemble knew what was going to happen.</p><p>Manager: Well, that wouldn't be very nice.</p><p>Student: No. But it really was quite a coincidence.</p><p>I learned from the dialogue that the girl's choir and jazz group had changed places, and then they renovated.

She will give the man the answers to his questions at another time.</p><p>B. She is sorry that she cannot change the rehearsal time.</p><p>C. She wishes that she could explain the problem more clearly.</p><p>D. She believes the man already knows the answers to his own questions.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Because their original time is three points, if the male teacher changes to advance and advance, some people may not be able to come, so that is not too much time. A, C is obviously wrong, D is a bit confused, but how can a male teacher surely know the answer? It is also necessary to communicate, D's tone is too affirmative. B corresponds to the virtual tone, that is, it cannot change time.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
