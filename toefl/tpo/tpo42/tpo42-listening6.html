a lecture in a marketing class.<span class="time" data-times="7.26" data-time="4.1">[00:04.10]</span>And that wraps up our discussion of how the <span class="highlight">retail</span> sector, uh, ways in which <span class="highlight">retail</span> managers <span class="highlight">deal</span> with customer complaints. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="10.71" data-time="11.36">[00:11.36]</span>So let's <span class="highlight">shift</span> now to the service sector, which markets not goods but services, intangibles like <span class="highlight">transportation</span>, food service, <span class="highlight">career</span><span class="highlight">counseling</span>.... <span class="time" data-times="3.03" data-time="22.07">[00:22.07]</span>Oh, there are <span class="highlight">literally</span> hundreds of examples.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.26" data-time="25.1">[00:25.10]</span>Service providers must, of <span class="highlight">course</span>, <span class="highlight">constantly</span><span class="highlight">strive</span> to meet customers' needs. <span class="time" data-times="9.83" data-time="30.36">[00:30.36]</span>But as in <span class="highlight">retail</span>, there are instances of service failure in which the customer is dissatisfied, uh, perhaps to the point of not doing business with you anymore.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="8.12" data-time="40.19">[00:40.19]</span>Some service failures are beyond an <span class="highlight">organization</span>'s control, like, uh, computer malfunction that leads to missed deadlines. <span class="time" data-times="6.09" data-time="48.31">[00:48.31]</span>Other failures <span class="highlight">stem</span> from <span class="highlight">process</span> problems, like inadequate training for newly-hired employees.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.16" data-time="54.4">[00:54.40]</span>Then there's human error. <span class="time" data-times="6.11" data-time="56.56">[00:56.56]</span>Okay, imagine you <span class="highlight">manage</span> a car <span class="highlight">rental</span><span class="highlight">agency</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.72" data-time="62.67">[01:02.67]</span>A customer calls in a <span class="highlight">reservation</span>, but your employee marks down the wrong <span class="highlight">date</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.35" data-time="68.39">[01:08.39]</span>So your customer arrives and guess what, the size car he reserved isn't <span class="highlight">available</span>. <span class="time" data-times="11.7" data-time="74.74">[01:14.74]</span>But your customer is less concerned about the <span class="highlight">source</span> of the failure than the solution: what you do about it; what <span class="highlight">sort</span> of <span class="highlight">compensation</span>; what service recovery you give.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.29" data-time="86.44">[01:26.44]</span>So if you are in the service <span class="highlight">industry</span>, as a marketer, you always need some kind of service recovery plan. <span class="time" data-times="11.12" data-time="93.73">[01:33.73]</span>Your plan must be in place before a failure occurs and it must also be communicated <span class="highlight">promptly</span> to everyone in your <span class="highlight">organization</span> who deals with customers so they'll know what to do.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="9.55" data-time="104.85">[01:44.85]</span>Service recovery encompasses all the actions taken to get a disappointed customer back to, uh, well, back to a <span class="highlight">state</span> of satisfaction. <span class="time" data-times="9.69" data-time="114.4">[01:54.40]</span>So if your car <span class="highlight">rental</span><span class="highlight">agency</span> couldn't provide the size car your customer <span class="highlight">wanted</span>, but your <span class="highlight">policy</span> is to provide a roomier car for the same price. <span class="time" data-times="5.48" data-time="124.09">[02:04.09]</span>Your customer would probably be happy, might <span class="highlight">even</span><span class="highlight">restore</span> his faith in your <span class="highlight">company</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.15" data-time="129.57">[02:09.57]</span>Research has in fact identified service recovery as a <span class="highlight">significant</span><span class="highlight">determinant</span> of customer loyalty.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="1.9" data-time="137.72">[02:17.72]</span>Student:I see what you mean. <span class="time" data-times="3.3" data-time="139.62">[02:19.62]</span>Every year, my family goes on <span class="highlight">vacation</span> together. <span class="time" data-times="4.25" data-time="142.92">[02:22.92]</span>And a few summers ago, when we were in Chicago, it was really really hot. <span class="time" data-times="5.1" data-time="147.17">[02:27.17]</span>And guess what, the hotel's <span class="highlight">air</span> conditioning broke and everyone was complaining. <span class="time" data-times="4.2" data-time="152.27">[02:32.27]</span>What the hotel did...they actually didn't charge anybody for that weekend. <span class="time" data-times="10.53" data-time="156.47">[02:36.47]</span>But the funny thing is that <span class="highlight">even</span> though we had that horrible experience at that hotel, because they were so quick to appease us, we usually stay at that same hotel every time we go to Chicago.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="1.88" data-time="167">[02:47.00]</span>Professor:Great example! <span class="time" data-times="9.18" data-time="168.88">[02:48.88]</span>So in this case that hotel <span class="highlight">chain</span> might <span class="highlight">consider</span> itself the beneficiary of the so-called service recovery paradox. <span class="time" data-times="15.88" data-time="178.06">[02:58.06]</span>Um, the paradox basically implies that customers who experience a service failure, well, they could potentially be made more <span class="highlight">loyal</span> than customers who were satisfied in the first place if an <span class="highlight">equitable</span> recovery occurred after the failure.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="1.69" data-time="193.94">[03:13.94]</span>Yes, Ben?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="1.42" data-time="195.63">[03:15.63]</span>Student:Wait a <span class="highlight">minute</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9.97" data-time="197.05">[03:17.05]</span>If a good service recovery creates more loyalty than, um, if things went <span class="highlight">smoothly</span> from the get-go, why don't companies like make mistakes on purpose so?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.12" data-time="207.02">[03:27.02]</span>Professor:So you could <span class="highlight">implement</span> a recovery plan that leave your customers <span class="highlight">delighted</span> as <span class="highlight">opposed</span> to merely satisfied?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="11.53" data-time="214.14">[03:34.14]</span>Look, it's always better to do things right the first time 'cause how can you know that the paradox will hold true in every situation?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="9.88" data-time="225.67">[03:45.67]</span>Plus, it's hard to <span class="highlight">predict</span> if a good service recovery will <span class="highlight">overcome</span> the <span class="highlight">negative</span> effect of a service failure, and what about all those failures that never come to your <span class="highlight">attention</span>? <span class="time" data-times="8.63" data-time="235.55">[03:55.55]</span>Because statistically about 50 percent of the customers don't <span class="highlight">complain</span> about service failures, at <span class="highlight">least</span> not to the service provider. <span class="time" data-times="5.53" data-time="244.18">[04:04.18]</span>But <span class="highlight">negative</span> word of mouth, now, that got worse implications for your business.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.49" data-time="249.71">[04:09.71]</span>Also, you'd have to <span class="highlight">pay</span> your employees to <span class="highlight">execute</span> the service a <span class="highlight">second</span> time. <span class="time" data-times="4.85" data-time="255.2">[04:15.20]</span>Typically, a service recovery is <span class="highlight">gonna</span><span class="highlight">involve</span> some kind of <span class="highlight">compensation</span>, right? <span class="time" data-times="5.13" data-time="260.05">[04:20.05]</span>So it is <span class="highlight">gonna</span><span class="highlight">cost</span> your <span class="highlight">company</span> some money that you are going have to <span class="highlight">account</span> for in your <span class="highlight">budget</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="11.56" data-time="265.18">[04:25.18]</span>I've actually been researching some of these issues myself 'cause what we need is a deeper understanding of customers' thought processes and their reactions to service recoveries. <span class="time" data-times="2.39" data-time="276.74">[04:36.74]</span>How do consumers form expectations? <span class="time" data-times="3.09" data-time="279.13">[04:39.13]</span>How do they react to different service recovery tactics? <span class="time" data-times="4.73" data-time="282.22">[04:42.22]</span>Can we <span class="highlight">predict</span> how any <span class="highlight">given</span> customer will react to a <span class="highlight">given</span> service failure?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.59" data-time="286.95">[04:46.95]</span>People's expectations, their priorities <span class="highlight">vary</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.94" data-time="290.54">[04:50.54]</span>Like uh, if I am in a <span class="highlight">hurry</span>, and the French fries I ordered at a fast food restaurant aren't piping hot. <span class="time" data-times="3.04" data-time="296.48">[04:56.48]</span>I might not <span class="highlight">complain</span> 'cause I got them fast. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="299.52">[04:59.52]</span>But If I am not in a <span class="highlight">hurry</span>, I might return the fries <span class="highlight">even</span> if I had to wait for a fresh <span class="highlight">batch</span>.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the lecture mainly about?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The most common causes of service failures</p><p>B. Effective strategies for preventing service failures</p><p>C. The importance of having a plan to address service failures</p><p>D. Ways in which different industries respond to service failures</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Professor at the beginning briefly listed several failure cases, such as miss deadlines, process problems, human error, and according to the original So, if you are in a service industry, as a marketer you always need some kind of service recovery plan. The purpose of the secondary mission is to emphasize the importance of these solutions in the case of service industry failures. So the C option is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor talk about a car rental agency?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To demonstrate the importance of employee training</p><p>B. To introduce the concept of service recovery</p><p>C. To point out that most service failures are within a company's control</p><p>D. To point out that it is costly to implement a service recovery plan</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The professor used a car rental agency as an example to illustrate how the customer made an appointment but the employee remembered the wrong date. How the customer should be compensated at this time is service recovery. So the B option is correct. Use this example to introduce service remediation. This concept.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the student mention his experience at a hotel in Chicago?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To show how complaints about a negative experience can hurt a business</p><p>B. To illustrate a surprising result of a successful service recovery</p><p>C. To give an example of an ineffective service recovery</p><p>D. To stress the importance of preventive maintenance in the hotel industry</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The student took an example of his own. In the summer, the air conditioning system of the hotel where he and his family went to take a vacation in Chicago broke down. The hotel's countermeasures were that air conditioning was not charged for the entire weekend, so even if the students felt that their living experience was not satisfactory, But because the hotel quickly appeased everyone's dissatisfaction, he chose this hotel every time he went to Chicago. This is a case where a very successful service fails but quickly remedies success. So the B option is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the professor's opinion of the service recovery paradox?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It should not be relied on as a way to increase customer loyalty.</p><p>B. It does not produce long-lasting benefits for the service provider.</p><p>C. It is more common in the hotel industry than in other service industries.</p><p>D. It can only be beneficial if the customer is not aware of the original failure.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>Whether or not you can deliberately dissatisfied the users with regard to the questions raised by the students, and then take a remedial plan to make them more satisfied. The professor responded: The program should not be adopted to attract customers and even serve as a way to increase user loyalty, so the A option is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What point does the professor make when she mentions a fast-food restaurant?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Service failures should be analyzed from the service provider's perspective.</p><p>B. A customer's reaction to a service failure can vary under different circumstances.</p><p>C. It is important for service managers to identify the source of a service failure.</p><p>D. Some service industries are more vulnerable than others to service failures.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>According to the original People's expectation, their priorities vary. Then the professor continues to give examples. For example, she was in a hurry. At this time, the fries she ordered at the fast food restaurant were not hot enough. She might not get complaints because she soon got food but she did not complain. She is not in a hurry at this time, she may return the fries, even if it means, she still needs to wait for some time. Therefore, the B option is correct, and each customer's response to the same service failure is not the same.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor say this:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To review the main points of the lecture</p><p>B. To suggest topics for the students' next research assignment</p><p>C. To indicate possible reasons why negative word of mouth is damaging to businesses</p><p>D. To specify where research is needed to better understand service recovery</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>It can be seen that the professor said that the purpose of that paragraph was to concretize the research that should be conducted. So the D option is correct.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
