            <span class="time" data-times="4.1" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in a marketing class.<span class="time" data-times="7.26" data-time="4.1">[00:04.10]</span>And that wraps up our discussion of how the <span class="highlight">retail</span> sector, uh, ways in which <span class="highlight">retail</span> managers <span class="highlight">deal</span> with customer complaints. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="10.71" data-time="11.36">[00:11.36]</span>So let's <span class="highlight">shift</span> now to the service sector, which markets not goods but services, intangibles like <span class="highlight">transportation</span>, food service, <span class="highlight">career</span> <span class="highlight">counseling</span>.... <span class="time" data-times="3.03" data-time="22.07">[00:22.07]</span>Oh, there are <span class="highlight">literally</span> hundreds of examples.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.26" data-time="25.1">[00:25.10]</span>Service providers must, of <span class="highlight">course</span>, <span class="highlight">constantly</span> <span class="highlight">strive</span> to meet customers' needs. <span class="time" data-times="9.83" data-time="30.36">[00:30.36]</span>But as in <span class="highlight">retail</span>, there are instances of service failure in which the customer is dissatisfied, uh, perhaps to the point of not doing business with you anymore.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="8.12" data-time="40.19">[00:40.19]</span>Some service failures are beyond an <span class="highlight">organization</span>'s control, like, uh, computer malfunction that leads to missed deadlines. <span class="time" data-times="6.09" data-time="48.31">[00:48.31]</span>Other failures <span class="highlight">stem</span> from <span class="highlight">process</span> problems, like inadequate training for newly-hired employees.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.16" data-time="54.4">[00:54.40]</span>Then there's human error. <span class="time" data-times="6.11" data-time="56.56">[00:56.56]</span>Okay, imagine you <span class="highlight">manage</span> a car <span class="highlight">rental</span> <span class="highlight">agency</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.72" data-time="62.67">[01:02.67]</span>A customer calls in a <span class="highlight">reservation</span>, but your employee marks down the wrong <span class="highlight">date</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.35" data-time="68.39">[01:08.39]</span>So your customer arrives and guess what, the size car he reserved isn't <span class="highlight">available</span>. <span class="time" data-times="11.7" data-time="74.74">[01:14.74]</span>But your customer is less concerned about the <span class="highlight">source</span> of the failure than the solution: what you do about it; what <span class="highlight">sort</span> of <span class="highlight">compensation</span>; what service recovery you give.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="7.29" data-time="86.44">[01:26.44]</span>So if you are in the service <span class="highlight">industry</span>, as a marketer, you always need some kind of service recovery plan. <span class="time" data-times="11.12" data-time="93.73">[01:33.73]</span>Your plan must be in place before a failure occurs and it must also be communicated <span class="highlight">promptly</span> to everyone in your <span class="highlight">organization</span> who deals with customers so they'll know what to do.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="9.55" data-time="104.85">[01:44.85]</span>Service recovery encompasses all the actions taken to get a disappointed customer back to, uh, well, back to a <span class="highlight">state</span> of satisfaction. <span class="time" data-times="9.69" data-time="114.4">[01:54.40]</span>So if your car <span class="highlight">rental</span> <span class="highlight">agency</span> couldn't provide the size car your customer <span class="highlight">wanted</span>, but your <span class="highlight">policy</span> is to provide a roomier car for the same price. <span class="time" data-times="5.48" data-time="124.09">[02:04.09]</span>Your customer would probably be happy, might <span class="highlight">even</span> <span class="highlight">restore</span> his faith in your <span class="highlight">company</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.15" data-time="129.57">[02:09.57]</span>Research has in fact identified service recovery as a <span class="highlight">significant</span> <span class="highlight">determinant</span> of customer loyalty.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.9" data-time="137.72">[02:17.72]</span>Student:I see what you mean. <span class="time" data-times="3.3" data-time="139.62">[02:19.62]</span>Every year, my family goes on <span class="highlight">vacation</span> together. <span class="time" data-times="4.25" data-time="142.92">[02:22.92]</span>And a few summers ago, when we were in Chicago, it was really really hot. <span class="time" data-times="5.1" data-time="147.17">[02:27.17]</span>And guess what, the hotel's <span class="highlight">air</span> conditioning broke and everyone was complaining. <span class="time" data-times="4.2" data-time="152.27">[02:32.27]</span>What the hotel did...they actually didn't charge anybody for that weekend. <span class="time" data-times="10.53" data-time="156.47">[02:36.47]</span>But the funny thing is that <span class="highlight">even</span> though we had that horrible experience at that hotel, because they were so quick to appease us, we usually stay at that same hotel every time we go to Chicago.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.88" data-time="167">[02:47.00]</span>Professor:Great example! <span class="time" data-times="9.18" data-time="168.88">[02:48.88]</span>So in this case that hotel <span class="highlight">chain</span> might <span class="highlight">consider</span> itself the beneficiary of the so-called service recovery paradox. <span class="time" data-times="15.88" data-time="178.06">[02:58.06]</span>Um, the paradox basically implies that customers who experience a service failure, well, they could potentially be made more <span class="highlight">loyal</span> than customers who were satisfied in the first place if an <span class="highlight">equitable</span> recovery occurred after the failure.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.69" data-time="193.94">[03:13.94]</span>Yes, Ben?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.42" data-time="195.63">[03:15.63]</span>Student:Wait a <span class="highlight">minute</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9.97" data-time="197.05">[03:17.05]</span>If a good service recovery creates more loyalty than, um, if things went <span class="highlight">smoothly</span> from the get-go, why don't companies like make mistakes on purpose so?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="7.12" data-time="207.02">[03:27.02]</span>Professor:So you could <span class="highlight">implement</span> a recovery plan that leave your customers <span class="highlight">delighted</span> as <span class="highlight">opposed</span> to merely satisfied?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="11.53" data-time="214.14">[03:34.14]</span>Look, it's always better to do things right the first time 'cause how can you know that the paradox will hold true in every situation?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="9.88" data-time="225.67">[03:45.67]</span>Plus, it's hard to <span class="highlight">predict</span> if a good service recovery will <span class="highlight">overcome</span> the <span class="highlight">negative</span> effect of a service failure, and what about all those failures that never come to your <span class="highlight">attention</span>? <span class="time" data-times="8.63" data-time="235.55">[03:55.55]</span>Because statistically about 50 percent of the customers don't <span class="highlight">complain</span> about service failures, at <span class="highlight">least</span> not to the service provider. <span class="time" data-times="5.53" data-time="244.18">[04:04.18]</span>But <span class="highlight">negative</span> word of mouth, now, that got worse implications for your business.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.49" data-time="249.71">[04:09.71]</span>Also, you'd have to <span class="highlight">pay</span> your employees to <span class="highlight">execute</span> the service a <span class="highlight">second</span> time. <span class="time" data-times="4.85" data-time="255.2">[04:15.20]</span>Typically, a service recovery is <span class="highlight">gonna</span> <span class="highlight">involve</span> some kind of <span class="highlight">compensation</span>, right? <span class="time" data-times="5.13" data-time="260.05">[04:20.05]</span>So it is <span class="highlight">gonna</span> <span class="highlight">cost</span> your <span class="highlight">company</span> some money that you are going have to <span class="highlight">account</span> for in your <span class="highlight">budget</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="11.56" data-time="265.18">[04:25.18]</span>I've actually been researching some of these issues myself 'cause what we need is a deeper understanding of customers' thought processes and their reactions to service recoveries. <span class="time" data-times="2.39" data-time="276.74">[04:36.74]</span>How do consumers form expectations? <span class="time" data-times="3.09" data-time="279.13">[04:39.13]</span>How do they react to different service recovery tactics? <span class="time" data-times="4.73" data-time="282.22">[04:42.22]</span>Can we <span class="highlight">predict</span> how any <span class="highlight">given</span> customer will react to a <span class="highlight">given</span> service failure?</p>

              <p>Professor at the beginning briefly listed several failure cases, such as miss deadlines, process problems, human error, and according to the original So, if you are in a service industry, as a marketer you always need some kind of service recovery plan.

              <p>The professor used a car rental agency as an example to illustrate how the customer made an appointment but the employee remembered the wrong date.

              <p>The student took an example of his own. In the summer, the air conditioning system of the hotel where he and his family went to take a vacation in Chicago broke down. The hotel's countermeasures were that air conditioning was not charged for the entire weekend, so even if the students felt that their living experience was not satisfactory, But because the hotel quickly appeased everyone's dissatisfaction, he chose this hotel every time he went to Chicago. This is a case where a very successful service fails but quickly remedies success. So the B option is correct.</p>

            </p>
            <div class="explanation">
              <p>According to the original People's expectation, their priorities vary. Then the professor continues to give examples. For example, she was in a hurry. At this time, the fries she ordered at the fast food restaurant were not hot enough. She might not get complaints because she soon got food but she did not complain. She is not in a hurry at this time, she may return the fries, even if it means, she still needs to wait for some time. Therefore, the B option is correct, and each customer's response to the same service failure is not the same.</p>

              <span>A. To review the main points of the lecture</span>
              <input name="radio" type="radio" />

            </p>
            <div class="explanation">
              <p>It can be seen that the professor said that the purpose of that paragraph was to concretize the research that should be conducted. So the D option is correct.</p>
