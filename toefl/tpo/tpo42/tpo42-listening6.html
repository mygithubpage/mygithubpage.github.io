            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.1" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in a marketing class.<span class="time" data-times="7.26" data-time="4.1">[00:04.10]</span>And that wraps up our discussion of how the <span class="underline">retail</span> sector, uh, ways in which <span class="underline">retail</span> managers <span class="underline">deal</span> with customer complaints. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.71" data-time="11.36">[00:11.36]</span>So let's <span class="underline">shift</span> now to the service sector, which markets not goods but services, intangibles like <span class="underline">transportation</span>, food service, <span class="underline">career</span> <span class="underline">counseling</span>.... <span class="time" data-times="3.03" data-time="22.07">[00:22.07]</span>Oh, there are <span class="underline">literally</span> hundreds of examples.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.26" data-time="25.1">[00:25.10]</span>Service providers must, of <span class="underline">course</span>, <span class="underline">constantly</span> <span class="underline">strive</span> to meet customers' needs. <span class="time" data-times="9.83" data-time="30.36">[00:30.36]</span>But as in <span class="underline">retail</span>, there are instances of service failure in which the customer is dissatisfied, uh, perhaps to the point of not doing business with you anymore.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.12" data-time="40.19">[00:40.19]</span>Some service failures are beyond an <span class="underline">organization</span>'s control, like, uh, computer malfunction that leads to missed deadlines. <span class="time" data-times="6.09" data-time="48.31">[00:48.31]</span>Other failures <span class="underline">stem</span> from <span class="underline">process</span> problems, like inadequate training for newly-hired employees.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.16" data-time="54.4">[00:54.40]</span>Then there's human error. <span class="time" data-times="6.11" data-time="56.56">[00:56.56]</span>Okay, imagine you <span class="underline">manage</span> a car <span class="underline">rental</span> <span class="underline">agency</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.72" data-time="62.67">[01:02.67]</span>A customer calls in a <span class="underline">reservation</span>, but your employee marks down the wrong <span class="underline">date</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.35" data-time="68.39">[01:08.39]</span>So your customer arrives and guess what, the size car he reserved isn't <span class="underline">available</span>. <span class="time" data-times="11.7" data-time="74.74">[01:14.74]</span>But your customer is less concerned about the <span class="underline">source</span> of the failure than the solution: what you do about it; what <span class="underline">sort</span> of <span class="underline">compensation</span>; what service recovery you give.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.29" data-time="86.44">[01:26.44]</span>So if you are in the service <span class="underline">industry</span>, as a marketer, you always need some kind of service recovery plan. <span class="time" data-times="11.12" data-time="93.73">[01:33.73]</span>Your plan must be in place before a failure occurs and it must also be communicated <span class="underline">promptly</span> to everyone in your <span class="underline">organization</span> who deals with customers so they'll know what to do.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.55" data-time="104.85">[01:44.85]</span>Service recovery encompasses all the actions taken to get a disappointed customer back to, uh, well, back to a <span class="underline">state</span> of satisfaction. <span class="time" data-times="9.69" data-time="114.4">[01:54.40]</span>So if your car <span class="underline">rental</span> <span class="underline">agency</span> couldn't provide the size car your customer <span class="underline">wanted</span>, but your <span class="underline">policy</span> is to provide a roomier car for the same price. <span class="time" data-times="5.48" data-time="124.09">[02:04.09]</span>Your customer would probably be happy, might <span class="underline">even</span> <span class="underline">restore</span> his faith in your <span class="underline">company</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.15" data-time="129.57">[02:09.57]</span>Research has in fact identified service recovery as a <span class="underline">significant</span> <span class="underline">determinant</span> of customer loyalty.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.9" data-time="137.72">[02:17.72]</span>Student:I see what you mean. <span class="time" data-times="3.3" data-time="139.62">[02:19.62]</span>Every year, my family goes on <span class="underline">vacation</span> together. <span class="time" data-times="4.25" data-time="142.92">[02:22.92]</span>And a few summers ago, when we were in Chicago, it was really really hot. <span class="time" data-times="5.1" data-time="147.17">[02:27.17]</span>And guess what, the hotel's <span class="underline">air</span> conditioning broke and everyone was complaining. <span class="time" data-times="4.2" data-time="152.27">[02:32.27]</span>What the hotel did...they actually didn't charge anybody for that weekend. <span class="time" data-times="10.53" data-time="156.47">[02:36.47]</span>But the funny thing is that <span class="underline">even</span> though we had that horrible experience at that hotel, because they were so quick to appease us, we usually stay at that same hotel every time we go to Chicago.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.88" data-time="167">[02:47.00]</span>Professor:Great example! <span class="time" data-times="9.18" data-time="168.88">[02:48.88]</span>So in this case that hotel <span class="underline">chain</span> might <span class="underline">consider</span> itself the beneficiary of the so-called service recovery paradox. <span class="time" data-times="15.88" data-time="178.06">[02:58.06]</span>Um, the paradox basically implies that customers who experience a service failure, well, they could potentially be made more <span class="underline">loyal</span> than customers who were satisfied in the first place if an <span class="underline">equitable</span> recovery occurred after the failure.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.69" data-time="193.94">[03:13.94]</span>Yes, Ben?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.42" data-time="195.63">[03:15.63]</span>Student:Wait a <span class="underline">minute</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9.97" data-time="197.05">[03:17.05]</span>If a good service recovery creates more loyalty than, um, if things went <span class="underline">smoothly</span> from the get-go, why don't companies like make mistakes on purpose so?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.12" data-time="207.02">[03:27.02]</span>Professor:So you could <span class="underline">implement</span> a recovery plan that leave your customers <span class="underline">delighted</span> as <span class="underline">opposed</span> to merely satisfied?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="11.53" data-time="214.14">[03:34.14]</span>Look, it's always better to do things right the first time 'cause how can you know that the paradox will hold true in every situation?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.88" data-time="225.67">[03:45.67]</span>Plus, it's hard to <span class="underline">predict</span> if a good service recovery will <span class="underline">overcome</span> the <span class="underline">negative</span> effect of a service failure, and what about all those failures that never come to your <span class="underline">attention</span>? <span class="time" data-times="8.63" data-time="235.55">[03:55.55]</span>Because statistically about 50 percent of the customers don't <span class="underline">complain</span> about service failures, at <span class="underline">least</span> not to the service provider. <span class="time" data-times="5.53" data-time="244.18">[04:04.18]</span>But <span class="underline">negative</span> word of mouth, now, that got worse implications for your business.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.49" data-time="249.71">[04:09.71]</span>Also, you'd have to <span class="underline">pay</span> your employees to <span class="underline">execute</span> the service a <span class="underline">second</span> time. <span class="time" data-times="4.85" data-time="255.2">[04:15.20]</span>Typically, a service recovery is <span class="underline">gonna</span> <span class="underline">involve</span> some kind of <span class="underline">compensation</span>, right? <span class="time" data-times="5.13" data-time="260.05">[04:20.05]</span>So it is <span class="underline">gonna</span> <span class="underline">cost</span> your <span class="underline">company</span> some money that you are going have to <span class="underline">account</span> for in your <span class="underline">budget</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="11.56" data-time="265.18">[04:25.18]</span>I've actually been researching some of these issues myself 'cause what we need is a deeper understanding of customers' thought processes and their reactions to service recoveries. <span class="time" data-times="2.39" data-time="276.74">[04:36.74]</span>How do consumers form expectations? <span class="time" data-times="3.09" data-time="279.13">[04:39.13]</span>How do they react to different service recovery tactics? <span class="time" data-times="4.73" data-time="282.22">[04:42.22]</span>Can we <span class="underline">predict</span> how any <span class="underline">given</span> customer will react to a <span class="underline">given</span> service failure?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.59" data-time="286.95">[04:46.95]</span>People's expectations, their priorities <span class="underline">vary</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.94" data-time="290.54">[04:50.54]</span>Like uh, if I am in a <span class="underline">hurry</span>, and the French fries I ordered at a fast food restaurant aren't piping hot. <span class="time" data-times="3.04" data-time="296.48">[04:56.48]</span>I might not <span class="underline">complain</span> 'cause I got them fast. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="299.52">[04:59.52]</span>But If I am not in a <span class="underline">hurry</span>, I might return the fries <span class="underline">even</span> if I had to wait for a fresh <span class="underline">batch</span>.</p>
