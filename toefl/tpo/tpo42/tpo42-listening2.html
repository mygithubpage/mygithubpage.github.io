              <span class="time" data-times="5.03" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in an art history class. <span class="time" data-times="10.29" data-time="5.03">[00:05.03]</span>I am sure you've all been to museum, where you've seen beautiful white <span class="underline">marble</span> statues sculpted by the Greeks and Romans, or at <span class="underline">least</span> that you've seen photos of such statues, right?<span class="time" data-times="14.39" data-time="15.32">[00:15.32]</span>We've come to <span class="underline">expect</span> these <span class="underline">classical</span> Greek and Roman statues to be monochrome, just one color, white skin, white hair, white eyes, white everything, the natural color of the <span class="underline">marble</span> they're carved from.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.55" data-time="29.71">[00:29.71]</span>Now, the <span class="underline">ideal</span> of <span class="underline">plain</span> white <span class="underline">sculpture</span> goes back to 15th <span class="underline">century</span> Europe when Renaissance artists rediscovered <span class="underline">ancient</span> Greek and Roman <span class="underline">culture</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.44" data-time="40.26">[00:40.26]</span>They were inspired by sculptures that appeared monochrome so they created white <span class="underline">marble</span> statues. <span class="time" data-times="11.64" data-time="46.7">[00:46.70]</span>The <span class="underline">impact</span> of these Renaissance statues, such as Michelangelo's David, gave rise to new standards for <span class="underline">sculpture</span>, standards that emphasized form rather than color.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.46" data-time="58.34">[00:58.34]</span>But what if many of those <span class="underline">ancient</span> statues were originally polychrome, colored from head to toe?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="14.59" data-time="64.8">[01:04.80]</span>Early in the 19th <span class="underline">century</span>, archeologists found traces of paint on <span class="underline">ancient</span> sculptures and since then, <span class="underline">classical</span> art historians have begun to realize that Greek and Roman <span class="underline">marble</span> sculptures were originally colored.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.71" data-time="79.39">[01:19.39]</span>
              <span class="underline">Even</span> if an <span class="underline">ancient</span> <span class="underline">marble</span> <span class="underline">statue</span> doesn't have any <span class="underline">visible</span> traces of paint, that does not mean it was originally monochrome.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.03" data-time="87.1">[01:27.10]</span>In many cases, the <span class="underline">pigment</span> would've <span class="underline">simply</span> deteriorated. <span class="time" data-times="8.21" data-time="91.13">[01:31.13]</span> <span class="underline">Ancient</span> artists used mineral-based paints with <span class="underline">organic</span> binding <span class="underline">media</span> that would've disintegrated on its own over time.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="12.09" data-time="99.34">[01:39.34]</span>In other cases, the <span class="underline">pigment</span> may have been weathered away while <span class="underline">exposed</span> to the elements or someone may have rigorously cleaned the statues and unknowingly removed the last traces of <span class="underline">pigment</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.05" data-time="111.43">[01:51.43]</span>So, the fact is, we do have <span class="underline">evidence</span> of polychrome sculptures from Greece and Rome from the 7th <span class="underline">century</span> B.C.E. <span class="time" data-times="4.84" data-time="119.48">[01:59.48]</span>all the way <span class="underline">through</span> at <span class="underline">least</span> the third or fourth <span class="underline">century</span> C.E. <span class="time" data-times="14.77" data-time="124.32">[02:04.32]</span>It's now generally accepted that most, maybe <span class="underline">even</span> all <span class="underline">marble</span> sculptures from that time period, receive some kind of surface treatment, like the <span class="underline">application</span> of pigments, colored stones or metals that would've modified their color.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.58" data-time="139.09">[02:19.09]</span>So do we <span class="underline">interpret</span> the <span class="underline">statue</span> differently if we had known it had originally been polychrome?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.75" data-time="144.67">[02:24.67]</span>I feel strongly when it comes to this. <span class="time" data-times="6.48" data-time="147.42">[02:27.42]</span>A <span class="underline">marble</span> <span class="underline">sculpture</span> that had been colored has another <span class="underline">layer</span> of meaning that was meant to <span class="underline">affect</span> the viewer. <span class="time" data-times="4.9" data-time="153.9">[02:33.90]</span>As art historians, we must try to <span class="underline">interpret</span> the intentions of the artists. <span class="time" data-times="3.21" data-time="158.8">[02:38.80]</span>What were the artists trying to achieve?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.94" data-time="162.01">[02:42.01]</span>Certain features of the <span class="underline">sculpture</span> were highlighted <span class="underline">through</span> color, were made to stand out. <span class="time" data-times="4.46" data-time="166.95">[02:46.95]</span>In other words, they caused the viewer to <span class="underline">focus</span> on certain features. <span class="time" data-times="4.98" data-time="171.41">[02:51.41]</span>And certain colors represented certain things to the <span class="underline">ancient</span> artists and cultures. <span class="time" data-times="5.16" data-time="176.39">[02:56.39]</span>A color might <span class="underline">symbolize</span> heroism, divinity or youth.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.04" data-time="181.55">[03:01.55]</span>One example to <span class="underline">consider</span> is the <span class="underline">statue</span> of Roman <span class="underline">emperor</span> Augustus. <span class="time" data-times="9.47" data-time="187.59">[03:07.59]</span>This <span class="underline">particular</span> <span class="underline">statue</span> of Augustus that I am referring to was discovered just outside of Rome in 1863 and was in <span class="underline">terrific</span> condition. <span class="time" data-times="4.03" data-time="197.06">[03:17.06]</span>It's about 2 meters tall, just larger than life size. <span class="time" data-times="6.97" data-time="201.09">[03:21.09]</span>It was made from an expensive high <span class="underline">quality</span> type of <span class="underline">marble</span> and was <span class="underline">obviously</span> carved by an expert.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.06" data-time="208.06">[03:28.06]</span>Now, it still had <span class="underline">visible</span> traces of color on the hair, eyes and its clothing and armor. <span class="time" data-times="2.74" data-time="215.12">[03:35.12]</span>The paints have been very carefully studied. <span class="time" data-times="3.66" data-time="217.86">[03:37.86]</span>And it turns out that the colors weren't just from any pigments. <span class="time" data-times="2.65" data-time="221.52">[03:41.52]</span>They were from expensive pigments. <span class="time" data-times="5.38" data-time="224.17">[03:44.17]</span>The use of these pigments showed the importance of Augustus and that he should be honored.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.98" data-time="229.55">[03:49.55]</span>And let's <span class="underline">consider</span> the <span class="underline">extensive</span> traces of a red <span class="underline">pigment</span> that were found on the <span class="underline">statue</span>'s cloak. <span class="time" data-times="5.13" data-time="235.53">[03:55.53]</span>The cloak is a <span class="underline">special</span> <span class="underline">garment</span> that was traditionally worn by an <span class="underline">emperor</span> on the battlefield. <span class="time" data-times="9.17" data-time="240.66">[04:00.66]</span>And in real life it was a red color, which to the Romans, signified the <span class="underline">emperor</span>'s <span class="underline">authority</span>, <span class="underline">military</span> and <span class="underline">political</span> <span class="underline">authority</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="14.62" data-time="249.83">[04:09.83]</span>Ok, I won't point out any further details about the colors on the Augustus <span class="underline">statue</span>, because you can already begin to see that there was cultural importance <span class="underline">associated</span> with the colors, symbolism, which should help us understand the <span class="underline">status</span> better.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.32" data-time="264.45">[04:24.45]</span>There are many, many more sculptures that have traces of pigments left on them and we have the technology these days to be able to carry out <span class="underline">effective</span> studies of these pigments. <span class="time" data-times="3.99" data-time="274.77">[04:34.77]</span>There is a lot of work to be done, but it needs to be done fast. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="278.76">[04:38.76]</span>Like I said before, these pigments <span class="underline">deteriorate</span> rapidly so we really need to do the research before the traces are gone so that we can increase our understanding of <span class="underline">ancient</span> polychrome sculptures and the cultures which created them.</p>
