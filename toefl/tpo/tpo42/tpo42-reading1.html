A <span class="highlight question1">key</span> event in the <span class="highlight">origin</span> of many <span class="highlight">species</span> is the separation of a <span class="highlight">population</span> with its <span class="highlight">gene</span> pool (all of the genes in a <span class="highlight">population</span> at any one time) from other populations of the same <span class="highlight">species</span>, <span class="highlight">thereby</span> preventing <span class="highlight">population</span> interbreeding. With its <span class="highlight">gene</span> pool <span class="highlight">isolated</span>, a <span class="highlight">separate</span><span class="highlight">population</span> can follow its own <span class="highlight">evolutionary</span><span class="highlight">course</span>. In the <span class="highlight">formation</span> of many <span class="highlight">species</span>, the <span class="highlight"><span class="question2">initial</span></span> isolation of a <span class="highlight">population</span> seems to have been a geographic <span class="highlight">barrier</span>. This <span class="highlight">mode</span> of evolving new <span class="highlight">species</span> is called allopatric <span class="highlight">speciation</span>.</p><p>Many factors can <span class="highlight">isolate</span> a <span class="highlight">population</span> geographically. A mountain <span class="highlight">range</span> may <span class="highlight">emerge</span> and <span class="highlight">gradually</span><span class="highlight">split</span> a <span class="highlight">population</span> of organisms that can <span class="highlight">inhabit</span> only <span class="highlight">lowland</span> lakes, certain fish populations might become <span class="highlight">isolated</span> in this way. Similarly, a creeping <span class="highlight">glacier</span> may <span class="highlight">gradually</span> divide a <span class="highlight">population</span>, or a land bridge such as the Isthmus of Panama may form and <span class="highlight">separate</span> the <span class="highlight">marine</span> life in the ocean waters on either side.</p><p>How <span class="highlight">formidable</span> must a geographic <span class="highlight">barrier</span> be to keep populations apart? It depends on the <span class="highlight">ability</span> of the organisms to move <span class="highlight">across</span> barriers. Birds and coyotes can easily cross mountains and rivers. The <span class="highlight">passage</span> of wind-blown tree <span class="highlight">pollen</span> is also not hindered by such barriers, and the seeds of many plants may be carried back and forth on animals. In <span class="highlight">contrast</span>, small rodents may find a deep <span class="highlight">canyon</span> or a wide river an <span class="highlight">effective</span><span class="highlight">barrier</span>. For example, the Grand <span class="highlight">Canyon</span>, in the southwestern United States, <span class="highlight">separate</span> the <span class="highlight">range</span> of the while-tailed <span class="highlight">antelope</span><span class="highlight">squirrel</span> from that of the closely related Harris' <span class="highlight">antelope</span><span class="highlight">squirrel</span>. Smaller, with a shorter tail that is white <span class="highlight">underneath</span>, the white-tailed <span class="highlight">antelope</span><span class="highlight">squirrel</span> inhabits deserts north of the <span class="highlight">canyon</span> and west of the Colorado River in southern California. Harris' <span class="highlight">antelope</span><span class="highlight">squirrel</span> has a more limited <span class="highlight">range</span> in deserts south of the Grand <span class="highlight">Canyon</span>.</p><p><span class="question8">Geographic isolation creates opportunities for new <span class="highlight">species</span> to develop, but it does not necessarily <span class="highlight">lead</span> to new <span class="highlight">species</span> because <span class="highlight">speciation</span> occurs only when the <span class="highlight">gene</span> pool <span class="question7">undergoes</span> enough changes to <span class="highlight">establish</span><span class="highlight">reproductive</span> barriers between the <span class="highlight">isolated</span><span class="highlight">population</span> and its parent <span class="highlight">population</span>.</span> The likelihood of allopatric <span class="highlight">speciation</span> increases when a <span class="highlight">population</span> is small as well as <span class="highlight">isolated</span>, making it more likely than a large <span class="highlight">population</span> to have its <span class="highlight">gene</span> pool changed <span class="highlight">substantially</span>. For example, in less than two million years, small populations of stray animals and plants from the South American mainland that <span class="question10">managed</span> to <span class="highlight">colonize</span> the Galapagos Islands gave rise to all the <span class="highlight">species</span> that now <span class="highlight">inhabit</span> the islands.</p><p>When <span class="highlight">oceanic</span> islands are far enough apart to <span class="highlight">permit</span> populations to <span class="highlight">evolve</span> in isolation, but close enough to allow <span class="highlight">occasional</span> dispersions to <span class="highlight">occur</span>, they are effectively outdoor laboratories of <span class="highlight">evolution</span>. The Galapagos island <span class="highlight">chain</span> is <span class="question11">one of the world's greatest showcases of <span class="highlight">evolution</span>.</span> Each island was born from underwater volcanoes and was <span class="highlight">gradually</span> covered by organisms derived from strays that rode the ocean currents and winds from other islands and continents. Organisms can also be carried to islands by other organisms, such as sea birds that travel long distances with seeds clinging to their feathers.</p><p>The <span class="highlight">species</span> on the Galapagos Islands today, most of which <span class="highlight">occur</span> nowhere else, descended from organisms that floated, flew, or were blown over the sea from the South American mainland. For <span class="highlight">instance</span>, the Galapagos island <span class="highlight">chain</span> has a total of thirteen <span class="highlight">species</span> of closely related birds called Galapagos finches. These birds have many similarities but differ in their feeding habits and their <span class="highlight">beak</span> type, which is correlated with what they eat. Accumulated <span class="highlight">evidence</span> indicates that all thirteen <span class="highlight">finch</span><span class="highlight">species</span> evolved from a single small <span class="highlight">population</span> of ancestral birds that colonized one of the islands. Completely <span class="highlight">isolated</span> on the island after migrating from the mainland, the founder <span class="highlight">population</span> may have undergone <span class="highlight">significant</span> changes in its <span class="highlight">gene</span> pool and become a new <span class="highlight">species</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>Later, a few individuals of this new <span class="highlight">species</span> may have been blown by storms to a neighboring island. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span><span class="highlight">Isolated</span> on this <span class="highlight">second</span> island, the <span class="highlight">second</span> founder <span class="highlight">population</span> could have evolved into a <span class="highlight">second</span> new <span class="highlight">species</span>, which could later recolonize the island from which its <span class="highlight">founding</span><span class="highlight">population</span> emigrated. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>Today each Galapagos island has <span class="highlight">multiple</span><span class="highlight">species</span> of finches, with as many as ten on some islands. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">key</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. early</p><p>B. crucial</p><p>C. noticeable</p><p>D. frequent</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Key, key.</p><p>Early, early.

This mode of evolving new species is called allopatric speciation. Where has been a geographic barrier corresponds to the presence of a geographic barrier in the B option. The B option is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>How is paragraph 2 related to paragraph 1?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Paragraph 2 points out a number of ways in which the phenomenon of geographic isolation mentioned in paragraph 1 can occur</p><p>B. Paragraph 2 identifies discoveries that led to the conclusion presented in paragraph 1 that geographic isolation has played a rote in the origin of many species</p><p>C. Paragraph 2 provides evidence supporting the statement in paragraph 1 that a population can follow its own evolutionary course once its gene pool becomes isolated</p><p>D. Paragraph 2 explains why the term "allopatric" was adopted to describe the method of speciation described in paragraph 1</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>According to the first sentence of the second paragraph Many factors can be isolated a population geographically. It can be seen that the entire contents of the next paragraph will focus on the factors or approaches that can cause alienation. The mountain range, creeping glacier, and land bridge listed later are all further explanations. So the A option is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>In paragraph 3, the author contrasts a variety of organisms to illustrate which of the following points?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Geographic barriers are less likely to keep apart populations of plants than populations of animals.</p><p>B. Geographic barriers are more likely to keep apart populations of large organisms than populations of small organisms</p><p>C.

The effectiveness of geographic barriers in keeping organisms apart depends on an organism's ability to move across barriers.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>How formidable must a geographic barrier be to keep populations apart? It depends on the ability of the organisms to move across barriers. How formidable must a geographical barrier be to keep populations apart corresponds to the effectiveness of the D option. The geographic barriers in keeping organisms apart. So the D option is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Paragraph 3 supports the idea that white-tailed antelope squirrels and Harris' antelope squirrels have which of the following in common?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They are the two smallest rodents now found in the southwestern United States.</p><p>B. They have white coloring underneath their tails</p><p>C. They cannot cross the Grand Canyon</p><p>D. They cannot survive in desert conditions</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>According to the white-tailed antelope squirrels, the Grand Canyon, in the southwestern United States, separate the range of the while-tailed antelope squirrel from that of the closely related Harris' antelope squirrel. The tail antelope squirrel and the Harris antelope squirrel are isolated, so the C option is correct. The common feature of the two antelope squirrels is their inability to cross the Grand Canyon.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question7">undergoes</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. experiences</p><p>B. allows</p><p>C. prevents</p><p>D. causes</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" A"><p>Undergoes, experience, endure.</p><p>Experiences, experience. Allows, allow. Prevents, stop. Cause, cause. So the A option is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Geographic isolation is sometimes but not always the reason for the creation of reproductive barriers between a parent population and the populations descended from it</p><p>B. Genetic changes in a geographical isolated population do not necessarily make the population look different enough from its parent population to be considered a new species</p><p>C. Geographical isolation allows the separated populations to evolve independently of each other and so can lead to the formation of new species</p><p>D. Geographic isolation can lead to new species only if the gene pool of the isolated population changes enough to prevent it from reproducing with the parent population</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>Pay attention to the transitions and causality in the sentence. The main body of the sentence appears behind the turn, and pay attention to what follows only. The implication is that geographical isolation will produce new species only when the isolated gene pool changes enough to prevent them and the parent population from multiplying. So the D option is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, why does the size of a population affect the likelihood of allopatric speciation?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Because smaller populations are more likely than larger ones to become geographically isolated</p><p>B. Because the gene pool of a small isolated population is more likely to undergo substantial change than is the gene pool of a larger population</p><p>C. Because a isolated population can become a new species with substantially less change to its gene pool than would be required by a larger population</p><p>D. Because smaller populations are more likely to be made up of stray animals or plants than larger populations are</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>According to the similarity of the likelihood of allopatric speciation increases when a population is small as well as isolated, making it more likely than a large population to have its gene pool changed substantially. Note the comparative relationship, and where its its gene pool Changed substantially corresponds to the undergo substantial change in the B option. So the B option is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question10">managed</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. were able</p><p>B. were forced</p><p>C. arrived</p><p>D. expanded</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" A"><p>Managed, <span class="question10">managed</span> to finish.</p><p>Were able, can. Were forced, forced. Arrived, arriving. Expanded, expanded. So the A option is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Paragraph 5 supports the idea that the Galapagos island chain was able to become "one of the world's greatest showcases of evolution" primarily because of</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. the richness of the volcanic soil of each of the islands in the chain</p><p>B. the distance of the individual islands from each other and from the mainland</p><p>C. the relativity long time it took for the islands to become covered by organisms</p><p>D. the outdoor laboratories that scientists have built on the islands to study evolution</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>According to "one of the world's greatest showcases of evolution", the words before oceanic islands are far enough apart to permit populations to evolve in isolation, but close enough to allow occasional dispersions to occur, they are aplastic outdoor laboratories of evolution. It can be seen that the distance between the islands and the distance to the land perfectly explain evolution. So the B option is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 6, what is true about the thirteen species of Galapagos finches?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. All thirteen species are now found on most of the Galapagos Islands</p><p>B. All thirteen species are descended from the same population of ancestral birds</p><p>C. All thirteen species evolved on the island that was originally colonized by finches from the mainland.</p><p>D. All thirteen species occur only in small, completely isolated populations.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>According to the thirteen species, the Accumulated evidence indicates that all thirteen finch species evolved from a single small population of ancestral birds that colonized one of the islands. Where a single small population of ancestral birds corresponds to the same population of ancestral birds in the B option. So the B option is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>This process of speciation and colonization could have been repeated over and over again, gradually involving all the islands in the chain..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>According to the sentence before the sentence to be inserted, Many explanations have been proposed for why dinosaurs was extinct. Many explanations have been given on why the dinosaurs would become extinct. The sentence to be inserted means that some explanations do not appear to be credible until after some facts have been considered, in accordance with the context. So the C option is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question14" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>An introductory sentence for a brief summary of the passage is provided below. Complete the summary by selecting the THREE answer choices that express the most important ideas in the passage. Some sentences do not belong in the summary because they express ideas that are not presented in the passage or are minor ideas in the passage. The geographic isolation of a population can result in the rise of a new species.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.Isolation can result when a geographic barrier forms and splits a population or when a few organisms somehow get carried across an existing geographic barrier and form a new population</p><p>B.Speciation is more likely when an isolated population is small because significant genetic changes are more likely to occur in a small population than in a large one</p><p>C.Because of the geographic isolation of the Galapagos Islands, the species that now inhabit them have gene pools that have not changed very much since the islands were first populated.</p><p>D.Fish populations are more easily isolated by geographic barriers than are populations of most other organisms because fish cannot move across areas where there is no water.</p><p>E.The Galapagos Islands are well situated for speciation because they provide opportunities for population isolation while also making occasional dispersions between islands possible.</p><p>F.Evidence indicates that the first organisms to reach the Galapagos Islands were probably a small population of finches that, in less than two million years of isolation, evolved into thirteen species.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="ABE"><p>The full text is talking about the isolation that occurs when the formation of geographical barriers separates a population, or when some organisms form new populations across geographical barriers. So the A option is correct.</p><p>According to the original The likelihood of allopatric speciation increases when a population is small as well as isolated, making it more likely than a large population to have its gene pool changed substantially.</p><p>According to the original Complete on the island after migrating from the mainland, the founder population may have undergone significant changes in its gene pool and become new species. It can be seen that the creatures on Galapagos Island have undergone many changes, not in the C option. Have not changed very much, so the C option is wrong.</p><p>According to the original A mountain range may emerge and gradually split a population of organisms that can inhabit only lowland lakes, certain fish populations might become isolated in this way, the paper does not mention that fish are easily isolated by geographical barriers, nor does it mention whether Without water, you cannot cross this area. So the D option is wrong.</p><p>Based on when oceanic islands are far enough apart to permit populations to evolve in isolation, but close enough to allow occasional dispersions to occur, they are effectable outdoor laboratories of evolution. So the E option is correct.</p><p>According to the original Accumulated evidence indicating that all thirteen finch species evolved from a single small population of ancestral birds that colonized one of the islands. It can be seen that the ancestral birds in the original text are not the finches in the F option, so the F option is wrong.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
