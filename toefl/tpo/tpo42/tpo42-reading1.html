          <h4 class="w3-center">Geographic Isolation Of Species</h4>
          <p>Biologist Ernst Mayr defined a <span class="highlight">species</span> as "an actually or potentially interbreeding <span class="highlight">population</span> that does not interbreed with other such populations when there is <span class="highlight">opportunity</span> to do so." A <span class="highlight question1">key</span> event in the <span class="highlight">origin</span> of many <span class="highlight">species</span> is the separation of a <span class="highlight">population</span> with its <span class="highlight">gene</span> pool (all of the genes in a <span class="highlight">population</span> at any one time) from other populations of the same <span class="highlight">species</span>, <span class="highlight">thereby</span> preventing <span class="highlight">population</span> interbreeding. With its <span class="highlight">gene</span> pool <span class="highlight">isolated</span>, a <span class="highlight">separate</span> <span class="highlight">population</span> can follow its own <span class="highlight">evolutionary</span> <span class="highlight">course</span>. In the <span class="highlight">formation</span> of many <span class="highlight">species</span>, the <span class="highlight"><span class="question2">initial</span></span> isolation of a <span class="highlight">population</span> seems to have been a geographic <span class="highlight">barrier</span>. This <span class="highlight">mode</span> of evolving new <span class="highlight">species</span> is called allopatric <span class="highlight">speciation</span>.</p>
          <p>Many factors can <span class="highlight">isolate</span> a <span class="highlight">population</span> geographically. A mountain <span class="highlight">range</span> may <span class="highlight">emerge</span> and <span class="highlight">gradually</span> <span class="highlight">split</span> a <span class="highlight">population</span> of organisms that can <span class="highlight">inhabit</span> only <span class="highlight">lowland</span> lakes, certain fish populations might become <span class="highlight">isolated</span> in this way. Similarly, a creeping <span class="highlight">glacier</span> may <span class="highlight">gradually</span> divide a <span class="highlight">population</span>, or a land bridge such as the Isthmus of Panama may form and <span class="highlight">separate</span> the <span class="highlight">marine</span> life in the ocean waters on either side.</p>
          <p>How <span class="highlight">formidable</span> must a geographic <span class="highlight">barrier</span> be to keep populations apart? It depends on the <span class="highlight">ability</span> of the organisms to move <span class="highlight">across</span> barriers. Birds and coyotes can easily cross mountains and rivers. The <span class="highlight">passage</span> of wind-blown tree <span class="highlight">pollen</span> is also not hindered by such barriers, and the seeds of many plants may be carried back and forth on animals. In <span class="highlight">contrast</span>, small rodents may find a deep <span class="highlight">canyon</span> or a wide river an <span class="highlight">effective</span> <span class="highlight">barrier</span>. For example, the Grand <span class="highlight">Canyon</span>, in the southwestern United States, <span class="highlight">separate</span> the <span class="highlight">range</span> of the while-tailed <span class="highlight">antelope</span> <span class="highlight">squirrel</span> from that of the closely related Harris' <span class="highlight">antelope</span> <span class="highlight">squirrel</span>. Smaller, with a shorter tail that is white <span class="highlight">underneath</span>, the white-tailed <span class="highlight">antelope</span> <span class="highlight">squirrel</span> inhabits deserts north of the <span class="highlight">canyon</span> and west of the Colorado River in southern California. Harris' <span class="highlight">antelope</span> <span class="highlight">squirrel</span> has a more limited <span class="highlight">range</span> in deserts south of the Grand <span class="highlight">Canyon</span>.</p>
          <p><span class="question8">Geographic isolation creates opportunities for new <span class="highlight">species</span> to develop, but it does not necessarily <span class="highlight">lead</span> to new <span class="highlight">species</span> because <span class="highlight">speciation</span> occurs only when the <span class="highlight">gene</span> pool <span class="question7">undergoes</span> enough changes to <span class="highlight">establish</span> <span class="highlight">reproductive</span> barriers between the <span class="highlight">isolated</span> <span class="highlight">population</span> and its parent <span class="highlight">population</span>.</span> The likelihood of allopatric <span class="highlight">speciation</span> increases when a <span class="highlight">population</span> is small as well as <span class="highlight">isolated</span>, making it more likely than a large <span class="highlight">population</span> to have its <span class="highlight">gene</span> pool changed <span class="highlight">substantially</span>. For example, in less than two million years, small populations of stray animals and plants from the South American mainland that <span class="question10">managed</span> to <span class="highlight">colonize</span> the Galapagos Islands gave rise to all the <span class="highlight">species</span> that now <span class="highlight">inhabit</span> the islands.</p>
          <p>When <span class="highlight">oceanic</span> islands are far enough apart to <span class="highlight">permit</span> populations to <span class="highlight">evolve</span> in isolation, but close enough to allow <span class="highlight">occasional</span> dispersions to <span class="highlight">occur</span>, they are effectively outdoor laboratories of <span class="highlight">evolution</span>. The Galapagos island <span class="highlight">chain</span> is <span class="question11">one of the world's greatest showcases of <span class="highlight">evolution</span>.</span> Each island was born from underwater volcanoes and was <span class="highlight">gradually</span> covered by organisms derived from strays that rode the ocean currents and winds from other islands and continents. Organisms can also be carried to islands by other organisms, such as sea birds that travel long distances with seeds clinging to their feathers.</p>
          <p>The <span class="highlight">species</span> on the Galapagos Islands today, most of which <span class="highlight">occur</span> nowhere else, descended from organisms that floated, flew, or were blown over the sea from the South American mainland. For <span class="highlight">instance</span>, the Galapagos island <span class="highlight">chain</span> has a total of thirteen <span class="highlight">species</span> of closely related birds called Galapagos finches. These birds have many similarities but differ in their feeding habits and their <span class="highlight">beak</span> type, which is correlated with what they eat. Accumulated <span class="highlight">evidence</span> indicates that all thirteen <span class="highlight">finch</span> <span class="highlight">species</span> evolved from a single small <span class="highlight">population</span> of ancestral birds that colonized one of the islands. Completely <span class="highlight">isolated</span> on the island after migrating from the mainland, the founder <span class="highlight">population</span> may have undergone <span class="highlight">significant</span> changes in its <span class="highlight">gene</span> pool and become a new <span class="highlight">species</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>Later, a few individuals of this new <span class="highlight">species</span> may have been blown by storms to a neighboring island. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> <span class="highlight">Isolated</span> on this <span class="highlight">second</span> island, the <span class="highlight">second</span> founder <span class="highlight">population</span> could have evolved into a <span class="highlight">second</span> new <span class="highlight">species</span>, which could later recolonize the island from which its <span class="highlight">founding</span> <span class="highlight">population</span> emigrated. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>Today each Galapagos island has <span class="highlight">multiple</span> <span class="highlight">species</span> of finches, with as many as ten on some islands. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p>

              <p>The full text is talking about the isolation that occurs when the formation of geographical barriers separates a population, or when some organisms form new populations across geographical barriers. So the A option is correct.</p>
              <p>According to the original The likelihood of allopatric speciation increases when a population is small as well as isolated, making it more likely than a large population to have its gene pool changed substantially.</p>
              <p>According to the original Complete on the island after migrating from the mainland, the founder population may have undergone significant changes in its gene pool and become new species. It can be seen that the creatures on Galapagos Island have undergone many changes, not in the C option. Have not changed very much, so the C option is wrong.</p>
              <p>According to the original A mountain range may emerge and gradually split a population of organisms that can inhabit only lowland lakes, certain fish populations might become isolated in this way, the paper does not mention that fish are easily isolated by geographical barriers, nor does it mention whether Without water, you cannot cross this area. So the D option is wrong.</p>
              <p>Based on when oceanic islands are far enough apart to permit populations to evolve in isolation, but close enough to allow occasional dispersions to occur, they are effectable outdoor laboratories of evolution. So the E option is correct.</p>
              <p>According to the original Accumulated evidence indicating that all thirteen finch species evolved from a single small population of ancestral birds that colonized one of the islands. It can be seen that the ancestral birds in the original text are not the finches in the F option, so the F option is wrong.</p>
