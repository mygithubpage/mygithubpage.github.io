According to a university administrator, the decision was prompted by a steady decline in enrollments in evening classes. "Evening classes are just too small," the administrator said. When asked to explain the decline in enrollments, the administrator pointed to the fact that most evening classes are taught by teaching assistants, who are usually graduate students. "Surveys show that students prefer to take classes taught by experienced faculty members," the spokesperson said, "probably because they simply know more than graduate teaching assistants do."</p></article><div><audio src="tpo42-speaking3.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></div><article id="listening-passage" class="passage"><h3>Listening Text</h3><p>Now listen to two students discussing the article.</p><p>Man:I just don't know about this decision.</p><p>Woman:It sort of makes sense to me.</p><p>Man:Not to me. I don't understand their reasoning. I mean, what's wrong with small classes? I think that's what students actually prefer. And it's easy to see why.</p><p>Woman:Yeah. You do get to participate more.</p><p>Man:Definitely. You can be more actively involved, get more attention and support. It's just a better way to learn.</p><p>Woman:Okay. But there is that survey.</p><p>Man:I don't know what students they asked, but I know a lot of people who feel just the opposite. I mean, what does experience mean anyway? Sometimes it means you have been teaching the same subject for twenty years and you are probably tired of it by now and maybe not very enthusiastic.</p><p>Woman:Yeah. That does happen.</p><p>Man:Whereas if it's the first time or maybe second you are teaching a class, well, it's going to be more exciting to you. And you are going to communicate that excitement to the people you are teaching. At least that's how I see it.</p></article><section id="question"><h4>Question</h4><p>The man disagrees with the decision announced in the student newspaper. Explain why the university made the decision and why the man disagrees with it. </p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>The school has implemented a new policy that the university will stop offering evening classes in many departments starting next fall due to the small scale of them and the unexperienced teaching staff. And the man holds a negative view towards the announcement. The first reason he gives is that thanks to the small classes, students can participate more and be more actively involved, get more attention and learn more. And the second one is based on the fact that some experienced teachers are lack of enthusiasm because they may have been teaching the same subject for too long. In contrast, if this is their first or second time teaching a class, it's going to be so exciting to them and they'll definitely dedicate more. Therefore, he disagrees with that opinion.</p></article></div></main></body></html>
