          <h4 class="w3-center">No More Evening Classes</h4>
          <p>The administration has announced that starting next fall, the university will stop offering evening classes in many departments. According to a university administrator, the decision was prompted by a steady decline in enrollments in evening classes. "Evening classes are just too small," the administrator said. When asked to explain the decline in enrollments, the administrator pointed to the fact that most evening classes are taught by teaching assistants, who are usually graduate students. "Surveys show that students prefer to take classes taught by experienced faculty members," the spokesperson said, "probably because they simply know more than graduate teaching assistants do."</p>

          <p>Now listen to two students discussing the article.</p>
          <p>Man: I just don't know about this decision.</p>
          <p>Woman: It's sort of make sense to me.</p>
          <p>Man: Not to me.Â I don't understand the reasoning.Â I mean what's wrong with more classes.Â I think that's what students actually prefer.Â And it's easy to see why.</p>
          <p>Woman: Yeah.Â You do get to participate more.</p>
          <p>Man: Definitely.Â You can be more actively involved, get more attention and support.Â It's just a better way to learn.</p>
          <p>Woman: Ok.Â But there is that survey.</p>
          <p>Man: I don't know what students they ask, but I don't a lot of people who feel just the opposite.Â I mean what does experienced mean anyway?Â Sometimes it means you've been teach the same subject for 20 years and you are probably tired of it by now, maybe not very enthusiastic.</p>
          <p>Woman: Yeah, that does happen.</p>
          <p>Man: Whereas if it's the first time or maybe second you're teaching class, well, it's going to be more exciting to you.Â And you're going to communicate that excitement to the people you're teaching.Â At least, that's how I see it.</p>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>The school has implemented a new policy that the university will stop offering evening classes in many departments starting next fall due to the small scale of them and the unexperienced teaching staff. And the man holds a negative view towards the announcement. The first reason he gives is that thanks to the small classes, students can participate more and be more actively involved, get more attention and learn more. And the second one is based on the fact that some experienced teachers are lack of enthusiasm because they may have been teaching the same subject for too long. In contrast, if this is their first or second time teaching a class, it's going to be so exciting to them and they'll definitely dedicate more. Therefore, he disagrees with that opinion.</p>
