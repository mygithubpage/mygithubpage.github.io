            <span class="time" data-times="4.03" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in an <span class="highlight">astronomy</span> class. <span class="time" data-times="8.54" data-time="4.03">[00:04.03]</span>Before we continue talking about the properties of <span class="highlight">individual</span> galaxies, it's <span class="highlight">worth</span> talking about the <span class="highlight">distribution</span> of galaxies in <span class="highlight">space</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.88" data-time="12.57">[00:12.57]</span>Efforts at mapping or surveying the <span class="highlight">universe</span>, making a <span class="highlight">sort</span> of atlas of galaxies, have been going on for more than 50 years. <span class="time" data-times="10.73" data-time="21.45">[00:21.45]</span>And the creators of the first <span class="highlight">major</span> map of the <span class="highlight">universe</span> were the astronomers Harlow Shapley and Adelaide Ames.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="11.68" data-time="32.18">[00:32.18]</span>In 1932, Shapley and Ames catalogued the positions of 1250 galaxies by photographing what they saw <span class="highlight">through</span> their telescopes.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.51" data-time="43.86">[00:43.86]</span>And they made an important discovery. <span class="time" data-times="7.21" data-time="46.37">[00:46.37]</span>Their <span class="highlight">survey</span> was the first to <span class="highlight">indicate</span> that galaxies were not distributed <span class="highlight">uniformly</span> in <span class="highlight">space</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.85" data-time="53.58">[00:53.58]</span>Some areas had a lot of galaxies, and other areas had just a few. <span class="time" data-times="5.17" data-time="59.43">[00:59.43]</span>Another way of putting this is to say that galaxies are clustered. <span class="time" data-times="3.03" data-time="64.6">[01:04.60]</span>They're not <span class="highlight">spread</span> evenly <span class="highlight">throughout</span> the <span class="highlight">universe</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.89" data-time="67.63">[01:07.63]</span>So we have stars grouped together in galaxies and galaxies grouped together in clusters. Okay?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="8.09" data-time="76.52">[01:16.52]</span>Now, after their <span class="highlight">survey</span>, other astronomers completed surveys that added to the number of clusters catalogued.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.84" data-time="84.61">[01:24.61]</span>One of the most important was done by the <span class="highlight">astronomer</span> George Abell. <span class="time" data-times="3.7" data-time="90.45">[01:30.45]</span>Abell completed his <span class="highlight">survey</span> in 1958. <span class="time" data-times="3.81" data-time="94.15">[01:34.15]</span>It added <span class="highlight">considerably</span> to the map made by Shapley and Ames. <span class="time" data-times="5.51" data-time="97.96">[01:37.96]</span>In fact, his map had over 2700 clusters of galaxies. <span class="time" data-times="4.13" data-time="103.47">[01:43.47]</span>That is 2700 clusters of galaxies! <span class="time" data-times="2.57" data-time="107.6">[01:47.60]</span>Not just galaxies.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.38" data-time="110.17">[01:50.17]</span>But there's another <span class="highlight">aspect</span> of Abell's work that makes this map so <span class="highlight">valuable</span> to astronomers. <span class="time" data-times="5.6" data-time="116.55">[01:56.55]</span>He introduced a <span class="highlight">classification</span> <span class="highlight">scheme</span> for the <span class="highlight">galaxy</span> clusters. <span class="time" data-times="11.85" data-time="122.15">[02:02.15]</span>Now, surveys completed since Abell's have catalogued <span class="highlight">additional</span> galaxies and surveyed more outer <span class="highlight">space</span>, but no one has improved upon Abell's <span class="highlight">classification</span> <span class="highlight">scheme</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.07" data-time="134">[02:14.00]</span>In fact, the Abell <span class="highlight">catalogue</span> is used as a starting point for astronomers who study these objects.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.78" data-time="141.07">[02:21.07]</span>One of the reasons his <span class="highlight">scheme</span> has been so widely accepted is because of his <span class="highlight">sample</span> size. <span class="time" data-times="5.51" data-time="147.85">[02:27.85]</span>With all the clusters in his <span class="highlight">sample</span>, he could <span class="highlight">determine</span> the different characteristics of clusters. <span class="time" data-times="4.94" data-time="153.36">[02:33.36]</span>And these characteristics form the basis of his <span class="highlight">classification</span> <span class="highlight">scheme</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.92" data-time="158.3">[02:38.30]</span>Now, two of the characteristics <span class="highlight">crucial</span> to his <span class="highlight">classification</span> were richness and <span class="highlight">symmetry</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.05" data-time="166.22">[02:46.22]</span>So what did he mean by "richness"?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.95" data-time="170.27">[02:50.27]</span>Well, basically it refers to the number of galaxies there are <span class="highlight">within</span> a <span class="highlight">cluster</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.08" data-time="177.22">[02:57.22]</span>Student:Is that the same as <span class="highlight">density</span>?</p>

          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.75" data-time="191.37">[03:11.37]</span>Student:And <span class="highlight">symmetry</span> just refers to its <span class="highlight">shape</span>?</p>

            <span class="time" data-times="2.58" data-time="194.12">[03:14.12]</span>Professor: <span class="highlight">Roughly</span> speaking, yes. <span class="time" data-times="5.32" data-time="196.7">[03:16.70]</span>Whether the <span class="highlight">shape</span> of the <span class="highlight">cluster</span> was the same on the left side as on the right side.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="8.29" data-time="202.02">[03:22.02]</span>So Abell use categories like that to <span class="highlight">classify</span> clusters on a scale: from <span class="highlight">regular</span> to <span class="highlight">irregular</span>.</p>

          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.17" data-time="229.53">[03:49.53]</span>Student: You are talking about the <span class="highlight">shape</span> of the <span class="highlight">cluster</span> though, not the <span class="highlight">shape</span> of the galaxies <span class="highlight">within</span> the <span class="highlight">cluster</span>.</p>

            <span class="time" data-times="4.91" data-time="234.7">[03:54.70]</span>Professor:Right. For example, let's <span class="highlight">consider</span> the Coma <span class="highlight">Cluster</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.95" data-time="239.61">[03:59.61]</span>It's a <span class="highlight">symmetrical</span> <span class="highlight">cluster</span> basically <span class="highlight">spherical</span> in <span class="highlight">shape</span>, but the <span class="highlight">individual</span> galaxies <span class="highlight">within</span> it are <span class="highlight">elliptical</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.51" data-time="247.56">[04:07.56]</span>They're not <span class="highlight">spherical</span> or <span class="highlight">spiral</span> shaped, but the <span class="highlight">cluster</span> itself shows <span class="highlight">spherical</span> <span class="highlight">symmetry</span>.</p>

            <span class="time" data-times="5.85" data-time="254.07">[04:14.07]</span>The Virgo <span class="highlight">Cluster</span>, on the other hand, is considered <span class="highlight">irregular</span>. <span class="time" data-times="10.58" data-time="259.92">[04:19.92]</span>There's no <span class="highlight">symmetry</span> to its <span class="highlight">overall</span> <span class="highlight">shape</span>, no central <span class="highlight">concentration</span> of galaxies, but it happens to have both <span class="highlight">elliptical</span> and <span class="highlight">spiral</span> galaxies <span class="highlight">within</span> it.</p>

            <span class="time" data-times="1.21" data-time="270.5">[04:30.50]</span>Student:Another question. <span class="time" data-times="4.09" data-time="271.71">[04:31.71]</span>You were saying how some clusters have more galaxies than others. <span class="time" data-times="4.92" data-time="275.8">[04:35.80]</span>How many galaxies does a <span class="highlight">cluster</span> have to have in order to <span class="highlight">even</span> be a <span class="highlight">cluster</span>?</p>

              <p>According to the original "Now, two of the measuring metrics to his classification were richness and symmetry. "</p>
              <p>According to the original student question Is that the same as density? The professor replied: That's right, both richness and density refer to the number per area. So the A option is correct.</p>
              <p>According to the original student question And symmetry just referred to its shape? Professor replied:Graphically speaking yes. So the B option is correct.</p>
