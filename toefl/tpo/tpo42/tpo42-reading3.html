            <b>Callisto and Ganymede </b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>From 1996 to 1999, the Galileo <span class="underline">spacecraft</span> passed <span class="underline">through</span> the Jovian system, providing much information about <span class="underline">Jupiter</span>'s satellites. Callisto, the <span class="underline">outermost</span> of <span class="underline">Jupiter</span>'s four largest satellites, orbits the <span class="underline">planet</span> in seventeen days at a distance from <span class="underline">Jupiter</span> of two million kilometers. Like our own Moon, Callisto rotates in the same period as it revolves, so it always keeps the same face toward <span class="underline">Jupiter</span>. Its noontime surface <span class="underline">temperature</span> is only about -140°C, so water ice is <span class="underline">stable</span> on its surface year-round. Callisto has a <span class="underline">diameter</span> of 4.820 kilometers, almost the same as that of <span class="underline">Mercury</span>. Its <span class="underline">mass</span> is only one-third as great, which means its <span class="underline">density</span> must be only one-third as great as well. This tells us that Callisto has far less of the <span class="underline">rocky</span> <span class="underline">metallic</span> materials found in the <span class="underline">inner</span> planets and must <span class="underline">instead</span> be an icy body <span class="underline">through</span> much of its <span class="underline">interior</span>.</p>
          <p>Callisto has not fully differentiated, meaning separated into layers of different <span class="underline">density</span> materials. Astronomers can tell that it lacks a <span class="underline"><span class="underline">dense</span></span> <span class="underline">core</span> from the details of its <span class="underline">gravitational</span> pull on the Galileo <span class="underline">spacecraft</span> during several very close flybys. This fact surprised scientists, who expected that all the big icy moons would be differentiated. It is much easier for an icy body to <span class="underline">differentiate</span> than for a <span class="underline">rocky</span> one, since the <span class="underline">melting</span> <span class="underline">temperature</span> of ice is so low. Only a little heating will soften the ice and get the <span class="underline">process</span> started, allowing the rock and metal to sink to the center and the slushy ice to <span class="underline">float</span> to the surface. Yet Callisto seems to have frozen <span class="underline">solid</span> before the <span class="underline">process</span> of <span class="underline">differentiation</span> was complete.</p>
          <p>Like our Moon's highlands, the surface of Callisto is covered with <span class="underline">impact</span> craters. The <span class="underline">survival</span> of these craters tells us that an icy object can form and <span class="underline">retain</span> <span class="underline">impact</span> craters in its surface. In thinking of ice so far from the Sun, it is important not to judge its <span class="underline">behavior</span> from that of the much warmer ice we know on Earth; at the temperatures of the outer <span class="underline">solar</span> system, ice on the surface is nearly as hard as rock, and behaves similarly. Ice on Callisto does not <span class="underline">deform</span> or flow like ice in glaciers on Earth. Callisto is <span class="underline">unique</span> among the planet-sized objects of the <span class="underline">solar</span> system in its <span class="underline">absence</span> of <span class="underline">interior</span> forces to <span class="underline">drive</span> geological <span class="underline">evolution</span>. The <span class="underline">satellite</span> was born dead and has remained geologically dead for more than four billion years.</p>
          <p>Ganymede, another of <span class="underline">Jupiter</span>'s satellites and the largest in our <span class="underline">solar</span> system, is also cratered, but less so than Callisto. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>About one-quarter of its surface seems to be as old and heavily cratered; the rest formed more recently, as we can tell by the <span class="underline">sparse</span> covering of <span class="underline">impact</span> craters as well as the <span class="underline">relative</span> freshness of the craters. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>Ganymede is a differentiated world, like the <span class="underline">terrestrial</span> planets. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>Measurements of its <span class="underline">gravity</span> <span class="underline">field</span> tell us that the rock and metal sank to form a <span class="underline">core</span> about the size of our Moon, with a <span class="underline">mantle</span> and <span class="underline">crust</span> of ice floating above it. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>In <span class="underline">addition</span>, the Galileo <span class="underline">spacecraft</span> discovered that Ganymede has a <span class="underline">magnetic</span> <span class="underline">field</span>, the signature of a <span class="underline">partially</span> <span class="underline">molten</span> <span class="underline">interior</span>. Ganymede is not a dead world, but rather a place of continuing geological <span class="underline">activity</span> powered by an <span class="underline">internal</span> heat <span class="underline">source</span>. Much of its surface may be as young as half a billion years.</p>
          <p>The younger <span class="underline">terrain</span> is the result of <span class="underline">tectonic</span> and <span class="underline">volcanic</span> forces. Some features formed when the <span class="underline">crust</span> cracked, flooding many of the craters with water from the <span class="underline">interior</span>. Extensive mountain ranges were formed from compression of the <span class="underline">crust</span>, forming long ridges with <span class="underline">parallel</span> valleys spaced one to two kilometers apart. In some places older <span class="underline">impact</span> craters were <span class="underline">split</span> and pulled apart. There are <span class="underline">even</span> indications of large-scale <span class="underline">crustal</span> movements that are <span class="underline">similar</span> to the <span class="underline">plate</span> <span class="underline">tectonics</span> of Earth.</p>
          <p>Why is Ganymede different from Callisto? Possibly the small <span class="underline">difference</span> in size and <span class="underline">internal</span> heating between the two led to this divergence in their <span class="underline">evolution</span>. But more likely the <span class="underline">gravity</span> of <span class="underline">Jupiter</span> is to blame for Ganymede's continuing geological <span class="underline">activity</span>. Ganymede is close enough to <span class="underline">Jupiter</span> that <span class="underline">tidal</span> forces from the <span class="underline">giant</span> <span class="underline">planet</span> may have episodically heated its <span class="underline">interior</span> and triggered <span class="underline">major</span> convulsions on its <span class="underline">crust</span>.</p>
