            <b>Explaining Dinosaur Extinction</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>Dinosaurs rapidly became <span class="highlight">extinct</span> about 65 million years ago as part of a <span class="highlight">mass</span> <span class="highlight">extinction</span> known as the K-T event, because it is <span class="highlight">associated</span> with a geological signature known as the K-T <span class="highlight">boundary</span>, usually a thin <span class="highlight">band</span> of <span class="highlight">sedimentation</span> found in various parts of the world (K is the <span class="highlight">traditional</span> abbreviation for the Cretaceous, derived from the German name Kreidezeit). <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>Many explanations have been proposed for why dinosaurs became <span class="highlight">extinct</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>For example, some have blamed <span class="highlight">dinosaur</span> <span class="highlight">extinction</span> on the <span class="highlight">development</span> of flowering plants, which were <span class="highlight">supposedly</span> more difficult to <span class="highlight">digest</span> and could have caused constipation or <span class="highlight">indigestion</span> - except that flowering plants first evolved in the Early Cretaceous, about 60 million years before the dinosaurs died out. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>In fact, several scientists have suggested that the duckbill dinosaurs and horned dinosaurs, with their <span class="highlight">complex</span> <span class="highlight">battery</span> of grinding teeth, evolved to <span class="highlight">exploit</span> this new <span class="highlight">resource</span> of rapidly growing flowering plants. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>Others have blamed <span class="highlight">extinction</span> on competition from the mammals, which <span class="question2">allegedly </span>ate all the <span class="highlight">dinosaur</span> eggs-except that mammals and dinosaurs appeared at the same time in the Late Triassic, about 190 million years ago, and there is no <span class="highlight">reason</span> to believe that mammals suddenly acquired a <span class="highlight">taste</span> for <span class="highlight">dinosaur</span> eggs after 120 million years of coexistence. Some explanations (such as the one stating that dinosaurs all died of diseases) fail because there is no way to scientifically test them, and they cannot move beyond the <span class="highlight">realm</span> of speculation and guesswork.</p>
          <p>This <span class="highlight">focus</span> on explaining <span class="highlight">dinosaur</span> <span class="highlight">extinction</span> misses an important point: the <span class="highlight">extinction</span> at the end of the Cretaceous was a global event that killed off organisms up and down the food <span class="highlight">chain</span>. It wiped out many kinds of <span class="highlight">plankton</span> in the ocean and many <span class="highlight">marine</span> organisms that lived on the <span class="highlight">plankton</span> at the <span class="highlight">base</span> of the food <span class="highlight">chain</span>. These included a <span class="highlight">variety</span> of clams and snails, and especially <span class="question6">the ammonites, </span>a group of shelled squidlike creatures that dominated the <span class="highlight">Mesozoic</span> seas and had survived many <span class="highlight">previous</span> <span class="highlight">mass</span> extinctions. The K-T event <span class="highlight">marked</span> the end of the <span class="highlight">marine</span> reptiles, such as the mosasaurs and the plesiosaurs, which were the largest creatures that had ever lived in the seas and which ruled the seas long before whales evolved. On land, there was also a <span class="question9">crisis </span>among the land plants, in <span class="highlight">addition</span> to the disappearance of dinosaurs. So any event that can explain the <span class="highlight">destruction</span> of the <span class="highlight">base</span> of the food <span class="highlight">chain</span> (<span class="highlight">plankton</span> in the ocean, plants on land) can better explain what happened to organisms at the top of the food <span class="highlight">chain</span>, such as the dinosaurs. By <span class="highlight">contrast</span>, any explanation that focuses <span class="question8">strictly </span>on the dinosaurs completely misses the point. The Cretaceous extinctions were a global <span class="highlight">phenomenon</span>, and dinosaurs were just a part of a bigger picture.</p>
          <p>According to one <span class="highlight">theory</span>, the Age of Dinosaurs ended suddenly 65 million years ago when a <span class="highlight">giant</span> rock from <span class="highlight">space</span> plummeted to Earth. Estimated to be ten to fifteen kilometers in <span class="highlight">diameter</span>, this bolide (either a <span class="highlight">comet</span> or an <span class="highlight">asteroid</span>) was traveling at <span class="highlight">cosmic</span> speeds of 20-70 kilometers per <span class="highlight">second</span>, or 45,000-156,000 miles per hour. Such a huge <span class="highlight">mass</span> traveling at such <span class="highlight">tremendous</span> speeds carries an <span class="highlight">enormous</span> <span class="highlight">amount</span> of energy. When the bolide struck this energy was released and generated a huge shock wave that leveled everything for thousands of kilometers around the <span class="highlight">impact</span> and caused most of the <span class="highlight">landscape</span> to burst into flames. The bolide struck an area of the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico known as Chicxulub, excavating a <span class="highlight">crater</span> 15-20 kilometers deep and at <span class="highlight">least</span> 170 kilometers in <span class="highlight">diameter</span>. The <span class="highlight">impact</span> displaced huge volumes of seawater, causing much flood damage in the Caribbean. Meanwhile, the bolide itself excavated 100 cubic kilometers of rock and <span class="highlight">debris</span> from the site, which rose to an <span class="highlight">altitude</span> of 100 kilometers. Most of it fell back immediately, but some of it remained as dust in the <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span> for months. This <span class="highlight">material</span>, <span class="highlight">along</span> with the smoke from the fires, shrouded Earth, creating a form of nuclear winter. According to computerized <span class="highlight">climate</span> models, global temperatures fell to near the freezing point, <span class="highlight">photosynthesis</span> <span class="question7">halted, </span>and most plants on land and in the sea died. With the bottom of the food <span class="highlight">chain</span> destroyed, dinosaurs could not <span class="highlight">survive</span>.</p>
