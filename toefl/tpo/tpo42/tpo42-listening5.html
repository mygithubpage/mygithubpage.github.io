            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.74" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in an <span class="underline">environmental</span> science class.<span class="time" data-times="5.69" data-time="5.74">[00:05.74]</span>When you try to imagine a <span class="underline">fungus</span>, you'd probably picture a <span class="underline">mushroom</span> popping up out of the ground. <span class="time" data-times="1.65" data-time="11.43">[00:11.43]</span>And think that's it. <span class="time" data-times="4.6" data-time="13.08">[00:13.08]</span>But a <span class="underline">fungus</span> like that...most of it actually lives <span class="underline">underground</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.64" data-time="17.68">[00:17.68]</span>And <span class="underline">fungi</span> in general are often an important active <span class="underline">component</span> of the soil. <span class="time" data-times="7.73" data-time="22.32">[00:22.32]</span>A <span class="underline">fungus</span> secretes enzymes into the soil, enzymes that <span class="underline">break</span> down, <span class="underline">decompose</span> <span class="underline">organic</span> <span class="underline">material</span> in the soil. <span class="time" data-times="3.6" data-time="30.05">[00:30.05]</span>So the <span class="underline">fungus</span> can <span class="underline">absorb</span> this <span class="underline">material</span> and get <span class="underline">nutrition</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.36" data-time="33.65">[00:33.65]</span>But to me, what's most interesting about this <span class="underline">process</span> is how it may enable <span class="underline">fungi</span> to help clean up <span class="underline">environmental</span> pollution in the soil. <span class="time" data-times="5.43" data-time="42.01">[00:42.01]</span>And that's thanks in part to a <span class="underline">substance</span> in their <span class="underline">cell</span> walls called Chitin. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.65" data-time="47.44">[00:47.44]</span>Now a lot of people think <span class="underline">fungi</span> are related to plants, but they are not. <span class="time" data-times="8.04" data-time="52.09">[00:52.09]</span>Believe it or not, the only other place chitin is found in <span class="underline">abundance</span> is in the exoskeletons of insects, crabs and such. <span class="time" data-times="4.97" data-time="60.13">[01:00.13]</span>So in this <span class="underline">sense</span>, <span class="underline">fungi</span> are more <span class="underline">associated</span> with insects than with any plant. <span class="time" data-times="1.34" data-time="65.1">[01:05.10]</span>Strange, huh? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.79" data-time="66.44">[01:06.44]</span>And the chitin in the <span class="underline">cell</span> walls of a filamentous <span class="underline">fungus</span>...a <span class="underline">filament</span>, of <span class="underline">course</span>, is a long thread-like structure, cells joined end to end. <span class="time" data-times="4.34" data-time="76.23">[01:16.23]</span>Filamentous <span class="underline">fungi</span> grow in soil and in decaying <span class="underline">vegetation</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.45" data-time="80.57">[01:20.57]</span>And as their name implies they exist as filaments. <span class="time" data-times="11.14" data-time="84.02">[01:24.02]</span>And although regarded as microorganisms, filaments from a single <span class="underline">fungus</span> can fan out to <span class="underline">occupy</span> many <span class="underline">square</span> meters or <span class="underline">even</span> several <span class="underline">square</span> kilometers of forest floor. <span class="time" data-times="15.24" data-time="95.16">[01:35.16]</span>Their <span class="underline">vast</span> surface area allows them to <span class="underline">break</span> down and take in huge amounts of nutrients, but beyond that, the filaments also pull out of the soil a great <span class="underline">deal</span> of the pollution that might be in there, especially heavy metals. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="13.65" data-time="110.4">[01:50.40]</span>And here is where chitin comes in, like some other substances in <span class="underline">fungal</span> <span class="underline">cell</span> walls, chitin forms strong chemical bonds to heavy metals in the environment, in a <span class="underline">process</span> we call adsorption. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.65" data-time="124.05">[02:04.05]</span>Now, don't confuse this with <span class="underline">absorption</span>, where a <span class="underline">substance</span> is absorbed into a <span class="underline">cell</span>, into the <span class="underline">interior</span> of a <span class="underline">cell</span>. <span class="time" data-times="1.94" data-time="131.7">[02:11.70]</span>I mean, that is happening here too. <span class="time" data-times="4.25" data-time="133.64">[02:13.64]</span>But adsorption means binding to the outer surface of the <span class="underline">cell</span>. <span class="time" data-times="11.85" data-time="137.89">[02:17.89]</span>And a filamentous <span class="underline">fungus</span> can adsorb <span class="underline">toxic</span> heavy metals, <span class="underline">bind</span> them to the surface of its <span class="underline">enormous</span> network of filaments, and <span class="underline">thereby</span> detoxify a large soil <span class="underline">ecosystem</span>. <span class="time" data-times="18.79" data-time="149.74">[02:29.74]</span>The heavy metals are still there, but <span class="underline">instead</span> of leaching into the water system and contaminating the water <span class="underline">underground</span>, large amounts of these metals may <span class="underline">remain</span> <span class="underline">bound</span> to the chitin, to the <span class="underline">cell</span> walls of filamentous <span class="underline">fungi</span> in the soil, and thus <span class="underline">remain</span> chemically <span class="underline">inactive</span> for as long as 30 years, perhaps longer. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.47" data-time="168.53">[02:48.53]</span>In fact, we can actually use the <span class="underline">cell</span> walls of filamentous <span class="underline">fungi</span> as a <span class="underline">filter</span>, <span class="underline">even</span> after the <span class="underline">fungi</span> are dead. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="23.56" data-time="177">[02:57.00]</span>For example, the <span class="underline">pharmaceutical</span> <span class="underline">industry</span> grows filamentous <span class="underline">fungi</span> in large quantities in the lab, like to produce the <span class="underline">antibiotic</span> <span class="underline">penicillin</span>, the drug <span class="underline">company</span> grows the <span class="underline">fungus</span> penicillium, and after the <span class="underline">penicillin</span> is extracted, these dead penicillium filaments, we can use the chitin in their <span class="underline">cell</span> walls to make <span class="underline">industrial</span> filters to adsorb heavy metals. <span class="time" data-times="8.16" data-time="200.56">[03:20.56]</span>We can put these filters into <span class="underline">waste</span> pipes from <span class="underline">industrial</span> processes, and use the filters to <span class="underline">trap</span> heavy metals, like <span class="underline">mercury</span> and <span class="underline">zinc</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.29" data-time="208.72">[03:28.72]</span>Later, we can chemically <span class="underline">extract</span> the heavy metals and reuse the <span class="underline">filter</span> over and over. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.63" data-time="214.01">[03:34.01]</span>Now going back to the <span class="underline">absorption</span> of <span class="underline">toxic</span> metals into the body of the <span class="underline">fungus</span>, let's turn our <span class="underline">attention</span> to mushrooms. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.78" data-time="221.64">[03:41.64]</span>Like other <span class="underline">fungi</span>, mushrooms can <span class="underline">absorb</span> large quantities of heavy metals. <span class="time" data-times="7.58" data-time="226.42">[03:46.42]</span>In fact, they may <span class="underline">contain</span> up to two and a half times the <span class="underline">concentration</span> of <span class="underline">toxic</span> metals found in the soil they grow in. <span class="time" data-times="10.21" data-time="234">[03:54.00]</span>So mushrooms, at <span class="underline">least</span> what we see above ground...we can potentially <span class="underline">harvest</span> them and then once for all safely <span class="underline">dispose</span> of the pollutants contained <span class="underline">within</span> them. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.2" data-time="244.21">[04:04.21]</span>In fact, to clean up, especially the <span class="underline">groundwater</span> system, permanently, harvesting mushrooms is probably the best way to go. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="252.41">[04:12.41]</span>For some <span class="underline">reason</span>, this hasn't happened yet as far as I know, but I can easily <span class="underline">envision</span> cultivating mushrooms for the <span class="underline">sole</span> purpose of detoxifying a large <span class="underline">underground</span> <span class="underline">ecosystem</span>. </p>
