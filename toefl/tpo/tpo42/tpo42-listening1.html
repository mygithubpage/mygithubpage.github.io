            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to a <span class="underline">conversation</span> between a student and an art <span class="underline">history</span> professor.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.5" data-time="5">[00:05.00]</span>Student: Hi. I'm Melisa. <span class="time" data-times="3.03" data-time="6.5">[00:06.50]</span>I was just a few doors down getting some help in the computer lab. <span class="time" data-times="2.09" data-time="9.53">[00:09.53]</span>My electronic files won't open. <span class="time" data-times="2.77" data-time="11.62">[00:11.62]</span>The technician says it's probably a computer <span class="underline">virus</span>. <span class="time" data-times="1.61" data-time="14.39">[00:14.39]</span>She's working on it now.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.48" data-time="16">[00:16.00]</span>Professor: Yes, from what I've heard lots of <span class="underline">campus</span> computers have been affected. <span class="time" data-times="1.36" data-time="19.48">[00:19.48]</span>What a first week! Huh?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.31" data-time="20.84">[00:20.84]</span>Student: I know, anyhow, I noticed your name on the door as I was walking down the hallway, thought I'd stop in and find out if you happen to have any <span class="underline">additional</span> copies of the class syllabus. <span class="time" data-times="3.12" data-time="31.15">[00:31.15]</span>The one I received in class the other day is missing a page.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.33" data-time="34.27">[00:34.27]</span>Professor: Oh, sorry about that. <span class="time" data-times="3.06" data-time="35.6">[00:35.60]</span>I probably have a few <span class="underline">extra</span> printouts on hand.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.84" data-time="38.66">[00:38.66]</span>Student: Great! Oh, and I noticed on the syllabus we'll be learning about and <span class="underline">eventually</span> writing a paper on "The Bauhaus style of art"? <span class="time" data-times="1.12" data-time="46.5">[00:46.50]</span>Sounds interesting. <span class="time" data-times="1.43" data-time="47.62">[00:47.62]</span>I'm looking <span class="underline">forward</span> to it.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.66" data-time="49.05">[00:49.05]</span>Professor: Right, but technically it doesn't say Bauhaus style of art. <span class="time" data-times="1.94" data-time="53.71">[00:53.71]</span>It only says the Bauhaus.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.81" data-time="55.65">[00:55.65]</span>Student: Oh, what's the <span class="underline">difference</span>?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.86" data-time="58.46">[00:58.46]</span>Professor: Well, the Bauhaus is not really an <span class="underline">artistic</span> style like <span class="underline">cubism</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.96" data-time="63.32">[01:03.32]</span>It was the name of an art and design school in Germany in the early 20th <span class="underline">century</span>. <span class="time" data-times="13.53" data-time="68.28">[01:08.28]</span>The Bauhaus was started as an experiment in education, and one ground-breaking <span class="underline">technique</span> used in its teaching was that students actively participated in workshops <span class="underline">instead</span> of just sitting in classes.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.48" data-time="81.81">[01:21.81]</span>Student: Interesting! I don't have much background in order or anything. <span class="time" data-times="6.9" data-time="85.29">[01:25.29]</span>I'm an economics <span class="underline">major</span> and I'm taking this class as an <span class="underline">elective</span>, decided I <span class="underline">wanted</span> to <span class="underline">broaden</span> my <span class="underline">awareness</span>, try something new!</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.44" data-time="92.19">[01:32.19]</span>Professor: Excellent! I'm really glad to hear that.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.28" data-time="94.63">[01:34.63]</span>Student: So, was the <span class="underline">focus</span> of the Bauhaus <span class="underline">architecture</span>, I mean, I studied German and Bauhaus translates into "house for building"...</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.78" data-time="102.91">[01:42.91]</span>Professor: Well, the <span class="underline">founding</span> <span class="underline">director</span> was an <span class="underline">architect</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7" data-time="105.69">[01:45.69]</span>However, he aimed to <span class="underline">combine</span> an incredibly <span class="underline">broad</span> <span class="underline">variety</span> of fine arts and crafts under one <span class="underline">artistic</span> roof. <span class="time" data-times="6.17" data-time="112.69">[01:52.69]</span>As a matter of fact, when the Bauhaus first opened, it was without an <span class="underline">architecture</span> <span class="underline">department</span> for several years. <span class="time" data-times="3.29" data-time="118.86">[01:58.86]</span>But later, it became very <span class="underline">influential</span> in <span class="underline">architecture</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.51" data-time="122.15">[02:02.15]</span>Student: So I wasn't all wrong.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.58" data-time="123.66">[02:03.66]</span>Professor: You'll see on the syllabus that you are required to visit the Rutherford Museum <span class="underline">exhibit</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.74" data-time="128.24">[02:08.24]</span>The <span class="underline">exhibit</span> will help you see that there is no single Bauhaus style. <span class="time" data-times="7.25" data-time="132.98">[02:12.98]</span>I think it's <span class="underline">refreshing</span> that this <span class="underline">particular</span> <span class="underline">exhibit</span> departs from the <span class="underline">standard</span> ways in which art from the Bauhaus is often presented.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="0.93000000000001" data-time="140.23">[02:20.23]</span>Student: Which are?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.95" data-time="141.16">[02:21.16]</span>Professor: Well, for example, by a <span class="underline">specific</span> artist. <span class="time" data-times="6.27" data-time="144.11">[02:24.11]</span>I think it's a mistake to <span class="underline">focus</span> on a single Bauhaus artist and that person's <span class="underline">individual</span> specialty. <span class="time" data-times="9.67" data-time="150.38">[02:30.38]</span>I mean, the different artists from the school created different things: <span class="underline">fabric</span>, <span class="underline">sculpture</span>, furniture, <span class="underline">graphic</span> design, paintings, <span class="underline">even</span> theatrical performances. <span class="time" data-times="8.35" data-time="160.05">[02:40.05]</span>The <span class="underline">exhibit</span> in the Rutherford Museum units all these specialties <span class="underline">through</span> connecting themes such as <span class="underline">motion</span> or the body.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.37" data-time="168.4">[02:48.40]</span>Student: Sounds <span class="underline">fascinating</span>! <span class="time" data-times="3.63" data-time="169.77">[02:49.77]</span>Say, I've heard of something about <span class="underline">discount</span> nights at that museum?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.64" data-time="173.4">[02:53.40]</span>Professor: Weekends are full price. <span class="time" data-times="2.36" data-time="175.04">[02:55.04]</span>It's typically best to go Thursday nights. <span class="time" data-times="2.77" data-time="177.4">[02:57.40]</span>That's student <span class="underline">discount</span> night, 50% off. <span class="time" data-times="3.34" data-time="180.17">[03:00.17]</span>However, next Wednesday is open to the public for free. <span class="time" data-times="1.31" data-time="183.51">[03:03.51]</span>It's a <span class="underline">special</span> <span class="underline">promotion</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="184.82">[03:04.82]</span>So I know what I would do.</p>
