Other people prefer living in the countryside, away from urban areas. Which do you think is better? Explain why, using specific details in your explanation.</p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>Compared to living in a city, I would like to live in the countryside. The reasons are as below. Firstly, living in the countryside means we can appreciate the healthier environment. Nowadays, people living in city have to suffer the air and water pollution caused by the high speeding development of industry. Secondly, we can enjoy the slow pace of life in the countryside. In big cities, pedestrians are always walking fast and it seems like they would feel unwilling to stop. But with the easy life style of countryside, they don't have to deal with the high pressure resulted from working and living. So it'll be much more comfortable to live there. That's why I prefer to live in the countryside.</p></article></div></main></body></html>
