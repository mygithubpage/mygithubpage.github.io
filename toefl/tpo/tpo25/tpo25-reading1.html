Three very large volcanoes are found on the Tharsis <span class="highlight">bulge</span>, an <span class="highlight question1">enormous</span> geologic area near Mars's <span class="highlight">equator</span>. Northwest of Tharsis is the largest <span class="highlight">volcano</span> of all: Olympus Mons, with a height of 25 kilometers and measuring some 700 kilometers in <span class="highlight">diameter</span> at its <span class="highlight">base</span>. The three large volcanoes on the Tharsis <span class="highlight">bulge</span> are a little smaller-a "<span class="highlight">mere</span>" 18 kilometers high.</p><p>None of these volcanoes was formed as a result of collisions between plates of the Martian crust-there is no <span class="highlight">plate</span><span class="highlight">motion</span> on Mars. <span class="highlight">Instead</span>, they are <span class="highlight">shield</span> volcanoes-volcanoes with <span class="highlight">broad</span>, sloping slides formed by <span class="highlight">molten</span> rock. All four show <span class="highlight"><span class="question3">distinctive</span></span><span class="highlight">lava</span> channels and other flow features <span class="highlight">similar</span> to those found on <span class="highlight">shield</span> volcanoes on Earth. Images of the Martian surface <span class="highlight">reveal</span> many hundreds of volcanoes. Most of the largest volcanoes are <span class="highlight">associated</span> with the Tharsis <span class="highlight">bulge</span>, but many smaller ones are found in the northern plains</p><p>The great height of Martian volcanoes is a direct <span class="highlight">consequence</span> of the <span class="highlight">planet</span>'s low surface <span class="highlight">gravity</span>. As <span class="highlight">lava</span> flows and spreads to form a <span class="highlight">shield</span><span class="highlight">volcano</span>, the <span class="highlight">volcano</span>'s eventual height depends on the new mountain's <span class="highlight">ability</span> to support its own weight. The <span class="highlight">lower</span> the <span class="highlight">gravity</span>, the lesser the weight and the greater the height of the mountain. It is no <span class="highlight">accident</span> that Maxwell Mons on <span class="highlight">Venus</span> and the Hawaiian <span class="highlight">shield</span> volcanoes on Earth rise to about the same height (about 10 kilometers) above their <span class="highlight">respective</span> bases-Earth and <span class="highlight">Venus</span> have <span class="highlight">similar</span> surface <span class="highlight">gravity</span>. Mars's surface <span class="highlight">gravity</span> is only 40 percent that of Earth, so volcanoes rise <span class="highlight"><span class="question5">roughly</span></span> 2.5 times as high. Are the Martian <span class="highlight">shield</span> volcanoes still active? <span class="question7">Scientists have no direct <span class="highlight">evidence</span> for recent or <span class="highlight">ongoing</span> eruptions, but if these volcanoes were active as recently as 100 million years ago (an <span class="highlight">estimate</span> of the time of last <span class="highlight">eruption</span> based on the <span class="highlight">extent</span> of <span class="highlight">impact</span> cratering on their slopes), some of them may still be at <span class="highlight">least</span><span class="highlight">intermittently</span> active.</span> Millions of years, though, may pass between eruptions.</p><p>Another <span class="highlight">prominent</span> feature of Mars's surface is cratering. The Mariner <span class="highlight">spacecraft</span> found that the surface of Mars, as well as that of its two moons, is pitted with <span class="highlight">impact</span> craters formed by meteoroids falling in from <span class="highlight">space</span>. As on our Moon, the smaller craters are often filled with surface matter-mostly dust-confirming that Mars is a dry <span class="highlight">desert</span> world. However, Martian craters get filled in <span class="highlight"><span class="question8">considerably</span></span> faster than their <span class="highlight">lunar</span> counterparts. On the Moon, <span class="highlight">ancient</span> craters less than 100 meters <span class="highlight">across</span> (corresponding to depths of about 20 meters) have been obliterated, <span class="highlight">primarily</span> by meteoritic <span class="highlight">erosion</span>. On Mars, there are <span class="highlight">relatively</span> few craters less than 5 kilometers in <span class="highlight">diameter</span>. The Martian <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span> is an <span class="highlight">efficient</span> erosive agent, with Martian winds transporting dust from place to place and erasing surface features much faster than meteoritic impacts alone can obliterate them.</p><p>As on the Moon, the <span class="highlight">extent</span> of large <span class="highlight">impact</span> cratering (i.e. craters too big to have been filled in by <span class="highlight">erosion</span> since they were formed) serves as an age indicator for the Martian surface. Age estimates ranging from four billion years for Mars's southern highlands to a few hundred million years in the youngest <span class="highlight">volcanic</span> areas were obtained in this way.</p><p>The detailed <span class="highlight">appearance</span> of Martian <span class="highlight">impact</span> craters provides an important piece of information about conditions just below the <span class="highlight">planet</span>'s surface. Martian craters are surrounded 
by <span class="highlight">ejecta</span> (<span class="highlight">debris</span> formed as a result of an <span class="highlight">impact</span>) that looks quite different from its <span class="highlight">lunar</span> counterparts. A <span class="highlight">comparison</span> of the Copernicus <span class="highlight">crater</span> on the Moon with the (<span class="highlight">fairly</span><span class="highlight">typical</span>) 
<span class="highlight">crater</span> Yuty on Mars demonstrates the differences. The <span class="highlight">ejecta</span> surrounding the <span class="highlight">lunar</span><span class="highlight">crater</span> is just what one would <span class="highlight">expect</span> from an <span class="highlight">explosion</span> ejecting a large <span class="highlight">volume</span> of dust, soil, and boulders.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>However, the <span class="highlight">ejecta</span> on Mars gives the <span class="highlight">distinct</span><span class="highlight">impression</span> of a <span class="highlight">liquid</span> that has splashed or flowed out of <span class="highlight">crater</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>Geologists think that this fluidized <span class="highlight">ejecta</span><span class="highlight">crater</span> indicates that a <span class="highlight">layer</span> 
of permafrost, or water ice, lies just a few meters under the surface. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>Explosive impacts heated and liquefied the ice, resulting in the <span class="highlight">fluid</span><span class="highlight">appearance</span> of the <span class="highlight">ejecta</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">enormous</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Although direct evidence of recent eruptions is lacking, scientists believe that these volcanoes were active as recently as 100 million years ago.</p><p>B. Scientists estimate that volcanoes active more recently than 100 years ago will still have extensive impact cratering on their slopes.</p><p>C. If, as some evidence suggests, these volcanoes erupted as recently as 100 million years ago, they may continue to be intermittently active.</p><p>D. Although these volcanoes were active as recently as 100 million years ago, there is no direct evidence of recent or ongoing eruptions.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The key to the C original sentence lies in the sentence after But. The turning point of the logic of the transition is after the turning point. Therefore, the focus is on the contents after but. The main logic behind but is hypothetical, throwing away some of the modifiers, the main meaning of the expression is: if these volcanoes were active volcanoes 100 million years ago, then they should now be intermittently active. The C option covers all these points in the trunk, and the statement is correct, so C is the correct answer. The A option misses the if guide's conclusion (still active), so the error; the B option overwrites it, the extensive impact is not mentioned at all; the D option misses all the main parts of the if guide, so it's wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question8">considerably</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.
