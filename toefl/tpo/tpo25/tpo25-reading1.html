            <b>The Surface of Mars</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>The surface of Mars shows a wide <span class="underline">range</span> of geologic features, including huge volcanoes-the largest known in the <span class="underline">solar</span> system-and <span class="underline">extensive</span> <span class="underline">impact</span> cratering. Three very large volcanoes are found on the Tharsis <span class="underline">bulge</span>, an <span class="light"><span class="underline">enormous</span></span> geologic area near Mars's <span class="underline">equator</span>. Northwest of Tharsis is the largest <span class="underline">volcano</span> of all: Olympus Mons, with a height of 25 kilometers and measuring some 700 kilometers in <span class="underline">diameter</span> at its <span class="underline">base</span>. The three large volcanoes on the Tharsis <span class="underline">bulge</span> are a little smaller-a "<span class="underline">mere</span>" 18 kilometers high.</p>
          <p>None of these volcanoes was formed as a result of collisions between plates of the Martian crust-there is no <span class="underline">plate</span> <span class="underline">motion</span> on Mars. <span class="underline">Instead</span>, they are <span class="underline">shield</span> volcanoes-volcanoes with <span class="underline">broad</span>, sloping slides formed by <span class="underline">molten</span> rock. All four show <span class="underline">distinctive</span> <span class="underline">lava</span> channels and other flow features <span class="underline">similar</span> to those found on <span class="underline">shield</span> volcanoes on Earth. Images of the Martian surface <span class="underline">reveal</span> many hundreds of volcanoes. Most of the largest volcanoes are <span class="underline">associated</span> with the Tharsis <span class="underline">bulge</span>, but many smaller ones are found in the northern plains</p>
          <p>The great height of Martian volcanoes is a direct <span class="underline">consequence</span> of the <span class="underline">planet</span>'s low surface <span class="underline">gravity</span>. As <span class="underline">lava</span> flows and spreads to form a <span class="underline">shield</span> <span class="underline">volcano</span>, the <span class="underline">volcano</span>'s eventual height depends on the new mountain's <span class="underline">ability</span> to support its own weight. The <span class="underline">lower</span> the <span class="underline">gravity</span>, the lesser the weight and the greater the height of the mountain. It is no <span class="underline">accident</span> that Maxwell Mons on <span class="underline">Venus</span> and the Hawaiian <span class="underline">shield</span> volcanoes on Earth rise to about the same height (about 10 kilometers) above their <span class="underline">respective</span> bases-Earth and <span class="underline">Venus</span> have <span class="underline">similar</span> surface <span class="underline">gravity</span>. Mars's surface <span class="underline">gravity</span> is only 40 percent that of Earth, so volcanoes rise <span class="underline">roughly</span> 2.5 times as high. Are the Martian <span class="underline">shield</span> volcanoes still active? Scientists have no direct <span class="underline">evidence</span> for recent or <span class="underline">ongoing</span> eruptions, but if these volcanoes were active as recently as 100 million years ago (an <span class="underline">estimate</span> of the time of last <span class="underline">eruption</span> based on the <span class="underline">extent</span> of <span class="underline">impact</span> cratering on their slopes), some of them may still be at <span class="underline">least</span> <span class="underline">intermittently</span> active. Millions of years, though, may pass between eruptions.</p>
          <p>Another <span class="underline">prominent</span> feature of Mars's surface is cratering. The Mariner <span class="underline">spacecraft</span> found that the surface of Mars, as well as that of its two moons, is pitted with <span class="underline">impact</span> craters formed by meteoroids falling in from <span class="underline">space</span>. As on our Moon, the smaller craters are often filled with surface matter-mostly dust-confirming that Mars is a dry <span class="underline">desert</span> world. However, Martian craters get filled in <span class="underline">considerably</span> faster than their <span class="underline">lunar</span> counterparts. On the Moon, <span class="underline">ancient</span> craters less than 100 meters <span class="underline">across</span> (corresponding to depths of about 20 meters) have been obliterated, <span class="underline">primarily</span> by meteoritic <span class="underline">erosion</span>. On Mars, there are <span class="underline">relatively</span> few craters less than 5 kilometers in <span class="underline">diameter</span>. The Martian <span class="underline">atmosphere</span> is an <span class="underline">efficient</span> erosive agent, with Martian winds transporting dust from place to place and erasing surface features much faster than meteoritic impacts alone can obliterate them.</p>
          <p>As on the Moon, the <span class="underline">extent</span> of large <span class="underline">impact</span> cratering (i.e. craters too big to have been filled in by <span class="underline">erosion</span> since they were formed) serves as an age indicator for the Martian surface. Age estimates ranging from four billion years for Mars's southern highlands to a few hundred million years in the youngest <span class="underline">volcanic</span> areas were obtained in this way.</p>
          <p>The detailed <span class="underline">appearance</span> of Martian <span class="underline">impact</span> craters provides an important piece of information about conditions just below the <span class="underline">planet</span>'s surface. Martian craters are surrounded 
by <span class="underline">ejecta</span> (<span class="underline">debris</span> formed as a result of an <span class="underline">impact</span>) that looks quite different from its <span class="underline">lunar</span> counterparts. A <span class="underline">comparison</span> of the Copernicus <span class="underline">crater</span> on the Moon with the (<span class="underline">fairly</span> <span class="underline">typical</span>) 
<span class="underline">crater</span> Yuty on Mars demonstrates the differences. The <span class="underline">ejecta</span> surrounding the <span class="underline">lunar</span> <span class="underline">crater</span> is just what one would <span class="underline">expect</span> from an <span class="underline">explosion</span> ejecting a large <span class="underline">volume</span> of dust, soil, and boulders.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>However, the <span class="underline">ejecta</span> on Mars gives the <span class="underline">distinct</span> <span class="underline">impression</span> of a <span class="underline">liquid</span> that has splashed or flowed out of <span class="underline">crater</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>Geologists think that this fluidized <span class="underline">ejecta</span> <span class="underline">crater</span> indicates that a <span class="underline">layer</span> 
of permafrost, or water ice, lies just a few meters under the surface. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>Explosive impacts heated and liquefied the ice, resulting in the <span class="underline">fluid</span> <span class="underline">appearance</span> of the <span class="underline">ejecta</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p>
