The professor's recent research on play and brain development.</p><p>B. Differing explanations of the reasons for play.</p><p>C. Examples of two distinct types of play fighting.</p><p>D. Differences in the play behaviors of various animal specials.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The first question is again the subject matter. From the very beginning, the professor said that he had arranged a task and read articles about animal play to discuss several different viewpoints.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>One of the students brings up the example of play fighting among wolf pups. What does this example lead him to believe?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. That wolves are especially violent animals.</p><p>B. That the play-as-preparation hypothesis is probably correct.</p><p>C. That wolves seldom engage in self-handicapping.</p><p>D. That the results of a recent study are probably not reliable.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Professor: And, what leads you to that conclusion? Jerry: Well, like wolves, the young pups, they fight a lot and bite, you know, not to hurt each other, but, just seems obviously why those wolf pups play like that In explaining play as preparation, the professor asked how jerry got that conclusion. Student jerry used the example of wolf.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which statement best expresses the professor's opinion of the play-as-preparation hypothesis?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It is well supported by available evidence.</p><p>B. It may apply only to certain species of animals.</p><p>C. It does not explain some important aspects of play.</p><p>D. It is particularly useful explaining human behavior.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>And in fact, there really is is't much in the way of solid experimental evidence to support the play-as-preparation hypothesis. The problem is solved by the boys. The girl punishes and says that the skills of playing with children are the same as adults. Differently, later professors agreed that play-as-preparation does not explain some of the important aspects of play.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor imply about self-handicapping? Click on 2 answers.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It commonly occurs in play but not in other activities.</p><p>B. It applies only to animal species that do not hunt for food.</p><p>C. It has been observed only in laboratory settings.</p><p>D. It contradicts the play-as-preparation hypothesis.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="AD"><p>Saying that this self-handicapping is used only when the game is playing, not when there is a real fight (this professor also has an explanation), so choose A. This is in the listening original, the female student has an explanation, and D can pass When the girls challenged the boys about the play-as-preparation explanation, B did not say only and hunt for food. C, only laboratory setting Article does not involve, pay attention to the only limit vocabulary of other options.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The professor discusses a study on the relationship between brain growth and play. What does that study conclude?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Patterns of brain growth are similar in animals that play and animals that do not play.</p><p>B. Excessive brain growth can sometimes limit an animal's behavioral vocabulary.</p><p>C. Animals that do not play have less-developed brains than animals that play.</p><p>D. Animals without well-developed brains are seldom observed playing.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>That playing literally stimulates growth, creates connections within the brain? The text has a vocabulary apparently, a clear summary of the vocabulary, and it is exactly the C item.</p></div></div><div class="replay" id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the student mean when she says this:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. She is not familiar with the play behavior of wolf pups.</p><p>B. She doubts that wolf pups fight as much as the other students implies.</p><p>C. She is not sure that she correctly understood the reading assignment.</p><p>D. She disagrees with the other student's opinion about play behavior.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The context of the female student obviously disagreed with the boy's point of view, and the content behind it was obviously a rebuttal of the boy's point of view.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
