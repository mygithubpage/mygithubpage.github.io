              <span class="time" data-times="10.34" data-time="5.91">[00:05.91]</span>Professor: All right. I hope you all had a <span class="highlight">chance</span> to finish the assigned readings about animal play, because I want to spend some time discussing the different viewpoints presented in those articles. <span class="time" data-times="3.88" data-time="16.25">[00:16.25]</span>Let's start with the play-as-preparation <span class="highlight">hypothesis</span>. <span class="time" data-times="1.41" data-time="20.13">[00:20.13]</span>Jerry, can you explain it? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.03" data-time="21.54">[00:21.54]</span>
              <span class="highlight">Male</span> Student: Yeah, Play-as-preparation. <span class="time" data-times="8.41" data-time="25.57">[00:25.57]</span>Young animals play in order to get really good at certain <span class="highlight">specific</span> things they will need to do when they are adults, things like chasing, pouncing, climbing. <span class="time" data-times="5.2" data-time="33.98">[00:33.98]</span>In other words, they play in order to practice <span class="highlight">survival</span> skills, like movements used in hunting and fighting. <span class="time" data-times="5.32" data-time="39.18">[00:39.18]</span>That <span class="highlight">hypothesis</span> makes a lot of <span class="highlight">sense</span>, like, maybe the most <span class="highlight">sense</span> of all the theories we read about. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.18" data-time="44.5">[00:44.50]</span>Professor: And what leads you to that conclusion? </p>

              <span class="time" data-times="12.56" data-time="46.68">[00:46.68]</span>
              <span class="highlight">Male</span> Student: Well, like wolves, the young pups, they fight a lot and bite, you know, not to hurt each other, but ... It just seems <span class="highlight">obvious</span> why those wolf pups play like that. <span class="time" data-times="4.47" data-time="59.24">[00:59.24]</span>It gives them practice with skills that will make them better hunters or fighters as adults. </p>

              <span class="highlight">Female</span> Student: Right. Self-handicapping. <span class="time" data-times="0.080000000000005" data-time="89.99">[01:29.99]</span>Like during a fake fight, a play fight, if one of the animals is winning, the winning animal might just stop and give up its <span class="highlight">advantage</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.16" data-time="90.07">[01:30.07]</span>Professor: Yes. And often it shifts to a <span class="highlight">submissive</span> posture too. <span class="time" data-times="4.26" data-time="94.23">[01:34.23]</span>Of <span class="highlight">course</span> self-handicapping <span class="highlight">hardly</span> ever happens in a real fight. <span class="time" data-times="3.31" data-time="98.49">[01:38.49]</span>Because in a real fight, well, the point is to win. <span class="time" data-times="7.88" data-time="101.8">[01:41.80]</span>So, this self-handicapping, it is important to take this into <span class="highlight">account</span> before just deciding to go with that first explanation. <span class="time" data-times="7.94" data-time="109.68">[01:49.68]</span>And in fact, there really isn't much in the way of <span class="highlight">solid</span> <span class="highlight">experimental</span> <span class="highlight">evidence</span> to support the play-as-preparation <span class="highlight">hypothesis</span>. </p>

              <span class="time" data-times="2.38" data-time="121.06">[02:01.06]</span>Professor: Ah, yes. Let's talk about that. <span class="time" data-times="8.63" data-time="123.44">[02:03.44]</span>As you say, play is much more than just pretend fighting or practicing other adult behaviors. <span class="time" data-times="9.32" data-time="132.07">[02:12.07]</span>Apparently, it also contributes to the <span class="highlight">development</span> of a brain that's <span class="highlight">flexible</span>, a brain that's quickly able to get a <span class="highlight">handle</span> on unfamiliar situations. <span class="time" data-times="6.8" data-time="141.39">[02:21.39]</span>This <span class="highlight">notion</span>, the <span class="highlight">flexibility</span> <span class="highlight">hypothesis</span>, well, many of my colleagues find it quite <span class="highlight">persuasive</span>. </p>

              <span class="time" data-times="9.79" data-time="148.19">[02:28.19]</span>
              <span class="highlight">Female</span> Student: So, like with kids, a little <span class="highlight">kid</span> might play a game with a friend, and then they might race each other <span class="highlight">across</span> the <span class="highlight">field</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.92" data-time="157.98">[02:37.98]</span>So they are switching from one type of play to another.<span class="time" data-times="1.6" data-time="161.9">[02:41.90]</span> There's a lot of <span class="highlight">variety</span>? <span class="time" data-times="3.37" data-time="163.5">[02:43.50]</span>I mean, they are learning to <span class="highlight">respond</span> to whatever happens? </p>

              <span class="time" data-times="1.81" data-time="166.87">[02:46.87]</span>Professor: Well, that's the general idea. <span class="time" data-times="3.55" data-time="168.68">[02:48.68]</span>But let's hold off on talking about human behaviors from now. <span class="time" data-times="9.77" data-time="172.23">[02:52.23]</span>OK. According to the <span class="highlight">flexibility</span> <span class="highlight">hypothesis</span>, yes, the <span class="highlight">diversity</span>, the <span class="highlight">variety</span> in play can <span class="highlight">lead</span> to a broader <span class="highlight">behavioral</span> <span class="highlight">vocabulary</span>. </p>

            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.84" data-time="185.65">[03:05.65]</span>Professor: Well, sometimes playing results in an animal doing something it would not <span class="highlight">normally</span> do. <span class="time" data-times="10.77" data-time="191.49">[03:11.49]</span>That can <span class="highlight">lead</span> to the animal learning to <span class="highlight">adapt</span>, to come up with new behaviors that can help it cope with <span class="highlight">major</span> problems later on, like staying safe or finding food. </p>
            <p>

Wasn't the conclusion interesting? <span class="time" data-times="4.71" data-time="219.94">[03:39.94]</span>That playing <span class="highlight">literally</span> stimulates growth, creates connections <span class="highlight">within</span> the brain? <span class="time" data-times="2.01" data-time="224.65">[03:44.65]</span>We need to do further studies, but ... </p>
