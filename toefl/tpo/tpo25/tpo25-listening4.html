          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="8.45" data-time="5.99">[00:05.99]</span>Student: Well, you know, I am writing that paper about whales and the <span class="highlight">path</span> they travel as they swim <span class="highlight">through</span> the ocean, their <span class="highlight">migration</span> patterns. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.18" data-time="14.44">[00:14.44]</span>Professor: Yes. I remember. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.88" data-time="15.62">[00:15.62]</span>Student: And well, I was thinking about it and I realized I don't understand how they hold their breath underwater. <span class="time" data-times="6.71" data-time="20.5">[00:20.50]</span>It's a little <span class="highlight">crazy</span> for me to be writing about <span class="highlight">migration</span> patterns without actually knowing how they stay underwater for so long. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.71" data-time="27.21">[00:27.21]</span>Professor: Did you do any research to find out how they do it? </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.08" data-time="29.92">[00:29.92]</span>Student: Yeah, I did. <span class="time" data-times="6.21" data-time="31">[00:31.00]</span>I searched on the internet and there was a lot of information about whales, their habitats, the way they <span class="highlight">communicate</span>, you know, their songs. <span class="time" data-times="4.08" data-time="37.21">[00:37.21]</span>But if there was anything about whales and how they hold their breath, I missed it. <span class="time" data-times="1.75" data-time="41.29">[00:41.29]</span>I've got a <span class="highlight">bunch</span> of books. <span class="time" data-times="2.96" data-time="43.04">[00:43.04]</span>Actually, I have got so much information, it's a little overwhelming. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.16" data-time="46">[00:46.00]</span>Professor: I am surprised there is nothing about it in any of those books. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.61" data-time="49.16">[00:49.16]</span>Student: Well, to be <span class="highlight">honest</span>, l've only skimmed them so far. <span class="time" data-times="2.31" data-time="51.77">[00:51.77]</span>I am still working on finding sources. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="7.4" data-time="54.08">[00:54.08]</span>Professor: OK. I know I <span class="highlight">encourage</span> everyone in class to look at a <span class="highlight">substantial</span> number of sources, but I don't want you to get overwhelmed. <span class="time" data-times="6.44" data-time="61.48">[01:01.48]</span>Looking at a number of sources gives you a good knowledge <span class="highlight">base</span>, but students only have a limited <span class="highlight">amount</span> of time to work on each paper. <span class="time" data-times="3.77" data-time="67.92">[01:07.92]</span>I don't <span class="highlight">expect</span> you to read a <span class="highlight">dozen</span> books on whales for this <span class="highlight">assignment</span>. <span class="time" data-times="1.2" data-time="71.69">[01:11.69]</span> <span class="highlight">Focus</span> on just a few. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.21" data-time="72.89">[01:12.89]</span>Student: Ok. Thanks. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.96" data-time="74.1">[01:14.10]</span>Professor: You know, since you are already here. <span class="time" data-times="3.66" data-time="76.06">[01:16.06]</span>I can give you a quick <span class="highlight">summary</span> of how whales hold their breath underwater. <span class="time" data-times="5.33" data-time="79.72">[01:19.72]</span>It's just a matter of certain adaptations in their anatomies, <span class="highlight">specifically</span> in their <span class="highlight">circulatory</span> system. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.15" data-time="85.05">[01:25.05]</span>Student: So the blood flow is what makes the <span class="highlight">difference</span>? </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.85" data-time="87.2">[01:27.20]</span>Professor: Yes, and in a <span class="highlight">couple</span> of ways.<span class="time" data-times="4.21" data-time="89.05">[01:29.05]</span> First, blood makes up a larger share of a whale's weight than in other mammals. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.97" data-time="93.26">[01:33.26]</span>Student: So they can store more <span class="highlight">oxygen</span> because they have more blood? </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.8" data-time="96.23">[01:36.23]</span>Professor: Yes, but that's only part of it.<span class="time" data-times="5.22" data-time="98.03">[01:38.03]</span> They also have a greater <span class="highlight">capacity</span> than land animals to store <span class="highlight">oxygen</span> in their blood. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.06" data-time="103.25">[01:43.25]</span>Student: So how does having more <span class="highlight">oxygen</span> in their blood help them stay underwater longer? </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.87" data-time="107.31">[01:47.31]</span>Professor: It's the way the whale's blood carries <span class="highlight">oxygen</span> to the rest of its body. <span class="time" data-times="4.28" data-time="111.18">[01:51.18]</span>Whales carefully <span class="highlight">conserve</span> their <span class="highlight">oxygen</span> when underwater in a <span class="highlight">couple</span> of ways. <span class="time" data-times="5.12" data-time="115.46">[01:55.46]</span>When a whale dives, its <span class="highlight">metabolic</span> <span class="highlight">rate</span> drops, causing its heartbeat to slow down. <span class="time" data-times="6.44" data-time="120.58">[02:00.58]</span>And the blood flow to its muscles and some of its non-vital organs, like its kidneys, is also cut off. <span class="time" data-times="5.67" data-time="127.02">[02:07.02]</span>A whale's muscles and non-vital organs are able to <span class="highlight">function</span> without <span class="highlight">oxygen</span> for an extended period of time. </p>
