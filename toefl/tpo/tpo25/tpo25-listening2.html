              <p>Corresponding text: So, perhaps you're wondering why not let nature take its course now?</p>
              <p>Well, we can't. The main problem is today's fragmented habitats. During previous inter-glacial periods, when glaciers retreated they left behind open land in their wakes. Today, human development has paved over much of the natural world. Ecosystems are fragmented There are few corridors left for species to migrate through without help. What are the problems that you can try to solve? The article describes the migration of assisted migration and the introduction of migration as a natural law and a comparison with assisted migration. The last sentence, if it does not help, does not have enough space for the species to migrate. In turn, it is the information that A answers said.</p>

              <p>Translocated animals can become invasive too. It happened in Australia. The cane toad was introduced back in 1935 to control an insect pest that was destroying Australia's sugarcane plantations. But the cane toad themselves became a pest and has destroyed much of the wildlife on that continent If you don't know if the cane toad is defamatory, it doesn't matter. This example appears in the place where the assisted migration is not good, so just look for negative attitudes in the options. So the B item.</p>

Like animals that eat a certain plant and that plant relys on a certain fungus to help it get nutrients from soil.

The professor said that currently the assated migration is only discussed within the biological organization organization, but the relevant government decision-making strategy that at least manages natural resources should participate in the decision. Pay attention to questions, and turning sentences.</p>

              <p>But I and many other biologists will be watching very closely how this maverick group makes out, because like I said, there could be unintended consequences. After the article says that government supervision is needed, it mentions an example conservationists who spontaneously organized to protect Florida torreya. However, in the end the professor came to a sentence like I said there could be unintended consequences indicating B items, paying attention to keywords, In one case example, but turning words.</p>
