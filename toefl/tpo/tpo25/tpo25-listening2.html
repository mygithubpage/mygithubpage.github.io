Listen to part of a lecture in a <span class="highlight">Conservation</span><span class="highlight">Biology</span> class. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.83" data-time="5.42">[00:05.42]</span>Professor: One <span class="highlight">consequence</span> of global warming is <span class="highlight">extinction</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.15" data-time="10.25">[00:10.25]</span>There's <span class="highlight">compelling</span><span class="highlight">evidence</span> that global warming will be a <span class="highlight">significant</span> driver of many plant and animal extinctions in this <span class="highlight">century</span>. <span class="time" data-times="13.02" data-time="17.4">[00:17.40]</span>So we are considering various strategies to help some threatened <span class="highlight">species</span><span class="highlight">survive</span> this <span class="highlight">unprecedented</span>, this warming <span class="highlight">trend</span> which, as you know, is caused mainly by greenhouse gases produced by the burning of <span class="highlight">fossil</span> fuels. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.44" data-time="30.42">[00:30.42]</span>Um... the most <span class="highlight">radical</span><span class="highlight">strategy</span> being debated among <span class="highlight">conservation</span> biologists is Assisted <span class="highlight">Migration</span>. <span class="time" data-times="11.42" data-time="37.86">[00:37.86]</span>Assisted <span class="highlight">migration</span> means picking up members of a <span class="highlight">species</span>, or members of a group of interdependent <span class="highlight">species</span> and physically moving or translocating them. <span class="time" data-times="9.1" data-time="49.28">[00:49.28]</span>Um... translocating threatened <span class="highlight">species</span> to a cooler place, to higher latitudes or higher elevations, for example. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.37" data-time="58.38">[00:58.38]</span>Now, <span class="highlight">migration</span> is a natural <span class="highlight">survival</span><span class="highlight">strategy</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.43" data-time="63.75">[01:03.75]</span>Over the past two million years, colder <span class="highlight">glacial</span> periods have alternated with warmer <span class="highlight">interglacial</span> periods. <span class="time" data-times="8.38" data-time="70.18">[01:10.18]</span>And so, um, in <span class="highlight">response</span> to these <span class="highlight">gradual</span><span class="highlight">climatic</span> swings, some <span class="highlight">species</span> have shifted their ranges hundreds of kilometers. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.27" data-time="78.56">[01:18.56]</span>So perhaps you are wondering why not let nature take its <span class="highlight">course</span> now?<span class="time" data-times="1.62" data-time="82.83">[01:22.83]</span> Well, we can't. <span class="time" data-times="3.39" data-time="84.45">[01:24.45]</span>The main problem is today's fragmented habitats. <span class="time" data-times="6.2" data-time="87.84">[01:27.84]</span>During <span class="highlight">previous</span><span class="highlight">interglacial</span> periods, when glaciers retreated, they left behind open land in their wakes. <span class="time" data-times="4.01" data-time="94.04">[01:34.04]</span>Today human <span class="highlight">development</span> has paved over much of the natural world. <span class="time" data-times="2.29" data-time="98.05">[01:38.05]</span>Ecosystems are fragmented. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.33" data-time="100.34">[01:40.34]</span>Housing developments, highways and cities have replaced or sliced <span class="highlight">through</span> forests and prairies. <span class="time" data-times="5.12" data-time="105.67">[01:45.67]</span>There are few corridors left for <span class="highlight">species</span> to <span class="highlight">migrate</span><span class="highlight">through</span> without help.<span class="time" data-times="4.78" data-time="110.79">[01:50.79]</span>So conservationists are trying to <span class="highlight">save</span> as many <span class="highlight">species</span> as possible. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="8.81" data-time="115.57">[01:55.57]</span>Now, assisted <span class="highlight">migration</span> could become a <span class="highlight">viable</span> part of our <span class="highlight">rescue</span><span class="highlight">strategy</span>, but there are a number of uncertainties and risks. <span class="time" data-times="5.87" data-time="124.38">[02:04.38]</span>Without more research, we can't <span class="highlight">predict</span> if Assisted <span class="highlight">Migration</span> will work for any <span class="highlight">given</span><span class="highlight">species</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.05" data-time="130.25">[02:10.25]</span>A translocated <span class="highlight">species</span> could die out from <span class="highlight">lack</span> of food, for example. <span class="time" data-times="10.16" data-time="135.3">[02:15.30]</span>At the other <span class="highlight">extreme</span>, we might successfully translocate the <span class="highlight">species</span>, but <span class="highlight">within</span> five or ten years that <span class="highlight">species</span> could <span class="highlight">proliferate</span> and become an invasive <span class="highlight">species</span>. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.49" data-time="145.46">[02:25.46]</span>Like a non-native plant that chokes out native plants by hogging the nutrients in the soil.<span class="time" data-times="3.49" data-time="150.95">[02:30.95]</span>Translocated animals can become invasive too.<span class="time" data-times="1.7" data-time="154.44">[02:34.44]</span> It happened in Australia. <span class="time" data-times="7.01" data-time="156.14">[02:36.14]</span>The cane <span class="highlight">toad</span> was introduced back in 1935 to control an <span class="highlight">insect</span><span class="highlight">pest</span> that was destroying Australia's sugarcane plantations. <span class="time" data-times="5.23" data-time="163.15">[02:43.15]</span>But the cane <span class="highlight">toad</span> itself became a <span class="highlight">pest</span> and has destroyed much of the wildlife on that <span class="highlight">continent</span>. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.48" data-time="168.38">[02:48.38]</span>Also, many <span class="highlight">species</span> are interdependent, <span class="highlight">intimately</span> connected to one another.<span class="time" data-times="10.12" data-time="173.86">[02:53.86]</span>Like animals that eat a certain plant and that plant relies on a certain <span class="highlight">fungus</span> to help it get nutrients from soil and on a certain <span class="highlight">insect</span> for <span class="highlight">pollination</span>.<span class="time" data-times="6.52" data-time="183.98">[03:03.98]</span>We probably have to translocate entire networks of <span class="highlight">species</span> and it's hard to know where to <span class="highlight">draw</span> the <span class="highlight">line</span>. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="8.14" data-time="190.5">[03:10.50]</span>And in <span class="highlight">addition</span> to all that, it is not <span class="highlight">even</span><span class="highlight">clear</span> that assisted <span class="highlight">migration</span> or any <span class="highlight">migration</span> for that matter, will help at <span class="highlight">least</span> for some <span class="highlight">species</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.24" data-time="198.64">[03:18.64]</span>Earth was already in one of its warm <span

twenty-first <span class="highlight">century</span>, global temperatures are expected to rise two to six degrees. <span class="time" data-times="5.94" data-time="210.92">[03:30.92]</span>That <span

class="time" data-times="7.36" data-time="216.86">[03:36.86]</span>Um ... whether to use Assisted <span class="highlight">Migration</span>, this <span class="highlight">debate</span> is mostly <span

data-time="224.22">[03:44.22]</span>But the <span class="highlight">ultimate</span> decision-makers, in the United States at <span class="highlight">least</span>, will be the <span

there's no public <span class="highlight">policy</span> on using assisted <span class="highlight">migration</span> to help <span class="highlight">species</span><span class="highlight">survive</span><span class="highlight">climate</span> change. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="8.07" data-time="242.23">[04:02.23]</span>People aren't <span

data-times="9.88" data-time="250.3">[04:10.30]</span>In one case, a group of conservationists has already taken it upon itself to try on their own to <span class="highlight">save</span> an <span

data-times="7.42" data-time="260.18">[04:20.18]</span>There's only about a thousand <span class="highlight">individual</span> Florida Torrey as left.<span class="time" data-times="5.05" data-time="267.6">[04:27.60]</span> And global warming is expected to <span class="highlight">significantly</span> reduce or <span class="highlight">eliminate</span> this tree's <span

data-times="9999" data-time="281.86">[04:41.86]</span>The group believed its effort is justified, but I and many other biologists will be watching very closely how this maverick group makes out, because like I said, there could be unintended consequences. </p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the main purpose of the lecture?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To explain the government's role in the regulating assisted migration.</p><p>B. To discuss ways in which plants and animals adapt to climate change.</p><p>C. To discuss a controversial approach to conserving plant and animal species.</p><p>D. To describe a recently discovered consequence of global warming.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>In this article, due to climate warming, some scholars have proposed a bio-migration strategy to avoid the extinction of endangered species due to climate warming. Later professors discussed this strategy. The last sentence like I said there could be unintended consequences. , indicating that this program is controversial.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor, what problem is assisted migration intended to overcome?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To diminishing amount of undeveloped land that species can migrate through.</p><p>B. The relative lack of nutrients available in cooler latitudes and higher elevations.</p><p>C. The increase in alternations between cool and warm periods.</p><p>D. Competition from other species in certain native habitats.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>Corresponding text: So, perhaps you're wondering why not let nature take its course now?</p><p>Well, we can't. The main problem is today's fragmented habitats. During previous inter-glacial periods, when glaciers retreated they left behind open land in their wakes. Today, human development has paved over much of the natural world. Ecosystems are fragmented There are few corridors left for species to migrate through without help. What are the problems that you can try to solve? The article describes the migration of assisted migration and the introduction of migration as a natural law and a comparison with assisted migration. The last sentence, if it does not help, does not have enough space for the species to migrate. In turn, it is the information that A answers said.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What point does the professor make when she discusses the cane toad?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Translocated species sometimes die out from lack of food.</p><p>B. Translocated species may spread too quickly in their new environment.</p><p>C. Several techniques are available to achieve assisted migration.</p><p>D. Animal species are often easier to translocate than plant species are.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Translocated animals can become invasive too. It happened in Australia. The cane toad was introduced back in 1935 to control an insect pest that was destroying Australia's sugarcane plantations. But the cane toad themselves became a pest and has destroyed much of the wildlife on that continent If you don't know if the cane toad is defamatory, it doesn't matter. This example appears in the place where the assisted migration is not good, so just look for negative attitudes in the options. So the B item.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor imply when she mentions translocating networking of species?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. There are aspects of interdependency that are unknown.</p><p>B. Some species evolve in ways that help them survive in new habitats.</p><p>C. It is difficult to know how far to move a network of species from its native habitat.</p><p>D. Many assisted-migration plans should involve the translocation of just one species.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>Also, many species are interdependent, intimately connected to one another. Like animals that eat a certain plant and that plant relys on a certain fungus to help it get nutrients from soil. And on a certain insect for pollination, we have have to translocate entire Networks. This question is another bad thing about assisted migration, that is, interdependent dependencies. So choose A for this question.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor imply about the government's role in regulating assisted migration in the United States?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The government should continue to encourage assisted migration.</p><p>B. The government has created policies that have proved unhelpful.</p><p>C. The government should follow the example set by other countries.</p><p>D. The government needs to increase its involvement in the issue.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>That rate of heatings far greater than during the last glacial retreat some orders of years ago. The professor said that currently the assated migration is only discussed within the biological organization organization, but the relevant government decision-making strategy that at least manages natural resources should participate in the decision. Pay attention to questions, and turning sentences.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the professor's attitude toward the effort to save the Florida torreya?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. She is glad that some conservationists are willing to take a chance on assisted migration.</p><p>B. She is concerned because it may have unintended consequences.</p><p>C. She is surprised because other species are more endangered than Florida torreya is.</p><p>D. She expects the effort will have to be repeated several times before it succeeds.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>But I and many other biologists will be watching very closely how this maverick group makes out, because like I said, there could be unintended consequences. After the article says that government supervision is needed, it mentions an example conservationists who spontaneously organized to protect Florida torreya. However, in the end the professor came to a sentence like I said there could be unintended consequences indicating B items, paying attention to keywords, In one case example, but turning words.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
