        <h3>Listening Text</h3>
        <article>
          <p>Narrator: Listen to a conversation between a student and his academic advisor.</p>
          <p>:Professor: Hi, Mark. What can I do for you?</p>
          <p>:Student: I am just filling out this approval for graduation form for the dean's office, and I don't know, I hope I will be able to graduate next semester.</p>
          <p>:Professor: Well, as long as you've met the departmental requirements and you submit the form on time, you shouldn't have any problem.Make sure you include all the classes you will have taken for your degree in finance and the electives too.</p>
          <p>:Student: Yeah, but as I look over the form, I got confused because of the way, um...they've changed the requirements. So now I am not sure I will be qualified to graduate next semester. I know I would, before, under the old requirements.</p>
          <p>:Professor: Well, when the business department changed the curriculum to include more courses in international business, to ... well, because of the increasing globalization of business. We made sure that students who have finished their second year, that is, those who are in their third or fourth year, wouldn't be affected. The new rules only apply to students in their first or second year.</p>
          <p>:Student: That's good to know. Uh... the department's hiring new faculty too I heard, to teach some of the new courses. But I want to...</p>
          <p>:Professor: Yes. One new faculty member has been hired. She will be teaching International Banking as a matter of fact.</p>
          <p>:Student: Actually, that's what I want to ask about - International Banking. I took International Banking 1, but I never took International Banking 2. It used to be that the second semester of International Banking was an elective, but now it says it's a required class.</p>
          <p>:Professor: Yes. But that's one of the recent changes. So...</p>
          <p>:Student: Oh, Oh, OK. Oh. And ... and I am planning to take a management course next semester, but I don't know if it's ... if it will count toward my major.</p>
          <p>:Professor: What's the course?</p>
          <p>:Student: Organizational Behavior.</p>
          <p>:Professor: Yes. That will count toward your major. That's a difficult class, you know. But well worth it. So it looks like you will have all the required classes you need. You should be just fine. Uh... I assume you have taken a seminar?</p>
          <p>:Student: Yeah, I took the marketing seminar.</p>
          <p>:Professor: OK. You are looking good. Just to be on the safe side, why don't you talk to someone in the dean's office before you give them the form?</p>
          <p>:Student: OK. So should I just explain to them that even though one of these classes got changed from an elective to a required class, I don't have to take it?</p>
          <p>:Professor: Yes. You've met the requirements for graduation. And if there's something I need to do ... if I need to write a letter or whatever, just let me know.</p>
          <p>:Student: OK. Thanks. I'll let you know if I need that letter. </p>
