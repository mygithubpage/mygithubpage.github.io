              <span class="time" data-times="8.31" data-time="139.25">[02:19.25]</span>Student: OK. So should I just explain to them that <span class="underline">even</span> though one of these classes got changed from an <span class="underline">elective</span> to a required class, I don't have to take it? </p>
