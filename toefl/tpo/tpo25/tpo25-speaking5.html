I have to concentrate on my senior project for the history department. I have a lot to write and I don't want any distractions. The only major problem, though, is how I'll be getting to campus.</p><p>(woman) Oh, yeah?</p><p>(man) See, the apartment's a little far from campus and Jim has a car and he gives me rides to and from campus everyday. But I can't afford a car now.</p><p>(woman) So have you thought about taking public transportation, uh, the bus to campus?</p><p>(man) Yeah, I have. The thing is that there's no bus going directly to campus from that part of town. I'd have to change buses a couple of times on the way.</p><p>(woman) I see. That could take a lot of time.</p><p>(man) Right!</p><p>(woman) Hmm, well, maybe you should move back into a dormitory on campus. Request a single room. There's lots of them.</p><p>(man) Yeah, I thought about that. You know, I could live alone and get my work done but, I don't know, I would miss my apartment.</p><p>(woman) I know, but you've got to make some choice.</p></article></section><section id="question"><h4>Question</h4><p>Briefly summarize the problem the speakers are discussing. Then state which of the two solutions from the conversation you would recommend. Explain the reasons for your recommendation. </p></section><section id="sample-response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><article><p>Well, the man's major problem is that the man couldn't get a ride to campus from his roommate every day since his roommate will move out, and its a long way from his room to his campus. Accordingly, the woman offers two solutions for the man: he could take public transportation or he could just find a single room in the dorm on campus. Well, I kindda prefer the second solution for some reasons. First, public transportation would be a bad idea, because it is too time-consuming and as we all know the bus is always not on schedule. For example several minutes late of the bus would cause the man to be late for his class and it could happen every day. On the other hand, living on campus would be much better, since the man could always be punctual if he is not getting up late of course, and that'll save him much time and energy for better concentration on his study. So I recommend the second solution. (173 words)</p></article></section></main></body></html>
