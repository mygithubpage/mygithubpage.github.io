The ancestors of plants were <span class="highlight">photosynthetic</span> single-celled organisms that gave rise to plants <span class="highlight question1">presumably</span> lacked true roots, stems, leaves, and <span class="highlight">complex</span><span class="highlight">reproductive</span> structures such as flowers. All of these features appeared later in the <span class="highlight">evolutionary</span><span class="highlight">history</span> of plants. Of today's different groups of <span class="highlight">algae</span>, green <span class="highlight">algae</span> are probably the most <span class="highlight">similar</span> to ancestral plants. This supposition stems from the close <span class="highlight">phylogenetic</span> (natural <span class="highlight">evolutionary</span>) relationship between the two groups. DNA comparisons have shown that green <span class="highlight">algae</span> are plants' closest living relatives. In <span class="highlight">addition</span>, other lines of <span class="highlight">evidence</span> support the <span class="highlight">hypothesis</span> that land plants evolved from ancestral green <span class="highlight">algae</span> used the same type of <span class="highlight">chlorophyll</span> and <span class="highlight">accessory</span> pigments in <span class="highlight">photosynthesis</span> as do land plants. This would not be true of red and brown <span class="highlight">algae</span>. Green <span class="highlight">algae</span> store food as <span class="highlight">starch</span>, as do land plants and have <span class="highlight">cell</span> walls made of <span class="highlight">cellulose</span>, <span class="highlight">similar</span> in <span class="highlight">composition</span> to those of land plants. Again, the good <span class="highlight">storage</span> and <span class="highlight">cell</span> wall molecules of red and brown <span class="highlight">algae</span> are different.</p><p>Today green <span class="highlight">algae</span> live mainly in freshwater, suggesting that their early <span class="highlight">evolutionary</span><span class="highlight">history</span> may have occurred in freshwater habitats. If so, the green <span class="highlight">algae</span> would have been <span class="question3">subjected to</span><span class="highlight">environmental</span> pressures that resulted in adaptations that enhanced their <span class="highlight">potential</span> to give rise to land-dwelling or organisms.</p><p><span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>The <span class="highlight">environmental</span> conditions of freshwater habitats, unlike those of ocean habitats, are highly <span class="highlight">variable</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>Water <span class="highlight">temperature</span> can <span class="highlight">fluctuate</span> seasonally or <span class="highlight">even</span> daily and changing <span class="highlight">level</span> of <span class="highlight">rainfall</span> can <span class="highlight">lead</span> to fluctuations in the <span class="highlight">concentration</span> of chemical in 
the water or <span class="highlight">even</span> to period in which the <span class="highlight">aquatic</span><span class="highlight">habitat</span> dries up. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span><span class="highlight">Ancient</span> fresh water green <span class="highlight">algae</span> must have evolved features that enable them to <span class="highlight">withstand</span> extremes of 
<span class="highlight">temperature</span> and periods of dryness. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>These adaptations served their <span class="highlight">descendant</span> well asthey invaded land.</p><p>The <span class="highlight">terrestrial</span> world is green now, but it did not start out that way. When plants first made the <span class="highlight">transition</span> ashore more than 400 million years ago, the land was <span class="highlight">barren</span> and <span class="highlight"><span class="question5">desolate</span></span>, <span class="highlight">inhospitable</span> to life. <span class="question6">From a plant's <span class="highlight">evolutionary</span> view point, however, it was also a land of <span class="highlight">opportunity</span>, free of competitors and predators and full of <span class="highlight">carbon</span><span class="highlight">dioxide</span> and sunlight (the <span class="highlight">raw</span> materials for <span class="highlight">photosynthesis</span>, which are present in far higher concentrations in <span class="highlight">air</span> than in water</span>).So once natural <span class="highlight">selection</span> had shaped the adaptations that helped plants <span class="highlight">overcome</span> the obstacles to <span class="highlight">terrestrial</span> living, plants prospered and diversified.</p><p>When plants pioneered the land, they faced a <span class="highlight">range</span> of challenges <span class="question8">posed</span> by <span class="highlight">terrestrial</span> environments. On land, the supportive buoyancy of water is missing, the plant is no longer bathed in a <span class="highlight">nutrient</span><span class="highlight">solution</span>, and <span class="highlight">air</span> tends to dry things out. These conditions <span class="highlight">favored</span> the <span class="highlight">evolution</span> of the structures that support the body, vessels that <span class="highlight">transport</span> water and nutrients to all parts of plant, and structures that <span class="highlight">conserve</span> water. The resulting adaptations to dry land include some <span class="highlight">structural</span> features that arose early in plant <span class="highlight">evolution</span>; now these features are <span class="highlight">common</span> to <span class="highlight">virtually</span> all land plant. They include roots or <span class="highlight">root</span> like structures, a <span class="highlight">waxy</span> cuticle that covers the surfaces of leaves and stems and limits the <span class="highlight">evaporation</span> of water, and pores called stomata in leaves and stems that allow gas <span class="highlight">exchange</span> but close when water is <span class="highlight">scarce</span>, thus reducing water loss. Other adaptations occurred later in the <span class="highlight">transition</span> to <span class="highlight">terrestrial</span> life and now wide <span class="highlight">spread</span> but not universal among plants. These include conducting vessels that <span class="highlight">transport</span> water and minerals upward from the roots and that move the <span class="highlight">photosynthetic</span> products from the leavesto the rest of the plant body and the stiffening <span class="highlight">substance</span> lignin, which support the plant body, helping it <span class="highlight">expose</span><span class="highlight">maximum</span> surface area to sunlight.</p><p>These adaptations allowed an increasing <span class="highlight">diversity</span> of plant forms to <span class="highlight">exploit</span> dry land. Life on land, however, also required new methods of transporting <span class="highlight">sperm</span> to eggs. Unlike <span class="highlight">aquatic</span> and <span class="highlight">marine</span> forms, land plants cannot always <span class="highlight">rely</span> on water currents to carry their sex cells and <span class="highlight">disperse</span> their <span class="highlight">fertilized</span> eggs. So the most successful groups of land plants are those that evolved methods of <span class="highlight">fertilized</span> sex <span class="highlight">cell</span><span class="highlight">dispersal</span> that are <span class="highlight">independent</span> of water and structures that <span class="highlight">protest</span> developing embryos from drying out. Protected embryos and waterless <span class="highlight">dispersal</span> of sex cells were achieved with the <span class="highlight">origin</span> of seed plants and the key <span class="highlight">evolutionary</span> innovations that they introduced: <span class="highlight">pollen</span>, seeds, and later, flowers and fruits.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">presumably</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. originally</p><p>B. supposedly</p><p>C. obviously</p><p>D. usually</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Presumably, probably, so the correct answer is B's sup<span class="question8">posed</span>ly. Unknown classmates think of assume, which is called assumption or inference. Because the prefix pre only indicates direction or strengthening, the word roughly means same as assume. Substitution, plant ancestors are photosynthetic single-celled creatures, how to lack rhizomes, etc. Since the ancestors of the plants did not know that they were blind, the conclusion that the plants formed by single-cell organisms had no rhizomes and so on was a conjecture. The correct answer was B.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 1, all of the following are true of ancestral plants EXCEPT</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They had cellulose-based cell walls.</p><p>B. They were closely related to green algae</p><p>C. They were able to store nutrients</p><p>D. They had a sophisticated multicellular structure.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The D exclusion method, A's cellulose based cell walls and C's store nutrients can all be positioned to the penultimate sentence. Both options are correct and not selected. B's green D's multicellular structure is contrary to the original sentence's second sentence. , In fact, this question does not need to be excluded at all because the D option is directly opposite to the information in the previous question.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The phrase "<span class="highlight"><span class="question3">subjected to</span></span>" in the passage is closest in</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. restricted by</p><p>B. distant from</p><p>C. exposed to</p><p>D. combined with</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" C"><p>C been asked to: suffer, suffer. The A option is limited, B is away from, C is ex<span class="question8">posed</span>, and suffers; D options are combined with. According to the word meaning, C is the correct option.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What can be inferred from paragraph 3 about ancient green algae?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They lived in a generally wet environment that was sometimes dry</p><p>B. They adapted better to changes in water temperature than did to other changes in the environment.</p><p>C. They inhabited areas that were close to the ocean.</p><p>D. They had lived primarily on land</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A. Using the ancient green algae as the key word to locate the last two sentences, said that the ancient algae could tolerate extreme temperatures and a period of drought, which is exactly what A said is dry, so A is the answer. B compared the changes in water temperature and other factors, and the original did not give any relevant information, wrong; C's close to the ocean does not seem to be when the drought; D on land is not too dry?</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question5">desolate</span></span>"in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. dusty</p><p>B. hardened</p><p>C. deserted</p><p>D. dried out</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" C"><p>C <span class="question5">desolate</span>: <span class="question5">desolate</span>. The A option is dusty, the B option is hardened, the C option is ridiculous, and the D option is dry. According to the word meaning, C is the correct option.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Terrestrial plants had the advantages of not having rivals and having easy access to photosynthetic material</p><p>B. The abundance of photosynthetic material made life on land easier for pioneering plants</p><p>C. Once plants had eliminated their competitors and their predators, their evolutionary process proceeded smoothly.</p><p>D. Plant evolution eliminated competitors and made the process of photosynthesis more efficient.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A. The main key content of the whole sentence is: the land of opportunity, and this free of competitors and predators and full of carbon dioxide and sunlight is an appositive to this feature, which is complementary to land of opportunity. The A option covers this main content. The B option misses the free of competitors; the logical relationship of the C option once is wrong, and there is a big difference between the original sentence and the original sentence; the D option changes a lot.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, which of the following is true about the terrestrial world at the time it was colonized by plants?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. it was exposed to high levels of solar radiation</p><p>B. it contained a limited supply of carbon dioxide</p><p>C. it had developed 400million years earlier</p><p>D. it lacked the presence of any organisms</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D. Using the terrestrial world as the key word to locate the first sentence, saying that although it is very green now, it is not at first, just asking what kind of thing it was and looking at it. The next sentence says that when plants land on land, the land is ridiculous and barren, so the correct answer is D. There is no organism. But to be honest, I personally think that this answer is not good, but the first choice of A is also a problem. The original sunlight can't be replaced directly by solar radiation. In comparison, D is better, and B and C are completely incorrect.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>the word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question8">posed</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. shared</p><p>B. presented</p><p>C. strengthened</p><p>D. concealed</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>B pose: Propose, cause. A is shared, B is raised, appears, C is strengthened, and D is hidden. According to the word meaning, B is the correct option.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 5, all of the following are problems that early terrestrial plants had to overcome Except</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. a tendency to become dry</p><p>B. the inability to limit surface sunlight</p><p>C. the absence of a structure to support the body of the plant</p><p>D. the inability to transport water and minerals through the plant</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>BA's been dry positioned to the second sentence of air tends to dry things out, A correct, not selected; C's support the body and D's transport water and minerals to the third sentence, both answers are correct, not selected; B's sunlight was in the last sentence, but the difficulty with the question was not at all the same thing, wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What purpose does paragraph 5 serve in the larger discussion of the origins of terrestrial plants?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To emphasize how long it took for ancestral plants to adjust to life on land</p><p>B. To disprove the argument that land plants adapted easily to their new terrestrial environment</p><p>C. To explain how plant colonization changed the physical environment of the terrestrial world</p><p>D. To describe how ancestral plants solved the problems they confirmed in colonizing</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D Paragraph function: directly summarize the paragraph meaning. Paragraphs usually appear in the first sentence of the paragraph, and the first sentence of this paragraph is also obviously the subject sentence. The expressed meaning is that when plants open up land, they will encounter many environmental challenges. What follows is a description of what these specific challenges are and describes how these plants develop adaptations to adapt to these environments. At the end of the previous paragraph, I also said that adaptation helps plants to overcome difficulties. Obviously this paragraph follows the previous paragraph and describes how to overcome it. This matches the content of the D option.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to Paragraph 6, The adaptation made by terrestrial plants had which of the following effect?'</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Plants developed reproductive strategies usable in both land and water environment</p><p>B. the plant diversity achieved in water environments diminished on land</p><p>C. seed plants became the dominant species among plants</p><p>D. a greater range of plants was able to develop</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>Adaptation is used as a key word to locate the first sentence, saying that adaption makes the plants on the dry land more and more diversified, which is exactly the effect of the question, so the correct answer is D a greater range, more were available. The original water environment of A and B did not say anything; the seed plants of C did not say anything.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the following best describes the author's presentation of the information about land plants?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. the author provided and overview of the evolutionary relationships between specific species of algae and land plants</p><p>B. The author discusses the transformation plants underwent in the process of changing from an aquatic to a terrestrial environment</p><p>C. the author establishes a pattern of similarity between major land and water pant groups</p><p>D. The author resents evidence to support the hypothesis that plants first fully evolved in water before finding their way to land</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B. From the analysis of the full-text structure, the article means that the evolution of plants requires a lot of adaptation. Afterwards, it began to say that they lived in fresh water first and then invaded the land. However, they encountered many challenges, and then they evolved a lot of adaptations. Overcome these problems and start to diversify. This coincides with the contents of the B option and describes the transformation of plants from aquatic to terrestrial.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Scientists believe that chemical changes and a thicker exterior, among other things, may have helped ancient algae overcome the conditions in their environment..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D uses the ancient algae as a transition point to find the second sentence of the penultimate sentence, so the answer is not C or D. The penultimate sentence says that there are features that make them tolerant of extreme temperatures and droughts, and what character these are to be inserted into the sentence is just a very smooth transition with the following adaptations. The correct answer is D. In addition, among other things to be inserted in the sentence is also a good point.</p></div></div><div id="question14" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>In moving from water to land, ancestral plants overcame many obstacles in order to survive.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.Neither brown nor red algae are likely to be ancestors of plants because of their difference in pigmentation</p><p>B.The instability of freshwater habitats caused marine algae to develop adaptations to their harsh environment.</p><p>C.The colonization of land by plants was a major revolution in the history of Earth.</p><p>D.Terrestrial plants adjusted to life on land by undergoing structural changes that enabled them to support themselves, resist drying, and exchange gases.</p><p>E.To colonize new terrestrial habitats, plants needed to create a way of reproducing without water.</p><p>F.Once plants had overcome the challenges posed by terrestrial life, they prospered by becoming less diverse.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="BDE"><p>The Neither option is completely omitted from the original text. The original only says that the algae is ancestor. The instability option corresponds to the entire third paragraph of the original text. The major revolution of The colonization option is not mentioned in the original, please do not take it for granted, so it is wrong. The Terrestrial option corresponds to the original Throughout the fifth paragraph, the correct .To colonize option corresponds to the first half of the last paragraph. The correct .Once plants option is the opposite of the last paragraph.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
