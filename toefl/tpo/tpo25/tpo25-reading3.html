            <b>The Evolutionary Origin of Plants</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>The <span class="underline">evolutionary</span> <span class="underline">history</span> of plants has been <span class="underline">marked</span> by a <span class="underline">series</span> of adaptations. The ancestors of plants were <span class="underline">photosynthetic</span> single-celled organisms that gave rise to plants <span class="light"><span class="underline">presumably</span></span> lacked true roots, stems, leaves, and <span class="underline">complex</span> <span class="underline">reproductive</span> structures such as flowers. All of these features appeared later in the <span class="underline">evolutionary</span> <span class="underline">history</span> of plants. Of today's different groups of <span class="underline">algae</span>, green <span class="underline">algae</span> are probably the most <span class="underline">similar</span> to ancestral plants. This supposition stems from the close <span class="underline">phylogenetic</span> (natural <span class="underline">evolutionary</span>) relationship between the two groups. DNA comparisons have shown that green <span class="underline">algae</span> are plants' closest living relatives. In <span class="underline">addition</span>, other lines of <span class="underline">evidence</span> support the <span class="underline">hypothesis</span> that land plants evolved from ancestral green <span class="underline">algae</span> used the same type of <span class="underline">chlorophyll</span> and <span class="underline">accessory</span> pigments in <span class="underline">photosynthesis</span> as do land plants. This would not be true of red and brown <span class="underline">algae</span>. Green <span class="underline">algae</span> store food as <span class="underline">starch</span>, as do land plants and have <span class="underline">cell</span> walls made of <span class="underline">cellulose</span>, <span class="underline">similar</span> in <span class="underline">composition</span> to those of land plants. Again, the good <span class="underline">storage</span> and <span class="underline">cell</span> wall molecules of red and brown <span class="underline">algae</span> are different.</p>
          <p>Today green <span class="underline">algae</span> live mainly in freshwater, suggesting that their early <span class="underline">evolutionary</span> <span class="underline">history</span> may have occurred in freshwater habitats. If so, the green <span class="underline">algae</span> would have been subjected to <span class="underline">environmental</span> pressures that resulted in adaptations that enhanced their <span class="underline">potential</span> to give rise to land-dwelling or organisms.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A">
            </span>The <span class="underline">environmental</span> conditions of freshwater habitats, unlike those of ocean habitats, are highly <span class="underline">variable</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>Water <span class="underline">temperature</span> can <span class="underline">fluctuate</span> seasonally or <span class="underline">even</span> daily and changing <span class="underline">level</span> of <span class="underline">rainfall</span> can <span class="underline">lead</span> to fluctuations in the <span class="underline">concentration</span> of chemical in 
the water or <span class="underline">even</span> to period in which the <span class="underline">aquatic</span> <span class="underline">habitat</span> dries up. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span> <span class="underline">Ancient</span> fresh water green <span class="underline">algae</span> must have evolved features that enable them to <span class="underline">withstand</span> extremes of 
<span class="underline">temperature</span> and periods of dryness. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>These adaptations served their <span class="underline">descendant</span> well asthey invaded land.</p>
          <p>The <span class="underline">terrestrial</span> world is green now, but it did not start out that way. When plants first made the <span class="underline">transition</span> ashore more than 400 million years ago, the land was <span class="underline">barren</span> and <span class="underline">desolate</span>, <span class="underline">inhospitable</span> to life. From a plant's <span class="underline">evolutionary</span> view point, however, it was also a land of <span class="underline">opportunity</span>, free of competitors and predators and full of <span class="underline">carbon</span> <span class="underline">dioxide</span> and sunlight (the <span class="underline">raw</span> materials for <span class="underline">photosynthesis</span>, which are present in far higher concentrations in <span class="underline">air</span> than in water).So once natural <span class="underline">selection</span> had shaped the adaptations that helped plants <span class="underline">overcome</span> the obstacles to <span class="underline">terrestrial</span> living, plants prospered and diversified.</p>
          <p>When plants pioneered the land, they faced a <span class="underline">range</span> of challenges posed by <span class="underline">terrestrial</span> environments. On land, the supportive buoyancy of water is missing, the plant is no longer bathed in a <span class="underline">nutrient</span> <span class="underline">solution</span>, and <span class="underline">air</span> tends to dry things out. These conditions <span class="underline">favored</span> the <span class="underline">evolution</span> of the structures that support the body, vessels that <span class="underline">transport</span> water and nutrients to all parts of plant, and structures that <span class="underline">conserve</span> water. The resulting adaptations to dry land include some <span class="underline">structural</span> features that arose early in plant <span class="underline">evolution</span>; now these features are <span class="underline">common</span> to <span class="underline">virtually</span> all land plant. They include roots or <span class="underline">root</span> like structures, a <span class="underline">waxy</span> cuticle that covers the surfaces of leaves and stems and limits the <span class="underline">evaporation</span> of water, and pores called stomata in leaves and stems that allow gas <span class="underline">exchange</span> but close when water is <span class="underline">scarce</span>, thus reducing water loss. Other adaptations occurred later in the <span class="underline">transition</span> to <span class="underline">terrestrial</span> life and now wide <span class="underline">spread</span> but not universal among plants. These include conducting vessels that <span class="underline">transport</span> water and minerals upward from the roots and that move the <span class="underline">photosynthetic</span> products from the leavesto the rest of the plant body and the stiffening <span class="underline">substance</span> lignin, which support the plant body, helping it <span class="underline">expose</span> <span class="underline">maximum</span> surface area to sunlight.</p>
          <p>These adaptations allowed an increasing <span class="underline">diversity</span> of plant forms to <span class="underline">exploit</span> dry land. Life on land, however, also required new methods of transporting <span class="underline">sperm</span> to eggs. Unlike <span class="underline">aquatic</span> and <span class="underline">marine</span> forms, land plants cannot always <span class="underline">rely</span> on water currents to carry their sex cells and <span class="underline">disperse</span> their <span class="underline">fertilized</span> eggs. So the most successful groups of land plants are those that evolved methods of <span class="underline">fertilized</span> sex <span class="underline">cell</span> <span class="underline">dispersal</span> that are <span class="underline">independent</span> of water and structures that <span class="underline">protest</span> developing embryos from drying out. Protected embryos and waterless <span class="underline">dispersal</span> of sex cells were achieved with the <span class="underline">origin</span> of seed plants and the key <span class="underline">evolutionary</span> innovations that they introduced: <span class="underline">pollen</span>, seeds, and later, flowers and fruits.</p>
