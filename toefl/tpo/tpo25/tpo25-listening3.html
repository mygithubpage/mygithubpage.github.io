            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.33" data-time="4.46">[00:04.46]</span>Professor: So I just finished reviewing your papers on the influence of <span class="underline">nationalism</span> on the composers' music. <span class="time" data-times="8.99" data-time="11.79">[00:11.79]</span>And <span class="underline">initially</span> I was surprised none of you chose to write about Béla Bartók, that is until I remembered we haven't had a <span class="underline">chance</span> to discuss him in class yet. <span class="time" data-times="3.4" data-time="20.78">[00:20.78]</span>He was a wonderful and ground-breaking <span class="underline">composer</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.48" data-time="24.18">[00:24.18]</span>Béla Bartók was a Hungarian, whose life stretched from the late nineteenth <span class="underline">century</span> to the middle of twentieth <span class="underline">century</span>.<span class="time" data-times="6.44" data-time="32.66">[00:32.66]</span> But he was not a fan of the <span class="underline">Romantic</span> style of music that was <span class="underline">popular</span> in his homeland during his youth. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.15" data-time="39.1">[00:39.10]</span>Student: Wait, Hungary wasn't a country in 1900, was it? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.02" data-time="43.25">[00:43.25]</span>Professor: You are right. <span class="time" data-times="0.96" data-time="44.27">[00:44.27]</span>I should have been <span class="underline">clear</span>.<span class="time" data-times="6.36" data-time="45.23">[00:45.23]</span> Bartok was born in Austria-Hungary, a nation that broke apart when he was about forty years old. <span class="time" data-times="3.81" data-time="51.59">[00:51.59]</span>Actually, the town where he was born is presently part of Romania. <span class="time" data-times="3.08" data-time="55.4">[00:55.40]</span>The <span class="underline">political</span> <span class="underline">history</span> of that <span class="underline">region</span> is <span class="underline">complex</span>.<span class="time" data-times="4.77" data-time="58.48">[00:58.48]</span> <span class="underline">Suffice</span> to say that Bartok is generally known as a Hungarian <span class="underline">composer</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="12.57" data-time="63.25">[01:03.25]</span>So during Bartók's youth, the music played in the <span class="underline">concert</span> halls of Austria-Hungary was dominated by <span class="underline">Romantic</span> pieces by mostly German composers. <span class="time" data-times="2.46" data-time="75.82">[01:15.82]</span>We discussed the <span class="underline">Romantic</span> style last week. <span class="time" data-times="2.67" data-time="78.28">[01:18.28]</span>These pieces were long and lyrical. <span class="time" data-times="3.7" data-time="80.95">[01:20.95]</span>They were meant to have a <span class="underline">sort</span> of <span class="underline">grandeur</span> about them. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.77" data-time="84.65">[01:24.65]</span>And in the early 1900s, composers who worked in the <span class="underline">Romantic</span> style were the most <span class="underline">popular</span> in Austria-Hungary. <span class="time" data-times="5.85" data-time="91.42">[01:31.42]</span>But Bartok, he was part of the <span class="underline">musical</span> <span class="underline">community</span> that was trying to change this. <span class="time" data-times="4.88" data-time="97.27">[01:37.27]</span>And it led him to ... well, the first thing it did was <span class="underline">lead</span> him to travel.<span class="time" data-times="11.42" data-time="102.15">[01:42.15]</span>He looked at the countryside for the music of the farmers and the people who lived in small towns, and their music, well, you could say he discovered the music that was <span class="underline">popular</span> in those areas. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.26" data-time="113.57">[01:53.57]</span>Student: What do you mean? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.09" data-time="117.83">[01:57.83]</span>Professor: Well, all the music we have been talking about the past few weeks, it really was all in the cities, that's where the composers and the orchestras were. <span class="time" data-times="9.68" data-time="126.92">[02:06.92]</span>Out in <span class="underline">remote</span> areas of the countryside, in <span class="underline">rural</span> locations, music was more <span class="underline">traditional</span>, the same songs that were enjoyed by <span class="underline">previous</span> generations. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.27" data-time="136.6">[02:16.60]</span>Bartók went out, he travelled to a <span class="underline">significant</span> <span class="underline">portion</span> of Eastern Europe actually.<span class="time" data-times="5.76" data-time="141.87">[02:21.87]</span> He roamed the countryside and listened to the music heard in small towns and in all sorts of celebrations. <span class="time" data-times="9.57" data-time="147.63">[02:27.63]</span>He attended weddings, dances and <span class="underline">religious</span> ceremonies, where he heard a very different <span class="underline">sort</span> of music from the <span class="underline">Romantic</span> <span class="underline">stuff</span> being played in the <span class="underline">concert</span> halls in the cities. <span class="time" data-times="4.02" data-time="157.2">[02:37.20]</span>The music he heard is what we would <span class="underline">consider</span> folk music. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.87" data-time="161.22">[02:41.22]</span>Student: And then he had those same songs played in the <span class="underline">concert</span> halls? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.71" data-time="165.09">[02:45.09]</span>Professor: No. At first he went around to document the folk music. <span class="time" data-times="4.76" data-time="168.8">[02:48.80]</span>He really <span class="underline">wanted</span> to make sure the folk songs were written down before they disappeared. <span class="time" data-times="5.21" data-time="173.56">[02:53.56]</span>In fact, Bartók didn't start out the <span class="underline">trip</span> thinking of himself as a <span class="underline">composer</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.52" data-time="178.77">[02:58.77]</span>He was an ethnomusicologist.<span class="time" data-times="2.67" data-time="181.29">[03:01.29]</span> He studied the <span class="underline">traditional</span> music of the <span class="underline">region</span>. <span class="time" data-times="10.72" data-time="183.96">[03:03.96]</span>But it turns out that what would later have a <span class="underline">notable</span> influence on European music on the whole, was the way Bartók used elements he heard in folk songs in his own compositions. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.52" data-time="194.68">[03:14.68]</span>He adopted a number of elements from what he heard, like unusual rhythms. <span class="time" data-times="7.46" data-time="199.2">[03:19.20]</span>And he liked to use the glissando as his hallmark, which he probably got from listening to Croatian folk music. <span class="time" data-times="4.46" data-time="206.66">[03:26.66]</span>A glissando is ... well, I have got a recording of Bartok here.<span class="time" data-times="2.62" data-time="211.12">[03:31.12]</span> Let's wait until the music is fresh in our minds. <span class="time" data-times="6.31" data-time="213.74">[03:33.74]</span>Susie, do you have something you want to ask first? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.96" data-time="220.05">[03:40.05]</span>Student: Yeah. Before, you <span class="underline">mention</span> <span class="underline">nationalism</span> and... </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.3" data-time="224.01">[03:44.01]</span>Professor: Ah, right, yes.<span class="time" data-times="6.32" data-time="225.31">[03:45.31]</span> When Bartok had his new pieces performed, their folk music roots made them <span class="underline">instantly</span> <span class="underline">popular</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.73" data-time="231.63">[03:51.63]</span>It happened to be a time of strong <span class="underline">nationalism</span> in Austria-Hungary, so his compositions came at just the right time. <span class="time" data-times="2.75" data-time="238.36">[03:58.36]</span>He became very successful there. <span class="time" data-times="12.96" data-time="241.11">[04:01.11]</span>Particularly, when Bartok's ballet The Wooden Prince opened, there was great excitement for music that included <span class="underline">musical</span> elements from <span class="underline">local</span> folk songs, music that reflected the <span class="underline">region</span>'s <span class="underline">musical</span> traditions. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="254.07">[04:14.07]</span>However, as <span class="underline">popular</span> as Bartok was in his homeland, he did not get much international <span class="underline">recognition</span> during his lifetime. </p>
