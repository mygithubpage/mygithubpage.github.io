            <b>The Decline of Venetian Shipping</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>In the late thirteenth <span class="highlight">century</span>, northern Italian cities such as Genoa, Florence, and Venice began an <span class="highlight">economic</span><span class="question1">resurgence</span> that made them into the most important <span class="highlight">economic</span> centers of Europe. By the seventeenth <span class="highlight">century</span>, however, other European powers had taken over, as the Italian cities lost much of their <span class="highlight">economic</span> might.</p>
          <p>This <span class="highlight">decline</span> can be seen clearly in the changes that affected Venetian shipping and <span class="highlight">trade</span>. First, Venic's <span class="highlight">intermediary</span> functions in the Adriatic Sea, where it had dominated the business of 
shipping for other parties, were lost to direct trading. In the fifteenth <span class="highlight">century</span> there was little problem recruiting sailors to row the galleys (large ships propelled by oars): 
guilds (business associations) were required to provide rowers, and <span class="highlight">through</span> a <span class="highlight">draft</span> system free citizens served <span class="question2">compulsorily </span>when called for. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>In the early sixteenth <span class="highlight">century</span> the <span class="highlight">shortage</span> 
of rowers was not serious because the demand for galleys was limited by a move to round ships (round-hulled ships with more <span class="highlight">cargo</span> <span class="highlight">space</span>), with required fewer rowers. 
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>But the <span class="highlight">shortage</span> of crews proved to be a greater and greater problem, despite <span class="highlight">continuous</span> <span class="highlight">appeal</span> to Venic's tradition of <span class="highlight">maritime</span> greatness.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span> <span class="highlight">Even</span> though sailors' wages doubled among the northern Italian cities from 1550 to 1590, this did not <span class="highlight">elicit</span> an increased <span class="highlight">supply</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p>
          <p>The problem in shipping extended to the Arsenale, Venice's huge and powerful shipyard. <span class="highlight">Timber</span> ran short, and it was necessary to procure it from farther and farther away. In <span class="highlight">ancient</span> Roman times, the Italian <span class="highlight">peninsula</span> had great forest of fir preferred for warships, but <span class="highlight">scarcity</span> was <span class="highlight">apparent</span> as early as the early fourteenth <span class="highlight">century</span>. Arsenale officers first brought <span class="highlight">timber</span> from the foothills of the Alps, then from north toward Trieste, and finally from <span class="highlight">across</span> the Adriatic. Private shipbuilders were required to buy their <span class="highlight">oak</span> <span class="highlight">abroad</span>. As the costs of shipbuilding rose, Venice clung to its <span class="question5">outdated <span class="highlight"></span>standard</span> while the Dutch were <span class="highlight">innovation</span> in the lighter and more easily handled ships.</p>
          <p>The step from buying foreign <span class="highlight">timber</span> to buying foreign ships was regarded as a short one, especially when complaints were heard in the <span class="highlight">latter</span> sixteenth <span class="highlight">century</span> that the standards and traditions of the Arsenale were running down. Work was stretched out and done poorly. Older workers had been allowed to stop work a half hour before the <span class="highlight">regular</span> time, and in 1601 younger works left with them. Merchants complained that the privileges reserved for Venetian-built and owned ships were first extended to those Venetians who bought ships from <span class="highlight">abroad</span> and then to foreign-built and owned vessels. <span class="question8">Historian Frederic Lane observes that after the loss of ships in battle in the late sixteenth <span class="highlight">century</span>, the shipbuilding <span class="highlight">industry</span> no longer had the <span class="highlight">capacity</span> to <span class="highlight">recover</span> that it had displayed at the start of the <span class="highlight">century</span>.</span></p>
          <p>The <span class="highlight"><span class="question9">conventional</span> </span>explanation for the loss of Venetian dominance in <span class="highlight">trade</span> is <span class="highlight">establishment</span> of the Portuguese direct sea <span class="highlight">route</span> to the East, replacing the overland Silk Road from the Black sea and the highly <span class="highlight">profitable</span> Indian Ocean-caravan-eastern <span class="highlight">Mediterranean</span> <span class="highlight">route</span> to Venice. The Portuguese Vasco da Gama's <span class="highlight">Voyage</span> around southern Africa to India took place at the end of the fifteenth <span class="highlight">century</span>, and by 1502 the trans- Abrabian <span class="highlight">caravan</span> <span class="highlight">route</span> had been cut off by <span class="highlight">political</span> <span class="highlight">unrest</span>.</p>
          <p>The Venetian <span class="highlight">Council</span> finally allowed round ships to enter the <span class="highlight">trade</span> that was <span class="highlight">previously</span> reserved for <span class="highlight">merchant</span> galleys, thus reducing <span class="highlight">transport</span> <span class="highlight">cost</span> by one third. Prices of spices delivered by ship from the eastern <span class="highlight">Mediterranean</span> came to <span class="highlight">equal</span> those of spices transported by Paortuguese vessels, but the increase in <span class="highlight">quantity</span> with both routes in operation drove the price far down. <span class="highlight">Gradually</span>, Venice's role as a <span class="highlight">storage</span> and <span class="highlight">distribution</span> center for spices and silk, dyes cotton, and gold <span class="highlight">decayed</span>, and by the early seventeenth <span class="highlight">century</span> Venice had lost its <span class="highlight">monopoly</span> in markets such as France and southern Germany.</p>
          <p>Venetian shipping had started to <span class="highlight">decline</span> from about 1530-before the <span class="highlight">entry</span> into the <span class="highlight">Mediterranean</span> of large volumes of Dutch and British shipping-and was clearly outclassed by the end of the <span class="highlight">century</span>. A <span class="highlight">contemporary</span> of Shakespeare (1564-1616) observed that the <span class="highlight">productivity</span> of Italian shipping had declined, compared with that of the British, because of conservatism and loss of <span class="highlight">expertise</span>. Moreover, Italian sailors were deserting and emigrating, and captains, no longer recruited from the ranks of nobles, were weak on navigations.</p>
