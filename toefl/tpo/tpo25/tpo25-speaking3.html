Beginning this year, however, the university will hold two graduation ceremonies. Under the new arrangement, half the graduating students will participate in the first ceremony, and the other half will participate in a second ceremony to be held the following day. Administrators cite two reasons for the change. First, the number of students has increased in recent years, and since diplomas are awarded individually, the single ceremony has become uncomfortably long. Also, the hall where the ceremony is held is too small to accommodate the growing audience of friends and family members.</p></article></section><div><audio src="tpo25-speaking3.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></div><section id="listening-text"><h3>Listening Text</h3><article><p>Now listen to two students discussing the article.</p><p>(woman) You know, I wish they wouldn't do this.</p><p>(man) Why?</p><p>(woman) Well, I think it's unnecessary, I mean, as far as the first reason goes. Yeah, sure, it takes a long time to have everyone receive their diploma individually, especially now that there are more students, but there's an easy way to make it shorter.</p><p>(man) What's that?</p><p>(woman) Reduce the number of speeches. I mean, a lot of people give speeches, students, professors, administrators, the president of the university. Do we really need that many speeches?</p><p>(man) Probably not, and a lot of the speeches are pretty boring anyway, so, yeah, we probably could cut out a few.</p><p>(woman) Yeah, and I don't think their second reason's very good either, about the space.</p><p>(man) How's that?</p><p>(woman) The problem isn't the size of the hall. It's that they allow students to invite too many people to come and watch. All they need to do is reduce the number of guests each graduating student gets to invite.</p><p>(man) Yeah, I guess that could solve the problem.</p><p>(woman) Yeah, I mean, right now each graduating student can invite up to ten people. That's too many. At most schools, students only get to invite like four or five people. It we just said, "OK, you can only invite six people." That'll still be more than most other schools and the ceremony could stay the way it is.</p></article></section><section id="question"><h4>Question</h4><p>The woman expresses her opinion about the university's plan. Briefly summarize the plan. Then state her opinion and explain the reasons she gives for holding that opinion. </p></section><section id="sample-response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><article><p>According to the university's plan, the university is changing the number of graduation ceremonies from one to two for two reasons. However the woman disagrees with the plan for some specific reasons. First of all, she think it's unnecessary to hold two ceremonies because the speeches can be reduced, such as speeches of the students, professors, administrators and the president. She doesn't think the students need so many speeches. Secondly, she thinks the size of the hall doesn't matter at all since the students don't have to invite so many guests to come and watch. Compared to other universities that allow the students to invite four or five people, she believes that six people will be enough for the university's ceremony. So the woman is against the plan for the reasons stated above. (132 words)</p></article></section></main></body></html>
