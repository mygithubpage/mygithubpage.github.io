lecture in a <span class="highlight">history</span> class. <span class="time" data-times="3.7" data-time="3.72">[00:03.72]</span>The professor has been discussing Egyptian Hieroglyphs. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="10.97" data-time="7.42">[00:07.42]</span>Professor: Egyptian Hieroglyphs are the <span class="highlight">ancient</span> Egyptian writings found in <span class="highlight">ancient</span> Egypt on walls, monuments and on the inside and outside of temples. <span class="time" data-times="4.42" data-time="18.39">[00:18.39]</span>Hieroglyphic writing ended <span class="highlight">abruptly</span> about 1600 years ago.<span class="time" data-times="7.15" data-time="22.81">[00:22.81]</span> And it mystified the most <span class="highlight">brilliant</span> minds in the study of Egyptian artifacts and <span class="highlight">archaeology</span> for many many centuries. <span class="time" data-times="8.59" data-time="29.96">[00:29.96]</span>Finally, the possibility of deciphering hieroglyphs came about with the discovery, in 1799, of the Rosetta Stone. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="8.83" data-time="38.55">[00:38.55]</span>The Rosetta Stone is arguably the most famous <span class="highlight">archaeological</span><span class="highlight">artifact</span> ever discovered.<span class="time" data-times="8.27" data-time="47.38">[00:47.38]</span>It contains the same <span class="highlight">exact</span> text written in three different alphabets: Greek, demotic, and hieroglyphic. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="9.68" data-time="55.65">[00:55.65]</span>But we didn't <span class="highlight">even</span> know at first that the three texts on the Rosetta Stone <span class="highlight">contain</span> the same information. <span class="time" data-times="7.87" data-time="65.33">[01:05.33]</span>And two of the three alphabets are <span class="highlight">ancient</span> Egyptian scripts that stop being used: the hieroglyphic and the demotic. <span class="time" data-times="8.01" data-time="73.2">[01:13.20]</span>The demotic <span class="highlight">script</span> found on the Rosetta Stone, well, demotic was not as <span class="highlight">elaborate</span> as hieroglyphic writing. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.19" data-time="81.21">[01:21.21]</span>It was used for more <span class="highlight">mundane</span> matters, oh, like administrative documents. <span class="time" data-times="4.8" data-time="86.4">[01:26.40]</span>These <span class="highlight">ancient</span> Egyptian scripts were replaced by Coptic scripts. <span class="time" data-times="8.63" data-time="91.2">[01:31.20]</span>But <span class="highlight">eventually</span>, the Arabic language replaced Coptic and this cut off the <span class="highlight">linguistic</span> link between <span class="highlight">ancient</span> and modern Egypt. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="10.94" data-time="99.83">[01:39.83]</span>Now, the Rosetta Stone was <span class="highlight">remarkable</span> because as I said, on it, was the same text in three different alphabets: Greek, demotic and hieroglyphic. <span class="time" data-times="6.17" data-time="110.77">[01:50.77]</span>The Stone was <span class="highlight">essentially</span> the dictionary that scholars needed to <span class="highlight">interpret</span> the meaning of the hieroglyphs. <span class="time" data-times="6.82" data-time="116.94">[01:56.94]</span>And it took a uniquely equipped researcher to finally <span class="highlight">decipher</span> and understand what was written on the stone. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="10.7" data-time="123.76">[02:03.76]</span>Thomas young, an English <span class="highlight">scholar</span>, was the first to seriously <span class="highlight">attempt</span> to <span class="highlight">decipher</span> the symbols on the Rosetta Stone. <span class="time" data-times="7.94" data-time="134.46">[02:14.46]</span>He suspected rightly that the hieroglyphs were phonetic symbols, that they represented its sounds rather than pictures. <span class="time" data-times="8.03" data-time="142.4">[02:22.40]</span>Until then, all scholars assumed that hieroglyphs were pictographs, that they <span class="highlight">symbolize</span> objects or concepts. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="9.75" data-time="150.43">[02:30.43]</span>Thomas Young focused his <span class="highlight">attention</span> on one set of hieroglyphs that he thought would probably spell out a single word: the name of a King or Queen. <span class="time" data-times="11.14" data-time="160.18">[02:40.18]</span>He guessed that the symbols represented the name of the early Egyptian ruler <span class="highlight">Ptolemy</span>, since <span class="highlight">Ptolemy</span> was also written in Greek on the stone and was indeed a Greek name.<span class="time" data-times="7.3" data-time="171.32">[02:51.32]</span>And Young did actually prove that these hieroglyphs represented sounds rather than whole words. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.72" data-time="178.62">[02:58.62]</span>Strangely though, he gave into the <span class="highlight">dominant</span><span class="highlight">thesis</span> of the day that hieroglyphs were pictographs. <span class="time" data-times="8.78" data-time="185.34">[03:05.34]</span>He actually dismissed his own findings as an <span class="highlight">anomaly</span> because the Ptolemaic dynasty was Greek, not Egyptian. <span class="time" data-times="3.85" data-time="194.12">[03:14.12]</span>In other words, he figured it was an <span class="highlight">exception</span> to the rule.<span class="time" data-times="4.21" data-time="197.97">[03:17.97]</span> It was phonetic because it was Greek, not Egyptian. <span class="time" data-times="4.67" data-time="202.18">[03:22.18]</span>How else could an Egyptian <span class="highlight">depict</span> a Greek name other than spell it out? <span class="time" data-times="7.98" data-time="206.85">[03:26.85]</span>And that brings us to the hero of our story: Jean-Francois Champollion. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="12.25" data-time="214.83">[03:34.83]</span>Champollion built on Young's work, showing that different hieroglyphs spelled the names of Kings and Queens like Alexander or Cleopatra. <span class="time" data-times="5.55" data-time="227.08">[03:47.08]</span>But his critics <span class="highlight">noted</span> that this was still not <span class="highlight">traditional</span> Egyptian names. <span class="time" data-times="6.16" data-time="232.63">[03:52.63]</span>He hadn't done any more than Young had been able to do, so he couldn't disprove the <span class="highlight">dominant</span><span class="highlight">theory</span>. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="9.31" data-time="238.79">[03:58.79]</span>Then in 1822, Champollion was shown a set of hieroglyphs that <span class="highlight">contain</span><span class="highlight">traditional</span> Egyptian names. <span class="time" data-times="13.44" data-time="248.1">[04:08.10]</span>The first two of these symbols were unknown, but Champollion knew that the repeated hieroglyphs to the far right symbolized an "S" <span class="highlight">sound</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.91" data-time="261.54">[04:21.54]</span>He then drew on his <span class="highlight">linguistic</span> knowledge to arrive at the <span class="highlight">solution</span> to the problem. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.82" data-time="266.45">[04:26.45]</span>You see, unlike any of the other scholars who had tried to <span class="highlight">crack</span> the <span class="highlight">code</span>, Champollion happened to be fluent in Coptic. <span class="time" data-times="8.24" data-time="274.27">[04:34.27]</span>He wondered, and this was the real <span class="highlight">breakthrough</span>, if Coptic was the language symbolized by the hieroglyphs on the Rosetta stone. <span class="time" data-times="6.54" data-time="282.51">[04:42.51]</span>And if so, then perhaps that first disc-shape <span class="highlight">symbol</span> might <span class="highlight">represent</span> the Sun. <span class="time" data-times="3.46" data-time="289.05">[04:49.05]</span>And the Coptic word for Sun is "ra". <span class="time" data-times="2.04" data-time="292.51">[04:52.51]</span>See where this is headed? </p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.97" data-time="294.55">[04:54.55]</span>So if the <span class="highlight">symbol</span> were Coptic, the first <span class="highlight">symbol</span> would be "ra". <span class="time" data-times="4.74" data-time="299.52">[04:59.52]</span>And then an unknown <span class="highlight">symbol</span> followed by a double "S" <span class="highlight">sound</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.85" data-time="304.26">[05:04.26]</span>Was this, Champollion wondered, the name Rameses? <span class="time" data-times="3.5" data-time="309.11">[05:09.11]</span>He was <span class="highlight">eventually</span> able to <span class="highlight">confirm</span> that it was. <span class="time" data-times="2.19" data-time="312.61">[05:12.61]</span>So, he had figured it out. <span class="time" data-times="8.52" data-time="314.8">[05:14.80]</span>Hieroglyphs were mainly phonetic, they represented sounds, not pictures, and the <span class="highlight">underlying</span> language was Coptic. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="323.32">[05:23.32]</span>A lot of work remained, but Champollion had cracked the <span class="highlight">code</span>.
