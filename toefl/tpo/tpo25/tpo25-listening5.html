part of a lecture in a <span class="highlight">history</span> class. <span class="time" data-times="3.7" data-time="3.72">[00:03.72]</span>The professor has been discussing Egyptian Hieroglyphs. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="10.97" data-time="7.42">[00:07.42]</span>Professor: Egyptian Hieroglyphs are the <span class="highlight">ancient</span> Egyptian writings found in <span class="highlight">ancient</span> Egypt on walls, monuments and on the inside and outside of temples. <span class="time" data-times="4.42" data-time="18.39">[00:18.39]</span>Hieroglyphic writing ended <span class="highlight">abruptly</span> about 1600 years ago.<span class="time" data-times="7.15" data-time="22.81">[00:22.81]</span> And it mystified the most <span class="highlight">brilliant</span> minds in the study of Egyptian artifacts and <span class="highlight">archaeology</span> for many many centuries. <span class="time" data-times="8.59" data-time="29.96">[00:29.96]</span>Finally, the possibility of deciphering hieroglyphs came about with the discovery, in 1799, of the Rosetta Stone. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="8.83" data-time="38.55">[00:38.55]</span>The Rosetta Stone is arguably the most famous <span class="highlight">archaeological</span><span class="highlight">artifact</span> ever discovered.<span class="time" data-times="8.27" data-time="47.38">[00:47.38]</span>It contains the same <span class="highlight">exact</span> text written in three different alphabets: Greek, demotic, and hieroglyphic. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="9.68" data-time="55.65">[00:55.65]</span>But we didn't <span class="highlight">even</span> know at first that the three texts on the Rosetta Stone <span class="highlight">contain</span> the same information. <span class="time" data-times="7.87" data-time="65.33">[01:05.33]</span>And two of the three alphabets are <span class="highlight">ancient</span> Egyptian scripts that stop being used: the hieroglyphic and the demotic. <span class="time" data-times="8.01" data-time="73.2">[01:13.20]</span>The demotic <span class="highlight">script</span> found on the Rosetta Stone, well, demotic was not as <span class="highlight">elaborate</span> as hieroglyphic writing. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.19" data-time="81.21">[01:21.21]</span>It was used for more <span class="highlight">mundane</span> matters, oh, like administrative documents. <span class="time" data-times="4.8" data-time="86.4">[01:26.40]</span>These <span class="highlight">ancient</span> Egyptian scripts were replaced by Coptic scripts. <span class="time" data-times="8.63" data-time="91.2">[01:31.20]</span>But <span class="highlight">eventually</span>, the Arabic language replaced Coptic and this cut off the <span class="highlight">linguistic</span> link between <span class="highlight">ancient</span> and modern Egypt. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="10.94" data-time="99.83">[01:39.83]</span>Now, the Rosetta Stone was <span class="highlight">remarkable</span> because as I said, on it, was the same text in three different alphabets: Greek, demotic and hieroglyphic. <span class="time" data-times="6.17" data-time="110.77">[01:50.77]</span>The Stone was <span class="highlight">essentially</span> the dictionary that scholars needed to <span class="highlight">interpret</span> the meaning of the hieroglyphs. <span class="time" data-times="6.82" data-time="116.94">[01:56.94]</span>And it took a uniquely equipped researcher to finally <span class="highlight">decipher</span> and understand what was written on the stone. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="10.7" data-time="123.76">[02:03.76]</span>Thomas young, an English <span class="highlight">scholar</span>, was the first to seriously <span class="highlight">attempt</span> to <span class="highlight">decipher</span> the symbols on the Rosetta Stone. <span class="time" data-times="7.94" data-time="134.46">[02:14.46]</span>He suspected rightly that the hieroglyphs were phonetic symbols, that they represented its sounds rather than pictures. <span class="time" data-times="8.03" data-time="142.4">[02:22.40]</span>Until then, all scholars assumed that hieroglyphs were pictographs, that they <span class="highlight">symbolize</span> objects or concepts. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="9.75" data-time="150.43">[02:30.43]</span>Thomas Young focused his <span class="highlight">attention</span> on one set of hieroglyphs that he thought would probably spell out a single word: the name of a King or Queen. <span class="time" data-times="11.14" data-time="160.18">[02:40.18]</span>He guessed that the symbols represented the name of the early Egyptian ruler <span class="highlight">Ptolemy</span>, since <span class="highlight">Ptolemy</span> was also written in Greek on the stone and was indeed a Greek name.<span class="time" data-times="7.3" data-time="171.32">[02:51.32]</span>And Young did actually prove that these hieroglyphs represented sounds rather than whole words. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.72" data-time="178.62">[02:58.62]</span>Strangely though, he gave into the <span class="highlight">dominant</span><span class="highlight">thesis</span> of the day that hieroglyphs were pictographs. <span class="time" data-times="8.78" data-time="185.34">[03:05.34]</span>He actually dismissed his own findings as an <span class="highlight">anomaly</span> because the Ptolemaic dynasty was Greek, not Egyptian. <span class="time" data-times="3.85" data-time="194.12">[03:14.12]</span>In other words, he figured it was an <span class="highlight">exception</span> to the rule.<span class="time" data-times="4.21" data-time="197.97">[03:17.97]</span> It was phonetic because it was Greek, not Egyptian. <span class="time" data-times="4.67" data-time="202.18">[03:22.18]</span>How else could an Egyptian <span class="highlight">depict</span> a Greek name other than spell it out? <span class="time" data-times="7.98" data-time="206.85">[03:26.85]</span>And that brings us to the hero of our story: Jean-Francois Champollion. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="12.25" data-time="214.83">[03:34.83]</span>Champollion built on Young's work, showing that different hieroglyphs spelled the names of Kings and Queens like Alexander or Cleopatra. <span class="time" data-times="5.55" data-time="227.08">[03:47.08]</span>But his critics <span class="highlight">noted</span> that this was still not <span class="highlight">traditional</span> Egyptian names. <span class="time" data-times="6.16" data-time="232.63">[03:52.63]</span>He hadn't done any more than Young had been able to do, so he couldn't disprove the <span class="highlight">dominant</span><span class="highlight">theory</span>. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="9.31" data-time="238.79">[03:58.79]</span>Then in 1822, Champollion was shown a set of hieroglyphs that <span class="highlight">contain</span><span class="highlight">traditional</span> Egyptian names. <span class="time" data-times="13.44" data-time="248.1">[04:08.10]</span>The first two of these symbols were unknown, but Champollion knew that the repeated hieroglyphs to the far right symbolized an "S" <span class="highlight">sound</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.91" data-time="261.54">[04:21.54]</span>He then drew on his <span class="highlight">linguistic</span> knowledge to arrive at the <span class="highlight">solution</span> to the problem. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.82" data-time="266.45">[04:26.45]</span>You see, unlike any of the other scholars who had tried to <span class="highlight">crack</span> the <span class="highlight">code</span>, Champollion happened to be fluent in Coptic. <span class="time" data-times="8.24" data-time="274.27">[04:34.27]</span>He wondered, and this was the real <span class="highlight">breakthrough</span>, if Coptic was the language symbolized by the hieroglyphs on the Rosetta stone. <span class="time" data-times="6.54" data-time="282.51">[04:42.51]</span>And if so, then perhaps that first disc-shape <span class="highlight">symbol</span> might <span class="highlight">represent</span> the Sun. <span class="time" data-times="3.46" data-time="289.05">[04:49.05]</span>And the Coptic word for Sun is "ra". <span class="time" data-times="2.04" data-time="292.51">[04:52.51]</span>See where this is headed? </p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.97" data-time="294.55">[04:54.55]</span>So if the <span class="highlight">symbol</span> were Coptic, the first <span class="highlight">symbol</span> would be "ra". <span class="time" data-times="4.74" data-time="299.52">[04:59.52]</span>And then an unknown <span class="highlight">symbol</span> followed by a double "S" <span class="highlight">sound</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.85" data-time="304.26">[05:04.26]</span>Was this, Champollion wondered, the name Rameses? <span class="time" data-times="3.5" data-time="309.11">[05:09.11]</span>He was <span class="highlight">eventually</span> able to <span class="highlight">confirm</span> that it was. <span class="time" data-times="2.19" data-time="312.61">[05:12.61]</span>So, he had figured it out. <span class="time" data-times="8.52" data-time="314.8">[05:14.80]</span>Hieroglyphs were mainly phonetic, they represented sounds, not pictures, and the <span class="highlight">underlying</span> language was Coptic. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="323.32">[05:23.32]</span>A lot of work remained, but Champollion had cracked the <span class="highlight">code</span>.

The history of language in ancient Egypt.</p><p>B. The process that was used to create hieroglyphic writing.</p><p>C. The competition between two scholars to solve an archaeological puzzle.</p><p>D. The circumstances that led to the solution of an archaeological puzzle.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>Hieroglyphic writing ended abruptly about 1600 years ago, and it mystified the most brilliant minds in the study of the Egyptian artifacts and archeology for many many centuries. Finally, the possibility of deciphering hieroglyphs came about with the discovery in 1799 of the Rosetta stone. When it came up, it introduced the works of Greece, but the sudden interruption of 1600 caused many problems, but it was finally broken. So some of the D-items contributed to the solution of the archeological mystery.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What was demotic script used for in ancient Egypt?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Decorations on temples and monuments.</p><p>B. Administrative documents.</p><p>C. Illustration for stories.</p><p>D. Representations of objects.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The demotic script found on the Rosetta stone, um ...well, demotic was not as assy as the hieroglyphic writing. It was used for Mundey matters or like administrator documents. The demotic is the popular meaning, the topic asked demotic script was used by ancient Egypt There is nothing special about the word, the key is to pay attention to the change of tone, and there is a comparison between the professor when it comes to this piece, and the contrast between demotic was not.... It was used for.....</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why was ancient Egyptian hieroglyphic writing difficult for scholars to interpret?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The language that it was based on was no longer used.</p><p>B. The same words were often represented by several different symbols</p><p>C. It consisted of a mixture of three different languages</p><p>D. Only fragments of it were found.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>But we didn't even know at first that the three texts on the Rosetta Stone contain the same information. And two of the three alphabets are ancient Egyptian scripts that stop being used. This question explains why the hearing is speaking of ancient Egypt. Manuscripts, popular editions, and hieroglyphics editions are no longer used. If you want to explain, you must have a dictionary. So choose A.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the professor's opinion about Thomas Young's work with hieroglyphs?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

She is surprised that Young did not recognize his own accomplishments.</p><p>D. She thinks that Young's work was not careful enough to be taken seriously.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>This is an attitude question. The professor is positively endorsing Thomas Yang from this sentence. Thomas Yang, an English scholar, was the first to seriously attempt to decide for the symbols on the Rosetta stone. He suspected rightly, that the hieroglyphs were phonetic symbols, that they stood sounds rather than pictures. There was a word Strangely though and the related information behind suggested that Young did not realize that his achievement was chosen C.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor, what led to the decoding of the Rosetta Stone?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

The realization that each hieroglyph represented a different object or concept.</p><p>D. The discovery that the word for "Sun" is written the same way in Greek, demotic, and hieroglyphics.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>Question of what caused Rosetta Stone to decode. As we said earlier, to decode hieroglyphs, we have to be very special. Next, the professor introduced the first correctly decoded Mr. Young. He spelled out a single word, the name of ..... And this name has been repeated throughout the text.
