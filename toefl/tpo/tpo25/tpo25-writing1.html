        <article>
          <p>In 1938 an archaeologist in Iraq acquired a set of clay jars that had been excavated two years earlier by villagers constructing a railroad line. The vessel was about 2,200 years old. Each clay jay contained a copper cylinder surrounding an iron rod. The archaeologist proposed that vessel were ancient electric batteries and even demonstrated that they can produce a small electric current when filled with some liquids. However, it is not likely that the vessels were actually used as electric batteries in ancient times.</p>
          <p>First of all, if the vessels were used as batteries, they would probably have been attached to some electricity conductors such as metal wires. But there is no evidence that any metal wires were located near the vessels. All that has been excavated are the vessels themselves.</p>
          <p>Second, the copper cylinders inside the jarslook exactly like copper cylinders discovered in the ruins of Seleucia, an ancientcity located nearby. We know that the copper cylinders from Seleucia were used for holding scrolls of sacred texts, not for generating electricity. Since the cylinders found with the jars have the same shape, it is very likely they were used for holding scrolls as well. That no scrolls were found inside the jars can be explained by the fact that the scrolls simply disintegrated over the centuries.</p>
          <p>Finally, what could ancient people have done with the electricity that the vessels were supposed to have generated? They had no devices that replied on electricity. As batteries, the vessels would have been completely useless to them. </p>

          <p>None of the three theories presented in the reading passage are very convincing. </p>
          <p>First, the stone balls as hunting weapons, common Neolithic weapons such as arrowheads and hand axes generally show signs of wear, so we should expect that if the stone balls had been used as weapons for hunting of fighting, they too would show signs of that use. Many of the stone balls would be cracked or have pieces broken off. However, the surfaces of the balls are generally well preserved, showing little or no wear or damage. </p>
          <p>Second, the carved stone balls maybe remarkably uniform in size, but their masses vary too considerably to have been used as uniform weights. This is because the stone balls were made of different types of stone including sandstone, green stone and quartzite. Each type of stone has a different density. Some types of stone are heavier than others just as a handful of feathers weighs less than a handful of rocks. Two balls of the same size are different weights depending on the type of stone they are made of. Therefore, the balls could not have been used as a primitive weighing system. </p>
          <p>Third, it's unlikely that the main purpose of the balls was as some kind of social marker. A couple of facts are inconsistent with this theory. For one thing, while some of the balls are carved with intricate patterns, many others have markings that are extremely simple, too simple to make the balls look like status symbols. Furthermore, we know that in Neolithic Britain, when someone died, particularly a high-ranking person, they were usually buried with their possessions. However, none of the carved stone balls have been actually found in tombs or graves. That makes it unlikely that the balls were personal possessions that marked a person's status within the community. </p>

          <p>In the reading material, the author states that the vessels found in Iraq in 1938 were not actually used as electric batteries in ancient times. However in the listening material, the professor refutes that the first, according to the reading passage, the author suggests that if they were used as batteries, they would have been attached to some electricity conductors. However in the listening, the professor claims that we should remember that the discovery was made by local people along with some other materials. As they were not trained as archaeologist, they could not recognize the importance of some certain excavations. Perhaps they were overlook as something uninterested and then thrown away. Second, the author in the reading material mentions that the vessels were likely used for holding scrolls. Unfortunately the professor argues that it could not prove anything. It is possible that the vessels may be originally designed to scrolls. However ancient inventor then discovered that if the vessels were used with iron rod and some liquid, it could generate the electricity. So the copper cylinders may be originally used for one purpose but adapted for another purpose. Finally, the author of the reading passage asserts that the vessels would have been completely useless to ancient people as they had no devices that replied on electricity. In the contrary in obviously contradicts with the listening passage in which the professor contends that the battery could generate some mild shock and this also interprets evidence of some invisible power that how people convince others they had the magic power. Also it could be used for healing. In modern society doctors would use batteries to stimulate muscles and release pains. In ancient times people could also do that. In conclusion, according to the listening material, the argument that the vessels could not be used as batteries is unwarranted. </p>
