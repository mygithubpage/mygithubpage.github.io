Others like to go shopping for pleasure whether or not they have something to buy. Which do you prefer and why?</p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>I suppose that I'm a unique person because people often say that boys don't like to buying, something for pleasure. But for me, I like to buy lots of food when I have difficulties and struggles in my life, such as when I got a very low score in the final exam, at that time I will buy some foods in the supermarket or the shopping malls, I will feel a lot of pleasure and I will enjoy about it. I will pick up some money to buy some food in a short time. Sometimes I can grab it in a hard way, sometimes when I borrow those food that I don't need, I will feel a lot of pleasure and accomplishment.</p></article></div></main></body></html>
