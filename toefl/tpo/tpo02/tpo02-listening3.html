              <span class="time" data-times="3.88" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture from a <span class="underline">Botany</span> class.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.03" data-time="3.88">[00:03.88]</span>Professor: Hi, everyone. <span class="time" data-times="1.56" data-time="4.91">[00:04.91]</span>Good to see you all today. <span class="time" data-times="4.26" data-time="6.47">[00:06.47]</span>Actually, I expected the <span class="underline">population</span> to be a lot <span class="underline">lower</span> today. <span class="time" data-times="5.06" data-time="10.73">[00:10.73]</span>It typically runs between 50 and 60 percent on the day the research paper is <span class="underline">due</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9.53" data-time="15.79">[00:15.79]</span>Um, I was hoping to have your exams back today, but, uh, the situation was that I went away for the weekend, and I was supposed to get in yesterday at five, <span class="time" data-times="10.28" data-time="25.32">[00:25.32]</span>and I expected to fully complete all the exams by midnight or so, which is the time that I usually go to bed, but my flight was delayed, and I ended up not getting in until one o'clock in the morning. <span class="time" data-times="3.82" data-time="35.6">[00:35.60]</span>Anyway, I'll do my best to have them finished by the next time we meet.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.82" data-time="39.42">[00:39.42]</span>OK.In the last class, we started talking about useful plant fibers. <span class="time" data-times="13.72" data-time="44.24">[00:44.24]</span>In <span class="underline">particular</span>, we talked about cotton fibers, which we said were very useful, not only in the <span class="underline">textile</span> <span class="underline">industry</span>, but also in the chemical <span class="underline">industry</span>, and in the production of many products, such as plastics, paper, explosives, and so on. <span class="time" data-times="7.24" data-time="57.96">[00:57.96]</span>Today we'll continue talking about useful fibers, and we'll begin with a <span class="underline">fiber</span> that's commonly known as "Manila <span class="underline">hemp</span>."</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.21" data-time="65.2">[01:05.20]</span>Now, for some strange <span class="underline">reason</span>, many people believe that Manila <span class="underline">hemp</span> is a <span class="underline">hemp</span> plant. <span class="time" data-times="2.39" data-time="70.41">[01:10.41]</span>But Manila <span class="underline">hemp</span> is not really <span class="underline">hemp</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.07" data-time="72.8">[01:12.80]</span>It's actually a member of the banana family-it <span class="underline">even</span> bears little banana-shaped fruits. <span class="time" data-times="9.3" data-time="77.87">[01:17.87]</span>The "Manila" part of the name makes <span class="underline">sense</span>, because Manila <span class="underline">hemp</span> is produced <span class="underline">chiefly</span> in the Philippine Islands and, of <span class="underline">course</span>, the capital city of the Philippines is Manila.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.53" data-time="87.17">[01:27.17]</span>Now, as fibers go, Manila <span class="underline">hemp</span> fibers are very long. <span class="time" data-times="5.19" data-time="92.7">[01:32.70]</span>They can easily be several feet in length and they're also very strong, very <span class="underline">flexible</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.21" data-time="97.89">[01:37.89]</span>They have one more <span class="underline">characteristic</span> that's very important, and that is that they are exceptionally <span class="underline">resistant</span> to salt water. <span class="time" data-times="12.23" data-time="104.1">[01:44.10]</span>And this <span class="underline">combination</span> of characteristics-long, strong, <span class="underline">flexible</span>, <span class="underline">resistant</span> to salt water-makes Manila <span class="underline">hemp</span> a great <span class="underline">material</span> for ropes, especially for ropes that are <span class="underline">gonna</span> be used on ocean-going ships.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="11.56" data-time="116.33">[01:56.33]</span>In fact, by the early 1940's, <span class="underline">even</span> though <span class="underline">steel</span> cables were <span class="underline">available</span>, most ships in the United States <span class="underline">Navy</span> were not moored with <span class="underline">steel</span> cables; they were moored with Manila <span class="underline">hemp</span> ropes. <span class="time" data-times="1.43" data-time="127.89">[02:07.89]</span>Now, why was that? <span class="time" data-times="6.03" data-time="129.32">[02:09.32]</span>Well, the main <span class="underline">reason</span> was that <span class="underline">steel</span> cables <span class="underline">degrade</span> very, very quickly in <span class="underline">contact</span> with salt water. <span class="time" data-times="4.28" data-time="135.35">[02:15.35]</span>If you've ever been to San Francisco, you know that the Golden Gate Bridge is red. <span class="time" data-times="4.28" data-time="139.63">[02:19.63]</span>And it's red because of the <span class="underline">zinc</span> paint that goes on those stainless <span class="underline">steel</span> cables.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="16.81" data-time="143.91">[02:23.91]</span>That, if they start at one end of the bridge and they work to the other end, by the time they finish, it's already time to go back and start painting the beginning of the bridge again, because the bridge was built with <span class="underline">steel</span> cables, and <span class="underline">steel</span> cables can't take the salt <span class="underline">air</span> unless they're treated repeatedly with a zinc-based paint.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.62" data-time="160.72">[02:40.72]</span>On the other hand, plant products like Manila <span class="underline">hemp</span>, you can <span class="underline">drag</span> <span class="underline">through</span> the ocean for weeks on end. <span class="time" data-times="9.32" data-time="167.34">[02:47.34]</span>If you <span class="underline">wanna</span> tie your <span class="underline">anchor</span> to it and <span class="underline">drop</span> it right into the ocean, that's no problem, because plant fibers can stand up for months, <span class="underline">even</span> years, in direct <span class="underline">contact</span> with salt water.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.94" data-time="176.66">[02:56.66]</span>OK. So how do you take plant fibers that individually you could <span class="underline">break</span> with your hands and turn them into a rope that's strong enough to moor a ship that weighs thousands of tons? <span class="time" data-times="18.77" data-time="187.6">[03:07.60]</span>Well, what you do is you <span class="underline">extract</span> these long fibers from the Manila <span class="underline">hemp</span> plant, and then you take several of these fibers, and you group them into a <span class="underline">bundle</span>, because by grouping the fibers you greatly increase their breaking strength-that <span class="underline">bundle</span> of fibers is much stronger than any of the <span class="underline">individual</span> fibers that <span class="underline">compose</span> it.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.96" data-time="206.37">[03:26.37]</span>And then you take that <span class="underline">bundle</span> of fibers and you <span class="underline">twist</span> it a little bit, because by twisting it, you increase its breaking strength <span class="underline">even</span> more. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="213.33">[03:33.33]</span>And then you take several of these little bundles, and you group and <span class="underline">twist</span> them into bigger bundles, which you then group and <span class="underline">twist</span> into <span class="underline">even</span> bigger bundles, and so on, until <span class="underline">eventually</span>, you end up with a very, very strong rope.</p>
