So how do you take plant fibers that individually you could <span class="highlight">break</span> with your hands and turn them into a rope that's strong enough to moor a ship that weighs thousands of tons? <span class="time" data-times="18.77" data-time="187.6">[03:07.60]</span>Well, what you do is you <span class="highlight">extract</span> these long fibers from the Manila <span class="highlight">hemp</span> plant, and then you take several of these fibers, and you group them into a <span class="highlight">bundle</span>, because by grouping the fibers you greatly increase their breaking strength-that <span class="highlight">bundle</span> of fibers is much stronger than any of the <span class="highlight">individual</span> fibers that <span class="highlight">compose</span> it.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.96" data-time="206.37">[03:26.37]</span>And then you take that <span class="highlight">bundle</span> of fibers and you <span class="highlight">twist</span> it a little bit, because by twisting it, you increase its breaking strength <span class="highlight">even</span> more. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="213.33">[03:33.33]</span>And then you take several of these little bundles, and you group and <span class="highlight">twist</span> them into bigger bundles, which you then group and <span class="highlight">twist</span> into <span class="highlight">even</span> bigger bundles, and so on, until <span class="highlight">eventually</span>, you end up with a very, very strong rope.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What aspect of Manila hemp fibers does the professor mainly discuss in the lecture.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

In fact, he is a banana family. It even has a little banana-shaped fruit. Some of its names make sense. Because Manila cannabis originally referred to the capital city of Manila. It can be inferred that the professor thinks that the word cannabis is not appropriate.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor mention the Golden Gate Bridge?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.
