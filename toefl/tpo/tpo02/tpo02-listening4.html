        <h3>Listening Text</h3>
        <article>
          <p>Narrator: Listen to a conversation between two students. They are both studying to be English teachers.</p>
          <p>:Girl: Did you register already for your classes next semester?</p>
          <p>:Boy: Yes, I did.</p>
          <p>:Girl: What are you taking?</p>
          <p>:Boy: Um...contemporary literature, English style, um... the teaching seminar, and I still have to do my student teaching. I'm gonna help teach a writing class of the junior high.</p>
          <p>:Girl: That's a heavy schedule.</p>
          <p>:Boy: Yeah, it will be really busy and I'm also taking a theory class. But I have to quit my job a couple of weeks cause it will be just too much.</p>
          <p>:Girl: Where do you work at?</p>
          <p>:Boy: Buster's coffee shop, but just till the end of the month. What are you doing next semester?</p>
          <p>:Girl: Actually a teaching seminar too. And I will have to start writing my thesis. You know, I'm also going for my master's degree.</p>
          <p>:Boy: So you are not writing any poetry, I imagine.</p>
          <p>:Girl: No, I was actually thinking about revising some of my poems and sending them into places for publication.</p>
          <p>:Boy: Cool, you should. Um, did you hear about that new poetry club, The Poetry Kitchen?</p>
          <p>:Girl: Yeah, no time.</p>
          <p>:Boy: It's fun. It's Sunday night. You don't do anything at Sunday nights?</p>
          <p>:Girl: I do homework Sunday nights.</p>
          <p>:Boy: Well, it's only from 7 to 9.</p>
          <p>:Girl: Is it every Sunday?</p>
          <p>:Boy: Last Sunday of every month. I don't know about this month, cause it's probably a little too close to Thanksgiving, so they might move it up. I don't know what they are gonna to do, but it's a good time, it's fun, some really impressive readings.</p>
          <p>:Girl: Who? From our class?</p>
          <p>:Boy: Some people from our class are reading. A lot of them go, sometimes even the professor.</p>
          <p>:Girl: Really? I don't know if I would want to read in front of her.</p>
          <p>:Boy: You wouldn't have to read, you can just watch. I just watched the first time, but it's a good environment to read them, I think anyway.</p>
          <p>:Girl: I probably have to write something new, so maybe during the summer, I just can't now.</p>
          <p>:Boy: Yeah, it wouldn't be the same just reading old stuff. Are you going to do summer school?</p>
          <p>:Girl: Definitely. Otherwise, I will be short 6 credits. I have no choice.</p>
          <p>:Boy: Yeah, me too. This is the second summer. I'll have to take classes. I gotta go now, my Shakespeare class starts in twenty minutes.</p>
