            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.81" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a <span class="underline">psychology</span> lecture. <span class="time" data-times="4" data-time="2.81">[00:02.81]</span>The professor is discussing <span class="underline">behaviorism</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.96" data-time="6.81">[00:06.81]</span>Professor: Now, many people <span class="underline">consider</span> John Watson to be the founder of <span class="underline">behaviorism</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.01" data-time="11.77">[00:11.77]</span>And like other behaviorists, he believed that psychologists should study only the behaviors they can <span class="underline">observe</span> and <span class="underline">measure</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.69" data-time="19.78">[00:19.78]</span>They're not interested in <span class="underline">mental</span> processes. <span class="time" data-times="8.28" data-time="22.47">[00:22.47]</span>While a person could <span class="underline">describe</span> his thoughts, no one else can see or hear them to <span class="underline">verify</span> the <span class="underline">accuracy</span> of his <span class="underline">report</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.26" data-time="30.75">[00:30.75]</span>But one thing you can <span class="underline">observe</span> is <span class="underline">muscular</span> habits. <span class="time" data-times="6.62" data-time="34.01">[00:34.01]</span>What Watson did was to <span class="underline">observe</span> <span class="underline">muscular</span> habits because he viewed them as a <span class="underline">manifestation</span> of thinking. <span class="time" data-times="4.93" data-time="40.63">[00:40.63]</span>One kind of <span class="underline">habit</span> that he studied are laryngeal habits. <span class="time" data-times="7.18" data-time="45.56">[00:45.56]</span>Watson thought laryngeal habits . . . you know, from <span class="underline">larynx</span>, in other words, related to the voice box . . .</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.92" data-time="52.74">[00:52.74]</span>He thought those habits were an expression of thinking. <span class="time" data-times="10.09" data-time="56.66">[00:56.66]</span>He argued that for very young children, thinking is really talking out loud to oneself because they talk out loud <span class="underline">even</span> if they're not trying to <span class="underline">communicate</span> with someone in <span class="underline">particular</span>. <span class="time" data-times="10.86" data-time="66.75">[01:06.75]</span>As the <span class="underline">individual</span> matures, that overt talking to oneself becomes covert talking to oneself, but thinking still shows up as a laryngeal <span class="underline">habit</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="12.34" data-time="77.61">[01:17.61]</span>One of the bits of <span class="underline">evidence</span> that supports this is that when people are trying to solve a problem, they, um, typically have increased <span class="underline">muscular</span> <span class="underline">activity</span> in the throat <span class="underline">region</span>. <span class="time" data-times="17.27" data-time="89.95">[01:29.95]</span>That is, if you put electrodes on the throat and <span class="underline">measure</span> <span class="underline">muscle</span> <span class="underline">potential</span>-<span class="underline">muscle</span> <span class="underline">activity</span>-you discover that when people are thinking, like if they're diligently trying to solve a problem, that there is <span class="underline">muscular</span> <span class="underline">activity</span> in the throat <span class="underline">region</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="14.3" data-time="107.22">[01:47.22]</span>So, Watson made the <span class="underline">argument</span> that problem solving, or thinking, can be defined as a set of behaviors-a set of responses-and in this case the <span class="underline">response</span> he observed was the throat <span class="underline">activity</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.46" data-time="121.52">[02:01.52]</span>That's what he means when he calls it a laryngeal <span class="underline">habit</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.46" data-time="124.98">[02:04.98]</span>Now, as I am thinking about what I am going to be saying, my muscles in my throat are responding. <span class="time" data-times="4.24" data-time="131.44">[02:11.44]</span>So, thinking can be measured as <span class="underline">muscle</span> <span class="underline">activity</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.63" data-time="135.68">[02:15.68]</span>Now, the <span class="underline">motor</span> <span class="underline">theory</span> . . . yes?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.78" data-time="139.31">[02:19.31]</span>Student: Professor Blake, um, did he happen to look at people who sign? <span class="time" data-times="1.59" data-time="144.09">[02:24.09]</span>I mean deaf people?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="22.03" data-time="145.68">[02:25.68]</span>Professor: Uh, he did indeed, um, and to jump ahead, what one finds in deaf individuals who use sign language when they're <span class="underline">given</span> problems of various kinds, they have <span class="underline">muscular</span> changes in their hands when they are trying to solve a problem . . .<span class="underline">muscle</span> changes in the hand, just like the <span class="underline">muscular</span> changes going on in the throat <span class="underline">region</span> for speaking individuals. <span class="time" data-times="5.85" data-time="167.71">[02:47.71]</span>So, for Watson, thinking is <span class="underline">identical</span> with the <span class="underline">activity</span> of muscles.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.76" data-time="173.56">[02:53.56]</span>A related <span class="underline">concept</span> of thinking was developed by William James. <span class="time" data-times="2.75" data-time="178.32">[02:58.32]</span>It's called <span class="underline">ideomotor</span> <span class="underline">action</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.12" data-time="181.07">[03:01.07]</span> <span class="underline">Ideomotor</span> <span class="underline">action</span> is an <span class="underline">activity</span> that occurs without our noticing it, without our being <span class="underline">aware</span> of it. <span class="time" data-times="1.9" data-time="188.19">[03:08.19]</span>I'll give you one simple example. <span class="time" data-times="6.71" data-time="190.09">[03:10.09]</span>If you think of locations, there tends to be eye movement that occurs with your thinking about that location. <span class="time" data-times="6.97" data-time="196.8">[03:16.80]</span>In <span class="underline">particular</span>, from where we're sitting, imagine that you're asked to think of our university library.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="14.43" data-time="203.77">[03:23.77]</span>Well, if you close your eyes and think of the library, and if you're sitting directly facing me, then according to this <span class="underline">notion</span>, your eyeballs will move <span class="underline">slightly</span> to the left, to your left, 'cause the library's in that general direction. <span class="time" data-times="11.98" data-time="218.2">[03:38.20]</span>James and others said that this is an idea <span class="underline">leading</span> to a <span class="underline">motor</span> <span class="underline">action</span>, and that's why it's called "<span class="underline">ideomotor</span> <span class="underline">action</span>"-an idea leads to <span class="underline">motor</span> <span class="underline">activity</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.01" data-time="230.18">[03:50.18]</span>If you wish to impress your friends and relatives, you can change this simple <span class="underline">process</span> into a magic trick. <span class="time" data-times="7.79" data-time="237.19">[03:57.19]</span>Ask people to do something such as I've just described: think of something on their left; think of something on their right. <span class="time" data-times="7.75" data-time="244.98">[04:04.98]</span>You get them to think about two things on either side with their eyes closed, and you watch their eyes very carefully. <span class="time" data-times="8.19" data-time="252.73">[04:12.73]</span>And if you do that, you'll discover that you can see rather clearly the eye movement-that is, you can see the movement of the eyeballs.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.32" data-time="260.92">[04:20.92]</span>Now, then you say, think of either one and I'll tell which you're thinking of. <span class="time" data-times="6.52" data-time="267.24">[04:27.24]</span>OK. Well, Watson makes the <span class="underline">assumption</span> that <span class="underline">muscular</span> <span class="underline">activity</span> is <span class="underline">equivalent</span> to thinking. <span class="time" data-times="11.53" data-time="273.76">[04:33.76]</span>But <span class="underline">given</span> everything we've been talking about here, one has to ask: are there alternatives to this <span class="underline">motor</span> <span class="underline">theory</span>-this <span class="underline">claim</span> that <span class="underline">muscular</span> activities are <span class="underline">equivalent</span> to thinking? <span class="time" data-times="6.61" data-time="285.29">[04:45.29]</span>Is there anything else that might <span class="underline">account</span> for this change in <span class="underline">muscular</span> <span class="underline">activity</span>, other than saying that it is thinking? <span class="time" data-times="2.22" data-time="291.9">[04:51.90]</span>And the answer is clearly yes. <span class="time" data-times="3.13" data-time="294.12">[04:54.12]</span>Is there any way to answer the question definitively? <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="297.25">[04:57.25]</span>I think the answer is no.</p>
