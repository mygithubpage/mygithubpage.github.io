      <p><span class="time" data-times="2.81" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a <span class="highlight">psychology</span> lecture. <span class="time" data-times="4" data-time="2.81">[00:02.81]</span>The professor is discussing <span class="highlight">behaviorism</span>.</p>
      <p><span class="time" data-times="4.96" data-time="6.81">[00:06.81]</span>Professor: Now, many people <span class="highlight">consider</span> John Watson to be the founder of <span class="highlight">behaviorism</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.01" data-time="11.77">[00:11.77]</span>And like other behaviorists, he believed that psychologists should study only the behaviors they can <span class="highlight">observe</span> and <span class="highlight">measure</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.69" data-time="19.78">[00:19.78]</span>They're not interested in <span class="highlight">mental</span> processes. <span class="time" data-times="8.28" data-time="22.47">[00:22.47]</span>While a person could <span class="highlight">describe</span> his thoughts, no one else can see or hear them to <span class="highlight">verify</span> the <span class="highlight">accuracy</span> of his <span class="highlight">report</span>.</p>
      <p><span class="time" data-times="3.26" data-time="30.75">[00:30.75]</span>But one thing you can <span class="highlight">observe</span> is <span class="highlight">muscular</span> habits. <span class="time" data-times="6.62" data-time="34.01">[00:34.01]</span>What Watson did was to <span class="highlight">observe</span><span class="highlight">muscular</span> habits because he viewed them as a <span class="highlight">manifestation</span> of thinking. <span class="time" data-times="4.93" data-time="40.63">[00:40.63]</span>One kind of <span class="highlight">habit</span> that he studied are laryngeal habits. <span class="time" data-times="7.18" data-time="45.56">[00:45.56]</span>Watson thought laryngeal habits . . . you know, from <span class="highlight">larynx</span>, in other words, related to the voice box . . .</p>
      <p><span class="time" data-times="3.92" data-time="52.74">[00:52.74]</span>He thought those habits were an expression of thinking. <span class="time" data-times="10.09" data-time="56.66">[00:56.66]</span>He argued that for very young children, thinking is really talking out loud to oneself because they talk out loud <span class="highlight">even</span> if they're not trying to <span class="highlight">communicate</span> with someone in <span class="highlight">particular</span>. <span class="time" data-times="10.86" data-time="66.75">[01:06.75]</span>As the <span class="highlight">individual</span> matures, that overt talking to oneself becomes covert talking to oneself, but thinking still shows up as a laryngeal <span class="highlight">habit</span>.</p>
      <p><span class="time" data-times="12.34" data-time="77.61">[01:17.61]</span>One of the bits of <span class="highlight">evidence</span> that supports this is that when people are trying to solve a problem, they, um, typically have increased <span class="highlight">muscular</span><span class="highlight">activity</span> in the throat <span class="highlight">region</span>. <span class="time" data-times="17.27" data-time="89.95">[01:29.95]</span>That is, if you put electrodes on the throat and <span class="highlight">measure</span><span class="highlight">muscle</span><span class="highlight">potential</span>-<span class="highlight">muscle</span><span class="highlight">activity</span>-you discover that when people are thinking, like if they're diligently trying to solve a problem, that there is <span class="highlight">muscular</span><span class="highlight">activity</span> in the throat <span class="highlight">region</span>.</p>
      <p><span class="time" data-times="14.3" data-time="107.22">[01:47.22]</span>So, Watson made the <span class="highlight">argument</span> that problem solving, or thinking, can be defined as a set of behaviors-a set of responses-and in this case the <span class="highlight">response</span> he observed was the throat <span class="highlight">activity</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.46" data-time="121.52">[02:01.52]</span>That's what he means when he calls it a laryngeal <span class="highlight">habit</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.46" data-time="124.98">[02:04.98]</span>Now, as I am thinking about what I am going to be saying, my muscles in my throat are responding. <span class="time" data-times="4.24" data-time="131.44">[02:11.44]</span>So, thinking can be measured as <span class="highlight">muscle</span><span class="highlight">activity</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.63" data-time="135.68">[02:15.68]</span>Now, the <span class="highlight">motor</span><span class="highlight">theory</span> . . . yes?</p>
      <p><span class="time" data-times="4.78" data-time="139.31">[02:19.31]</span>Student: Professor Blake, um, did he happen to look at people who sign? <span class="time" data-times="1.59" data-time="144.09">[02:24.09]</span>I mean deaf people?</p>
      <p><span class="time" data-times="22.03" data-time="145.68">[02:25.68]</span>Professor: Uh, he did indeed, um, and to jump ahead, what one finds in deaf individuals who use sign language when they're <span class="highlight">given</span> problems of various kinds, they have <span class="highlight">muscular</span> changes in their hands when they are trying to solve a problem . . .<span class="highlight">muscle</span> changes in the hand, just like the <span class="highlight">muscular</span> changes going on in the throat <span class="highlight">region</span> for speaking individuals. <span class="time" data-times="5.85" data-time="167.71">[02:47.71]</span>So, for Watson, thinking is <span class="highlight">identical</span> with the <span class="highlight">activity</span> of muscles.</p>
      <p><span class="time" data-times="4.76" data-time="173.56">[02:53.56]</span>A related <span class="highlight">concept</span> of thinking was developed by William James. <span class="time" data-times="2.75" data-time="178.32">[02:58.32]</span>It's called <span class="highlight">ideomotor</span><span class="highlight">action</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.12" data-time="181.07">[03:01.07]</span><span class="highlight">Ideomotor</span><span class="highlight">action</span> is an <span class="highlight">activity</span> that occurs without our noticing it, without our being <span class="highlight">aware</span> of it. <span class="time" data-times="1.9" data-time="188.19">[03:08.19]</span>I'll give you one simple example. <span class="time" data-times="6.71" data-time="190.09">[03:10.09]</span>If you think of locations, there tends to be eye movement that occurs with your thinking about that location. <span class="time" data-times="6.97" data-time="196.8">[03:16.80]</span>In <span class="highlight">particular</span>, from where we're sitting, imagine that you're asked to think of our university library.</p>
      <p><span class="time" data-times="14.43" data-time="203.77">[03:23.77]</span>Well, if you close your eyes and think of the library, and if you're sitting directly facing me, then according to this <span class="highlight">notion</span>, your eyeballs will move <span class="highlight">slightly</span> to the left, to your left, 'cause the library's in that general direction. <span class="time" data-times="11.98" data-time="218.2">[03:38.20]</span>James and others said that this is an idea <span class="highlight">leading</span> to a <span class="highlight">motor</span><span class="highlight">action</span>, and that's why it's called "<span class="highlight">ideomotor</span><span class="highlight">action</span>"-an idea leads to <span class="highlight">motor</span><span class="highlight">activity</span>.</p>
      <p><span class="time" data-times="7.01" data-time="230.18">[03:50.18]</span>If you wish to impress your friends and relatives, you can change this simple <span class="highlight">process</span> into a magic trick. <span class="time" data-times="7.79" data-time="237.19">[03:57.19]</span>Ask people to do something such as I've just described: think of something on their left; think of something on their right. <span class="time" data-times="7.75" data-time="244.98">[04:04.98]</span>You get them to think about two things on either side with their eyes closed, and you watch their eyes very carefully. <span class="time" data-times="8.19" data-time="252.73">[04:12.73]</span>And if you do that, you'll discover that you can see rather clearly the eye movement-that is, you can see the movement of the eyeballs.</p>
      <p><span class="time" data-times="6.32" data-time="260.92">[04:20.92]</span>Now, then you say, think of either one and I'll tell which you're thinking of. <span class="time" data-times="6.52" data-time="267.24">[04:27.24]</span>OK. Well, Watson makes the <span class="highlight">assumption</span> that <span class="highlight">muscular</span><span class="highlight">activity</span> is <span class="highlight">equivalent</span> to thinking. <span class="time" data-times="11.53" data-time="273.76">[04:33.76]</span>But <span class="highlight">given</span> everything we've been talking about here, one has to ask: are there alternatives to this <span class="highlight">motor</span><span class="highlight">theory</span>-this <span class="highlight">claim</span> that <span class="highlight">muscular</span> activities are <span class="highlight">equivalent</span> to thinking? <span class="time" data-times="6.61" data-time="285.29">[04:45.29]</span>Is there anything else that might <span class="highlight">account</span> for this change in <span class="highlight">muscular</span><span class="highlight">activity</span>, other than saying that it is thinking? <span class="time" data-times="2.22" data-time="291.9">[04:51.90]</span>And the answer is clearly yes. <span class="time" data-times="3.13" data-time="294.12">[04:54.12]</span>Is there any way to answer the question definitively? <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="297.25">[04:57.25]</span>I think the answer is no.</p>

        <div class="explanation" data-answer="C">
          <p>Well, if you close your eyes and think of the library, and if you're sitting coming facing me, then according to this notion, your eyeballs will move slightly to the left, to your left, 'cause the library's in that general direction The professor asked the students to think about the library of the school.

        <div class="explanation" data-answer="A">
          <p>It's called ideomotor action. Ideomotor action is an activity that occurs without our noticing it,without our being aware of it. People may not be aware of some micro-motions while thinking. The trick taught by the professor is that people do not realize these movements.</p>

        <div class="explanation" data-answer="D">
          <p>Is there anything else that might account for this change in muscular activity,other than saying that it is thinking? And the answer is clearly yes. Is there any way to answer the question definitively? I think the answer is no. It is difficult to completely confirm the theory and it is difficult to be completely denied. Muscle activity is not necessarily the same as thinking.</p>
