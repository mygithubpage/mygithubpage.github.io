          <h4 class="w3-center">Bus Service Elimination Planned</h4>The university has decided to discontinue its free bus service for students. The reason given for this decision is that few students ride the buses and the buses arc expensive to operate. Currently, the buses run from the center of campus past university buildings and through some of the neighborhoods surrounding the campus. The money saved by eliminating the bus service will be used to expand the overcrowded student parking lots.</article>

          <p>NarratorNow listen to two students discussing the article.</p>
          <p>Man:I don't like the university's plan.</p>
          <p>Woman:Really? I've ridden those buses, and sometimes there were only a few people on the bus. It did seem like kind of a waste.</p>
          <p>Man:I see your point. But I think the problem is the route's out-of-date. It only goes through the neighborhoods that've gotten too expensive for students to live in. It's ridiculous that they haven't already changed the route - you know, so it goes where most of campus students live now. 1 bet if they did that, they'd get plenty of students riding those buses.</p>
          <p>Woman:Well, at least they are adding more parking. It's gotten really tough to find a space.</p>
          <p>Man:That's the other part I don't like, actually. Cutting back the bus service and adding parking's just gonna encourage more students to drive on campus. And that'll just add to the noise around campus and create more traffic...and that'll increase the need for more parking spaces.</p>
          <p>Woman:Yeah, I guess I can see your point. Maybe it would be better if more students used the buses instead of driving.</p>
          <p>Man:Right. And the university should make it easier to do that, not harder.</p>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>Well, the man disagrees with the plan for two main reasons. First of all, he believes that the route is out-of-date since it only goes through the neighborhoods that are too expensive for students to live in. If they change the bus route making it go through areas where most off-campus students live now, they will have plenty of students riding those buses. On top of that, the man thinks that the plan will encourage students to drive on campus, which will cause not only more traffic and noise but also deficient parking spaces on campus. So the man disagrees with the plan for the reasons stated above. (110 words)</p>
