            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.07" data-time="11.23">[00:11.23]</span>Professor: OK. Let's get going. <span class="time" data-times="4.36" data-time="13.3">[00:13.30]</span>Today I'm going to talk about how the <span class="underline">asteroid</span> <span class="underline">belt</span> was discovered. <span class="time" data-times="4.34" data-time="17.66">[00:17.66]</span>And . . . I'm going to start by writing some numbers on the <span class="underline">board</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.08" data-time="22">[00:22.00]</span>Here they are: We'll start with zero, then 3, . . . 6, . . . 12. <span class="time" data-times="1.55" data-time="30.08">[00:30.08]</span>Uh, tell me what I'm doing.</p>

              <span class="time" data-times="8.92" data-time="33.43">[00:33.43]</span>Professor: Right. I'm doubling the numbers, so 2 times 12 is 24, and the next one I'm going to write after 24 would be...</p>

              <span class="time" data-times="1.61" data-time="42.35">[00:42.35]</span>

              <span class="time" data-times="5.09" data-time="43.96">[00:43.96]</span>Professor: 48. Then 96. <span class="time" data-times="1.81" data-time="49.05">[00:49.05]</span>We'll stop there for now. <span class="time" data-times="3.46" data-time="50.86">[00:50.86]</span>Uh, now I'll write another row of numbers under that. <span class="time" data-times="2.01" data-time="54.32">[00:54.32]</span>Tell me what I'm doing. <span class="time" data-times="6.15" data-time="56.33">[00:56.33]</span>4, 7, 10 ...How am I getting this <span class="underline">second</span> row?</p>

              <span class="time" data-times="15.24" data-time="136.28">[02:16.28]</span>Um, it isn't really a <span class="underline">scientific</span> law, not in the <span class="underline">sense</span> of predicting gravitation mathematically or something, but it's attempting a <span class="underline">pattern</span> in the spacing of the planets, and it was noticed by <span class="underline">Bode</span> hundreds of years ago. <span class="time" data-times="11.52" data-time="151.52">[02:31.52]</span>Well, you can imagine that there was some <span class="underline">interest</span> in why the 2.8 <span class="underline">spot</span> in the <span class="underline">pattern</span> was skipped, and um . . . but there wasn't anything <span class="underline">obvious</span> there, in the early telescopes. <span class="time" data-times="3.01" data-time="163.04">[02:43.04]</span>Then what happened in the late 1700s? <span class="time" data-times="1.21" data-time="166.05">[02:46.05]</span>The discovery of . . . ?</p>

              <span class="time" data-times="3.89" data-time="200.96">[03:20.96]</span>And Ceres was in the right place-the missing <span class="underline">spot</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.67" data-time="204.85">[03:24.85]</span>Uh, but it was way too <span class="underline">faint</span> to be a <span class="underline">planet</span>. <span class="time" data-times="1.47" data-time="207.52">[03:27.52]</span>It looked like a little star. <span class="time" data-times="6.26" data-time="208.99">[03:28.99]</span>Uh, and because of its starlike <span class="underline">appearance</span>, um, it was called an "<span class="underline">asteroid</span>." <span class="time" data-times="4.96" data-time="215.25">[03:35.25]</span>OK? "Aster" is Greek for "star," as in "<span class="underline">astronomy</span>." <span class="time" data-times="8.19" data-time="220.21">[03:40.21]</span>Um, and so, Ceres was the first and is the largest of what became many objects discovered at that same distance. <span class="time" data-times="5.69" data-time="228.4">[03:48.40]</span>Not just one thing, but all the objects found at that distance from the <span class="underline">asteroid</span> <span class="underline">belt</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.74" data-time="234.09">[03:54.09]</span>So the <span class="underline">asteroid</span> <span class="underline">belt</span> is the most famous success of this <span class="underline">Bode</span>'s Law. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="239.83">[03:59.83]</span>That's how the <span class="underline">asteroid</span> <span class="underline">belt</span> was discovered.</p>
