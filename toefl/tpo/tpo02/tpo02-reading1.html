The <span class="highlight">expansion</span> of desert-like conditions into areas where they did not <span class="highlight">previously</span> exist is called <span class="highlight">desertification</span>. It has been estimated that an <span class="highlight">additional</span> one-fourth of the Earth's land surface is <span class="highlight question1">threatened</span> by this <span class="highlight">process</span>.</p><p><span class="highlight">Desertification</span> is <span class="highlight">accomplished</span><span class="highlight">primarily</span><span class="highlight">through</span> the loss of stabilizing natural <span class="highlight">vegetation</span> and the <span class="highlight">subsequent</span><span class="highlight">accelerated</span><span class="highlight">erosion</span> of the soil by wind and water. In some cases the <span class="highlight">loose</span> soil is blown completely away, leaving a stony surface. In other cases, the finer particles may be removed, while the sand-sized particles are accumulated to form <span class="highlight">mobile</span> hills or ridges of sand.</p><p><span class="highlight">Even</span> in the areas that <span class="highlight">retain</span> a soil cover, the <span class="highlight">reduction</span> of <span class="highlight">vegetation</span> typically results in the loss of the soil's <span class="highlight">ability</span> to <span class="highlight">absorb</span><span class="highlight">substantial</span> quantities of water. The <span class="highlight">impact</span> of raindrops on the <span class="highlight">loose</span> soil tends to <span class="highlight">transfer</span> fine <span class="highlight">clay</span> particles into the tiniest soil spaces, sealing them and producing a surface that allows very little water penetration. Water <span class="highlight">absorption</span> is greatly reduced; <span class="highlight">consequently</span><span class="highlight">runoff</span> is increased, resulting in <span class="highlight">accelerated</span><span class="highlight">erosion</span> rates. The <span class="highlight">gradual</span> drying of the soil caused by its <span class="highlight">diminished</span><span class="highlight">ability</span> to <span class="highlight">absorb</span> water results in the further loss of <span class="highlight">vegetation</span>, so that a <span class="highlight">cycle</span> of <span class="highlight">progressive</span> surface <span class="highlight">deterioration</span> is established.</p><p>In some regions, the increase in <span class="highlight">desert</span> areas is occurring largely as the result of a <span class="highlight">trend</span> toward drier <span class="highlight">climatic</span> conditions. Continued <span class="highlight">gradual</span> global warming has produced an increase in aridity for some areas over the past few thousand years. The <span class="highlight">process</span> may be <span class="highlight">accelerated</span> in <span class="highlight">subsequent</span> decades if global warming resulting from <span class="highlight">air</span> pollution seriously increases.</p><p>There is little <span class="highlight">doubt</span>, however, that <span class="highlight">desertification</span> in most areas results <span class="highlight">primarily</span> from human activities rather than natural processes. The <span class="highlight">semiarid</span> lands bordering the deserts exist in a <span class="highlight"><span class="question3">delicate</span></span><span class="highlight">ecological</span><span class="highlight">balance</span> and are limited in their <span class="highlight">potential</span> to <span class="highlight">adjust</span> to increased <span class="highlight">environmental</span> pressures. Expanding populations are subjecting the land to increasing pressures to provide them with food and <span class="highlight">fuel</span>. In wet periods, the land may be able to <span class="highlight">respond</span> to these stresses. During the dry periods that are <span class="highlight">common</span> phenomena <span class="highlight">along</span> the <span class="highlight">desert</span> margins, though, the <span class="highlight">pressure</span> on the land is often far in <span class="highlight">excess</span> of its <span class="highlight">diminished</span><span class="highlight">capacity</span>, and <span class="highlight">desertification</span> results.</p><p>Four <span class="highlight">specific</span> activities have been identified as <span class="highlight">major</span> contributors to the <span class="highlight">desertification</span> processes: overcultivation, overgrazing, firewood gathering, and overirrigation. The <span class="highlight">cultivation</span> of crops has expanded into <span class="question5">progressively</span> drier regions as <span class="highlight">population</span> densities have grown. These regions are especially likely to have periods of <span class="highlight">severe</span> dryness, so that crop failures are <span class="highlight">common</span>. Since the raising of most crops necessitates the <span class="highlight">prior</span><span class="highlight">removal</span> of the natural <span class="highlight">vegetation</span>, crop failures leave <span class="highlight">extensive</span> tracts of land <span class="question7"><span class="highlight">devoid</span> of</span> a plant cover and <span class="highlight">susceptible</span> to wind and water <span class="highlight">erosion</span>.</p><p><span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>The raising of <span class="highlight">livestock</span> is a <span class="highlight">major</span><span class="highlight">economic</span><span class="highlight">activity</span> in <span class="highlight">semiarid</span> lands, where grasses are generally the <span class="highlight">dominant</span> type of natural <span class="highlight">vegetation</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>The consequences of an <span class="highlight">excessive</span> number of <span class="highlight">livestock</span><span class="highlight">grazing</span> in an area are the <span class="highlight">reduction</span> of the <span class="highlight">vegetation</span> cover and the trampling and pulverization of the soil. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>This is usually followed by the drying of the soil and <span class="highlight">accelerated</span><span class="highlight">erosion</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p><p>Firewood is the <span class="highlight">chief</span><span class="highlight">fuel</span> used for cooking and heating in many countries. The increased pressures of expanding populations have led to the <span class="highlight">removal</span> of woody plants so that many cities and towns are surrounded by large areas completely lacking in trees and shrubs. The increasing use of dried animal <span class="highlight">waste</span> as a <span class="highlight">substitute</span><span class="highlight">fuel</span> has also hurt the soil because this <span class="highlight">valuable</span> soil conditioner and <span class="highlight">source</span> of plant nutrients is no longer being returned to the land.</p><p>The final <span class="highlight">major</span> human cause of <span class="highlight">desertification</span> is soil <span class="highlight">salinization</span> resulting from overirrigation. <span class="highlight">Excess</span> water from <span class="highlight">irrigation</span> sinks down into the water table. If no <span class="highlight">drainage</span> system exists, the water table rises, bringing dissolved salts to the surface. The water evaporates and the salts are left behind, creating a white <span class="highlight">crustal</span><span class="highlight">layer</span> that prevents <span class="highlight">air</span> and water from reaching the <span class="highlight">underlying</span> soil.</p><p><span class="question10">The <span class="highlight">extreme</span> seriousness of <span class="highlight">desertification</span> results from the <span class="highlight">vast</span> areas of land and the <span class="highlight">tremendous</span> numbers of people affected, as well as from the great difficulty of reversing or <span class="highlight">even</span> slowing the <span class="highlight">process</span>.</span> Once the soil has been removed by <span class="highlight">erosion</span>, only the <span class="highlight">passage</span> of centuries or <span class="highlight">millennia</span> will enable new soil to form. In areas where <span class="highlight">considerable</span> soil still remains, though, a rigorously enforced program of land protection and cover-crop planting may make it possible to <span class="highlight">reverse</span> the present <span class="highlight">deterioration</span> of the surface.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">threatened</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. restricted</p><p>B. endangered</p><p>C. prevented</p><p>D. rejected</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Threaten: Threat. A is a restriction; B is a danger; C is a stop, avoid; D is a rejection. Answers with option B, so the correct answer is B. The sentence says that about a quarter of the land has been estimated that an additional one-fourth of the Earth's land surface is threatened by this process. After the ACD substitution, it found that the sentence was unreasonable, and only B was the most appropriate.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 3, the loss of natural vegetation has which of the following consequences for soil?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Increased stony content</p><p>B. Reduced water absorption</p><p>C. Increased numbers of spaces in the soil</p><p>D. Reduced water runoff</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>With vegetation positioning to the first sentence: Even in the areas that retain a soil cover, the reduction of vegetation typically results in the loss of the soil's ability to absorb substantial quantities of water. This leads to the ability of the soil to absorb large amounts of water. This corresponds to the B option. A is not mentioned in the original text. It is wrong. The text does not say "spaces in the soil" increases, so C is wrong. The D option is contrary to the content of the text, so it is wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question3">delicate</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. fragile</p><p>B. predictable</p><p>C. complex</p><p>D. valuable</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" A"><p>Delicate: fragile, <span class="question3">delicate</span>. And option A echoes. B is predictable; C is complex; D is valuable. The corresponding semiarid lands bordering the deserts exist in a <span class="question3">delicate</span> ecological balance and are limited in their potential to adjust to increased environmental pressures. There is a side-by-side relationship in this sentence, and from the latter and after the limit can be inferred that the <span class="question3">delicate</span> should be a negative word, D is excluded first, D is a positive vocabulary; BC is a neutral word, not selected. Only A is the most suitable.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 5, in dry periods, border areas have difficulty</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. adjusting to stresses created by settlement</p><p>B. retaining their fertility after desertification</p><p>C. providing water for irrigating crops</p><p>D. attracting populations in search of food and fuel</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>With the dry periods to the last sentence: During the dry periods that are common phenomena along the desert margins, though, the pressure on the land is often far in excess of its diminished capacity, and desertification results. Pressure corresponds to the stresses in the A option, A is correct. The irrigatting crops in the fertilit and C options in option B are not mentioned, so B and C are wrong. The "attracting populations" option D is also not mentioned.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question5">progressively</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. openly</p><p>B. impressively</p><p>C. objectively</p><p>D. increasingly</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" D"><p>Progressively: Progressive, increasing. Echo with option D. A is public; B is memorable; C is objective. In this sentence, when the density of population increases, the cultivation of crops has been <span class="question5">progressively</span> expanded to a more dry place.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 6, which of the following is often associated with raising crops?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Lack of proper irrigation techniques</p><p>B. Failure to plant crops suited to the particular area</p><p>C. Removal of the original vegetation</p><p>D. Excessive use of dried animal waste</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>According to raising crops, the last sentence: Since the raising of most crops necessitates the prior removal of the natural vegetation, crop failures leave extensive tracts of land devoid of a plant cover and susceptible to wind and water erosion. With the removal of natural vegetation in advance, the failure of the crop would leave the land uncovered and subject to wind and water erosion. Echoes C options.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The phrase "<span class="highlight">devoid of</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. consisting of</p><p>B. hidden by</p><p>C. except for</p><p>D. lacking in</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="devoid of D"><p>Devoid of: No, lack. Echo with option D. A is composed of... B is hidden by... C is apart; D is lacking. The original sentence of the raising of most crops necessitates the prior removal of the natural vegetation, crop failures leave extensive tracts of land devoid of a plant cover and susceptible to wind and water erosion. The original sentence has obvious inheritance relationship, connected with and , so crop failure leaves the land devoid of vegetation cover, and then it suffers erosion. This kind of inheritance relationship can be withdrawn, devoid of negative expressions, and erosion without erosion. So the correct answer is D.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 9, the ground's absorption of excess water is a factor in desertification because it can</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. interfere with the irrigation of land</p><p>B. limit the evaporation of water</p><p>C. require more absorption of air by the soil</p><p>D. bring salts to the surface</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>Excess water is used to locate the second sentence, but this sentence does not say why, look back, and the following sentence gives the answer: If no drainage system exists, the water table rises, bring dissolved salts to the surface. Specifically, if there is no drainage system, the groundwater level will rise and bring the salt to the surface, which corresponds to the D option, so the correct answer is D. None of the ABCs mentioned it.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>All of the following are mentioned in the passage as contributing to desertification EXCEPT</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. soil erosion</p><p>B. global warming</p><p>C. insufficient irrigation</p><p>D. the raising of livestock</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Option A's "soil erosion" is mentioned in the first sentence of the second paragraph: Desertification is yet first through the loss of stabilizing natural vegetation and the subsequent accelerated erosion of the soil by wind and water. Option B, "global warning" In the second sentence of the fourth paragraph, mentioning: Continued gradual global warming has produced an increase in aridity for some areas over the past few thousand years, option D, "raising of livestock" is mentioned in the penultimate sentence of the seventh paragraph: The consequences of an excessive number of livestock grazing in an area are the reduction of the vegetation cover and the trampling and pulverization of the soil. The irrigation of option C is mentioned in ninth paragraph, but C speaks antithesis, the original says overirrigation instead of insufficient , so wrong, selected: The final major human cause of desertification is soil salinization resulting from overirrigation.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Desertification is a significant problem because it is so hard to reverse and affects large areas of land and great numbers of people.</p><p>B. Slowing down the process of desertification is difficult because of population growth that has spread over large areas of land.</p><p>C. The spread of deserts is considered a very serious problem that can be solved only if large numbers of people in various countries are involved in the effort.</p><p>D. Desertification is extremely hard to reverse unless the population is reduced in the vast areas affected.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The main logic of this sentence is juxtaposition, and several parallel objects are indispensable: 1) vast land; 2) large numbers of people affected; and 3) slowing or reversing this process is difficult. The logic of Option A corresponds to the original source, and the objects in parallel are included in the selection, so A is correct; the result of B is partially wrong, the original sentence is the severe situation of desertification, and here it becomes a deceleration process, and the reason part is not 3 All parts are covered; C's solve part of the original sentence is not, is purely a compilation; D's unless structure and the original logic does not match.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>It can be inferred from the passage that the author most likely believes which of the following about the future of desertification?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Governments will act quickly to control further desertification.</p><p>B. The factors influencing desertification occur in cycles and will change in the future.</p><p>C. Desertification will continue to increase.</p><p>D. Desertification will soon occur in all areas of the world.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>This question is more difficult, you need to contact the first two paragraphs. The article begins by pointing out that the desert has already covered a quarter of the earth's surface, and in recent years desertification has expanded at an alarming pace, making another quarter-of-a-kind Earth's land surface is under threat. At the end of the article, it was concluded that once the soil is eroded, only the passage of centuries or millennia can be reborn; though it is understood as "though", the author intends to explain that although protection is possible in those areas where the soil remains, (may make it possible to reverse) can stop the deterioration, but in fact there is an implication of this sentence, that is, those areas that have been seriously corroded are not optimistic about the prospects. In summary, the author is pessimistic about the prospect of desertification and believes that the desertification will continue to expand. So choose C.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>This economic reliance on livestock in certain regions makes large tracts of land susceptible to overgrazing..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The insertion sentence has an explicit relation of this economic reliance. So go to the text to find where to mention economic reliance. Of these options, there is obviously only the major economic activity on which B is based and this correspondence.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>Many factors have contributed to the great increase in desertification in recent decades.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.Growing human populations and the agricultural demands that come with such growth have upset the ecological balance in some areas and led to the spread of deserts.</p><p>B.As periods of severe dryness have become more common, failures of a number of different crops have increased.</p><p>C.Excessive numbers of cattle and the need for firewood for fuel have reduced grasses and trees, leaving the land unprotected and vulnerable.</p><p>D.Extensive irrigation with poor drainage brings salt to the surface of the soil, a process that reduces water and air absorption.</p><p>E.Animal dung enriches the soil by providing nutrients for plant growth.</p><p>F.Grasses are generally the dominant type of natural vegetation in semiarid lands.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="ACD"><p>The correct answer is A, C, and D. A.C.D is mentioned in the text, and B.E.F has no mention.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
