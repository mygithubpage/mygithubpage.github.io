          <h4 class="w3-center">Desert Formation</h4>
          <p>The deserts, which already <span class="highlight">occupy</span> <span class="highlight">approximately</span> a fourth of the Earth's land surface, have in recent decades been increasing at an alarming pace. The <span class="highlight">expansion</span> of desert-like conditions into areas where they did not <span class="highlight">previously</span> exist is called <span class="highlight">desertification</span>. It has been estimated that an <span class="highlight">additional</span> one-fourth of the Earth's land surface is <span class="highlight question1">threatened</span> by this <span class="highlight">process</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="highlight">Desertification</span> is <span class="highlight">accomplished</span> <span class="highlight">primarily</span> <span class="highlight">through</span> the loss of stabilizing natural <span class="highlight">vegetation</span> and the <span class="highlight">subsequent</span> <span class="highlight">accelerated</span> <span class="highlight">erosion</span> of the soil by wind and water. In some cases the <span class="highlight">loose</span> soil is blown completely away, leaving a stony surface. In other cases, the finer particles may be removed, while the sand-sized particles are accumulated to form <span class="highlight">mobile</span> hills or ridges of sand.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="highlight">Even</span> in the areas that <span class="highlight">retain</span> a soil cover, the <span class="highlight">reduction</span> of <span class="highlight">vegetation</span> typically results in the loss of the soil's <span class="highlight">ability</span> to <span class="highlight">absorb</span> <span class="highlight">substantial</span> quantities of water. The <span class="highlight">impact</span> of raindrops on the <span class="highlight">loose</span> soil tends to <span class="highlight">transfer</span> fine <span class="highlight">clay</span> particles into the tiniest soil spaces, sealing them and producing a surface that allows very little water penetration. Water <span class="highlight">absorption</span> is greatly reduced; <span class="highlight">consequently</span> <span class="highlight">runoff</span> is increased, resulting in <span class="highlight">accelerated</span> <span class="highlight">erosion</span> rates. The <span class="highlight">gradual</span> drying of the soil caused by its <span class="highlight">diminished</span> <span class="highlight">ability</span> to <span class="highlight">absorb</span> water results in the further loss of <span class="highlight">vegetation</span>, so that a <span class="highlight">cycle</span> of <span class="highlight">progressive</span> surface <span class="highlight">deterioration</span> is established.</p>
          <p>In some regions, the increase in <span class="highlight">desert</span> areas is occurring largely as the result of a <span class="highlight">trend</span> toward drier <span class="highlight">climatic</span> conditions. Continued <span class="highlight">gradual</span> global warming has produced an increase in aridity for some areas over the past few thousand years. The <span class="highlight">process</span> may be <span class="highlight">accelerated</span> in <span class="highlight">subsequent</span> decades if global warming resulting from <span class="highlight">air</span> pollution seriously increases.</p>
          <p>There is little <span class="highlight">doubt</span>, however, that <span class="highlight">desertification</span> in most areas results <span class="highlight">primarily</span> from human activities rather than natural processes. The <span class="highlight">semiarid</span> lands bordering the deserts exist in a <span class="highlight"><span class="question3">delicate</span></span> <span class="highlight">ecological</span> <span class="highlight">balance</span> and are limited in their <span class="highlight">potential</span> to <span class="highlight">adjust</span> to increased <span class="highlight">environmental</span> pressures. Expanding populations are subjecting the land to increasing pressures to provide them with food and <span class="highlight">fuel</span>. In wet periods, the land may be able to <span class="highlight">respond</span> to these stresses. During the dry periods that are <span class="highlight">common</span> phenomena <span class="highlight">along</span> the <span class="highlight">desert</span> margins, though, the <span class="highlight">pressure</span> on the land is often far in <span class="highlight">excess</span> of its <span class="highlight">diminished</span> <span class="highlight">capacity</span>, and <span class="highlight">desertification</span> results.</p>
          <p>Four <span class="highlight">specific</span> activities have been identified as <span class="highlight">major</span> contributors to the <span class="highlight">desertification</span> processes: overcultivation, overgrazing, firewood gathering, and overirrigation. The <span class="highlight">cultivation</span> of crops has expanded into <span class="question5">progressively</span> drier regions as <span class="highlight">population</span> densities have grown. These regions are especially likely to have periods of <span class="highlight">severe</span> dryness, so that crop failures are <span class="highlight">common</span>. Since the raising of most crops necessitates the <span class="highlight">prior</span> <span class="highlight">removal</span> of the natural <span class="highlight">vegetation</span>, crop failures leave <span class="highlight">extensive</span> tracts of land <span class="question7"><span class="highlight">devoid</span> of</span> a plant cover and <span class="highlight">susceptible</span> to wind and water <span class="highlight">erosion</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A">
            </span>The raising of <span class="highlight">livestock</span> is a <span class="highlight">major</span> <span class="highlight">economic</span> <span class="highlight">activity</span> in <span class="highlight">semiarid</span> lands, where grasses are generally the <span class="highlight">dominant</span> type of natural <span class="highlight">vegetation</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>The consequences of an <span class="highlight">excessive</span> number of <span class="highlight">livestock</span> <span class="highlight">grazing</span> in an area are the <span class="highlight">reduction</span> of the <span class="highlight">vegetation</span> cover and the trampling and pulverization of the soil. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>This is usually followed by the drying of the soil and <span class="highlight">accelerated</span> <span class="highlight">erosion</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p>
          <p>Firewood is the <span class="highlight">chief</span> <span class="highlight">fuel</span> used for cooking and heating in many countries. The increased pressures of expanding populations have led to the <span class="highlight">removal</span> of woody plants so that many cities and towns are surrounded by large areas completely lacking in trees and shrubs. The increasing use of dried animal <span class="highlight">waste</span> as a <span class="highlight">substitute</span> <span class="highlight">fuel</span> has also hurt the soil because this <span class="highlight">valuable</span> soil conditioner and <span class="highlight">source</span> of plant nutrients is no longer being returned to the land.</p>
          <p>The final <span class="highlight">major</span> human cause of <span class="highlight">desertification</span> is soil <span class="highlight">salinization</span> resulting from overirrigation. <span class="highlight">Excess</span> water from <span class="highlight">irrigation</span> sinks down into the water table. If no <span class="highlight">drainage</span> system exists, the water table rises, bringing dissolved salts to the surface. The water evaporates and the salts are left behind, creating a white <span class="highlight">crustal</span> <span class="highlight">layer</span> that prevents <span class="highlight">air</span> and water from reaching the <span class="highlight">underlying</span> soil.</p>
          <p><span class="question10">The <span class="highlight">extreme</span> seriousness of <span class="highlight">desertification</span> results from the <span class="highlight">vast</span> areas of land and the <span class="highlight">tremendous</span> numbers of people affected, as well as from the great difficulty of reversing or <span class="highlight">even</span> slowing the <span class="highlight">process</span>.</span> Once the soil has been removed by <span class="highlight">erosion</span>, only the <span class="highlight">passage</span> of centuries or <span class="highlight">millennia</span> will enable new soil to form. In areas where <span class="highlight">considerable</span> soil still remains, though, a rigorously enforced program of land protection and cover-crop planting may make it possible to <span class="highlight">reverse</span> the present <span class="highlight">deterioration</span> of the surface.</p>

              <p>Devoid of: No, lack. Echo with option D. A is composed of... B is hidden by... C is apart; D is lacking. The original sentence of the raising of most crops necessitates the prior removal of the natural vegetation, crop failures leave extensive tracts of land devoid of a plant cover and susceptible to wind and water erosion. The original sentence has obvious inheritance relationship, connected with and , so crop failure leaves the land devoid of vegetation cover, and then it suffers erosion. This kind of inheritance relationship can be withdrawn, devoid of negative expressions, and erosion without erosion. So the correct answer is D.</p>

              <p>This question is more difficult, you need to contact the first two paragraphs. The article begins by pointing out that the desert has already covered a quarter of the earth's surface, and in recent years desertification has expanded at an alarming pace, making another quarter-of-a-kind Earth's land surface is under threat. At the end of the article, it was concluded that once the soil is eroded, only the passage of centuries or millennia can be reborn; though it is understood as "though", the author intends to explain that although protection is possible in those areas where the soil remains, (may make it possible to reverse) can stop the deterioration, but in fact there is an implication of this sentence, that is, those areas that have been seriously corroded are not optimistic about the prospects. In summary, the author is pessimistic about the prospect of desertification and believes that the desertification will continue to expand. So choose C.</p>
