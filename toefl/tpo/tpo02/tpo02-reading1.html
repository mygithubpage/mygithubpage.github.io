            <b>Desert Formation</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>The deserts, which already <span class="underline">occupy</span> <span class="underline">approximately</span> a fourth of the Earth's land surface, have in recent decades been increasing at an alarming pace. The <span class="underline">expansion</span> of desert-like conditions into areas where they did not <span class="underline">previously</span> exist is called <span class="underline">desertification</span>. It has been estimated that an <span class="underline">additional</span> one-fourth of the Earth's land surface is <span class="light">threatened</span> by this <span class="underline">process</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="underline">Desertification</span> is <span class="underline">accomplished</span> <span class="underline">primarily</span> <span class="underline">through</span> the loss of stabilizing natural <span class="underline">vegetation</span> and the <span class="underline">subsequent</span> <span class="underline">accelerated</span> <span class="underline">erosion</span> of the soil by wind and water. In some cases the <span class="underline">loose</span> soil is blown completely away, leaving a stony surface. In other cases, the finer particles may be removed, while the sand-sized particles are accumulated to form <span class="underline">mobile</span> hills or ridges of sand.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="underline">Even</span> in the areas that <span class="underline">retain</span> a soil cover, the <span class="underline">reduction</span> of <span class="underline">vegetation</span> typically results in the loss of the soil's <span class="underline">ability</span> to <span class="underline">absorb</span> <span class="underline">substantial</span> quantities of water. The <span class="underline">impact</span> of raindrops on the <span class="underline">loose</span> soil tends to <span class="underline">transfer</span> fine <span class="underline">clay</span> particles into the tiniest soil spaces, sealing them and producing a surface that allows very little water penetration. Water <span class="underline">absorption</span> is greatly reduced; <span class="underline">consequently</span> <span class="underline">runoff</span> is increased, resulting in <span class="underline">accelerated</span> <span class="underline">erosion</span> rates. The <span class="underline">gradual</span> drying of the soil caused by its <span class="underline">diminished</span> <span class="underline">ability</span> to <span class="underline">absorb</span> water results in the further loss of <span class="underline">vegetation</span>, so that a <span class="underline">cycle</span> of <span class="underline">progressive</span> surface <span class="underline">deterioration</span> is established.</p>
          <p>In some regions, the increase in <span class="underline">desert</span> areas is occurring largely as the result of a <span class="underline">trend</span> toward drier <span class="underline">climatic</span> conditions. Continued <span class="underline">gradual</span> global warming has produced an increase in aridity for some areas over the past few thousand years. The <span class="underline">process</span> may be <span class="underline">accelerated</span> in <span class="underline">subsequent</span> decades if global warming resulting from <span class="underline">air</span> pollution seriously increases.</p>
          <p>There is little <span class="underline">doubt</span>, however, that <span class="underline">desertification</span> in most areas results <span class="underline">primarily</span> from human activities rather than natural processes. The <span class="underline">semiarid</span> lands bordering the deserts exist in a <span class="underline">delicate</span> <span class="underline">ecological</span> <span class="underline">balance</span> and are limited in their <span class="underline">potential</span> to <span class="underline">adjust</span> to increased <span class="underline">environmental</span> pressures. Expanding populations are subjecting the land to increasing pressures to provide them with food and <span class="underline">fuel</span>. In wet periods, the land may be able to <span class="underline">respond</span> to these stresses. During the dry periods that are <span class="underline">common</span> phenomena <span class="underline">along</span> the <span class="underline">desert</span> margins, though, the <span class="underline">pressure</span> on the land is often far in <span class="underline">excess</span> of its <span class="underline">diminished</span> <span class="underline">capacity</span>, and <span class="underline">desertification</span> results.</p>
          <p>Four <span class="underline">specific</span> activities have been identified as <span class="underline">major</span> contributors to the <span class="underline">desertification</span> processes: overcultivation, overgrazing, firewood gathering, and overirrigation. The <span class="underline">cultivation</span> of crops has expanded into progressively drier regions as <span class="underline">population</span> densities have grown. These regions are especially likely to have periods of <span class="underline">severe</span> dryness, so that crop failures are <span class="underline">common</span>. Since the raising of most crops necessitates the <span class="underline">prior</span> <span class="underline">removal</span> of the natural <span class="underline">vegetation</span>, crop failures leave <span class="underline">extensive</span> tracts of land <span class="underline">devoid</span> of a plant cover and <span class="underline">susceptible</span> to wind and water <span class="underline">erosion</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A">
            </span>The raising of <span class="underline">livestock</span> is a <span class="underline">major</span> <span class="underline">economic</span> <span class="underline">activity</span> in <span class="underline">semiarid</span> lands, where grasses are generally the <span class="underline">dominant</span> type of natural <span class="underline">vegetation</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>The consequences of an <span class="underline">excessive</span> number of <span class="underline">livestock</span> <span class="underline">grazing</span> in an area are the <span class="underline">reduction</span> of the <span class="underline">vegetation</span> cover and the trampling and pulverization of the soil. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>This is usually followed by the drying of the soil and <span class="underline">accelerated</span> <span class="underline">erosion</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p>
          <p>Firewood is the <span class="underline">chief</span> <span class="underline">fuel</span> used for cooking and heating in many countries. The increased pressures of expanding populations have led to the <span class="underline">removal</span> of woody plants so that many cities and towns are surrounded by large areas completely lacking in trees and shrubs. The increasing use of dried animal <span class="underline">waste</span> as a <span class="underline">substitute</span> <span class="underline">fuel</span> has also hurt the soil because this <span class="underline">valuable</span> soil conditioner and <span class="underline">source</span> of plant nutrients is no longer being returned to the land.</p>
          <p>The final <span class="underline">major</span> human cause of <span class="underline">desertification</span> is soil <span class="underline">salinization</span> resulting from overirrigation. <span class="underline">Excess</span> water from <span class="underline">irrigation</span> sinks down into the water table. If no <span class="underline">drainage</span> system exists, the water table rises, bringing dissolved salts to the surface. The water evaporates and the salts are left behind, creating a white <span class="underline">crustal</span> <span class="underline">layer</span> that prevents <span class="underline">air</span> and water from reaching the <span class="underline">underlying</span> soil.</p>
          <p>The <span class="underline">extreme</span> seriousness of <span class="underline">desertification</span> results from the <span class="underline">vast</span> areas of land and the <span class="underline">tremendous</span> numbers of people affected, as well as from the great difficulty of reversing or <span class="underline">even</span> slowing the <span class="underline">process</span>. Once the soil has been removed by <span class="underline">erosion</span>, only the <span class="underline">passage</span> of centuries or <span class="underline">millennia</span> will enable new soil to form. In areas where <span class="underline">considerable</span> soil still remains, though, a rigorously enforced program of land protection and cover-crop planting may make it possible to <span class="underline">reverse</span> the present <span class="underline">deterioration</span> of the surface.</p>
