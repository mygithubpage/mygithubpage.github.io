              <span class="time" data-times="7.12" data-time="4.5">[00:04.50]</span>Professor: OK. Another <span class="underline">ancient</span> Greek <span class="underline">philosopher</span> we need to discuss is <span class="underline">Aristotle</span>-<span class="underline">Aristotle</span>'s <span class="underline">ethical</span> <span class="underline">theory</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.87" data-time="11.62">[00:11.62]</span>What <span class="underline">Aristotle</span>'s <span class="underline">ethical</span> <span class="underline">theory</span> is all about is this: he's trying to show you how to be happy-what true happiness is. <span class="time" data-times="3.58" data-time="20.49">[00:20.49]</span>Now, why is he interested in human happiness? <span class="time" data-times="4.45" data-time="24.07">[00:24.07]</span>It's not just because it's something that all people want or aim for. <span class="time" data-times="1.22" data-time="28.52">[00:28.52]</span>It's more than that. <span class="time" data-times="4.45" data-time="29.74">[00:29.74]</span>But to get there we need to first make a very important <span class="underline">distinction</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.72" data-time="34.19">[00:34.19]</span>Let me introduce a <span class="underline">couple</span> of <span class="underline">technical</span> terms: <span class="underline">extrinsic</span> value and <span class="underline">intrinsic</span> value. <span class="time" data-times="9.53" data-time="40.91">[00:40.91]</span>To understand <span class="underline">Aristotle</span>'s <span class="underline">interest</span> in happiness, you need to understand this <span class="underline">distinction</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8" data-time="50.44">[00:50.44]</span>Some things we aim for and value, not for themselves but for what they bring about in <span class="underline">addition</span> to themselves. <span class="time" data-times="6.89" data-time="58.44">[00:58.44]</span>If I value something as a means to something else, then it has what we will call "<span class="underline">extrinsic</span> value." <span class="time" data-times="4.97" data-time="65.33">[01:05.33]</span>Other things we <span class="underline">desire</span> and hold to be <span class="underline">valuable</span> for themselves alone. <span class="time" data-times="8.69" data-time="70.3">[01:10.30]</span>If we value something not as a means to something else, but for its own <span class="underline">sake</span>, let us say that it has "<span class="underline">intrinsic</span> value."</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.22" data-time="78.99">[01:18.99]</span>
              <span class="underline">Exercise</span>. There may be some people who value <span class="underline">exercise</span> for itself, but I don't. <span class="time" data-times="6.79" data-time="85.21">[01:25.21]</span>I value <span class="underline">exercise</span> because if I <span class="underline">exercise</span>, I <span class="underline">tend</span> to stay healthier than I would if I didn't. <span class="time" data-times="10.22" data-time="92">[01:32.00]</span>So I <span class="underline">desire</span> to <span class="underline">engage</span> in <span class="underline">exercise</span> and I value <span class="underline">exercise</span> extrinsically, not for its own <span class="underline">sake</span>, but as a means to something beyond it. <span class="time" data-times="1.46" data-time="102.22">[01:42.22]</span>It brings me good health.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.19" data-time="103.68">[01:43.68]</span>Health. Why do I value good health? <span class="time" data-times="3.03" data-time="106.87">[01:46.87]</span>Well, here it gets a little more <span class="underline">complicated</span> for me. <span class="time" data-times="9.4" data-time="109.9">[01:49.90]</span>Um, health is important for me because I can't...do other things I want to do-play music, teach <span class="underline">philosophy</span>-if I'm ill. <span class="time" data-times="6.17" data-time="119.3">[01:59.30]</span>So health is important to me-has value to me-as a means to a <span class="underline">productive</span> life. <span class="time" data-times="6.89" data-time="125.47">[02:05.47]</span>But health is also important to me because I just kind of like to be healthy-it feels good. <span class="time" data-times="3.5" data-time="132.36">[02:12.36]</span>It's pleasant to be healthy, unpleasant not to be. <span class="time" data-times="7.68" data-time="135.86">[02:15.86]</span>So to some <span class="underline">degree</span>, I value health both for itself and as a means to something else: <span class="underline">productivity</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.1" data-time="143.54">[02:23.54]</span>It's got <span class="underline">extrinsic</span> and <span class="underline">intrinsic</span> value for me.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.05" data-time="147.64">[02:27.64]</span>Then there's some things that are just valued for themselves. <span class="time" data-times="5.1" data-time="151.69">[02:31.69]</span>I'm a <span class="underline">musician</span>, not a <span class="underline">professional</span> <span class="underline">musician</span>; I just play a <span class="underline">musical</span> <span class="underline">instrument</span> for fun. <span class="time" data-times="2.51" data-time="156.79">[02:36.79]</span>Why do I value playing music? <span class="time" data-times="5.79" data-time="159.3">[02:39.30]</span>Well, like most <span class="underline">amateur</span> musicians, I only play because, well, I just enjoy it. <span class="time" data-times="2.3" data-time="165.09">[02:45.09]</span>It's something that's an end in itself.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8" data-time="167.39">[02:47.39]</span>Now, something else I value is teaching. <span class="time" data-times="6.47" data-time="175.39">[02:55.39]</span>Why? Well, it brings in a <span class="underline">modest</span> income, but I could make more money doing other things. <span class="time" data-times="2.88" data-time="181.86">[03:01.86]</span>I'd do it <span class="underline">even</span> if they didn't <span class="underline">pay</span> me. <span class="time" data-times="1.36" data-time="184.74">[03:04.74]</span>I just enjoy teaching. <span class="time" data-times="3.13" data-time="186.1">[03:06.10]</span>In that <span class="underline">sense</span> it's an end to itself. <span class="time" data-times="6.48" data-time="189.23">[03:09.23]</span>But teaching's not something that has <span class="underline">intrinsic</span> value for all people-and that's true generally.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.07" data-time="195.71">[03:15.71]</span>Most things that are enjoyed in and of themselves <span class="underline">vary</span> from person to person. <span class="time" data-times="4.44" data-time="200.78">[03:20.78]</span>Some people value teaching intrinsically, but others don't. <span class="time" data-times="3.29" data-time="205.22">[03:25.22]</span>So how does all this <span class="underline">relate</span> to human happiness? <span class="time" data-times="10.55" data-time="208.51">[03:28.51]</span>Well, <span class="underline">Aristotle</span> asks: is there something that all human beings value . . . and value only intrinsically, for its own <span class="underline">sake</span> and only for its own <span class="underline">sake</span>?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.72" data-time="219.06">[03:39.06]</span>If you could find such a thing, that would be the universal final good, or truly the <span class="underline">ultimate</span> purpose or goal for all human beings. <span class="time" data-times="2.46" data-time="228.78">[03:48.78]</span> <span class="underline">Aristotle</span> thought the answer was yes. <span class="time" data-times="1.09" data-time="231.24">[03:51.24]</span>What is it? <span class="time" data-times="9.75" data-time="232.33">[03:52.33]</span>Happiness. Everyone will agree, he argues, that happiness is the <span class="underline">ultimate</span> end to be valued for itself and really only for itself. <span class="time" data-times="3.39" data-time="242.08">[04:02.08]</span>For what other purpose is there in being happy? <span class="time" data-times="1.62" data-time="245.47">[04:05.47]</span>What does it <span class="underline">yield</span>? <span class="time" data-times="5.18" data-time="247.09">[04:07.09]</span>The attainment of happiness becomes the <span class="underline">ultimate</span> or highest good for <span class="underline">Aristotle</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.01" data-time="252.27">[04:12.27]</span>The next question that <span class="underline">Aristotle</span> raises is: what is happiness? <span class="time" data-times="3.76" data-time="257.28">[04:17.28]</span>We all want it; we all <span class="underline">desire</span> it; we all seek it. <span class="time" data-times="2.09" data-time="261.04">[04:21.04]</span>It's the goal we have in life. <span class="time" data-times="1.57" data-time="263.13">[04:23.13]</span>But what is it? <span class="time" data-times="1.51" data-time="264.7">[04:24.70]</span>How do we find it? <span class="time" data-times="4.39" data-time="266.21">[04:26.21]</span>Here he notes, with some frustration, people disagree. <span class="time" data-times="8" data-time="270.6">[04:30.60]</span>But he does give us a <span class="underline">couple</span> of <span class="underline">criteria</span>, or features, to keep in <span class="underline">mind</span> as we look for what true human happiness is.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.38" data-time="278.6">[04:38.60]</span>True human happiness should be, as he puts it, complete. <span class="time" data-times="3.4" data-time="282.98">[04:42.98]</span>Complete in that it's all we <span class="underline">require</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.7" data-time="286.38">[04:46.38]</span>Well, true human happiness...if you had that, what else do you need? Nothing. <span class="time" data-times="5.06" data-time="292.08">[04:52.08]</span>And, <span class="underline">second</span>, true happiness should be something that I can <span class="underline">obtain</span> on my own. <span class="time" data-times="2.82" data-time="297.14">[04:57.14]</span>I shouldn't have to <span class="underline">rely</span> on other people for it.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.19" data-time="299.96">[04:59.96]</span>Many people value fame and seek fame. <span class="time" data-times="2.19" data-time="303.15">[05:03.15]</span>Fame for them becomes the goal. <span class="time" data-times="7.37" data-time="305.34">[05:05.34]</span>But, according to <span class="underline">Aristotle</span>, this won't work either, because fame depends <span class="underline">altogether</span> too much on other people. <span class="time" data-times="3.76" data-time="312.71">[05:12.71]</span>I can't get it on my own, without help from other people. <span class="time" data-times="9.54" data-time="316.47">[05:16.47]</span>In the end, <span class="underline">Aristotle</span> says that true happiness is the <span class="underline">exercise</span> of <span class="underline">reason</span>-a life of <span class="underline">intellectual</span> contemplation ...of thinking. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="326.01">[05:26.01]</span>So let's see how he comes to that.</p>
