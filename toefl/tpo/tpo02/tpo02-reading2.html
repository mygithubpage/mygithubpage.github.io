      <h4 class="w3-center">The Origins of Cetaceans</h4>
      <p>It should be <span class="highlight">obvious</span> that cetaceans—whales, porpoises, and dolphins—are mammals. They breathe <span class="highlight">through</span> lungs, not <span class="highlight">through</span> gills, and give birth to live young. Their <span class="highlight">streamlined</span> bodies, the <span class="highlight">absence</span> of <span class="highlight">hind</span> legs, and the presence of a fluke and blowhole cannot <span class="highlight">disguise</span> their affinities with land <span class="highlight">dwelling</span> mammals. However, unlike the cases of sea otters and pinnipeds (seals, sea lions, and walruses, whose limbs are <span class="highlight">functional</span> both on land and at sea), it is not easy to <span class="highlight">envision</span> what the first whales looked like. <span class="highlight">Extinct</span> but already fully <span class="highlight">marine</span> cetaceans are known from the <span class="highlight">fossil</span><span class="highlight">record</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>How was the <span class="highlight">gap</span> between a walking <span class="highlight">mammal</span> and a swimming whale bridged? <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>Missing until recently were fossils clearly <span class="highlight">intermediate</span>, or transitional, between land mammals and cetaceans.</p>
      <p><span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>Very <span class="highlight">exciting</span> discoveries have finally allowed scientists to reconstruct the most likely origins of cetaceans. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>In 1979, a team looking for fossils in northern Pakistan found what proved to be the oldest <span class="highlight">fossil</span> whale. The <span class="highlight">fossil</span> was officially named Pakicetus in honor of the country where the discovery was made. Pakicetus was found embedded in rocks formed from river deposits that were 52 million years old. The river that formed these deposits was actually not far from an <span class="highlight">ancient</span> ocean known as the Tethys Sea.</p>
      <p>The <span class="highlight">fossil</span> consists of a complete <span class="highlight">skull</span> of an archaeocyte, an <span class="highlight">extinct</span> group of ancestors of modern cetaceans. Although limited to a <span class="highlight">skull</span>, the Pakicetus <span class="highlight">fossil</span> provides <span class="highlight"><span class="question3">precious</span></span> details on the origins of cetaceans. The <span class="highlight">skull</span> is cetacean-like but its jawbones <span class="highlight">lack</span> the enlarged <span class="highlight">space</span> that is filled with fat or oil and used for receiving underwater <span class="highlight">sound</span> in modern whales. Pakicetus probably detected <span class="highlight">sound</span><span class="highlight">through</span> the ear opening as in land mammals. The <span class="highlight">skull</span> also lacks a blowhole, another <span class="highlight">cetacean</span><span class="highlight">adaptation</span> for diving. Other features, however, show experts that Pakicetus is a transitional form between a group of <span class="highlight">extinct</span> flesh-eating mammals, the mesonychids, and cetaceans. It has been suggested that Pakicetus fed on fish in <span class="highlight">shallow</span> water and was not yet adapted for life in the open ocean. <span class="question5">It</span> probably bred and gave birth on land.</p>
      <p>Another <span class="highlight">major</span> discovery was made in Egypt in 1989. Several skeletons of another early whale, Basilosaurus, were found in sediments left by the Tethys Sea and now <span class="highlight"><span class="question6">exposed</span></span> in the Sahara <span class="highlight">desert</span>. This whale lived around 40 million years ago, 12 million years after Pakicetus. Many incomplete skeletons were found but they included, for the first time in an archaeocyte, a complete <span class="highlight">hind</span> leg that features a foot with three tiny toes. Such legs would have been far too small to have supported the 50-foot-long Basilosaurus on land. Basilosaurus was undoubtedly a fully <span class="highlight">marine</span> whale with possibly nonfunctional, or vestigial, <span class="highlight">hind</span> legs.</p>
      <p>An <span class="highlight">even</span> more <span class="highlight">exciting</span> find was reported in 1994, also from Pakistan. The now <span class="highlight">extinct</span> whale Ambulocetus natans ("the walking whale that swam") lived in the Tethys Sea 49 million years ago. It lived around 3 million years after Pakicetus but 9 million before Basilosaurus. The <span class="highlight">fossil</span><span class="question9">luckily</span> includes a good <span class="highlight">portion</span> of the <span class="highlight">hind</span> legs. The legs were strong and ended in long feet very much like those of a modern pinniped. The legs were certainly <span class="highlight">functional</span> both on land and at sea. The whale retained a tail and lacked a fluke, the <span class="highlight">major</span> means of <span class="highlight">locomotion</span> in modern cetaceans. <span class="question10">The structure of the <span class="highlight">backbone</span> shows, however, that Ambulocetus swam like modern whales by moving the <span class="highlight">rear</span><span class="highlight">portion</span> of its body up and down, <span class="highlight">even</span> though a fluke was missing.</span> The large <span class="highlight">hind</span> legs were used for <span class="highlight"><span class="question11">propulsion</span></span> in water. On land, where it probably bred and gave birth, Ambulocetus may have moved around very much like a modern sea lion. It was undoubtedly a whale that linked life on land with life at sea.</p>

          <p>D. It cannot yield clues about the origins of cetaceans.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="explanation" data-answer="B">
          <p>According to blowhole, find: the presence of a fluke1 and blowhole2 cannot disguise their affinities with land dwelling mammals. Option B is correct and is a synonymous adaptation of the sentence.</p>

        <div class="question">
          <p>Which of the following can be inferred from paragraph 1 about early sea otters?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="choices">
          <p>A. It is not difficult to imagine what they looked like.</p>
          <p>B. There were great numbers of them.</p>
          <p>C. They lived in the sea only.</p>
          <p>D. They did not leave many fossil remains.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="explanation" data-answer="A">
          <p>Typical non-reasonable questions. According to sea otters' original position, find: thelike of cases of sea otters and pinnipeds (seals, sea lions, and walruses, whose limbs are functional both on land and at sea), it is not easy to envision what the first whales looked like. A correct. BCD can not be launched.</p>

      <div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio">
        <div class="question">
          <p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question3">precious</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p>
        </div>
        <div class="choices">

          <p>Precious: <span class="question3">precious</span>, <span class="question3">precious</span>. And option C's valued echoes. A is accurate; B is scarce; D is the beginning. Corresponding to the original Abstract limited to a skull, the Pakicetus fossil provides <span class="question3">precious</span> details on the origins of cetaceans. The original sentence has a clear turning point in logic, before the turning point emphasizes the limited nature of the fossils, after turning the fossils provide <span class="question3">precious</span> details. From the transitional relationship, it can be inferred that <span class="question3">precious</span> should be a positive description because it is a negative description before the transition, so that a reasonable turning point can be formed. Then BD can be directly excluded, are neutral words, and AC is possible. C is closer to <span class="question3">precious</span>, so it's correct.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio">
        <div class="question">
          <p>Pakicetus and modern cetaceans have similar</p>

        </div>
        <div class="explanation" data-answer="C">
          <p>Most of the entire paragraph describes the difference between the two. Only the third sentence describes the similarities: The skull is cetacean-like but its jawbones lack the enlarged space that is is filled with fat or oil and used for receiving underwater sound In modern whales. This sentence says P's skull is cetacen-like, which corresponds to the C option. So the correct answer is C.</p>

          <p>Exposed: <span class="question6">exposed</span>. Echoes option B. A is the explanation; C is verified; D is positioned. Corresponding to the original Severs skeletons of another early whale, Basilosaurus, were found in sediments left by the Tethys Sea and now <span class="question6">exposed</span> in the Sahara desert. This sentence said that another skeleton of the whales was discovered. Saying that these skeletons can be seen in the desert, B is the most suitable.</p>

        <div class="explanation" data-answer="D">
          <p>Use the hind leg to locate the fourth sentence, but this sentence does not say importance, look down, such tells you the next sentence is related content: Such legs would have been far too small small to have supported the 50-foot-long Basilosaurus On land. This sentence emphasizes that the leg is too small to support on land, corresponding to the D option.</p>

        <div class="explanation" data-answer=" B">
          <p>Luckily's sentence, and the next two sentences, describe the meaning of the discovery of the "hing leg", and together they read to find the main sentence that he supports, that is, the sixth sentence of this paragraph: The fossil <span class="question9">luckily</span> includes a good portion of the hind Legs. The legs were strong and ended in long feet very much like those of a modern pinniped. The legs were last functional both on land and at sea. <span class="question9">luckily</span> means "lucky" and called "lucky" on A fossil. In terms of scientific value, because it has a good portion of the hind leg, (in the sixth sentence) the scientists are able to introduce "The legs were last functional both on land and at sea" (A. Land and land amphibious). In summary, it is because the legs provide important scientific information that people call it <span class="question9">luckily</span>, so choose B.</p>

          <p>C. Although Ambulocetus had no fluke, its backbone structure shows that it swam like modern whales.</p>
          <p>D. By moving the rear parts of their bodies up and down, modern whales swim in a different way from the way Ambulocetus swam.</p>

          <p>The main logic of this sentence is the turning point, there are even though divided into 2 parts. Despite the lack of fluke, Ambulocetus swims like a whale by the back of the body.
