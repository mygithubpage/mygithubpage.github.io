In the peepshow <span class="highlight">format</span>, a <span class="highlight">film</span> was viewed <span class="highlight">through</span> a small opening in a machine that was created for that purpose. Thomas Edison's peepshow <span class="highlight">device</span>, the Kinetoscope, was introduced to the public in 1894. It was designed for use in Kinetoscope parlors, or arcades, which contained only a few <span class="highlight">individual</span> machines and permitted only one customer to view a short, 50-foot <span class="highlight">film</span> at any one time. The first Kinetoscope parlors contained five machines. For the price of 25 cents (or 5 cents per machine), customers moved from machine to machine to watch five different films (or, in the case of famous prizefights, <span class="highlight">successive</span> rounds of a single fight).</p><p>These Kinetoscope arcades were modeled on <span class="highlight">phonograph</span> parlors, which had proven successful for Edison several years earlier. In the <span class="highlight">phonograph</span> parlors, customers listened to recordings <span class="highlight">through</span><span class="highlight">individual</span> ear tubes, moving from one machine to the next to hear different recorded speeches or pieces of music. The Kinetoscope parlors functioned in a <span class="highlight">similar</span> way. Edison was more interested in the sale of Kinetoscopes (for <span class="highlight">roughly</span> $1,000 apiece) to these parlors than in the films that would be run in them (which <span class="highlight">cost</span><span class="highlight">approximately</span> $10 to $15 each). <span class="question3">He refused to develop <span class="highlight">projection</span> technology, reasoning that if he made and sold projectors, then exhibitors would <span class="highlight">purchase</span> only one machine-a projector-from him <span class="highlight">instead</span> of several.</span></p><p><span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>Exhibitors, however, <span class="highlight">wanted</span> to maximize their profits, which they could do more <span class="highlight"><span class="question4">readily</span></span> by projecting a <span class="highlight">handful</span> of films to hundreds of customers at a time (rather than one at a time) and by charging 25 to 50 cents <span class="highlight">admission</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> About a year after the opening of the first Kinetoscope <span class="highlight">parlor</span> in 1894, showmen such as Louis and Auguste Lumiere, Thomas Armat and Charles Francis Jenkins, and Orville and Woodville Latham (with the <span class="highlight"><span class="question5">assistance</span></span> of Edison's <span class="highlight">former</span><span class="highlight">assistant</span>, William Dickson) perfected <span class="highlight">projection</span> devices. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>These early <span class="highlight">projection</span> devices were used in vaudeville theaters, <span class="highlight">legitimate</span> theaters, <span class="highlight">local</span> town halls, makeshift <span class="highlight">storefront</span> theaters, fairgrounds, and <span class="highlight">amusement</span> parks to show films to a <span class="highlight">mass</span><span class="highlight">audience</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p><p>With the <span class="highlight">advent</span> of <span class="highlight">projection</span> in 1895-1896, <span class="highlight">motion</span> pictures became the <span class="highlight">ultimate</span> form of <span class="highlight">mass</span><span class="highlight">consumption</span>. <span class="highlight">Previously</span>, large audiences had viewed spectacles at the theater, where vaudeville, <span class="highlight">popular</span> dramas, <span class="highlight">musical</span> and minstrel shows, <span class="highlight">classical</span> plays, lectures, and slide-and-lantern shows had been presented to several hundred spectators at a time. But the movies differed <span class="highlight">significantly</span> from these other forms of entertainment, which depended on either live performance or (in the case of the slide-and-lantern shows) the active <span class="highlight">involvement</span> of a master of ceremonies who assembled the final program.</p><p>Although early exhibitors regularly accompanied movies with live acts, the <span class="highlight">substance</span> of the movies themselves is mass-produced, prerecorded <span class="highlight">material</span> that can easily be reproduced by theaters with little or no active participation by the exhibitor. <span class="highlight">Even</span> though early exhibitors shaped their <span class="highlight">film</span> programs by mixing films and other entertainments together in whichever way they thought would be most <span class="highlight">attractive</span> to audiences or by accompanying them with lectures, their <span class="highlight">creative</span> control remained limited. What audiences came to see was the <span class="highlight">technological</span><span class="highlight">marvel</span> of the movies; the lifelike <span class="highlight">reproduction</span> of the <span class="highlight">commonplace</span><span class="highlight">motion</span> of trains, of waves <span class="highlight">striking</span> the <span class="highlight">shore</span>, and of people walking in the street; and the magic made possible by trick <span class="highlight">photography</span> and the manipulation of the camera.</p><p>With the <span class="highlight">advent</span> of <span class="highlight">projection</span>, the viewer's relationship with the <span class="highlight">image</span> was no longer private, as it had been with earlier peepshow devices such as the Kinetoscope and the Mutoscope, which was a <span class="highlight">similar</span> machine that reproduced <span class="highlight">motion</span> by means of <span class="highlight">successive</span> images on <span class="highlight">individual</span><span class="highlight">photographic</span> cards <span class="highlight">instead</span> of on strips of <span class="highlight">celluloid</span>. It suddenly became public-an experience that the viewer shared with dozens, scores, and <span class="highlight">even</span> hundreds of others. At the same time, the <span class="highlight">image</span> that the <span class="highlight">spectator</span> looked at <span class="question11">expanded</span> from the <span class="highlight">minuscule</span> peepshow dimensions of 1 or 2 inches (in height) to the life-size proportions of 6 or 9 feet.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 1, all of the following were true of viewing films in Kinetoscope parlors EXCEPT:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. One individual at a time viewed a film.</p><p>B. Customers could view one film after another.</p><p>C. Prizefights were the most popular subjects for films.</p><p>D. Each film was short.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>BC corresponds to the last sentence, indicating that the audience can watch one by one. B is correct; the article did not point out that the professional boxing match (prizefight) is the most popular, so C is wrong, choose: For the price of 25 cents (or 5 cents per machine), customers moved from machine to machine to watch five different films ( Or, in the case of famous prizefights, successive rounds of a single fight).</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The author discusses phonograph parlors in paragraph 2 in order to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. explain Edison's financial success</p><p>B. describe the model used to design Kinetoscope parlors</p><p>C. contrast their popularity to that of Kinetoscope parlors</p><p>D. illustrate how much more technologically advanced Kinetoscope parlors were</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The first sentence of the paragraph indicates that the Kinetoscope arcades are modeled after the phonograph parlors, and then describe the setting of the phonograph room, thus illustrating the similar effect of the Kinetoscope parlors. Select B.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence from the passage? Incorrect answer choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Edison was more interested in developing a variety of machines than in developing a technology based on only one.</p><p>B. Edison refused to work on projection technology because he did not think exhibitors would replace their projectors with newer machines.</p><p>C. Edison did not want to develop projection technology because it limited the number of machines he could sell.</p><p>D. Edison would not develop projection technology unless exhibitors agreed to purchase more than one projector from him.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The sentence points out: Edison did not want to improve the screening technology because the exhibitor would not buy a large number of machines, thus reducing his income. The main logic in this sentence is cause and effect. The C option perfectly reproduces the logic of the original sentence, and the causal content is completely correct, so choose C. Variety of the A option is completely irrelevant to the original sentence, and no causal logic is reproduced; the result of the B option is correct, and the reason is contrary to the original sentence; the absolute logic of D is incorrect, and the original sentence of the exibitors is not mentioned.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question4">readily</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. frequently</p><p>B. easily</p><p>C. intelligently</p><p>D. obviously</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>Accessible: Easily. Echoes option B. Corresponding to the original Exhibitors, however, wanted to maximize their profits, which they could do more <span class="question4">readily</span> by projecting a handful of films to hundreds of customers at a time (rather than one at a time) and by charging 25 to 50 cents admission. Words can be learned that the player wants to maximize the benefits, which can be more <span class="question4">readily</span> done by playing a lot of movies to hundreds of viewers at a time. From the context it can be inferred that <span class="question4">readily</span> should be easy, and that other alternatives are not reasonable.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question5">assistance</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. criticism</p><p>B. leadership</p><p>C. help</p><p>D. approval</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" C"><p>Assistance: help. Interact with option C. Corresponding to the original About a year after the opening of the first Kinetoscope parlor in 1894, showmen such as Louis and Auguste Lumiere, Thomas Armat and Charles Francis Jenkins, and Orville and Woodville Latham (with the <span class="question5">assistance</span> of Edison's former assistant, William Dickson) perfected projection Devices. This sentence said that these people have perfected the projection instrument. Under Edison's assistant, it is not difficult to guess from the context that it is help. So the correct answer is C</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, how did the early movies differ from previous spectacles that were presented to large audiences?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They were a more expensive form of entertainment.</p><p>B. They were viewed by larger audiences.</p><p>C. They were more educational.</p><p>D. They did not require live entertainers.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>With differing to the last sentence: But the movies differed significantly from these other forms of entertainment, which depended on either live performance or the active involvement of a master of ceremonies who assembled the final program. The point is that it does not require performers' live performance or the active involvement, so choose D.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 5, what role did early exhibitors play in the presentation of movies in theaters?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They decided how to combine various components of the film program.</p><p>B. They advised film-makers on appropriate movie content.</p><p>C. They often took part in the live-action performances.</p><p>D. They produced and prerecorded the material that was shown in the theaters.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>According to early exhibitors positioning the first two sentences: if early exhibitors regularly accompanying movies with live acts, the substance of the movies themselves is mass-produced, prerecorded material that can easily be reproduced by theaters with little or no active participation by the Exhibitor. Even though early exhibitors shaped their film programs by mixing films and other entertainments together in whichever way thoughts would most attractive to audiences or by accompanying them with lectures, their creative control remained limited. The C option, but the C option and the original anchor segment, the original saying is accompanied by the movie, while the latter half emphasizes that there can be no active participation, so C is wrong; and the second sentence says: The early showman tried to combine the movie with other entertainment elements Up, corresponding to the A option, correct.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the following is mentioned in paragraph 6 as one of the ways the Mutoscope differed from the Kinetoscope?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Sound and motion were simultaneously produced in the Mutoscope.</p><p>B. More than one person could view the images at the same time with the Mutoscope.</p><p>C. The Mutoscope was a less sophisticated earlier prototype of the Kinetoscope.</p><p>D. A different type of material was used to produce the images used in the Mutoscope.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>Positioning to the first sentence: With the advent of projection, the viewer's relationship with the image was no longer private, as it had been with early peepshow devices such as the Kinetoscope and the Mutoscope, which was a similar machine that copied motion by means of successive Images are expressed on individual photographic cards instead of on strips of celluloid. The expression means: Mutoscope is a machine similar to Kinetoscope. It replicates moving pictures through continuous images on separate films. Instead of using film, the difference between Mutoscope and Kinetoscope can be seen. The material used to make the image is different. So choose D. Note: The "more than one person could view the images at the same time" in option B was achieved by the advent of projection, not the Mutoscope.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">It</span>" in the passage refers to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

Celluloid</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Referring to the relationship, looking for the subject of the previous sentence. Combining with the previous sentence, it can be concluded that it refers to the viewer's relationship with the image. It is no longer personal but gradually publicized.
