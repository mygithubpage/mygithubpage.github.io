In the peepshow <span class="highlight">format</span>, a <span class="highlight">film</span> was viewed <span class="highlight">through</span> a small opening in a machine that was created for that purpose. Thomas Edison's peepshow <span class="highlight">device</span>, the Kinetoscope, was introduced to the public in 1894. It was designed for use in Kinetoscope parlors, or arcades, which contained only a few <span class="highlight">individual</span> machines and permitted only one customer to view a short, 50-foot <span class="highlight">film</span> at any one time. The first Kinetoscope parlors contained five machines. For the price of 25 cents (or 5 cents per machine), customers moved from machine to machine to watch five different films (or, in the case of famous prizefights, <span class="highlight">successive</span> rounds of a single fight).</p><p>These Kinetoscope arcades were modeled on <span class="highlight">phonograph</span> parlors, which had proven successful for Edison several years earlier. In the <span class="highlight">phonograph</span> parlors, customers listened to recordings <span class="highlight">through</span><span class="highlight">individual</span> ear tubes, moving from one machine to the next to hear different recorded speeches or pieces of music. The Kinetoscope parlors functioned in a <span class="highlight">similar</span> way. Edison was more interested in the sale of Kinetoscopes (for <span class="highlight">roughly</span> $1,000 apiece) to these parlors than in the films that would be run in them (which <span class="highlight">cost</span><span class="highlight">approximately</span> $10 to $15 each). <span class="question3">He refused to develop <span class="highlight">projection</span> technology, reasoning that if he made and sold projectors, then exhibitors would <span class="highlight">purchase</span> only one machine-a projector-from him <span class="highlight">instead</span> of several.</span></p><p><span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>Exhibitors, however, <span class="highlight">wanted</span> to maximize their profits, which they could do more <span class="highlight"><span class="question4">readily</span></span>by projecting a <span class="highlight">handful</span> of films to hundreds of customers at a time (rather than one at a time) and by charging 25 to 50 cents <span class="highlight">admission</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> About a year after the opening of the first Kinetoscope <span class="highlight">parlor</span> in 1894, showmen such as Louis and Auguste Lumiere, Thomas Armat and Charles Francis Jenkins, and Orville and Woodville Latham (with the <span class="highlight"><span class="question5">assistance</span></span>of Edison's <span class="highlight">former</span><span class="highlight">assistant</span>, William Dickson) perfected <span class="highlight">projection</span> devices. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>These early <span class="highlight">projection</span> devices were used in vaudeville theaters, <span class="highlight">legitimate</span> theaters, <span class="highlight">local</span> town halls, makeshift <span class="highlight">storefront</span> theaters, fairgrounds, and <span class="highlight">amusement</span> parks to show films to a <span class="highlight">mass</span><span class="highlight">audience</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p><p>With the <span class="highlight">advent</span> of <span class="highlight">projection</span> in 1895-1896, <span class="highlight">motion</span> pictures became the <span class="highlight">ultimate</span> form of <span class="highlight">mass</span><span class="highlight">consumption</span>. <span class="highlight">Previously</span>, large audiences had viewed spectacles at the theater, where vaudeville, <span class="highlight">popular</span> dramas, <span class="highlight">musical</span> and minstrel shows, <span class="highlight">classical</span> plays, lectures, and slide-and-lantern shows had been presented to several hundred spectators at a time. But the movies differed <span class="highlight">significantly</span> from these other forms of entertainment, which depended on either live performance or (in the case of the slide-and-lantern shows) the active <span class="highlight">involvement</span> of a master of ceremonies who assembled the final program.</p><p>Although early exhibitors regularly accompanied movies with live acts, the <span class="highlight">substance</span> of the movies themselves is mass-produced, prerecorded <span class="highlight">material</span> that can easily be reproduced by theaters with little or no active participation by the exhibitor. <span class="highlight">Even</span> though early exhibitors shaped their <span class="highlight">film</span> programs by mixing films and other entertainments together in whichever way they thought would be most <span class="highlight">attractive</span> to audiences or by accompanying them with lectures, their <span class="highlight">creative</span> control remained limited. What audiences came to see was the <span class="highlight">technological</span><span class="highlight">marvel</span> of the movies; the lifelike <span class="highlight">reproduction</span> of the <span class="highlight">commonplace</span><span class="highlight">motion</span> of trains, of waves <span class="highlight">striking</span> the <span class="highlight">shore</span>, and of people walking in the street; and the magic made possible by trick <span class="highlight">photography</span> and the manipulation of the camera.</p><p>With the <span class="highlight">advent</span> of <span class="highlight">projection</span>, the viewer's relationship with the <span class="highlight">image</span> was no longer private, as it had been with earlier peepshow devices such as the Kinetoscope and the Mutoscope, which was a <span class="highlight">similar</span> machine that reproduced <span class="highlight">motion</span> by means of <span class="highlight">successive</span> images on <span class="highlight">individual</span><span class="highlight">photographic</span> cards <span class="highlight">instead</span> of on strips of <span class="highlight">celluloid</span>. It suddenly became public-an experience that the viewer shared with dozens, scores, and <span class="highlight">even</span> hundreds of others. At the same time, the <span class="highlight">image</span> that the <span class="highlight">spectator</span> looked at <span class="question11">expanded </span>from the <span class="highlight">minuscule</span> peepshow dimensions of 1 or 2 inches (in height) to the life-size proportions of 6 or 9 feet.</p></article></div><div id="question"><div id="question1"><p>According to paragraph 1, all of the following were true of viewing films in Kinetoscope parlors EXCEPT:</p><label class="my-label"><span>A.
