        <article>
          <p>Listen to a conversation between a student and her geology professor.</p>
          <p>(Man)Mary, I'm so glad I ran into you.</p>
          <p>(Woman)Oh hello, Professor Jensen.</p>
          <p>(Man)Listen, I know it's short notice...and maybe you've already made plans for spring break... but...one of my students just dropped out of the field trip to the Smithson River Caves. You're next on the waiting list, so now there's room for you to come along.</p>
          <p>(Woman)You're kidding! [disappointed] I didn't think there was a chance... and...well, it's a three-day trip, right? I agreed to spend next week helping Professor Clark set up the new museum exhibition. I think she's really counting on me.</p>
          <p>(Man)Yeah, three days. But you know... if you'd rather come on the field trip, why not speak with her and see if she has anyone to replace you?</p>
          <p>(Woman)Yeah, I'd hate to miss out on the caves. I'll definitely ask Professor Clark if there's someone else who could help her.</p>
          <p>(Man)You know... we don't leave until Wednesday. If you still have to help out, any chance you could get the museum setup done before then?</p>
          <p>(Woman)Oh yeah... not until Wednesday... so then yeah... maybe that's possible too.</p>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>Well, the woman's got a problem that she is now invited by her professor to a field trip but it conflicts with the museum exhibition which she is helping setting up. There are two solutions for the woman to solve the problem. She could ask her professor to find scxne other student to the field trip or she could hurry up to finish setting up the museum exhibition ahead of time so that she could go to the trip after that. I guess the woman should take the second solution for two reasons. First of all, field trips are usually the most helpful activities of our study life, especially during our break. We students could put everything we learned into real practice, to prove and to test results and conclusions from the classes and textbooks, so any student should not miss any field trips. Secondly, she could speed up her setting up the museum exhibition by asking others for some help especially with the trivial work and the details, and therefore I am sure she could finish her work with the museum set-up before the field trip.
