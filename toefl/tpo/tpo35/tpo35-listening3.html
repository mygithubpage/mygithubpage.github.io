              <span class="time" data-times="7.84" data-time="5.22">[00:05.22]</span>Professor:One of the frustrating things about <span class="highlight">archaeology</span>, especially for beginning students, is that theories are <span class="highlight">constantly</span> evolving. <span class="time" data-times="4.7" data-time="13.06">[00:13.06]</span>A <span class="highlight">theory</span> that's been accepted for many years may suddenly be called into question.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.73" data-time="17.76">[00:17.76]</span>Student:But why would that happen?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.66" data-time="19.49">[00:19.49]</span>Professor:There are probably a number of reasons. <span class="time" data-times="4.34" data-time="22.15">[00:22.15]</span>Earlier finds are always being reexamined in the <span class="highlight">context</span> of new finds. <span class="time" data-times="7.52" data-time="26.49">[00:26.49]</span>Or it may just be that someone looks at the <span class="highlight">evidence</span> in a different way, has a different idea of what it suggests.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.71" data-time="34.01">[00:34.01]</span>Take the <span class="highlight">theory</span> about the earliest <span class="highlight">permanent</span> settlements. <span class="time" data-times="5.33" data-time="37.72">[00:37.72]</span>They were found in an area to the east of the <span class="highlight">Mediterranean</span> Sea called the Levant. <span class="time" data-times="4.23" data-time="43.05">[00:43.05]</span>And the people who lived there were the Natufians.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.14" data-time="47.28">[00:47.28]</span>For quite some time, it's been widely accepted that about 15,000 years ago, the Natufians developed a <span class="highlight">sedentary</span> lifestyle. <span class="time" data-times="2.69" data-time="57.42">[00:57.42]</span>Can someone <span class="highlight">remind</span> us what that means?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.39" data-time="60.11">[01:00.11]</span>Student:It means that they stopped being <span class="highlight">nomadic</span>, that they began staying in one area year round <span class="highlight">instead</span> of moving around all the time.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="11.15" data-time="68.5">[01:08.50]</span>Professor:Right. And we think there was an <span class="highlight">abundance</span> of <span class="highlight">edible</span> plants and animals in the area at that time that make this <span class="highlight">shift</span> away from a <span class="highlight">nomadic</span> lifestyle possible. <span class="time" data-times="4.86" data-time="79.65">[01:19.65]</span>Uh...keep in <span class="highlight">mind</span> that the Natufians were hunter-gatherers. <span class="time" data-times="6.03" data-time="84.51">[01:24.51]</span>So in spite of other changes, they were always a pre- agricultural society.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.66" data-time="90.54">[01:30.54]</span>Anyway, after being <span class="highlight">sedentary</span> for around 2,000 years, something happened that forced the Natufians to change their lifestyle. <span class="time" data-times="8" data-time="100.2">[01:40.20]</span>The general <span class="highlight">consensus</span> is that there was a period of <span class="highlight">climatic</span> cooling, which had a <span class="highlight">negative</span> effect on the <span class="highlight">availability</span> of food. <span class="time" data-times="6.53" data-time="108.2">[01:48.20]</span>And this food <span class="highlight">shortage</span> likely caused the Natufians to <span class="highlight">revert</span> to a <span class="highlight">nomadic</span> lifestyle. <span class="time" data-times="6.27" data-time="114.73">[01:54.73]</span>Then around 11,500 years ago, the <span class="highlight">climate</span> warmed again. <span class="time" data-times="5.9" data-time="121">[02:01.00]</span>Food became more <span class="highlight">abundant</span> and the people in that area became <span class="highlight">sedentary</span> again.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.41" data-time="126.9">[02:06.90]</span>Now, no one is contesting that these people, probably descendants of the Natufians, were indeed <span class="highlight">sedentary</span> by 11,500 years ago. <span class="time" data-times="2.24" data-time="136.31">[02:16.31]</span>The <span class="highlight">evidence</span> is quite strong. <span class="time" data-times="9.46" data-time="138.55">[02:18.55]</span>Archaeologists have uncovered <span class="highlight">numerous</span> <span class="highlight">circular</span> structures dating from that period that <span class="highlight">appear</span> to have been used to store <span class="highlight">grain</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.49" data-time="148.01">[02:28.01]</span>We think this for a <span class="highlight">couple</span> of reasons.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.56" data-time="150.5">[02:30.50]</span>First, the remains of barley houses have been found inside them. <span class="time" data-times="3.5" data-time="155.06">[02:35.06]</span>Barley was the main type of <span class="highlight">grain</span> that grew in this area.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.5" data-time="158.56">[02:38.56]</span>And secondly, the floors on these structures were elevated. <span class="time" data-times="5.64" data-time="163.06">[02:43.06]</span>This design would have been <span class="highlight">consistent</span> with the need to keep the barley dry and safe from rodents. <span class="time" data-times="1.93" data-time="168.7">[02:48.70]</span>So, that makes <span class="highlight">sense</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.17" data-time="170.63">[02:50.63]</span>And there are lots of these structures in the settlements. <span class="time" data-times="7.25" data-time="173.8">[02:53.80]</span>In one <span class="highlight">settlement</span> that was only <span class="highlight">partially</span> excavated, archaeologists have already found four of these structures.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.98" data-time="181.05">[03:01.05]</span>Student:So it's the earlier part, that the Natufians were <span class="highlight">sedentary</span> 15,000 years ago, that's changed?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.97" data-time="188.03">[03:08.03]</span>Professor:Well, there's <span class="highlight">evidence</span>, but some archaeologists have questioned the <span class="highlight">criteria</span> used to <span class="highlight">identify</span> <span class="highlight">permanent</span> settlements.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="14.39" data-time="196">[03:16.00]</span>See, <span class="highlight">circular</span> structures have also been found in early Natufian settlements, so archaeologists believe that these were also food <span class="highlight">storage</span> structures based on their <span class="highlight">physical</span> similarity to the structures in later settlements. <span class="time" data-times="5.8" data-time="210.39">[03:30.39]</span>And they would <span class="highlight">indicate</span> that the Natufians were <span class="highlight">sedentary</span> 15,000 years ago.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.65" data-time="216.19">[03:36.19]</span>But now, there are doubts about the use of these earlier structures.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.66" data-time="220.84">[03:40.84]</span>Researchers point to the <span class="highlight">lack</span> of <span class="highlight">grain</span> remnants in these earlier structures. <span class="time" data-times="3.57" data-time="225.5">[03:45.50]</span>In fact, things other than grains have been found in them. <span class="time" data-times="5.9" data-time="229.07">[03:49.07]</span>So at the very <span class="highlight">least</span>, they say, these structures probably had <span class="highlight">multiple</span> purposes.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.31" data-time="234.97">[03:54.97]</span>And another problem they point to is that most early settlements have only one of these so-called <span class="highlight">storage</span> structures. <span class="time" data-times="6.22" data-time="243.28">[04:03.28]</span>But do you think one structure would be enough to hold the <span class="highlight">surplus</span> for an entire <span class="highlight">settlement</span>?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.5" data-time="249.5">[04:09.50]</span>Student:Well, whatever these structures were used for, couldn't they just have built them at a place they came back to regularly? <span class="time" data-times="2.35" data-time="256">[04:16.00]</span>Maybe to store things for their next visit?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.54" data-time="258.35">[04:18.35]</span>Professor:Exactly! So-called <span class="highlight">base</span> camps, where the Natufians didn't stay all year round.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.21" data-time="263.89">[04:23.89]</span>But artifacts that were found at a number of Natufian sites <span class="highlight">seem</span> to present <span class="highlight">evidence</span> of a <span class="highlight">sedentary</span> way of life. <span class="time" data-times="5.17" data-time="271.1">[04:31.10]</span>Large heavy mortars, the <span class="highlight">sort</span> of thing that would have been used for grinding <span class="highlight">grain</span>. <span class="time" data-times="12.8" data-time="276.27">[04:36.27]</span>Such heavy equipment could <span class="highlight">indicate</span> that the Natufians would have stayed permanently in one place since the work involved in moving an <span class="highlight">item</span> like this around <span class="highlight">constantly</span> would have been <span class="highlight">substantial</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="12.12" data-time="289.07">[04:49.07]</span>But this <span class="highlight">evidence</span> of sedentism has also been called into question because the materials used to make the stone mortars did originally come from quite a distance. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="301.19">[05:01.19]</span>And if the Natufians could move the materials over great distances...</p>
