Strategies used by different hunter-gatherer societies in response to climate change.</p><p>D. The development of the Natufians into an agricultural society.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>"One of the frustrating things about archaeology, especially for beginning students, is that the are are evolving. A theory that has been accepted for many years may suddenly be called into question."</p><p>At the beginning of the article, there are obvious subject sentences, and the specific example "Whether the Natufian tribe is stationed" is used to concretely prove this point in the following. Therefore, Option B is correct. A option says "The technology of the Natufian covered shelters" is not mentioned, so it is excluded. The C option says "different hunter-gatherer groups respond to climate tactics," not mentioned, so it is excluded. The D option says "The process of Natufian development as an agricultural society" is not mentioned, so it is excluded.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor, what does a theory suggest about the Natufians who lived 15,000 years ago?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They moved into the eastern Mediterranean region.</p><p>B. They developed advanced hunting tools.</p><p>C. They began cultivating a variety of crops.</p><p>D. They began to settle permanently in one area.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>"It has been widely adopted that about 15,000 years ago, the Natufians developed a sedentary lifestyle." It was clearly stated in the text that 1,500 years ago, Natufians began to live. Option A says "They migrated to the Eastern Mediterranean". The article mentions that the Natufians were discovered in the eastern Mediterranean, but did not mention that they had migrated there 1,5,000 years ago, so it was ruled out. Option B said "they only made advanced hunting tools", not mentioned, so ruled out. The C option says "They began to cultivate a variety of foods," not mentioned, so ruled out.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor, in what ways did climate change affect Natufians?

A period of climatic warming enabled them to settle in centralized villages.</p><p>C. A period of climatic warming allowed them to plant crops other than barley.</p><p>D.

The general consensus is that there was a period of climatic cooling which had a negative effect on the availability of food.</p><p>And this food has been exposed to the Natufians to revert to a nomadic lifestyle. Then, around 11,500 years ago, the climate warmed again. Food became more abundant, and people in that area became sedentary again." As a result, option AB is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor discuss the floor of excavated structures?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

To support the idea that the structures were used to hold grain.</p><p>D. To explain a construction method that was common 15,000 years ago.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>In the article, when referring to supporting the Natufians as stationers, three reasons were cited. The second reason was that "And secondly, the floors on these structures were elevated. This design would have been been consistent with the need to keep the barley dry and "Safe from rodents. So, that makes sense." So Option C is correct.</p><p>• The A option says "In order to demonstrate the super science technology used by prehistoric people", it is not mentioned, so it is excluded.</p><p>• The B option says "In order to explain that the Levant is always flooded regularly", it is not mentioned, so it is excluded.</p><p>• The D option says "For explanation 1, the construction method that was common 5,000 years ago" was not mentioned, so it was excluded.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>What evidence suggests that Natufians were NOT sedentary 15,000 years ago? Click on 2 answers.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. No tools for grinding grain have been found in Natufian settlements from that time.</p><p>B. Individual settlements from that time contain just one circular structure.</p><p>C. Circular structures from that time may have had multiple purposes.</p><p>D. Circular structures from that time contain remnants of grain.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="BC"><p>"There are doubts about the use of these earlier structures. Researchers point to the lack of grain remnants in these earlier structures. In fact, things other than grains have been found in them. So, at the very least, they say, these structures Unlikely had multiply purposes. And another problem they point to you is that most early settlements have only one of these so called storage structures, but do you think one structure would be enough to hold the surplus for an entire settlement?" The two suspect reasons correspond to the BC option, so the option BC is correct. The "A" option says "There was no tool for grinding grain at that time." Among the reasons for the support, there was a mention of the fact that the round vessel was used to grind grain. This was not mentioned in the reason of opposition. Therefore, the "D" option says "Circular at that time." There are still some residues of micro-grain left in the vessel."</p></div></div><div class="replay" id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor say this:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

Because the materials used to make the stone mortars did originally come from quite a distance, and if the Natufians could move the materials over great distances..."</p><p>The answer to the questions section is for the professor to explain why the latter did not believe that the Natufians were stationed, so option D is correct. The A option says "In order to point out that she is not sure about the source of these materials." This assumption is unfounded and therefore excluded. The B option says "In order to illustrate that the Natufians' residence area is very large", this presumption is not based on the exclusion. The C option says "In order to point out how the material technology advances the life of the Natufians," this presumption is unfounded and therefore excluded.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
