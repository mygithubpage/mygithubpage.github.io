a lecture in an art <span class="highlight">history</span> class. <span class="time" data-times="4.02" data-time="4.34">[00:04.34]</span>The professor has been discussing the Italian Renaissance.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="16.4" data-time="8.36">[00:08.36]</span>Professor: In our discussion of Italian Renaissance paintings from the 1400s and early 1500s, we've looked at some masterpieces on <span class="highlight">canvas</span> and on wood, but our discussion will be grossly incomplete without talking about frescos.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.64" data-time="24.76">[00:24.76]</span>Frescos are basically paintings done on the interiors of buildings, on walls and ceilings. <span class="time" data-times="3.13" data-time="31.4">[00:31.40]</span>They weren't invented during the Renaissance. <span class="time" data-times="9.56" data-time="34.53">[00:34.53]</span>If you remember we looked <span class="highlight">briefly</span> at frescos paintings way back in our discussion of <span class="highlight">ancient</span> Romans and <span class="highlight">ancient</span> Roman art a few weeks ago. <span class="time" data-times="6.64" data-time="44.09">[00:44.09]</span>But, it was much later during the Renaissance that the <span class="highlight">term</span><span class="highlight">fresco</span> was commonly used. <span class="time" data-times="4.28" data-time="50.73">[00:50.73]</span>It's an Italian word that means <span class="highlight">literally</span> fresh. <span class="time" data-times="7.53" data-time="55.01">[00:55.01]</span>And, well, to explain that, we have to get <span class="highlight">specific</span> about <span class="highlight">technique</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.9" data-time="62.54">[01:02.54]</span>Back then, most buildings had stone and brick walls with highly <span class="highlight">irregular</span> surfaces. <span class="time" data-times="1.52" data-time="68.44">[01:08.44]</span>They weren't smooth. <span class="time" data-times="3.29" data-time="69.96">[01:09.96]</span>Also, the walls weren't completely waterproof. <span class="time" data-times="1.98" data-time="73.25">[01:13.25]</span><span class="highlight">Moisture</span> could <span class="highlight">seep</span> in. <span class="time" data-times="2.09" data-time="75.23">[01:15.23]</span>Buildings were often <span class="highlight">damp</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.49" data-time="77.32">[01:17.32]</span>There was no way to really control <span class="highlight">humidity</span> inside buildings in those days. <span class="time" data-times="10.11" data-time="82.81">[01:22.81]</span>So, because frescos are done inside buildings on walls, well, the walls needed to be prepared before work could begin.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="18.39" data-time="92.92">[01:32.92]</span>So for example, sometimes, thin reed mats were <span class="highlight">stuck</span> onto the walls, so these thin reed mats would be like an <span class="highlight">additional</span><span class="highlight">layer</span> between the <span class="highlight">original</span> part of the wall and the frescos, the painted part of the walls that were done over them. <span class="time" data-times="9.82" data-time="111.31">[01:51.31]</span>The reed mats could smooth out the surface of a <span class="highlight">rough</span> wall or could also provide that all- important protection from <span class="highlight">moisture</span> or do both. <span class="time" data-times="9.4" data-time="121.13">[02:01.13]</span>So it was the wall, then the mats, then <span class="highlight">plaster</span> on top of the mats, then the <span class="highlight">fresco</span> painted onto the <span class="highlight">plaster</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="12.6" data-time="130.53">[02:10.53]</span>Other times though, <span class="highlight">plaster</span> was applied directly to the walls, a thick <span class="highlight">layer</span> of <span class="highlight">plaster</span>, to fill in spaces between the bricks, to smooth out the wall surface for painting the <span class="highlight">fresco</span>. <span class="time" data-times="1.01" data-time="143.13">[02:23.13]</span>You see.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.75" data-time="144.14">[02:24.14]</span><span class="highlight">Plaster</span> is a whitish kind of <span class="highlight">paste</span>, a mixture of <span class="highlight">lime</span>, water and sand. <span class="time" data-times="4.86" data-time="149.89">[02:29.89]</span>After you <span class="highlight">spread</span><span class="highlight">plaster</span> on a surface, it'll harden, like <span class="highlight">cement</span> does. <span class="time" data-times="4.02" data-time="154.75">[02:34.75]</span>But as I said, <span class="highlight">fresco</span> means fresh. <span class="time" data-times="11" data-time="158.77">[02:38.77]</span>And that's because to create a <span class="highlight">fresco</span>, the painting has to be applied very soon after the <span class="highlight">plaster</span> has been <span class="highlight">spread</span> over a surface, right on to the wet fresh <span class="highlight">plaster</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.33" data-time="169.77">[02:49.77]</span>By doing this, the painting actually becomes part of the <span class="highlight">plaster</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.8" data-time="175.1">[02:55.10]</span>Finishing a painting before the <span class="highlight">plaster</span> dry was a real <span class="highlight">challenge</span> for <span class="highlight">fresco</span> painters.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="20.64" data-time="180.9">[03:00.90]</span>The <span class="highlight">technique</span> of creating frescos was developed <span class="highlight">overtime</span> and <span class="highlight">eventually</span> perfected during the Renaissance, a time when <span class="highlight">immense</span> buildings were being erected as symbols of wealth and power, very large buildings, which people <span class="highlight">wanted</span> decorated on the inside as well as the outside. <span class="time" data-times="8.93" data-time="201.54">[03:21.54]</span>The owners of these grand buildings <span class="highlight">wanted</span> to <span class="highlight">decorate</span> the walls to <span class="highlight">reflect</span> their own affluence and <span class="highlight">prestige</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="8.3" data-time="210.47">[03:30.47]</span>Now, few people would <span class="highlight">argue</span> with the greatness of artists from that period, Michelangelo, Raphael. <span class="time" data-times="8.31" data-time="218.77">[03:38.77]</span>But there is this <span class="highlight">popular</span><span class="highlight">mental</span><span class="highlight">image</span> people have of an <span class="highlight">artistic</span><span class="highlight">genius</span> producing a masterpiece in total solitude. <span class="time" data-times="11.29" data-time="227.08">[03:47.08]</span>Well, that idea is fine for <span class="highlight">canvas</span> painting or other small works, but a <span class="highlight">practical</span> reality of <span class="highlight">fresco</span> painting in the Renaissance was collaboration. <span class="time" data-times="16.09" data-time="238.37">[03:58.37]</span>The <span class="highlight">sheer</span> dimensions of the surfaces involved, plus the <span class="highlight">physical</span> properties of the <span class="highlight">plaster</span>, meant it was <span class="highlight">inevitable</span> that Renaissance artists would <span class="highlight">rely</span> on assistants, apprentices they were called, to help create their masterpieces. <span class="time" data-times="5.41" data-time="254.46">[04:14.46]</span>Artists had to plan the work carefully, divide it into several days. <span class="time" data-times="4.28" data-time="259.87">[04:19.87]</span>Each day was a <span class="highlight">repetition</span> of the same <span class="highlight">technical</span><span class="highlight">process</span>. <span class="time" data-times="11.39" data-time="264.15">[04:24.15]</span>Apprentices mix paints, <span class="highlight">prepare</span> the <span class="highlight">plaster</span>, <span class="highlight">spread</span> it on one <span class="highlight">section</span> of the wall or ceiling, then finally paint on the wet <span class="highlight">plaster</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.18" data-time="275.54">[04:35.54]</span>This had to be done <span class="highlight">within</span> a few hours before the <span class="highlight">plaster</span> dried. <span class="time" data-times="5.64" data-time="279.72">[04:39.72]</span>So they go <span class="highlight">through</span> that whole <span class="highlight">process</span> in one day on one <span class="highlight">section</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.54" data-time="285.36">[04:45.36]</span>The next day they'd move on and do it again on an <span class="highlight">adjacent</span> part. <span class="time" data-times="7.68" data-time="290.9">[04:50.90]</span>So any <span class="highlight">fresco</span> commissioned to an artist was, for <span class="highlight">practical</span> reasons, commissioned to a whole team.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="17.97" data-time="298.58">[04:58.58]</span>Now, I am not saying a <span class="highlight">genius</span> like Michelangelo lacked the skill to paint the <span class="highlight">enormous</span> ceiling of The Sistine <span class="highlight">Chapel</span> by himself, but he probably would have had to live until he was 200 years old to finish the ceiling's frescos like that without anyone's help. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="316.55">[05:16.55]</span>So although we aren't sure exactly how many people took an active role in actually painting the ceiling, we can see areas which are really <span class="highlight">inferior</span> to Michelangelo's work that must have been painted by his apprentices.</p></article><div

The article clearly states the role of reed mats, corresponding to the BD selection. Therefore, the top BD is correct. The A option says "to provide the artist with a comfortable standing environment when drawing", not mentioned, so it is excluded. The C option says "to cover and protect fresco in the cold", not mentioned, so rule out.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What point does the professor emphasize about buildings from the Italian Renaissance?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

Very large buildings, which people wanted decorated on inside as well as the outside. The Owners of these grand buildings wanted to decorate the walls to reflect their own affluence and prestige."</p><p>The article clearly states that during the Renaissance, people like to use large houses to symbolize wealth and power.

Well, that idea is fine for canvas painting or other small works. But a practical reality of fresco painting in the Renaissance was collaboration."</p><p>The article clearly stated that canvas paintings, or other small works, could be done by the artist alone, but fresco required artists to cooperate to complete it. Therefore, option D was correct. The A option says "this theory has been supported by contemporary scholars", contrary to the original text, and is therefore excluded. Option B says "This theory applies to Michelangelo, but it does not apply to Raphael," contrary to the original text, so it is excluded.

Each day was a repetition of the same technical process. Apprentices mixed paints, prepared the plaster, spread it on one section of the wall or ceiling. Then finally, painted The wet plaster. This had to be done within a few hours before the plaster dried. So next to it, they'd move on, and do it again, on An anyway part. So any fresco commissioned to an artist, was for practical reasons, commissioned to a whole team. "</p><p>The article clearly stated that apprentices completed part of the work and completed the next part of the content. Therefore, Option D is correct. The "A" option says "Some fresco takes a hundred years to complete". The premise of this sentence is that if the entire fresco is drawn by an artist, it may be painted for a hundred years, but it does not conform to this question and is therefore excluded. The B option says "many fresco is completely completed by apprentices" and "completely" is absolutely absolute, so it is excluded. The C option says "The apprentices divide their work at the same time and do different things."</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
