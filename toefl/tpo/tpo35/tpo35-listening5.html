            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.34" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in an art <span class="underline">history</span> class. <span class="time" data-times="4.02" data-time="4.34">[00:04.34]</span>The professor has been discussing the Italian Renaissance.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="16.4" data-time="8.36">[00:08.36]</span>Professor: In our discussion of Italian Renaissance paintings from the 1400s and early 1500s, we've looked at some masterpieces on <span class="underline">canvas</span> and on wood, but our discussion will be grossly incomplete without talking about frescos.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.64" data-time="24.76">[00:24.76]</span>Frescos are basically paintings done on the interiors of buildings, on walls and ceilings. <span class="time" data-times="3.13" data-time="31.4">[00:31.40]</span>They weren't invented during the Renaissance. <span class="time" data-times="9.56" data-time="34.53">[00:34.53]</span>If you remember we looked <span class="underline">briefly</span> at frescos paintings way back in our discussion of <span class="underline">ancient</span> Romans and <span class="underline">ancient</span> Roman art a few weeks ago. <span class="time" data-times="6.64" data-time="44.09">[00:44.09]</span>But, it was much later during the Renaissance that the <span class="underline">term</span> <span class="underline">fresco</span> was commonly used. <span class="time" data-times="4.28" data-time="50.73">[00:50.73]</span>It's an Italian word that means <span class="underline">literally</span> fresh. <span class="time" data-times="7.53" data-time="55.01">[00:55.01]</span>And, well, to explain that, we have to get <span class="underline">specific</span> about <span class="underline">technique</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.9" data-time="62.54">[01:02.54]</span>Back then, most buildings had stone and brick walls with highly <span class="underline">irregular</span> surfaces. <span class="time" data-times="1.52" data-time="68.44">[01:08.44]</span>They weren't smooth. <span class="time" data-times="3.29" data-time="69.96">[01:09.96]</span>Also, the walls weren't completely waterproof. <span class="time" data-times="1.98" data-time="73.25">[01:13.25]</span> <span class="underline">Moisture</span> could <span class="underline">seep</span> in. <span class="time" data-times="2.09" data-time="75.23">[01:15.23]</span>Buildings were often <span class="underline">damp</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.49" data-time="77.32">[01:17.32]</span>There was no way to really control <span class="underline">humidity</span> inside buildings in those days. <span class="time" data-times="10.11" data-time="82.81">[01:22.81]</span>So, because frescos are done inside buildings on walls, well, the walls needed to be prepared before work could begin.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="18.39" data-time="92.92">[01:32.92]</span>So for example, sometimes, thin reed mats were <span class="underline">stuck</span> onto the walls, so these thin reed mats would be like an <span class="underline">additional</span> <span class="underline">layer</span> between the <span class="underline">original</span> part of the wall and the frescos, the painted part of the walls that were done over them. <span class="time" data-times="9.82" data-time="111.31">[01:51.31]</span>The reed mats could smooth out the surface of a <span class="underline">rough</span> wall or could also provide that all- important protection from <span class="underline">moisture</span> or do both. <span class="time" data-times="9.4" data-time="121.13">[02:01.13]</span>So it was the wall, then the mats, then <span class="underline">plaster</span> on top of the mats, then the <span class="underline">fresco</span> painted onto the <span class="underline">plaster</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="12.6" data-time="130.53">[02:10.53]</span>Other times though, <span class="underline">plaster</span> was applied directly to the walls, a thick <span class="underline">layer</span> of <span class="underline">plaster</span>, to fill in spaces between the bricks, to smooth out the wall surface for painting the <span class="underline">fresco</span>. <span class="time" data-times="1.01" data-time="143.13">[02:23.13]</span>You see.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.75" data-time="144.14">[02:24.14]</span>
              <span class="underline">Plaster</span> is a whitish kind of <span class="underline">paste</span>, a mixture of <span class="underline">lime</span>, water and sand. <span class="time" data-times="4.86" data-time="149.89">[02:29.89]</span>After you <span class="underline">spread</span> <span class="underline">plaster</span> on a surface, it'll harden, like <span class="underline">cement</span> does. <span class="time" data-times="4.02" data-time="154.75">[02:34.75]</span>But as I said, <span class="underline">fresco</span> means fresh. <span class="time" data-times="11" data-time="158.77">[02:38.77]</span>And that's because to create a <span class="underline">fresco</span>, the painting has to be applied very soon after the <span class="underline">plaster</span> has been <span class="underline">spread</span> over a surface, right on to the wet fresh <span class="underline">plaster</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.33" data-time="169.77">[02:49.77]</span>By doing this, the painting actually becomes part of the <span class="underline">plaster</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.8" data-time="175.1">[02:55.10]</span>Finishing a painting before the <span class="underline">plaster</span> dry was a real <span class="underline">challenge</span> for <span class="underline">fresco</span> painters.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="20.64" data-time="180.9">[03:00.90]</span>The <span class="underline">technique</span> of creating frescos was developed <span class="underline">overtime</span> and <span class="underline">eventually</span> perfected during the Renaissance, a time when <span class="underline">immense</span> buildings were being erected as symbols of wealth and power, very large buildings, which people <span class="underline">wanted</span> decorated on the inside as well as the outside. <span class="time" data-times="8.93" data-time="201.54">[03:21.54]</span>The owners of these grand buildings <span class="underline">wanted</span> to <span class="underline">decorate</span> the walls to <span class="underline">reflect</span> their own affluence and <span class="underline">prestige</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.3" data-time="210.47">[03:30.47]</span>Now, few people would <span class="underline">argue</span> with the greatness of artists from that period, Michelangelo, Raphael. <span class="time" data-times="8.31" data-time="218.77">[03:38.77]</span>But there is this <span class="underline">popular</span> <span class="underline">mental</span> <span class="underline">image</span> people have of an <span class="underline">artistic</span> <span class="underline">genius</span> producing a masterpiece in total solitude. <span class="time" data-times="11.29" data-time="227.08">[03:47.08]</span>Well, that idea is fine for <span class="underline">canvas</span> painting or other small works, but a <span class="underline">practical</span> reality of <span class="underline">fresco</span> painting in the Renaissance was collaboration. <span class="time" data-times="16.09" data-time="238.37">[03:58.37]</span>The <span class="underline">sheer</span> dimensions of the surfaces involved, plus the <span class="underline">physical</span> properties of the <span class="underline">plaster</span>, meant it was <span class="underline">inevitable</span> that Renaissance artists would <span class="underline">rely</span> on assistants, apprentices they were called, to help create their masterpieces. <span class="time" data-times="5.41" data-time="254.46">[04:14.46]</span>Artists had to plan the work carefully, divide it into several days. <span class="time" data-times="4.28" data-time="259.87">[04:19.87]</span>Each day was a <span class="underline">repetition</span> of the same <span class="underline">technical</span> <span class="underline">process</span>. <span class="time" data-times="11.39" data-time="264.15">[04:24.15]</span>Apprentices mix paints, <span class="underline">prepare</span> the <span class="underline">plaster</span>, <span class="underline">spread</span> it on one <span class="underline">section</span> of the wall or ceiling, then finally paint on the wet <span class="underline">plaster</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.18" data-time="275.54">[04:35.54]</span>This had to be done <span class="underline">within</span> a few hours before the <span class="underline">plaster</span> dried. <span class="time" data-times="5.64" data-time="279.72">[04:39.72]</span>So they go <span class="underline">through</span> that whole <span class="underline">process</span> in one day on one <span class="underline">section</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.54" data-time="285.36">[04:45.36]</span>The next day they'd move on and do it again on an <span class="underline">adjacent</span> part. <span class="time" data-times="7.68" data-time="290.9">[04:50.90]</span>So any <span class="underline">fresco</span> commissioned to an artist was, for <span class="underline">practical</span> reasons, commissioned to a whole team.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="17.97" data-time="298.58">[04:58.58]</span>Now, I am not saying a <span class="underline">genius</span> like Michelangelo lacked the skill to paint the <span class="underline">enormous</span> ceiling of The Sistine <span class="underline">Chapel</span> by himself, but he probably would have had to live until he was 200 years old to finish the ceiling's frescos like that without anyone's help. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="316.55">[05:16.55]</span>So although we aren't sure exactly how many people took an active role in actually painting the ceiling, we can see areas which are really <span class="underline">inferior</span> to Michelangelo's work that must have been painted by his apprentices.</p>
