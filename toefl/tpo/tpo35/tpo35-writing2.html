Famous entertainers and athletes deserve to have more privacy than they have now. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. </p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>Famous entertainers and athletes are always the focus of media. People are curious about not only their achievements but also their private life. Recently, the view that famous public figures should have more privacy has been repeatedly discussed. I strongly agree with this proposal. Protecting the private life of entertainers and athletes can bring various benefits which are listed below.</p><p>To begin with, decreasing the exposure of famous people's daily schedule will help protect the security of themselves as well as their fanatic fans. For example, Princess Diana died in a car accident when she was driving at a high speed in order to escape from the trail of dog packs. In addition, there are also too many stampedes in which enthusiastic fans cluster together to meet their idol. Sometimes, fans will influx into airports or railway station to pick up their idols. Thus will lead to horrific jam in public facilities and cause severe inconvenience to other people.</p><p>Moreover, no one is perfect. So are the public figures. A famous actor could meanwhile be a drug abuser and a glorious athlete might commit adultery secretly. The terrible thing is their fans are often young kids who have not established their own standards to distinguish which of their idol's behavior is worth imitating. All those conducts of their idols will be admired and imitated without screening. They probably will learn to abuse drugs or alcohol which is definitely harmful to their health. Therefore, merely exhibiting famous people's outstanding side to the public can be a valid solution to those negative conformity effect.</p><p>Last but not least, children of the public characters also suffer from media's over-exposure. The consequence caused by too much public attention includes limited freedom and overload pressure. Kids of famous entertainers and athletes will be anxious feeling many eyes watching them. What's more, they may also grow up in solitude for their parents will confine their going out for fear of their safety – not only famous adults, their little baby could also be followed and disturbed by crazy fans. Every child occupies his own rights to have a happy childhood, not a stressful one. If the privacy of their parents could be well protected, it may be easier for them to lead an ordinary life.</p></article></div></main></body></html>
