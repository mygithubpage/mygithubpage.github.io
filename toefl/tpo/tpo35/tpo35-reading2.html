            <b>The Development of Social Complexity</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>For most of human <span class="underline">history</span>, we have foraged (hunted, fished, and collected wild plants) for food. Small <span class="underline">nomadic</span> groups could easily <span class="underline">supply</span> the necessities for their families.No one needed more, and providing for more than one's needs made little <span class="underline">sense</span>. The <span class="underline">organization</span> of such societies could be rather simple, revolving around age and <span class="underline">gender</span> categories. Such societies likely were largely egalitarian, beyond distinctions based on age and <span class="underline">gender</span>, <span class="underline">virtually</span> all people had <span class="underline">equivalent</span> rights, <span class="underline">status</span>, and <span class="underline">access</span> to resources.</p>
          <p>Archaeologist Donald Henry suggests that the <span class="underline">combination</span> of a rich <span class="underline">habitat</span> and sedentism (<span class="underline">permanent</span>, year-round <span class="underline">settlement</span>) led to a <span class="underline">dramatic</span> increase in human <span class="underline">population</span>. In his view, <span class="underline">nomadic</span>, simple foragers have <span class="underline">relatively</span> <span class="underline">tow</span> levels of <span class="underline">fertility</span>. Their high-protein, low-carbohydrate diets result in low body-fat levels, which are commonly <span class="underline">associated</span> with low <span class="underline">fertility</span> in women. High levels of <span class="underline">physical</span> <span class="underline">activity</span> and long periods of nursing, which are <span class="underline">common</span> among modern simple foragers, probably also contributed to low levels of <span class="underline">female</span> <span class="underline">fertility</span> if they were <span class="underline">likewise</span> <span class="underline">common</span> among <span class="underline">ancient</span> foragers.</p>
          <p>In Henry's view, the <span class="underline">adoption</span> of a more settled <span class="underline">existence</span> in areas with <span class="underline">abundant</span> food resources would have contributed to higher <span class="underline">fertility</span> levels among the <span class="underline">sedentary</span> foragers. A <span class="underline">diet</span> higher in wild cereals produces proportionally more body fat, <span class="underline">leading</span> to higher <span class="underline">fertility</span> among women. Cereals, which are easy to <span class="underline">digest</span>, would have supplemented and then replaced mother's milk as the <span class="underline">primary</span> food for older infants. Since women are less <span class="underline">fertile</span> when they are breast-feeding, substituting cereals for mother s milk would have resulted in closer spacing of births and the <span class="underline">potential</span> for a greater number of live births for each woman. A more <span class="underline">sedentary</span> <span class="underline">existence</span> may also have lowered <span class="underline">infant</span> <span class="underline">mortality</span> and perhaps increased <span class="underline">longevity</span> among the aged. These more <span class="underline">vulnerable</span> members of society could safely stay in a fixed village rather than be forced regularly to move great distances as part of a <span class="underline">nomadic</span> <span class="underline">existence</span>, with its greater risk of accidents and <span class="underline">trauma</span>.</p>
          <p>All of these factors may have resulted in a <span class="underline">trend</span> of increasing size among some <span class="underline">local</span> human populations in the Holocene (since 9600 B C E ). <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> <span class="underline">Given</span> <span class="underline">sufficient</span> time, <span class="underline">even</span> in very rich habitats, human <span class="underline">population</span> size can <span class="underline">reach</span> carrying <span class="underline">capacity</span>, the <span class="underline">maximum</span> <span class="underline">population</span> an area can <span class="underline">sustain</span> <span class="underline">within</span> the <span class="underline">context</span> of a <span class="underline">given</span> <span class="underline">subsistence</span> system. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>And human <span class="underline">population</span> growth is like a runaway tram once it picks up speed, it is difficult to control. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span> So <span class="underline">even</span> after reaching an area's carrying <span class="underline">capacity</span>, Holocene human populations probably continued to grow in food-rich regions, overshooting the <span class="underline">ability</span> of the <span class="underline">territory</span> to feed the <span class="underline">population</span>, again <span class="underline">within</span> the <span class="underline">context</span> of the same <span class="underline">subsistence</span> <span class="underline">strategy</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>In some areas, small changes in <span class="underline">climate</span> or <span class="underline">minor</span> changes in plant characteristics may have further destabilized <span class="underline">local</span> economies.</p>
          <p>One possible <span class="underline">response</span> to surpassing the carrying <span class="underline">capacity</span> of a <span class="underline">region</span> is for a group to <span class="underline">exploit</span> <span class="underline">adjoining</span> land. However, good land may itself be limited-for example,<span class="underline">within</span> the confines of a river <span class="underline">valley</span> where neighbors are in the same <span class="underline">position</span>, having filled up the whole of the <span class="underline">desirable</span> <span class="underline">habitat</span> <span class="underline">available</span> in their home territories, <span class="underline">expansion</span> is also problematic. Impinging on the neighbors' <span class="underline">territory</span> can <span class="underline">lead</span> to <span class="underline">conflict</span>, especially when they too are up against the <span class="underline">capacity</span> of the land to provide enough food.</p>
          <p>Another option is to stay in the same area but to <span class="underline">shift</span> and <span class="underline">intensify</span> the food <span class="underline">quest</span> there. The <span class="underline">impulse</span> to produce more food to feed a growing <span class="underline">population</span> was satisfied in some areas by the <span class="underline">development</span> of more-complex <span class="underline">subsistence</span> strategies involving <span class="underline">intensive</span> labor and requiring more <span class="underline">cooperation</span> and greater coordination among the increasing numbers of people. This <span class="underline">development</span> resulted in a change in the social and <span class="underline">economic</span> equations that defined those societies. Hierarchies that did not exist in earlier foraging groups but that were helpful in structuring <span class="underline">cooperative</span> labor and in organizing more-complex technologies probably became established, <span class="underline">even</span> before <span class="underline">domestication</span> and <span class="underline">agriculture</span>, as pre-Neolithic societies (before the tenth <span class="underline">millennium</span> B C E) reacted to the <span class="underline">population</span> increase.</p>
