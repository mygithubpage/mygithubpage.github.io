          <h4 class="w3-center">The Development of Social Complexity</h4>
          <p>For most of human <span class="highlight">history</span>, we have foraged (hunted, fished, and collected wild plants) for food. Small <span class="highlight">nomadic</span> groups could easily <span class="highlight">supply</span> the necessities for their families.No one needed more, and providing for more than one's needs made little <span class="highlight">sense</span>. The <span class="highlight">organization</span> of such societies could be rather simple, revolving around age and <span class="highlight">gender</span> categories. Such societies likely were largely egalitarian, beyond distinctions based on age and <span class="highlight">gender</span>, <span class="highlight"><span class="question2">virtually</span></span> all people had <span class="highlight">equivalent</span> rights, <span class="highlight">status</span>, and <span class="highlight">access</span> to resources.</p>
          <p>Archaeologist Donald Henry suggests that the <span class="highlight">combination</span> of a rich <span class="highlight">habitat</span> and sedentism (<span class="highlight">permanent</span>, year-round <span class="highlight">settlement</span>) led to a <span class="highlight">dramatic</span> increase in human <span class="highlight">population</span>. In his view, <span class="highlight">nomadic</span>, simple foragers have <span class="highlight"><span class="question3">relatively</span></span> <span class="highlight">tow</span> levels of <span class="highlight">fertility</span>. Their high-protein, low-carbohydrate diets result in low body-fat levels, which are commonly <span class="highlight">associated</span> with low <span class="highlight">fertility</span> in women. High levels of <span class="highlight">physical</span> <span class="highlight">activity</span> and long periods of nursing, which are <span class="highlight">common</span> among <span class="question4">modern simple foragers</span>, probably also contributed to low levels of <span class="highlight">female</span> <span class="highlight">fertility</span> if they were <span class="highlight">likewise</span> <span class="highlight">common</span> among <span class="highlight">ancient</span> foragers.</p>
          <p>In Henry's view, the <span class="highlight">adoption</span> of a more settled <span class="highlight">existence</span> in areas with <span class="highlight"><span class="question5">abundant</span></span> food resources would have contributed to higher <span class="highlight">fertility</span> levels among the <span class="highlight">sedentary</span> foragers. A <span class="highlight">diet</span> higher in wild cereals produces proportionally more body fat, <span class="highlight">leading</span> to higher <span class="highlight">fertility</span> among women. Cereals, which are easy to <span class="highlight">digest</span>, would have supplemented and then replaced mother's milk as the <span class="highlight">primary</span> food for older infants. Since women are less <span class="highlight">fertile</span> when they are breast-feeding, substituting cereals for mother s milk would have resulted in closer spacing of births and the <span class="highlight">potential</span> for a greater number of live births for each woman. A more <span class="highlight">sedentary</span> <span class="highlight">existence</span> may also have lowered <span class="highlight">infant</span> <span class="highlight">mortality</span> and perhaps increased <span class="highlight">longevity</span> among the aged. These more <span class="highlight">vulnerable</span> members of society could safely stay in a fixed village rather than be forced regularly to move great distances as part of a <span class="highlight">nomadic</span> <span class="highlight">existence</span>, with its greater risk of accidents and <span class="highlight">trauma</span>.</p>
          <p>All of these factors may have resulted in a <span class="highlight">trend</span> of increasing size among some <span class="highlight">local</span> human populations in the Holocene (since 9600 B C E ). <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> <span class="highlight">Given</span> <span class="highlight">sufficient</span> time, <span class="highlight">even</span> in very rich habitats, human <span class="highlight">population</span> size can <span class="highlight">reach</span> carrying <span class="highlight">capacity</span>, the <span class="highlight">maximum</span> <span class="highlight">population</span> an area can <span class="highlight">sustain</span> <span class="highlight">within</span> the <span class="highlight">context</span> of a <span class="highlight">given</span> <span class="highlight">subsistence</span> system. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>And human <span class="highlight">population</span> growth is like a runaway tram once it picks up speed, it is difficult to control. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span> So <span class="highlight">even</span> after reaching an area's carrying <span class="highlight">capacity</span>, Holocene human populations probably continued to grow in food-rich regions, overshooting the <span class="highlight">ability</span> of the <span class="highlight">territory</span> to feed the <span class="highlight">population</span>, again <span class="highlight">within</span> the <span class="highlight">context</span> of the same <span class="highlight">subsistence</span> <span class="highlight">strategy</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>In some areas, small changes in <span class="highlight">climate</span> or <span class="highlight">minor</span> changes in plant characteristics may have further destabilized <span class="highlight">local</span> economies.</p>
          <p>One possible <span class="highlight">response</span> to surpassing the carrying <span class="highlight">capacity</span> of a <span class="highlight">region</span> is for a group to <span class="highlight">exploit</span> <span class="highlight">adjoining</span> land. However, good land may itself be limited-for example,<span class="highlight">within</span> the confines of a river <span class="highlight">valley</span> where neighbors are in the same <span class="highlight">position</span>, having filled up the whole of the <span class="highlight">desirable</span> <span class="highlight">habitat</span> <span class="highlight">available</span> in their home territories, <span class="highlight">expansion</span> is also problematic. Impinging on the neighbors' <span class="highlight">territory</span> can <span class="highlight">lead</span> to <span class="highlight">conflict</span>, especially when they too are up against the <span class="highlight">capacity</span> of the land to provide enough food.</p>
          <p>Another option is to stay in the same area but to <span class="highlight">shift</span> and <span class="highlight">intensify</span> the food <span class="highlight">quest</span> there. The <span class="highlight"><span class="question11">impulse</span></span> to produce more food to feed a growing <span class="highlight">population</span> was satisfied in some areas by the <span class="highlight">development</span> of more-complex <span class="highlight">subsistence</span> strategies involving <span class="highlight">intensive</span> labor and requiring more <span class="highlight">cooperation</span> and greater coordination among the increasing numbers of people. This <span class="highlight">development</span> resulted in a change in the social and <span class="highlight">economic</span> equations that defined those societies. <span class="question12">Hierarchies that did not exist in earlier foraging groups but that were helpful in structuring <span class="highlight">cooperative</span> labor and in organizing more-complex technologies probably became established, <span class="highlight">even</span> before <span class="highlight">domestication</span> and <span class="highlight">agriculture</span>, as pre-Neolithic societies (before the tenth <span class="highlight">millennium</span> B C E) reacted to the <span class="highlight">population</span> increase.</span></p>

Option A stated that the wild grain that the settled people ate had no more nomadic people. There was no such comparison in the two paragraphs of the original text; Option B said that the settled people were less dependent on protein than the nomadic people. It was right, because they eat more grains. The C option says that the settled peoples have more manual work than the nomadic people. This is not mentioned in the original text.

It is not mentioned in the original text. The original sentence is just to say that the newborn mortality rate is reduced and the life span of the elderly is prolonged. A more sedentary existence may also have changed infant mortality and perhaps longer longevity. Among the aged; Option B said neonatal mortality decreased, correct, corresponding to the original A more sedentary existence may also have improved infant mortality; C option says that women are less likely to find food, out of nothing; D option says that the life span of the elderly is extended, corresponding to Perhaps increased longevity among the aged, right.
