Small <span class="highlight">nomadic</span> groups could easily <span class="highlight">supply</span> the necessities for their families.No one needed more, and providing for more than one's needs made little <span class="highlight">sense</span>. The <span class="highlight">organization</span> of such societies could be rather simple, revolving around age and <span class="highlight">gender</span> categories. Such societies likely were largely egalitarian, beyond distinctions based on age and <span class="highlight">gender</span>, <span class="highlight"><span class="question2">virtually</span></span> all people had <span class="highlight">equivalent</span> rights, <span class="highlight">status</span>, and <span class="highlight">access</span> to resources.</p><p>Archaeologist Donald Henry suggests that the <span class="highlight">combination</span> of a rich <span class="highlight">habitat</span> and sedentism (<span class="highlight">permanent</span>, year-round <span class="highlight">settlement</span>) led to a <span class="highlight">dramatic</span> increase in human <span class="highlight">population</span>. In his view, <span class="highlight">nomadic</span>, simple foragers have <span class="highlight"><span class="question3">relatively</span></span><span class="highlight">tow</span> levels of <span class="highlight">fertility</span>. Their high-protein, low-carbohydrate diets result in low body-fat levels, which are commonly <span class="highlight">associated</span> with low <span class="highlight">fertility</span> in women. High levels of <span class="highlight">physical</span><span class="highlight">activity</span> and long periods of nursing, which are <span class="highlight">common</span> among <span class="question4">modern simple foragers</span>, probably also contributed to low levels of <span class="highlight">female</span><span class="highlight">fertility</span> if they were <span class="highlight">likewise</span><span class="highlight">common</span> among <span class="highlight">ancient</span> foragers.</p><p>In Henry's view, the <span class="highlight">adoption</span> of a more settled <span class="highlight">existence</span> in areas with <span class="highlight"><span class="question5">abundant</span></span> food resources would have contributed to higher <span class="highlight">fertility</span> levels among the <span class="highlight">sedentary</span> foragers. A <span class="highlight">diet</span> higher in wild cereals produces proportionally more body fat, <span class="highlight">leading</span> to higher <span class="highlight">fertility</span> among women. Cereals, which are easy to <span class="highlight">digest</span>, would have supplemented and then replaced mother's milk as the <span class="highlight">primary</span> food for older infants. Since women are less <span class="highlight">fertile</span> when they are breast-feeding, substituting cereals for mother s milk would have resulted in closer spacing of births and the <span class="highlight">potential</span> for a greater number of live births for each woman. A more <span class="highlight">sedentary</span><span class="highlight">existence</span> may also have lowered <span class="highlight">infant</span><span class="highlight">mortality</span> and perhaps increased <span class="highlight">longevity</span> among the aged. These more <span class="highlight">vulnerable</span> members of society could safely stay in a fixed village rather than be forced regularly to move great distances as part of a <span class="highlight">nomadic</span><span class="highlight">existence</span>, with its greater risk of accidents and <span class="highlight">trauma</span>.</p><p>All of these factors may have resulted in a <span class="highlight">trend</span> of increasing size among some <span class="highlight">local</span> human populations in the Holocene (since 9600 B C E ). <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span><span class="highlight">Given</span><span class="highlight">sufficient</span> time, <span class="highlight">even</span> in very rich habitats, human <span class="highlight">population</span> size can <span class="highlight">reach</span> carrying <span class="highlight">capacity</span>, the <span class="highlight">maximum</span><span class="highlight">population</span> an area can <span class="highlight">sustain</span><span class="highlight">within</span> the <span class="highlight">context</span> of a <span class="highlight">given</span><span class="highlight">subsistence</span> system. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>And human <span class="highlight">population</span> growth is like a runaway tram once it picks up speed, it is difficult to control. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span> So <span class="highlight">even</span> after reaching an area's carrying <span class="highlight">capacity</span>, Holocene human populations probably continued to grow in food-rich regions, overshooting the <span class="highlight">ability</span> of the <span class="highlight">territory</span> to feed the <span class="highlight">population</span>, again <span class="highlight">within</span> the <span class="highlight">context</span> of the same <span class="highlight">subsistence</span><span class="highlight">strategy</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>In some areas, small changes in <span class="highlight">climate</span> or <span class="highlight">minor</span> changes in plant characteristics may have further destabilized <span class="highlight">local</span> economies.</p><p>One possible <span class="highlight">response</span> to surpassing the carrying <span class="highlight">capacity</span> of a <span class="highlight">region</span> is for a group to <span class="highlight">exploit</span><span class="highlight">adjoining</span> land. However, good land may itself be limited-for example,<span class="highlight">within</span> the confines of a river <span class="highlight">valley</span> where neighbors are in the same <span class="highlight">position</span>, having filled up the whole of the <span class="highlight">desirable</span><span class="highlight">habitat</span><span class="highlight">available</span> in their home territories, <span class="highlight">expansion</span> is also problematic. Impinging on the neighbors' <span class="highlight">territory</span> can <span class="highlight">lead</span> to <span class="highlight">conflict</span>, especially when they too are up against the <span class="highlight">capacity</span> of the land to provide enough food.</p><p>Another option is to stay in the same area but to <span class="highlight">shift</span> and <span class="highlight">intensify</span> the food <span class="highlight">quest</span> there. The <span class="highlight"><span class="question11">impulse</span></span> to produce more food to feed a growing <span class="highlight">population</span> was satisfied in some areas by the <span class="highlight">development</span> of more-complex <span class="highlight">subsistence</span> strategies involving <span class="highlight">intensive</span> labor and requiring more <span class="highlight">cooperation</span> and greater coordination among the increasing numbers of people. This <span class="highlight">development</span> resulted in a change in the social and <span class="highlight">economic</span> equations that defined those societies. <span class="question12">Hierarchies that did not exist in earlier foraging groups but that were helpful in structuring <span class="highlight">cooperative</span> labor and in organizing more-complex technologies probably became established, <span class="highlight">even</span> before <span class="highlight">domestication</span> and <span class="highlight">agriculture</span>, as pre-Neolithic societies (before the tenth <span class="highlight">millennium</span> B C E) reacted to the <span class="highlight">population</span> increase.</span></p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the following is NOT mentioned in paragraph 1 as a characteristic of early nomadic foraging societies?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Organization by age or gender</p><p>B. Collection of surplus food</p><p>C. Equal access to resources</p><p>D. Lack of status divisions</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>This question is based on early nomadic foraging societies positioning, found that the entire first paragraph needs to be read. The A option corresponds to The organization of such societies could be rather simple, revolving around age and gender categories, correct; option B says they need to overstore food, with No one needed more, and providing more than one's needs made little sense. In contrast, the C and D options for all people had equivalent rights, status, and access to resources are correct. Select B.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question2">virtually</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. probably</p><p>B. nearly</p><p>C. gradually</p><p>D. fundamentally</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>Vocabulary. The word societies such as society is equal, beyond the distinctive between age and gender, . In fact, all people have equal rights, status and access to resources. Virtually means in fact, almost, actually. The four options for this question are A, B, B, B, C, and D. B is the best match. .</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question3">relatively</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. comparatively</p><p>B. surprisingly</p><p>C. significantly</p><p>D. dangerously</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" A"><p>Vocabulary. The general meaning is that in this anthropologist's point of view, the simple nomadic people eat <span class="question3">relatively</span> simple foods. Later on, they also specifically stated that they eat low-fat and high-protein foods. Relatively means that in comparison. Option A is also a comparison. B means surprising, C is important, and D is dangerous. Select A.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the author mention "<span class="highlight"><span class="question4">modern simple foragers</span></span>"?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To contrast the diets of modern simple foragers with those of ancient simple foragers</p><p>B. To illustrate the effects of low levels of female fertility on foraging populations</p><p>C. To help support the claim that ancient foragers may have had low levels of fertility</p><p>D. To argue for a link between nursing practices and fertility levels</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" C"><p>This question is based on <span class="question4">modern simple foragers</span> targeting high level of physical activity and long periods of nursing, which are common among <span class="question4">modern simple foragers</span>, probably also contributed to low levels of female fertility if they were just common among ancient foragers. <span class="question4">modern simple foragers</span> For comparison with the ancient foragers, the food they ingested was low in fat and met the C option. A is the comparison between ancient and modern nomadic people's diet. The original text does not have this contrast; B is to use this to explain the impact of low-fat women on the population, and out of nothing; the D option is to support the link between breastfeeding behavior and fat content. There is nothing out of nothing. Select C.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question5">abundant</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. varied</p><p>B. plentiful</p><p>C. known</p><p>D. valuable</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>The sentence <span class="question5">abundant</span> locates this sentence: In Henry's view, the adoption of a more settled existence areas with <span class="question5">abundant</span> food resources would have contributed to higher fertility levels among the sedentary foragers. The sentence is intended to be a more stable, more food-friendly place of residence. Causes settlers to eat more fat. Abundant means <span class="question5">abundant</span> surplus. Option A means diversity, Option B is sufficient, Option C is known, and Option D is valuable. Select B is closest.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the following can be inferred from paragraphs 2 and 3 about sedentary foragers?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Their diet did not include as much wild cereal as that of nomadic foragers</p><p>B. Their diet relied less on protein than did the diet of nomadic foragers</p><p>C. They were more physically active than nomadic foragers</p><p>D. They were more likely to breast feed their infants than nomadic foragers were</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>According to the title, the second paragraph of the article mainly states that anthropologists believe that the settlement and the rich settlements have greatly increased the human population. The third paragraph of the article mainly stated that he also believes that the food rich in settlement leads to an increase in fat content in the human body. . Option A stated that the wild grain that the settled people ate had no more nomadic people. There was no such comparison in the two paragraphs of the original text; Option B said that the settled people were less dependent on protein than the nomadic people. It was right, because they eat more grains. The C option says that the settled peoples have more manual work than the nomadic people. This is not mentioned in the original text. The D option says that women are more willing to breastfeed their children, but the original language says that cereals are used instead of breastfeeding. Select B.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>Select the TWO answer choices that according to paragraph 3, were probable effects of a more sedentary existence among foragers. To receive credit you must select TWO answer choices.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. More people were available to care for infants and the aged.</p><p>B. The frequency of infant mortality decreased.</p><p>C. Women no longer participated regularly in foraging activities.</p><p>D. The life span of older people lengthened.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="BD"><p>This question requires the selection of two human settlements that have an impact on human life. The A option says that more people can take care of newborns and the elderly. It is not mentioned in the original text. The original sentence is just to say that the newborn mortality rate is reduced and the life span of the elderly is prolonged. A more sedentary existence may also have changed infant mortality and perhaps longer longevity. Among the aged; Option B said neonatal mortality decreased, correct, corresponding to the original A more sedentary existence may also have improved infant mortality; C option says that women are less likely to find food, out of nothing; D option says that the life span of the elderly is extended, corresponding to Perhaps increased longevity among the aged, right. Double-select BD in this question.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>It can be inferred from paragraph 3 that, compared with simple foragers, foragers</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. stopped breast-feeding earlier.</p><p>B. had lower levels of body fat.</p><p>C. ate a limited variety of wild cereals.</p><p>D. had less access to easily digested foods.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>This question asks what changes are present in omnivores compared to ancient simple omnivores. Option A said that they broke breastfeeding earlier, and we could have in Since women are less fertile when they are breast-feeding, substituting cereals for mother s milk would have formed in closer spacing of births and the potential for a greater number of Live births for each woman found that cereals can replace breastmilk, right; Option B said that their body fat content is lower and is wrong, in fact, higher; Option C says they eat fewer types of cereals, should be more Rich; Option D says they are more difficult to get easily digestible food and should be easier to get. Select A.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, all of the following factors could have destabilized local economies among Holocene populations EXCEPT</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. population growth beyond carrying capacity.</p><p>B. changes in local climate.</p><p>C. changes in plant characteristics.</p><p>D. political conflict within a given population.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>This question requires us to select factors that do not affect the population of Holocene. The whole paragraph of the fourth paragraph discusses the factors affecting the population of Holocene: (1) No matter how big the settlement is, the population can always increase to its maximum carrying capacity; (2) Once the population starts to grow, it cannot stop. , not well controlled; (3) when the population gradually grows to be unable to carry the land, they will occupy the rest of the food-rich areas; (4) climate and vegetation changes will also lead to instability in the local economy. A, B, and C were all mentioned in the above minutes. The D option says political conflict. This is nothing but a D.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 5, what is one possible response for a society that has surpassed the carrying capacity of its land?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Sharing resources with neighbors.</p><p>B. Making use of additional lands nearby.</p><p>C. Moving to better land in areas such as river valleys.</p><p>D. Exploiting less desirable resources in their home territory.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>This paragraph refers to the fifth paragraph, the first sentence of the fifth paragraph One possible response to surpassing the carrying capacity of a region is for a group to exploit adjoining land to solve one of the methods of overpopulation is to develop adjacent land. Option A says sharing resources with neighbors, B says using surplus land around, C says moving to better land, D says developing resources that are not needed on their land. B is the most appropriate.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question11">impulse</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. basic motive</p><p>B. only choice.</p><p>C. capacity.</p><p>D. opportunity</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" A"><p>Vocabulary. Impulse to produce more food to feed a growing population was satisfied in some areas by the development of more-complex subsistence strategies intensive intensive labor and requiring more cooperation and greater coordination among the increasing numbers of people. This can be achieved through more sophisticated strategies to meet the needs of producing more food and feeding more people. Option A basic motivation, correct; option B only option, option C capability, option D opportunity. Only A is the most suitable. Select A.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The appearance of domestication and agriculture brought about the need for more hierarchically organized systems of labor and technologies among pre-Neolithic foraging societies.</p><p>B. The formation of social hierarchies meant that domestication and agriculture became less important than labor and technical development to the growth of pre-Neolithic societies.</p><p>C. Population increases among pre-Neolithic societies, even before domestication and agriculture, probably resulted in social hierarchies that helped organize labor and technologies.</p><p>D. Hierarchies that developed among foraging group pre-Neolithic societies respond to later population increases caused domestication and agriculture.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>This question speaks of sentence meaning. The target sentence is: Hierarchies that did not exist in earlier foraging groups but that were helpful in structuring cooperative labor and in organizing more-complex techniques probably become established, even before domestication and agriculture, as pre-Neolithic societies (before the tenth millennium BCE) Reacted to the population increase. The main meaning of this sentence is that the stratum did not exist at an early stage, but it was useful in the division of labor, and it formed in more complex technical organizations, even earlier than stocking livestock and farming. It also appeared. In the process of dealing with population growth in the pre-Stone Age. C has the same meaning as this sentence and is correct. Option A said that raising livestock and farming led to the emergence of classes, and the causal relationship was erroneous; Option B said that the class made the stocking of livestock and farming less important than cooperation and technology, and there was no mention in the original sentence; Option D said that the hierarchy led to the stocking of livestock. And the emergence of farming is also wrong. Select C.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Population growth eventually leads to potential problems, however..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>This means that population growth eventually leads to potential problems, however. It means that population growth eventually leads to many potential problems. However, the word means that this sentence is a turning point. It should be preceded by the situation of population growth, followed by its problems. Looking at each of the four insertion sites, A's position stated in front of the population growth, and later it elaborated on a series of problems caused by uncontrollable population growth. Most suitable, choose A.</p></div></div><div id="question14" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>As human societies in the pre-Neolithic period shifted from nomadic to sedentary lifestyles, their organization became more complex and hierarchical.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.The shift to sedentism did not occur in rich habitats, where groups were able to maintain nomadic, foraging lifestyles because of easy access to food sources.</p><p>B.In general, the higher the proportion of protein to carbohydrate in a female individual's diet, the higher the level of that individual's fertility.</p><p>C.The carrying capacities of certain types of regions such as river valleys were limited by the presence of neighbors competing for the same resources.</p><p>D.Changes in diet and activity associated with a sedentary life may have resulted in higher fertility levels and better chances of survival.</p><p>E.As human populations increased during the Holocene period, they began to exceed the number of people that could be sustained by the local environment.</p><p>F.Societies responded to the limitations of their environment by developing more complex social and technological strategies that enabled them to produce more food within the same area.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="DEF"><p>This question needs to analyze each option in turn. Option A means that people are turning to settled lives and they are not in rich areas. They are out of nothing and they are not elected. Option B is that the more carbohydrates a woman eats, the more body fat there is. Right, but it is the details. It is not generalization and no election. Option C means that the population's carrying capacity of the land is limited because of the competition of the neighboring population. Option D says that changes in diet and activities have increased fat content in the body, summarizing the contents of the second and third paragraphs; Option E says that population growth gradually exceeds the amount that the environment can bear, summarizing the fourth paragraph of this paper; Option F says that humans The society produces more food by developing science and technology and corresponds to the sixth paragraph. Select D, E, F.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
