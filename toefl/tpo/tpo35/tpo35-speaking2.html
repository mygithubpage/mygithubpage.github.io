A university's academic reputation is the most important thing a student should consider in deciding which universtiy to attend. Use examples and details to support your opinion.</p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>Well, I really don't think that a university's academic reputation is the deciding factor a student should consider while choosing a university.Someone who believes in it must have assumed that academic reputation is the only element for a person's development or success, but they overlook the fact that there're other parts of university education that helps one to succeed, like the social life, the various campus activities and general atmosphere.If a university has a great academic reputation but a hostile atmosphere, some students may become depressed and frustrated, and therefore less motivated to work hard to achieve something in college. That, I guess, would be a waste of their college tuition and time.</p></article></div></main></body></html>
