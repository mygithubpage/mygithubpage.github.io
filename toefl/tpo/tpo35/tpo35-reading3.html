          </h4>

            <span id="arrow">

            <span class="underline">Phytoplankton</span> are <span class="light"><span class="underline">minute</span></span> free-floating <span class="underline">aquatic</span> plants In <span class="underline">addition</span> to the <span class="underline">marked</span> changes in <span class="underline">abundance</span> observed in <span class="underline">phytoplankton</span> over the <span class="underline">course</span> of a year, there is also a <span class="underline">marked</span> change in <span class="underline">species</span> <span class="underline">composition</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>This change in the <span class="underline">dominant</span> <span class="underline">species</span> from <span class="underline">season</span> to <span class="underline">season</span> is called <span class="underline">seasonal</span> <span class="underline">succession</span>, and it occurs m a wide <span class="underline">variety</span> of locations. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>Under <span class="underline">seasonal</span> <span class="underline">succession</span>, one or more <span class="underline">species</span> <span class="underline">dominate</span> the <span class="underline">phytoplankton</span> for a shorter or longer period of time and then are replaced by another set of <span class="underline">species</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>This <span class="underline">pattern</span> is repeated yearly. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>This <span class="underline">succession</span> is different from <span class="underline">typical</span> <span class="underline">terrestrial</span> <span class="underline">ecological</span> <span class="underline">succession</span> in which various plants <span class="underline">replace</span> one another until finally a so-called <span class="underline">climax</span> <span class="underline">community</span> develops, which persists for many years.</p>
          <p>What are the factors causing this <span class="underline">phenomenon</span>? Considering that <span class="underline">seasonal</span> <span class="underline">succession</span> is most often and clearly seen in <span class="underline">temperate</span> seas, which have a <span class="underline">marked</span> change in <span class="underline">temperature</span> during a year, <span class="underline">temperature</span> has been suggested as a cause. This may be one of the factors, but it is <span class="underline">unlikely</span> to be the <span class="underline">sole</span> cause because there are <span class="underline">species</span> that become <span class="underline">dominant</span> <span class="underline">species</span> at various temperatures. Furthermore, <span class="underline">temperature</span> changes rather slowly in seawater, and the replacement of <span class="underline">dominant</span> <span class="underline">species</span> often is much more rapid.</p>
          <p>Another suggested <span class="underline">reason</span> is the change in <span class="underline">nutrient</span> <span class="underline">level</span> over the year, with differing concentrations favoring different phytoplanklon <span class="underline">species</span>. While this <span class="underline">factor</span> may also <span class="underline">contribute</span>, observations suggest that <span class="underline">phytoplankton</span> populations rise and fall much more quickly than <span class="underline">nutrient</span> concentrations change.</p>
          <p>Yet another explanation is that <span class="underline">species</span> <span class="underline">succession</span> is a <span class="underline">consequence</span> of changes in seawater brought about by the <span class="underline">phytoplankton</span> living in it. Each <span class="underline">species</span> of <span class="underline">phytoplankton</span> secretes or excretes <span class="underline">organic</span> molecules into the seawater. These metabolites can have an effect on the organisms living in the seawater, either inhibiting or promoting their growth. For any <span class="underline">individual</span> <span class="underline">organism</span>, the <span class="underline">amount</span> of metabolite secreted is small. But the effect of secretions by all the individuals of the <span class="underline">dominant</span> <span class="underline">species</span> can be <span class="underline">significant</span> both for themselves and for other <span class="underline">species</span>.</p>
          <p>These <span class="underline">organic</span> metabolites could, and probably do, include a number of different classes of <span class="underline">organic</span> compounds. Some are likely toxins, such as those released by the dinoflagellates (a <span class="underline">species</span> of <span class="underline">plankton</span>) during red tides, which <span class="underline">inhibit</span> growth of other <span class="underline">photosynthetic</span> organisms. In such cases, the <span class="underline">population</span> <span class="underline">explosion</span> of dinoflagellates is so great that the water becomes brownish red in color from the billions of dinoflagellate cells. Although each <span class="underline">cell</span> secretes a <span class="underline">minute</span> <span class="underline">amount</span> of toxin, the <span class="underline">massive</span> dinoflagellate numbers cause the toxin to <span class="underline">reach</span> concentrations that kill many creatures. This toxin can be concentrated in such filter-feeding organisms as clams and mussels, rendering them <span class="underline">toxic</span> to humans.</p>
          <p>Another class of metabolite is the vitamins. It is now known that certain <span class="underline">phytoplankton</span> <span class="underline">species</span> have requirements for certain vitamins, and that there are <span class="underline">considerable</span> differences among <span class="underline">species</span> as to requirements. The B vitamins, especially vitamin B12, thiamine and biotin, <span class="underline">seem</span> to be the most generally required Some <span class="underline">species</span> may be unable to <span class="underline">thrive</span> until a <span class="underline">particular</span> vitamin, or group of vitamins, is present in the water. These vitamins are produced only by another species: hence, a <span class="underline">succession</span> of <span class="underline">species</span> could <span class="underline">occur</span> <span class="underline">whereby</span> first the vitamin-producing <span class="underline">species</span> is present and then the vitamin-requiring <span class="underline">species</span> follows.</p>
          <p>Other <span class="underline">organic</span> compounds that may <span class="underline">inhibit</span> or <span class="underline">promote</span> various <span class="underline">species</span> include <span class="underline">amino</span> acids, carbohydrates, and fatty acids. Although it is suspected that these <span class="underline">organic</span> metabolites may have an important role in <span class="underline">species</span> <span class="underline">succession</span> and it has been demonstrated in the <span class="underline">laboratory</span> that <span class="underline">phytoplankton</span> <span class="underline">species</span> <span class="underline">vary</span> both in their <span class="underline">ability</span> to produce necessary vitamins and in their requirements for such in order to grow, <span class="underline">evidence</span> is still inadequate as to their real role in the sea.</p>
          <p>There is also <span class="underline">evidence</span> to suggest that grazers (animals that feed on plants or <span class="underline">stationary</span> animals), particularly <span class="underline">selective</span> grazers, can influence the <span class="underline">phytoplankton</span> <span class="underline">species</span> <span class="underline">composition</span>. Many copepods (small, <span class="underline">herbivorous</span> crustaceans) and <span class="underline">invertebrate</span> <span class="underline">larvae</span> pick out selected <span class="underline">phytoplankton</span> <span class="underline">species</span> from mixed groups, changing the <span class="underline">species</span> <span class="underline">composition</span>.</p>
          <p>A growing body of <span class="underline">evidence</span> now suggests that all of the factors considered here are operating simultaneously to produce <span class="underline">species</span> <span class="underline">succession</span>. The importance of any <span class="underline">factor</span> will <span class="underline">vary</span> with the <span class="underline">particular</span> <span class="underline">phytoplankton</span> <span class="underline">species</span> and the <span class="underline">environmental</span> conditions.</p>
