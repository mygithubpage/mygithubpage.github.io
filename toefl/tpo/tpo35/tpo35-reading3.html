Considering that <span class="highlight">seasonal</span><span class="highlight">succession</span> is most often and clearly seen in <span class="highlight">temperate</span> seas, which have a <span class="highlight">marked</span> change in <span class="highlight">temperature</span> during a year, <span class="highlight">temperature</span> has been suggested as a cause. This may be one of the factors, but it is <span class="highlight">unlikely</span> to be the <span class="highlight">sole</span> cause because there are <span class="highlight">species</span> that become <span class="highlight">dominant</span><span class="highlight">species</span> at various temperatures. Furthermore, <span class="highlight">temperature</span> changes rather slowly in seawater, and the replacement of <span class="highlight">dominant</span><span class="highlight">species</span> often is much more rapid.</p><p>Another suggested <span class="highlight">reason</span> is the change in <span class="highlight">nutrient</span><span class="highlight">level</span> over the year, with <span class="question3">differing</span> concentrations favoring different phytoplanklon <span class="highlight">species</span>. While this <span class="highlight">factor</span> may also <span class="highlight">contribute</span>, observations suggest that <span class="question4"><span class="highlight">phytoplankton</span> populations rise and fall much more quickly than <span class="highlight">nutrient</span> concentrations change.</span></p><p>Yet another explanation is that <span class="highlight">species</span><span class="highlight">succession</span> is a <span class="highlight">consequence</span> of changes in seawater brought about by the <span class="highlight">phytoplankton</span> living in it. Each <span class="highlight">species</span> of <span class="highlight">phytoplankton</span> secretes or excretes <span class="highlight">organic</span> molecules into the seawater. These metabolites can have an effect on the organisms living in the seawater, either inhibiting or promoting their growth. For any <span class="highlight">individual</span><span class="highlight">organism</span>, the <span class="highlight">amount</span> of metabolite secreted is small. But the effect of secretions by all the individuals of the <span class="highlight">dominant</span><span class="highlight">species</span> can be <span class="highlight">significant</span> both for themselves and for other <span class="highlight">species</span>.</p><p>These <span class="highlight">organic</span> metabolites could, and probably do, include a number of different classes of <span class="highlight">organic</span> compounds. Some are likely toxins, such as those released by the dinoflagellates (a <span class="highlight">species</span> of <span class="highlight">plankton</span>) during red tides, which <span class="highlight">inhibit</span> growth of other <span class="highlight">photosynthetic</span> organisms. In such cases, the <span class="highlight">population</span><span class="highlight">explosion</span> of dinoflagellates is so great that the water becomes brownish red in color from the billions of dinoflagellate cells. Although each <span class="highlight">cell</span> secretes a <span class="highlight">minute</span><span class="highlight">amount</span> of toxin, the <span class="highlight"><span class="question7">massive</span></span> dinoflagellate numbers cause the toxin to <span class="highlight">reach</span> concentrations that kill many creatures. This toxin can be concentrated in such filter-feeding organisms as clams and mussels, rendering them <span class="highlight">toxic</span> to humans.</p><p>Another class of metabolite is the vitamins. It is now known that certain <span class="highlight">phytoplankton</span><span class="highlight">species</span> have requirements for certain vitamins, and that there are <span class="highlight"><span class="question8">considerable</span></span> differences among <span class="highlight">species</span> as to requirements. The B vitamins, especially vitamin B12, thiamine and biotin, <span class="highlight">seem</span> to be the most generally required Some <span class="highlight">species</span> may be unable to <span class="highlight">thrive</span> until a <span class="highlight">particular</span> vitamin, or group of vitamins, is present in the water. These vitamins are produced only by another species: hence, a <span class="highlight">succession</span> of <span class="highlight">species</span> could <span class="highlight">occur</span><span class="highlight">whereby</span> first the vitamin-producing <span class="highlight">species</span> is present and then the vitamin-requiring <span class="highlight">species</span> follows.</p><p>Other <span class="highlight">organic</span> compounds that may <span class="highlight">inhibit</span> or <span class="highlight">promote</span> various <span class="highlight">species</span> include <span class="highlight">amino</span> acids, carbohydrates, and fatty acids. Although it is suspected that these <span class="highlight">organic</span> metabolites may have an important role in <span class="highlight">species</span><span class="highlight">succession</span> and it has been demonstrated in the <span class="highlight">laboratory</span> that <span class="highlight">phytoplankton</span><span class="highlight">species</span><span class="highlight">vary</span> both in their <span class="highlight">ability</span> to produce necessary vitamins and in their requirements for such in order to grow, <span class="highlight">evidence</span> is still inadequate as to their real role in the sea.</p><p>There is also <span class="highlight">evidence</span> to suggest that grazers (animals that feed on plants or <span class="highlight">stationary</span> animals), particularly <span class="highlight">selective</span> grazers, can influence the <span class="highlight">phytoplankton</span><span class="highlight">species</span><span class="highlight">composition</span>. Many copepods (small, <span class="highlight">herbivorous</span> crustaceans) and <span class="highlight">invertebrate</span><span class="highlight">larvae</span> pick out selected <span class="highlight">phytoplankton</span><span class="highlight">species</span> from mixed groups, changing the <span class="highlight">species</span><span class="highlight">composition</span>.</p><p>A growing body of <span class="highlight">evidence</span> now suggests that all of the factors considered here are operating <span class="question11">simultaneously</span> to produce <span class="highlight">species</span><span class="highlight">succession</span>. The importance of any <span class="highlight">factor</span> will <span class="highlight">vary</span> with the <span class="highlight">particular</span><span class="highlight">phytoplankton</span><span class="highlight">species</span> and the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> conditions.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">minute</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. light</p><p>B. common</p><p>C. tiny</p><p>D. simple</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The corresponding sentence in this article is Phytoplankton are minute, free-floating aquatic plants. This means that Phytoplankon is a small free-floating aquatic organism. Minutes mean minute, option A is light, option B is common, option C is small, and option D is simple. C is the most consistent.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 2, one reason temperature is not likely to be the sole cause of seasonal succession in phytoplankton is</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. the temperature of seawater changes too often.</p><p>B. seasonal succession usually occurs only in temperate seas.</p><p>C. the rate of replacement of dominant species is slower than that of temperature change.</p><p>D. certain dominant species have been observed at different temperatures.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>According to the keyword the sole cause, this problem is located in this sentence: This may be one of the factors, but it is unlikely to be the sole cause because there are species that become the dominant species at various temperatures. Species will become dominant species at temperature. The meaning is consistent with option D. Option A says that seawater temperature changes too frequently. Option B says that seasonal changes take place only in moderate seas. Option C says that the replacement rate of dominant species is faster than the rate of temperature change. These three are all out of nothing. Select D.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question3">differing</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. increasing</p><p>B. necessary</p><p>C. varying</p><p>D. high</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" C"><p>Another reason for this is that the corresponding sentence in the text is Another suggested reason is change in nutrient level over the year, with <span class="question3">differing</span> concentrations favoring different phytoplankton species. The other reason is that the level of nutrition is changed in a year, and the concentration of different nutrients will lead to The outbreak of different plankton. Differing consciousness here is different, Option A is growing, Option B is required, Option C is changed, and Option D is high. Option C is the most appropriate.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the author provide the information that "<span class="highlight">phytoplankton populations rise and fall much more quickly than nutrient concentrations change</span>"?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To argue that the nutrient level not determine phytoplankton succession.</p><p>B. To argue that the succession of phytoplankton is actually the cause of changes in the nutrient level.</p><p>C. To indicate that phytoplankton populations are very sensitive to changes in the nutrient level.</p><p>D. To imply that changes in the nutrient level explain the succession of phytoplankton.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="phytoplankton populations rise and fall much more quickly than nutrient concentrations change A"><p>This question needs to be positioned in the third paragraph. Overall, the third paragraph first states that another guess is that changes in the level of nutrition determine the type of dominant plankton, followed by a while turning that there is also a factor that may be useful. That is, the change in the quantity of plankton is faster than the change in nutrition, and questions the former. Option A says that it is correct that the nutritional level does not determine the replacement of plankton. Option B says that it is indeed nutrients that determine the replacement of plankton. Option C is that plankton is very sensitive to nutrients. Option D is that changes in nutrients explain the change in plankton.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, all of the following are true about metabolites secreted by phytoplankton EXCEPT</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They have a less significant effect on the dominant species of phytoplankton than they do on other species of phytoplankton.</p><p>B. They affect the growth of phytoplankton living in seawater.</p><p>C. They are secreted in small amounts by individual phytoplankton.</p><p>D. They cause changes in seawater that result in species succession of phytoplankton.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>This question needs to look at the fourth paragraph. The fourth paragraph mainly discusses another explanation for the replacement of plankton: a type of organism that influences seawater itself and then influences its own survival. Each type of plankton secretes organic molecules that affect the growth of organic matter in the water. If the number of plankton is small, the secretion of this substance is also small and the impact is small; but once their number increases, the influence of this secretion will become greater. B, C, and D are all mentioned in this paragraph. Only Option A says that those substances that are secreted have little influence on plankton and have a great influence on other species. This is not mentioned in the original text.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 5, all of the following statements are true about dinoflagellates EXCEPT</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They produce toxins that inhibit the growth of other organisms.</p><p>B. Each produces a very little amount of toxin.</p><p>C. Their toxins can concentrate in clams and mussels.</p><p>D. Their toxins are dangerous only to other photosynthetic organisms.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>This question needs to return to the fifth paragraph. Option A corresponds to which inhibit growth of other photosynthetic organisms, correct; Option B corresponds to Abstract each cell secretes a minute amount of toxin, correct; Option C corresponds to This toxin can be concentrated in such filter-feeding organisms as clams and mussels, correct. Option D is not mentioned, wrong. Select D.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question7">massive</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. enormous</p><p>B. total</p><p>C. observed</p><p>D. increasing</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" A"><p>The term <span class="question7">massive</span> in the original text corresponds to the phrase each minute secret of a minute amount of toxin, the <span class="question7">massive</span> dinoflagellate numbers cause the toxin to reach concentrations that kill many creatures. This sentence is: Although a single cell secretes few poisons, but many The cells are pooled and the poisons analyzed can kill other organisms. Massive here means a lot. Option A is huge, Option B is all, Option C is observed, and Option D is growing. Option A best matches.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question8">considerable</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. often</p><p>B. a few</p><p>C. basic</p><p>D. significant</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" D"><p>The meaning of the word for this question is <span class="question8">considerable</span>. In the original sentence, the corresponding sentence is It is now known that certain phytoplankton species have requirements for certain vitamins, and that there are significant differences among species as to requirements. The meaning of this sentence is that certain plankton require specific vitamins. Different kinds of plankton have very different vitamin types from each other. Here <span class="question8">considerable</span> means huge. Option A is often, Option B is a few, Option C is basic, Option D is important, Huge, D is selected.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Paragraph 6 supports which of the following statements about a phytoplankton species that cannot produce thiamine?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It can be followed in a seasonal succession only by another phytoplankton species that cannot produce thiamine.</p><p>B. It can never become the dominant species in a seasonal succession.</p><p>C. It can be preceded in a seasonal succession only by a phytoplankton species that produces thiamine.</p><p>D. It is able to produce B vitamins other than thiamine.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>This question needs to see the sixth paragraph. In the sixth paragraph, we talked roughly about the fact that some species cannot survive without certain vitamins, so there is a phenomenon in which a species that can produce specific vitamins first appears, and then other species The species that need these vitamins follow. The question asks what happens to a plankton that cannot produce thiamine on its own. Option A says that it can only be followed by another species that does not produce thiamine, wrong; Option B says it can never be a dominant species, wrong; Option C says it can be produced immediately after the species that produces thiamine, right; Option D Say it can produce vitamin B by itself. It doesn't matter what this paragraph says. Option C is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The copepods mentioned in paragraph 8 are</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. one type of phytoplankton</p><p>B. stationary animals</p><p>C. selective grazers</p><p>D. invertebrate larva</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>This question concerns the eighth paragraph of the original text. The eighth paragraph mainly discusses that there are some herbivores that also affect the composition of plankton. The copepods are taken as an example. They say that it and invertebrate larvae will pick out some kinds of plankton to eat. Option A is a plankton, Option B is an immobile animal, Option C is a selective herbivore, and Option D is invertebrate larvae. Option C is in accordance with the original meaning.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question11">simultaneously</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. without limits</p><p>B. at the same time</p><p>C. merely</p><p>D. spontaneously</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>The words examined in this question are <span class="question11">simultaneously</span> and correspondent to the sentence in the original text: A growing body of evidence now suggests that all of the elements considered here are operating <span class="question11">simultaneously</span> to produce species succession. The general idea is: more and more evidence shows that these factors are together Affect the replacement of species. Both mean simultaneous, together, option A is unlimited, option B is simultaneous, option C is only, and option D is spontaneous. Option B is closest to original intention.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the following statements best describes how the passage is organized?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. A description of a phenomenon is provided, forward hypotheses as to the phenomenon's cause.</p><p>B. Two phenomena are introduced, and the rest of the passage provides reasons as to why the first is more common than the second.</p><p>C. A group of species is discussed, and the rest of the passage explains the environmental factors threatening it.</p><p>D. A phenomenon is described, and the rest of the passage discusses effects of that phenomenon on the environment.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>This article asks the organization structure of the article. Need us to analyze the full text. In order to save time in this case, we can only look at the structure in the first sentence of each paragraph. In the first paragraph of this article, the seasonal replacement of phytoplankton was introduced. The reasons for the novation at the beginning of the second paragraph began. From the second paragraph, the author began to list all kinds of speculations. This article is a total score structure. Option A means to give a phenomenon first, then put forward various hypotheses, and correctly; Option B means to introduce two phenomena, and the latter explains why the first phenomenon is more common than the second; Option C means to introduce Some of the species' factors; Option D says to start with a phenomenon that is described later. B, C, D are not correct.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>In fact, seasonal succession has been observed all over the globe, from the Arctic to the Tropics..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>First analyze the sentences that need to be inserted: In fact, seasonal succession has been observed all over the globe, from the Arctic to the Tropics. In fact, seasonal changes can be observed globally, from the Arctic to the tropics. The in fact at the beginning of this sentence requires our attention. This shows that it is not the first time that this concept has been mentioned. It must have been mentioned before that it is a seasonal replacement. One by one, see where you can insert, and find that B is OK. The preceding sentence at the B position mentioned the breadth of seasonal alternations. The latter sentence further elaborated on what would happen in the seasonal alternations. Inserting into this position could form a logical relationship that was introduced first and then introduced in detail. It was appropriate. Select B.</p></div></div><div id="question14" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>As human societies in the pre-Neolithic period shifted from nomadic to sedentary lifestyles, their organization became more complex and hierarchical.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.At any given place and time a particular group of phytoplankton species dominates, but the group that has dominance changes in a pattern of seasonal succession that is repeated on an annual basis.</p><p>B.Organic chemicals released by the dominant phytoplankton species, including toxins and vitamins, may influence successions by inhibiting or promoting the populations of other phytoplankton species.</p><p>C.Certain species of phytoplankon release concentrated toxins that can kill other species of phytoplankton.</p><p>D.The seasonal succession among phytoplankton populations are influenced by a number of factors including water temperature, nutrient levels, and the activities of selective grazers.</p><p>E.Seasonal succession, unlike terrestrial ecological succession, results in a climax community, which can last indefinitely provided the right environmental conditions persist.</p><p>F.Laboratory experiments have shown that, in temperate seas, temperature is the primary factor in phytoplankton species composition.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="ABD"><p>This question needs to analyze each option one by one. Option A states that plankton species are dominant anytime, anywhere, but the dominant species species are constantly changing, repeating in a regular pattern, summarizing the contents of the first paragraph, and correct; Option B means the secretion of dominant species.
