That I didn't know. <span class="time" data-times="8.67" data-time="116.14">[01:56.14]</span>But <span class="highlight">regardless</span> of who commissioned it, isn't the fact that it was based on eye witness accounts the most important thing? <span class="time" data-times="3.48" data-time="124.81">[02:04.81]</span>I mean, it was made only 17 years after the battle. <span class="time" data-times="2.19" data-time="128.29">[02:08.29]</span>So plenty of eye witnesses were still alive.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="1.73" data-time="130.48">[02:10.48]</span>Professor: Yes, that's true. <span class="time" data-times="4.49" data-time="132.21">[02:12.21]</span>But the real point of the <span class="highlight">controversy</span> isn't the battle itself. <span class="time" data-times="6.79" data-time="136.7">[02:16.70]</span>It has to do with the <span class="highlight">reason</span> for the battle: who was the rightful <span class="highlight">heir</span> to the throne? <span class="time" data-times="2.3" data-time="143.49">[02:23.49]</span>Who would be the next king? <span class="time" data-times="5.77" data-time="145.79">[02:25.79]</span>And if William the Conqueror's brother is the one who's commissioned this tapestry...</p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.9" data-time="151.56">[02:31.56]</span>Student: Then he would be the one to decide which words and images would go on the tapestry and what would be left out.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.4" data-time="158.46">[02:38.46]</span>Professor:Exactly. So of <span class="highlight">course</span> the tapestry shows why William should be the new king.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="1.96" data-time="164.86">[02:44.86]</span>Student:I guess I see your point. <span class="time" data-times="3.03" data-time="166.82">[02:46.82]</span>Embroiderers are just <span class="highlight">gonna</span> do what they are told to do.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="9.3" data-time="169.85">[02:49.85]</span>Professor:You have to understand that the tapestry depicted an entire <span class="highlight">series</span> of events as they were interpreted by the Normans, the victors of the battle. <span class="time" data-times="9.51" data-time="179.15">[02:59.15]</span>And that's a problem if you are trying to write objectively about the <span class="highlight">invasion</span>, especially if you use it as your only <span class="highlight">source</span> of information. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="188.66">[03:08.66]</span>After all, it's important for historians to examine an event from all sides.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor want to talk to the student?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To review material from a previous class.</p><p>B. To recommend a resource for an assignment.</p><p>C. To outline steps the student should take to complete his research.</p><p>D. To discuss the student's plan for a paper.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>"So, I want to talk about your outline. I do like your topic, William the conqueror, leading the Norman invasion of England, but...I'm a little concerned about your source, and the fact that you want to use "It as the entire basis of your paper." The professor asked the students to discuss his outline and the accuracy of the reference materials. Therefore, option D is correct. The A option says "For the purpose of reviewing the contents of the previous lesson," it was not mentioned, so it was excluded. The B option says "In order to introduce the necessary resources for the operation", it is not mentioned, so it is excluded. The C option says "In order to give the student an outline step", not mentioned, it is excluded.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor imply about the student's outline?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It needs to have a clearer thesis.</p><p>B. It needs to include specific examples.</p><p>C. It needs to have information from additional sources.</p><p>D. It needs to be better organized.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>"but...I'm a little concerned about your source, and the fact that you want to use it as the entire basis of your paper." Professors are more worried that students consider tapestry as primary reference material, To the bad point of this material, Option C is correct. A option says "needs for a clearer topic", not mentioned, so rule out.</p><p>Option B says "need to include specific examples", not mentioned, so rule out. The D option says "Needs to be better organized", not mentioned, so ruled out.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the student, why is the Bayeux Tapestry an important historical document?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It contains the earliest records of English kings.</p><p>B. It is based on eyewitness accounts.</p><p>C. It documents differences between life in England and life in France during the eleventh century.</p><p>D. Its images match those in other documents from the eleventh century.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>"But regardless of who commissioned it, isn't the fact that it was based on eyewitness accounts the most important thing? I mean it was made only 17 years after the battle so plenty of eyewitness were still alive." Based on the witness's record, it is very real and important, so Option B is correct. The A option says "It contains the earliest records of the British Kings", not mentioned, so it is excluded. The C option says "It records the differences in life between Britain and France in the 11th century." It is not mentioned, so it is excluded. The D option says "It's pictures match other 11th-century documents," not mentioned, so it's excluded.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What do the speakers say about the condition of the tapestry?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Some of its parts are missing.</p><p>B. It has been restored to its original condition.</p><p>C. Some of the words on it have faded.</p><p>D. Identifying people on it has become difficult.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>"Student: Well, I know some pieces of it will probably lose. Professor: It is incomplete." So Option A is correct. The option B says "It was repaired to the initial state", not mentioned, so it is excluded. The C option says "Some handwriting has faded." The D option says "Difficult to identify the person above", not mentioned, so it is excluded.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor emphasize the bishop's role in the commissioning of the tapestry?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To acknowledge that the history of the tapestry is well-known.</p><p>B. To point out one of the weaknesses with using the tapestry as a historical document.</p><p>C. To explain why the tapestry has survived since the eleventh century.</p><p>D. To explain how tapestries were typically paid for in the eleventh century.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Emphasizing that the most intuitive manifestation is the speaker's repetition of an information point. The professor mentioned the commissioning of the tapestry twice. In order to illustrate that bishop is the half brother of the winner, he can tamper with the history in order to maintain the winner. Therefore, Option B is correct. The A option states that "in recognition of the history of tapestry", the professor in the dialogue considered that the history may have been tampered with, and was therefore excluded. The C option says "In order to explain that the tapestry survived since the 11th century", it is not mentioned, so it is excluded. The D option says "How did the tapestry be paid in order to explain the 11th century?"</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
