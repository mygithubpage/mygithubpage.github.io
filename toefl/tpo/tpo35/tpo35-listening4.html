            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.63" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to a <span class="underline">conversation</span> between a student and his European <span class="underline">History</span> Professor.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.93" data-time="6.63">[00:06.63]</span>Professor:So I <span class="underline">wanted</span> to talk about your <span class="underline">outline</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.75" data-time="9.56">[00:09.56]</span>I do like your topic:William, the conqueror, <span class="underline">leading</span> the Norman <span class="underline">invasion</span> of England. <span class="time" data-times="8.93" data-time="15.31">[00:15.31]</span>But I'm a little concerned about your <span class="underline">source</span> and the fact that you want to use it as the entire basis of your paper.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.61" data-time="24.24">[00:24.24]</span>Student: Really? The Bayeux tapestry? <span class="time" data-times="4.65" data-time="26.85">[00:26.85]</span>I thought it was <span class="underline">pretty</span> <span class="underline">creative</span> to use something that was made to hang on a wall as a <span class="underline">source</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.59" data-time="31.5">[00:31.50]</span>And as far as I know it's the most important <span class="underline">documentation</span> of the <span class="underline">invasion</span>, a first-hand <span class="underline">account</span>, right?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.96" data-time="38.09">[00:38.09]</span>Professor: Well, you are right. It's considered a <span class="underline">primary</span> <span class="underline">source</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.44" data-time="43.05">[00:43.05]</span>And at 70 meters long, the tapestry certainly is <span class="underline">impressive</span>. <span class="time" data-times="10.35" data-time="47.49">[00:47.49]</span>Imagine the time it took for those embroiderers to <span class="underline">sew</span> all those words and images to tell the story of the Norman forces sailing from France to England. <span class="time" data-times="11.59" data-time="57.84">[00:57.84]</span>So, yeah, it's an amazing <span class="underline">artifact</span>, but what's problematic is that the tapestry is a very <span class="underline">controversial</span> <span class="underline">source</span>. <span class="time" data-times="1.44" data-time="69.43">[01:09.43]</span>Were you <span class="underline">aware</span> of this?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.47" data-time="70.87">[01:10.87]</span>Student: Well, I know some pieces of it were probably lost.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.2" data-time="74.34">[01:14.34]</span>Professor: It is incomplete, but...</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.24" data-time="76.54">[01:16.54]</span>Student: But I also read that historians have relied on it to help <span class="underline">interpret</span> the events <span class="underline">leading</span> up to the <span class="underline">invasion</span> and the battle itself.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="13.03" data-time="86.78">[01:26.78]</span>Professor: Well, it has great historical value, no <span class="underline">doubt</span>, but in my opinion, there's a problem because...well...do you know who commissioned the tapestry?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.34" data-time="99.81">[01:39.81]</span>Student: It was a church <span class="underline">official</span>...um...the bishop of Bayeux, a city in France?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.48" data-time="108.15">[01:48.15]</span>Professor: Yes. And the bishop was also William the Conqueror's half-brother.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.51" data-time="113.63">[01:53.63]</span>Student: Oh! That I didn't know. <span class="time" data-times="8.67" data-time="116.14">[01:56.14]</span>But <span class="underline">regardless</span> of who commissioned it, isn't the fact that it was based on eye witness accounts the most important thing? <span class="time" data-times="3.48" data-time="124.81">[02:04.81]</span>I mean, it was made only 17 years after the battle. <span class="time" data-times="2.19" data-time="128.29">[02:08.29]</span>So plenty of eye witnesses were still alive.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.73" data-time="130.48">[02:10.48]</span>Professor: Yes, that's true. <span class="time" data-times="4.49" data-time="132.21">[02:12.21]</span>But the real point of the <span class="underline">controversy</span> isn't the battle itself. <span class="time" data-times="6.79" data-time="136.7">[02:16.70]</span>It has to do with the <span class="underline">reason</span> for the battle: who was the rightful <span class="underline">heir</span> to the throne? <span class="time" data-times="2.3" data-time="143.49">[02:23.49]</span>Who would be the next king? <span class="time" data-times="5.77" data-time="145.79">[02:25.79]</span>And if William the Conqueror's brother is the one who's commissioned this tapestry...</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.9" data-time="151.56">[02:31.56]</span>Student: Then he would be the one to decide which words and images would go on the tapestry and what would be left out.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.4" data-time="158.46">[02:38.46]</span>Professor:Exactly. So of <span class="underline">course</span> the tapestry shows why William should be the new king.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.96" data-time="164.86">[02:44.86]</span>Student:I guess I see your point. <span class="time" data-times="3.03" data-time="166.82">[02:46.82]</span>Embroiderers are just <span class="underline">gonna</span> do what they are told to do.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.3" data-time="169.85">[02:49.85]</span>Professor:You have to understand that the tapestry depicted an entire <span class="underline">series</span> of events as they were interpreted by the Normans, the victors of the battle. <span class="time" data-times="9.51" data-time="179.15">[02:59.15]</span>And that's a problem if you are trying to write objectively about the <span class="underline">invasion</span>, especially if you use it as your only <span class="underline">source</span> of information. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="188.66">[03:08.66]</span>After all, it's important for historians to examine an event from all sides.</p>
