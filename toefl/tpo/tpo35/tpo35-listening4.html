          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.93" data-time="6.63">[00:06.63]</span>Professor:So I <span class="highlight">wanted</span> to talk about your <span class="highlight">outline</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.75" data-time="9.56">[00:09.56]</span>I do like your topic:William, the conqueror, <span class="highlight">leading</span> the Norman <span class="highlight">invasion</span> of England. <span class="time" data-times="8.93" data-time="15.31">[00:15.31]</span>But I'm a little concerned about your <span class="highlight">source</span> and the fact that you want to use it as the entire basis of your paper.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.61" data-time="24.24">[00:24.24]</span>Student: Really? The Bayeux tapestry? <span class="time" data-times="4.65" data-time="26.85">[00:26.85]</span>I thought it was <span class="highlight">pretty</span> <span class="highlight">creative</span> to use something that was made to hang on a wall as a <span class="highlight">source</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.59" data-time="31.5">[00:31.50]</span>And as far as I know it's the most important <span class="highlight">documentation</span> of the <span class="highlight">invasion</span>, a first-hand <span class="highlight">account</span>, right?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.96" data-time="38.09">[00:38.09]</span>Professor: Well, you are right. It's considered a <span class="highlight">primary</span> <span class="highlight">source</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.44" data-time="43.05">[00:43.05]</span>And at 70 meters long, the tapestry certainly is <span class="highlight">impressive</span>. <span class="time" data-times="10.35" data-time="47.49">[00:47.49]</span>Imagine the time it took for those embroiderers to <span class="highlight">sew</span> all those words and images to tell the story of the Norman forces sailing from France to England. <span class="time" data-times="11.59" data-time="57.84">[00:57.84]</span>So, yeah, it's an amazing <span class="highlight">artifact</span>, but what's problematic is that the tapestry is a very <span class="highlight">controversial</span> <span class="highlight">source</span>. <span class="time" data-times="1.44" data-time="69.43">[01:09.43]</span>Were you <span class="highlight">aware</span> of this?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.47" data-time="70.87">[01:10.87]</span>Student: Well, I know some pieces of it were probably lost.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.2" data-time="74.34">[01:14.34]</span>Professor: It is incomplete, but...</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="10.24" data-time="76.54">[01:16.54]</span>Student: But I also read that historians have relied on it to help <span class="highlight">interpret</span> the events <span class="highlight">leading</span> up to the <span class="highlight">invasion</span> and the battle itself.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="13.03" data-time="86.78">[01:26.78]</span>Professor: Well, it has great historical value, no <span class="highlight">doubt</span>, but in my opinion, there's a problem because...well...do you know who commissioned the tapestry?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="8.34" data-time="99.81">[01:39.81]</span>Student: It was a church <span class="highlight">official</span>...um...the bishop of Bayeux, a city in France?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.48" data-time="108.15">[01:48.15]</span>Professor: Yes. And the bishop was also William the Conqueror's half-brother.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.51" data-time="113.63">[01:53.63]</span>Student: Oh! That I didn't know. <span class="time" data-times="8.67" data-time="116.14">[01:56.14]</span>But <span class="highlight">regardless</span> of who commissioned it, isn't the fact that it was based on eye witness accounts the most important thing? <span class="time" data-times="3.48" data-time="124.81">[02:04.81]</span>I mean, it was made only 17 years after the battle. <span class="time" data-times="2.19" data-time="128.29">[02:08.29]</span>So plenty of eye witnesses were still alive.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.73" data-time="130.48">[02:10.48]</span>Professor: Yes, that's true. <span class="time" data-times="4.49" data-time="132.21">[02:12.21]</span>But the real point of the <span class="highlight">controversy</span> isn't the battle itself. <span class="time" data-times="6.79" data-time="136.7">[02:16.70]</span>It has to do with the <span class="highlight">reason</span> for the battle: who was the rightful <span class="highlight">heir</span> to the throne? <span class="time" data-times="2.3" data-time="143.49">[02:23.49]</span>Who would be the next king? <span class="time" data-times="5.77" data-time="145.79">[02:25.79]</span>And if William the Conqueror's brother is the one who's commissioned this tapestry...</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.9" data-time="151.56">[02:31.56]</span>Student: Then he would be the one to decide which words and images would go on the tapestry and what would be left out.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.4" data-time="158.46">[02:38.46]</span>Professor:Exactly. So of <span class="highlight">course</span> the tapestry shows why William should be the new king.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.96" data-time="164.86">[02:44.86]</span>Student:I guess I see your point. <span class="time" data-times="3.03" data-time="166.82">[02:46.82]</span>Embroiderers are just <span class="highlight">gonna</span> do what they are told to do.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="9.3" data-time="169.85">[02:49.85]</span>Professor:You have to understand that the tapestry depicted an entire <span class="highlight">series</span> of events as they were interpreted by the Normans, the victors of the battle. <span class="time" data-times="9.51" data-time="179.15">[02:59.15]</span>And that's a problem if you are trying to write objectively about the <span class="highlight">invasion</span>, especially if you use it as your only <span class="highlight">source</span> of information. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="188.66">[03:08.66]</span>After all, it's important for historians to examine an event from all sides.</p>

I do like your topic, William the conqueror, leading the Norman invasion of England, but...I'm a little concerned about your source, and the fact that you want to use "It as the entire basis of your paper." The professor asked the students to discuss his outline and the accuracy of the reference materials. Therefore, option D is correct. The A option says "For the purpose of reviewing the contents of the previous lesson," it was not mentioned, so it was excluded. The B option says "In order to introduce the necessary resources for the operation", it is not mentioned, so it is excluded. The C option says "In order to give the student an outline step", not mentioned, it is excluded.</p>

              <p>"but...I'm a little concerned about your source, and the fact that you want to use it as the entire basis of your paper." Professors are more worried that students consider tapestry as primary reference material, To the bad point of this material, Option C is correct. A option says "needs for a clearer topic", not mentioned, so rule out.</p>
              <p>Option B says "need to include specific examples", not mentioned, so rule out. The D option says "Needs to be better organized", not mentioned, so ruled out.</p>

The A option says "It contains the earliest records of the British Kings", not mentioned, so it is excluded. The C option says "It records the differences in life between Britain and France in the 11th century." It is not mentioned, so it is excluded.

              <p>Emphasizing that the most intuitive manifestation is the speaker's repetition of an information point. The professor mentioned the commissioning of the tapestry twice. In order to illustrate that bishop is the half brother of the winner, he can tamper with the history in order to maintain the winner. Therefore, Option B is correct. The A option states that "in recognition of the history of tapestry", the professor in the dialogue considered that the history may have been tampered with, and was therefore excluded. The C option says "In order to explain that the tapestry survived since the 11th century", it is not mentioned, so it is excluded. The D option says "How did the tapestry be paid in order to explain the 11th century?"</p>
