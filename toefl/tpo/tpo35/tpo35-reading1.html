            <b>Earth’s Age</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>One of the first recorded observers to <span class="underline">surmise</span> a long age for Earth was the Greek historian Herodotus, who lived from <span class="underline">approximately</span> 480 B.C. to 425 B.C. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> He observed that the Nile River Delta was in fact a <span class="underline">series</span> of <span class="underline">sediment</span> deposits built up in <span class="underline">successive</span> floods. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> By noting that <span class="underline">individual</span> floods <span class="underline">deposit</span> only thin layers of <span class="underline">sediment</span>, he was able to <span class="underline">conclude</span> that the Nile Delta had taken many thousands of years to build up. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>More important than the <span class="underline">amount</span> of time Herodotus computed, which turns out to be <span class="light"><span class="underline">trivial</span></span> compared with the age of Earth, was the <span class="underline">notion</span> that one could <span class="underline">estimate</span> ages of geologic features by determining rates of the processes <span class="underline">responsible</span> for such features, and then assuming the rates to be <span class="underline">roughly</span> <span class="underline">constant</span> over time. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span> <span class="underline">Similar</span> applications of this <span class="underline">concept</span> were to be used again and again in later centuries to <span class="underline">estimate</span> the ages of rock formations and, in <span class="underline">particular</span>, of layers of <span class="underline">sediment</span> that had compacted and cemented to form <span class="underline">sedimentary</span> rocks.</p>
          <p>It was not until the seventeenth <span class="underline">century</span> that attempts were made again to understand clues to Earth's <span class="underline">history</span> <span class="underline">through</span> the rock <span class="underline">record</span>. Nicolaus Steno (1638-1686) was the first to work out principles of the <span class="underline">progressive</span> depositing of <span class="underline">sediment</span> in Tuscany. However, James Hutton (1726-1797), known as the founder of modern <span class="underline">geology</span>, was the first to have the important <span class="underline">insight</span> that geologic processes are cyclic in nature. Forces <span class="underline">associated</span> with <span class="underline">subterranean</span> heat cause land to be uplifted into plateaus and mountain ranges. The effects of wind and water then <span class="underline">break</span> down the masses of uplifted rock, producing <span class="underline">sediment</span> that is transported by water <span class="underline">downward</span> to <span class="underline">ultimately</span> form layers in lakes, seashores, or <span class="underline">even</span> oceans. Over time, the layers become <span class="underline">sedimentary</span> rock. These rocks are then uplifted sometime in the future to form new mountain ranges, which <span class="underline">exhibit</span> the <span class="underline">sedimentary</span> layers (and the remains of life <span class="underline">within</span> those layers) of the earlier episodes of <span class="underline">erosion</span> and <span class="underline">deposition</span>.</p>
          <p>Hutton's <span class="underline">concept</span> represented a <span class="underline">remarkable</span> <span class="underline">insight</span> because it unified many <span class="underline">individual</span> phenomena and observations into a conceptual picture of Earth's <span class="underline">history</span>. With the further <span class="underline">assumption</span> that these geologic processes were generally no more or less <span class="underline">vigorous</span> than they are today, Hutton's examination of <span class="underline">sedimentary</span> layers led him to realize that Earth's <span class="underline">history</span> must be <span class="underline">enormous</span>, that geologic time is an abyss and human <span class="underline">history</span> a speck by <span class="underline">comparison</span>.</p>
          <p>After Hutton, geologists tried to <span class="underline">determine</span> rates of <span class="underline">sedimentation</span> so as to <span class="underline">estimate</span> the age of Earth from the total length of the <span class="underline">sedimentary</span> or stratigraphic <span class="underline">record</span>. <span class="underline">Typical</span> numbers produced at the turn of the twentieth <span class="underline">century</span> were 100 million to 400 million years. These underestimated the actual age by factors of 10 to 50 because much of the <span class="underline">sedimentary</span> <span class="underline">record</span> is missing in various locations and because there is a long rock <span class="underline">sequence</span> that is older than half a billion years that is far less well defined in terms of fossils and less well preserved.</p>
          <p>Various other techniques to <span class="underline">estimate</span> Earth's age fell short, and particularly <span class="underline">noteworthy</span> in this regard were flawed determinations of the Sun's age. It had been recognized by the German <span class="underline">philosopher</span> Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) that chemical reactions could not <span class="underline">supply</span> the <span class="underline">tremendous</span> <span class="underline">amount</span> of energy flowing from the Sun for more than about a <span class="underline">millennium</span>. Two physicists during the nineteenth <span class="underline">century</span> both came up with ages for the Sun based on the Sun's energy coming from <span class="underline">gravitational</span> contraction. Under the force of <span class="underline">gravity</span>, the compression resulting from a <span class="underline">collapse</span> of the object must <span class="underline">release</span> energy. Ages for Earth were derived that were in the tens of millions of years, much less than the geologic estimates of the <span class="underline">lime</span>.</p>
          <p>It was the discovery of radioactivity at the end of the nineteenth <span class="underline">century</span> that opened the door to determining both the Sun's energy <span class="underline">source</span> and the age of Earth. From the <span class="underline">initial</span> work came a suite of discoveries <span class="underline">leading</span> to radio <span class="underline">isotopic</span> dating, which quickly ted to the <span class="underline">realization</span> that Earth must be billions of years old, and to the discovery of nuclear <span class="underline">fusion</span> as an energy <span class="underline">source</span> <span class="underline">capable</span> of sustaining the Sun's <span class="underline">luminosity</span> for that <span class="underline">amount</span> of time. By the 1960s, both <span class="underline">analysis</span> of meteorites and refinements of <span class="underline">solar</span> <span class="underline">evolution</span> models converged on an age for the <span class="underline">solar</span> system, and hence for Earth, of 4 5 billion years.</p>
