          <h4 class="w3-center">Earthï¿½s Age</h4>
          <p>One of the first recorded observers to <span class="highlight">surmise</span> a long age for Earth was the Greek historian Herodotus, who lived from <span class="highlight">approximately</span> 480 B.C. to 425 B.C. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> He observed that the Nile River Delta was in fact a <span class="highlight">series</span> of <span class="highlight">sediment</span> deposits built up in <span class="highlight">successive</span> floods. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> By noting that <span class="highlight">individual</span> floods <span class="highlight">deposit</span> only thin layers of <span class="highlight">sediment</span>, he was able to <span class="highlight">conclude</span> that the Nile Delta had taken many thousands of years to build up. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>More important than the <span class="highlight">amount</span> of time Herodotus computed, which turns out to be <span class="highlight question1">trivial</span> compared with the age of Earth, was the <span class="highlight">notion</span> that one could <span class="highlight">estimate</span> ages of geologic features by determining rates of the processes <span class="highlight">responsible</span> for such features, and then assuming the rates to be <span class="highlight">roughly</span> <span class="highlight">constant</span> over time. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span> <span class="highlight">Similar</span> applications of this <span class="highlight">concept</span> were to be used again and again in later centuries to <span class="highlight">estimate</span> the ages of rock formations and, in <span class="highlight">particular</span>, of layers of <span class="highlight">sediment</span> that had compacted and cemented to form <span class="highlight">sedimentary</span> rocks.</p>
          <p>It was not until the seventeenth <span class="highlight">century</span> that attempts were made again to understand clues to Earth's <span class="highlight">history</span> <span class="highlight">through</span> the rock <span class="highlight">record</span>. Nicolaus Steno (1638-1686) was the first to work out principles of the <span class="highlight">progressive</span> depositing of <span class="highlight">sediment</span> in Tuscany. However, James Hutton (1726-1797), known as the founder of modern <span class="highlight">geology</span>, was the first to have the important <span class="highlight">insight</span> that geologic processes are cyclic in nature. Forces <span class="highlight">associated</span> with <span class="highlight">subterranean</span> heat cause land to be uplifted into plateaus and mountain ranges. The effects of wind and water then <span class="highlight">break</span> down the masses of uplifted rock, producing <span class="highlight">sediment</span> that is transported by water <span class="highlight">downward</span> to <span class="highlight">ultimately</span> form layers in lakes, seashores, or <span class="highlight">even</span> oceans. Over time, the layers become <span class="highlight">sedimentary</span> rock. These rocks are then uplifted sometime in the future to form new mountain ranges, which <span class="highlight"><span class="question4">exhibit</span></span> the <span class="highlight">sedimentary</span> layers (and the remains of life <span class="highlight">within</span> those layers) of the earlier <span class="question5">episodes</span> of <span class="highlight">erosion</span> and <span class="highlight">deposition</span>.</p>
          <p>Hutton's <span class="highlight">concept</span> represented a <span class="highlight">remarkable</span> <span class="highlight">insight</span> because it unified many <span class="highlight">individual</span> phenomena and observations into a conceptual picture of Earth's <span class="highlight">history</span>. <span class="question6">With the further <span class="highlight">assumption</span> that these geologic processes were generally no more or less <span class="highlight">vigorous</span> than they are today, Hutton's examination of <span class="highlight">sedimentary</span> layers led him to realize that Earth's <span class="highlight">history</span> must be <span class="highlight">enormous</span>, that geologic time is an abyss and human <span class="highlight">history</span> a speck by <span class="highlight">comparison</span>.</span></p>
          <p>After Hutton, geologists tried to <span class="highlight">determine</span> rates of <span class="highlight">sedimentation</span> so as to <span class="highlight">estimate</span> the age of Earth from the total length of the <span class="highlight">sedimentary</span> or stratigraphic <span class="highlight">record</span>. <span class="highlight">Typical</span> numbers produced at the turn of the twentieth <span class="highlight">century</span> were 100 million to 400 million years. These underestimated the actual age by factors of 10 to 50 because much of the <span class="highlight">sedimentary</span> <span class="highlight">record</span> is missing in various locations and because there is a long rock <span class="highlight">sequence</span> that is older than half a billion years that is far less well defined in terms of fossils and less well preserved.</p>
          <p>Various other techniques to <span class="highlight">estimate</span> Earth's age fell short, and particularly <span class="highlight">noteworthy</span> in this regard were <span class="question8">flawed</span> determinations of the Sun's age. It had been recognized by the German <span class="highlight">philosopher</span> Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) that chemical reactions could not <span class="highlight">supply</span> the <span class="highlight">tremendous</span> <span class="highlight">amount</span> of energy flowing from the Sun for more than about a <span class="highlight">millennium</span>. Two physicists during the nineteenth <span class="highlight">century</span> both came up with ages for the Sun based on the Sun's energy coming from <span class="question9"><span class="highlight">gravitational</span> contraction.</span> Under the force of <span class="highlight">gravity</span>, the compression resulting from a <span class="highlight">collapse</span> of the object must <span class="highlight">release</span> energy. Ages for Earth were derived that were in the tens of millions of years, much less than the geologic estimates of the <span class="highlight">lime</span>.</p>
          <p>It was the discovery of radioactivity at the end of the nineteenth <span class="highlight">century</span> that opened the door to determining both the Sun's energy <span class="highlight">source</span> and the age of Earth. From the <span class="highlight">initial</span> work came a suite of discoveries <span class="highlight">leading</span> to radio <span class="highlight">isotopic</span> dating, which quickly ted to the <span class="highlight">realization</span> that Earth must be billions of years old, and to the discovery of nuclear <span class="highlight">fusion</span> as an energy <span class="highlight">source</span> <span class="highlight">capable</span> of sustaining the Sun's <span class="highlight">luminosity</span> for that <span class="highlight">amount</span> of time. By the 1960s, both <span class="highlight">analysis</span> of meteorites and refinements of <span class="highlight">solar</span> <span class="highlight">evolution</span> models converged on an age for the <span class="highlight">solar</span> system, and hence for Earth, of 4 5 billion years.</p>

This sentence roughly means that the Herodotus person's calculated amount of time is trivial compared to the age of the Earth. What's more important is a concept. The concept is that one can estimate the age of geographic features by estimating the speed of a certain process of the corresponding geographic features... Then use Herodotus as a key to locate this time and find the third sentence of this paragraph. It was found that he was speculating that Nile Delta had taken thousands of years to form. According to common sense, we know that the age of a delta cannot be compared with the ancient world and is much smaller than the age of the earth.

              <p>Let's look at the question: Why is the Herodotus person's observation of the delta important? Grab keywords Herodotus, Delta and significant back to the original paragraph positioning. The fourth sentence of the first paragraph, which is the sentence we analyzed in the first question, shows the three keywords at the same time. It requires the examinee to pay attention to the fact that the significant does not appear as it is, but is replaced by the important synonym. Candidates in the keyword positioning do not only look at the words appearing in the title, should pay attention to the place where the synonymous substitution occurs in the original text, which is often the answer. Once again reviewing the meaning of the next sentence, this time we shaved off the modified clause and directly grabbed the trunk: More important than the amount of time Herodotus computed, was the notion. Compared with the value calculated by Herodotus, there is a concept more important. Looking further, what is this notion? One can estimate ages of geologic features features by determining rates of the processes responsible for such features, and then assuming the rates to be roughly constant time. This sentence roughly means that one person can estimate the age of geographical features through some methods. After understanding the original to this level, we return to the topic and look at the four options: A provides a specific record of what? There is nothing in this sentence, Excluded; B found an age for calculating geographic features, right; C It is inferred that this delta is as old as the earth and nonsense; D speculates when the river is flooding and the original sentence is not mentioned. Select B.</p>

This sentence roughly means that according to a more in-depth hypothesis (this hypothesis is that these geological activities were as active as they are today), Hutton's examination of the subsidence caused him to discover a fact. The fact is that compared with human history, the history of the earth is immense. The logical relationship of this sentence is that the first half of the sentence assumption is Hutton realize understand this level, we return to see the title, A Hutton realized that if the activity of the geological activity has been in line with the present, then the history of the earth is far longer than human history. This option can be. B Hutton's examination of the subsidence layer led him to a conclusion that in the long history of the earth, the geological process used to be the same today, the conditions were reversed, and no choice was made; C Although Hutton contributed to understanding the address process Our understanding of the history of the earth is far less than the understanding of human history. This option gives birth to a concession; D Hutton is very active in the examination of sediments. His conclusion is very important in the history of human beings. This option has nothing to do with it. , do not choose. So A is correct.</p>

              <p>This question requires us to look at the options in turn. The A option refers to Herodotus measuring the age of the earth through sedimentary layers, and the modern Steno and Hutton to measure the age of the earth through geological processes. This option summarizes the main ideas of the first and second paragraphs, correctly; the B option locates the fifth paragraph according to Kant. However, Kant's sentence only stated that the chemical reaction was not enough to power the Sun. There was no mention in the option. It was nothing but the election. The C option was about the role of radioactivity and summarized the main contents of the sixth paragraph. , elected; D options according to Hutton found the effects of wind and water then break down the masses of uplifted rock, producing sediment that is transported by water downward to ultimately form layers in lakes, seashores, or even oceans. However, the details are not summarized, and they are not selected. The E option says that the early estimation of the age of the earth based on geological activities is inaccurate, and the subsequent estimation based on the sun is also underestimated. Corresponding to paragraph 1256 of this paper, it is a general conclusion. The option says that scientists have discovered that the solar system is at least 1 billion years old, out of nothing, and not chosen.</p>
