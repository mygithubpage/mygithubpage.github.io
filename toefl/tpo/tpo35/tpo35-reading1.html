Nicolaus Steno (1638-1686) was the first to work out principles of the <span class="highlight">progressive</span> depositing of <span class="highlight">sediment</span> in Tuscany. However, James Hutton (1726-1797), known as the founder of modern <span class="highlight">geology</span>, was the first to have the important <span class="highlight">insight</span> that geologic processes are cyclic in nature. Forces <span class="highlight">associated</span> with <span class="highlight">subterranean</span> heat cause land to be uplifted into plateaus and mountain ranges. The effects of wind and water then <span class="highlight">break</span> down the masses of uplifted rock, producing <span class="highlight">sediment</span> that is transported by water <span class="highlight">downward</span> to <span class="highlight">ultimately</span> form layers in lakes, seashores, or <span class="highlight">even</span> oceans. Over time, the layers become <span class="highlight">sedimentary</span> rock. These rocks are then uplifted sometime in the future to form new mountain ranges, which <span class="highlight"><span class="question4">exhibit</span></span>the <span class="highlight">sedimentary</span> layers (and the remains of life <span class="highlight">within</span> those layers) of the earlier <span class="question5">episodes </span>of <span class="highlight">erosion</span> and <span class="highlight">deposition</span>.</p><p>Hutton's <span class="highlight">concept</span> represented a <span class="highlight">remarkable</span><span class="highlight">insight</span> because it unified many <span class="highlight">individual</span> phenomena and observations into a conceptual picture of Earth's <span class="highlight">history</span>. <span class="question6">With the further <span class="highlight">assumption</span> that these geologic processes were generally no more or less <span class="highlight">vigorous</span> than they are today, Hutton's examination of <span class="highlight">sedimentary</span> layers led him to realize that Earth's <span class="highlight">history</span> must be <span class="highlight">enormous</span>, that geologic time is an abyss and human <span class="highlight">history</span> a speck by <span class="highlight">comparison</span>.</span></p><p>After Hutton, geologists tried to <span class="highlight">determine</span> rates of <span class="highlight">sedimentation</span> so as to <span class="highlight">estimate</span> the age of Earth from the total length of the <span class="highlight">sedimentary</span> or stratigraphic <span class="highlight">record</span>. <span class="highlight">Typical</span> numbers produced at the turn of the twentieth <span class="highlight">century</span> were 100 million to 400 million years. These underestimated the actual age by factors of 10 to 50 because much of the <span class="highlight">sedimentary</span><span class="highlight">record</span> is missing in various locations and because there is a long rock <span class="highlight">sequence</span> that is older than half a billion years that is far less well defined in terms of fossils and less well preserved.</p><p>Various other techniques to <span class="highlight">estimate</span> Earth's age fell short, and particularly <span class="highlight">noteworthy</span> in this regard were <span class="question8">flawed </span>determinations of the Sun's age. It had been recognized by the German <span class="highlight">philosopher</span> Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) that chemical reactions could not <span class="highlight">supply</span> the <span class="highlight">tremendous</span><span class="highlight">amount</span> of energy flowing from the Sun for more than about a <span class="highlight">millennium</span>. Two physicists during the nineteenth <span class="highlight">century</span> both came up with ages for the Sun based on the Sun's energy coming from <span class="highlight"><span class="question9">gravitational</span> contraction. </span>Under the force of <span class="highlight">gravity</span>, the compression resulting from a <span class="highlight">collapse</span> of the object must <span class="highlight">release</span> energy. Ages for Earth were derived that were in the tens of millions of years, much less than the geologic estimates of the <span class="highlight">lime</span>.</p><p>It was the discovery of radioactivity at the end of the nineteenth <span class="highlight">century</span> that opened the door to determining both the Sun's energy <span class="highlight">source</span> and the age of Earth. From the <span class="highlight">initial</span> work came a suite of discoveries <span class="highlight">leading</span> to radio <span class="highlight">isotopic</span> dating, which quickly ted to the <span class="highlight">realization</span> that Earth must be billions of years old, and to the discovery of nuclear <span class="highlight">fusion</span> as an energy <span class="highlight">source</span><span class="highlight">capable</span> of sustaining the Sun's <span class="highlight">luminosity</span> for that <span class="highlight">amount</span> of time. By the 1960s, both <span class="highlight">analysis</span> of meteorites and refinements of <span class="highlight">solar</span><span class="highlight">evolution</span> models converged on an age for the <span class="highlight">solar</span> system, and hence for Earth, of 4 5 billion years.</p></article></div><div id="question"><div id="question1"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">trivial</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p><label class="my-label"><span>A. similar</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><label class="my-label"><span>B. inaccurate</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><label class="my-label"><span>C. small</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><label class="my-label"><span>D. significant</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><p><span>Answer: </span><span class="my-answer">C</span></p></div><div id="question2"><p>According to paragraph 1, Herodotus' observations of the Nile River Delta were significant because they allowed him to</p><label class="my-label"><span>A. provide detailed records of the most significant floods in the history of the Nile</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><label class="my-label"><span>B. develop a way of calculating the age of geologic features</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><label class="my-label"><span>C. conclude that the Nile River Delta was as old as Earth</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><label class="my-label"><span>D. predict when the river would flood and when it would not</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><p><span>Answer: </span><span class="my-answer">B</span></p></div><div id="question3"><p>According to paragraph 2, James Hutton was the first person to</p><label class="my-label"><span>A. understand clues to Earth's history through the rock record.</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><label class="my-label"><span>B. work out principles of the progressive depositing of sediment.</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><label class="my-label"><span>C. realize that geologic processes happen in cycles.</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><label class="my-label"><span>D. describe the forces associated with subterranean heat.</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><p><span>Answer: </span><span class="my-answer">C</span></p></div><div id="question4"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">exhibit</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p><label class="my-label"><span>A. replace</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><label class="my-label"><span>B. show</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><label class="my-label"><span>C. cover</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><label class="my-label"><span>D. expand</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><p><span>Answer: </span><span class="my-answer">B</span></p></div><div id="question5"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">episodes</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p><label class="my-label"><span>A. occurrence</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><label class="my-label"><span>B. locations</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><label class="my-label"><span>C. effects</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><label class="my-label"><span>D. combinations</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><p><span>Answer: </span><span class="my-answer">A</span></p></div><div id="question6"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage?
