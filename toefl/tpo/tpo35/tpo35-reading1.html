Nicolaus Steno (1638-1686) was the first to work out principles of the <span class="highlight">progressive</span> depositing of <span class="highlight">sediment</span> in Tuscany. However, James Hutton (1726-1797), known as the founder of modern <span class="highlight">geology</span>, was the first to have the important <span class="highlight">insight</span> that geologic processes are cyclic in nature. Forces <span class="highlight">associated</span> with <span class="highlight">subterranean</span> heat cause land to be uplifted into plateaus and mountain ranges. The effects of wind and water then <span class="highlight">break</span> down the masses of uplifted rock, producing <span class="highlight">sediment</span> that is transported by water <span class="highlight">downward</span> to <span class="highlight">ultimately</span> form layers in lakes, seashores, or <span class="highlight">even</span> oceans. Over time, the layers become <span class="highlight">sedimentary</span> rock. These rocks are then uplifted sometime in the future to form new mountain ranges, which <span class="highlight"><span class="question4">exhibit</span></span> the <span class="highlight">sedimentary</span> layers (and the remains of life <span class="highlight">within</span> those layers) of the earlier <span class="question5">episodes</span> of <span class="highlight">erosion</span> and <span class="highlight">deposition</span>.</p><p>Hutton's <span class="highlight">concept</span> represented a <span class="highlight">remarkable</span><span class="highlight">insight</span> because it unified many <span class="highlight">individual</span> phenomena and observations into a conceptual picture of Earth's <span class="highlight">history</span>. <span class="question6">With the further <span class="highlight">assumption</span> that these geologic processes were generally no more or less <span class="highlight">vigorous</span> than they are today, Hutton's examination of <span class="highlight">sedimentary</span> layers led him to realize that Earth's <span class="highlight">history</span> must be <span class="highlight">enormous</span>, that geologic time is an abyss and human <span class="highlight">history</span> a speck by <span class="highlight">comparison</span>.</span></p><p>After Hutton, geologists tried to <span class="highlight">determine</span> rates of <span class="highlight">sedimentation</span> so as to <span class="highlight">estimate</span> the age of Earth from the total length of the <span class="highlight">sedimentary</span> or stratigraphic <span class="highlight">record</span>. <span class="highlight">Typical</span> numbers produced at the turn of the twentieth <span class="highlight">century</span> were 100 million to 400 million years. These underestimated the actual age by factors of 10 to 50 because much of the <span class="highlight">sedimentary</span><span class="highlight">record</span> is missing in various locations and because there is a long rock <span class="highlight">sequence</span> that is older than half a billion years that is far less well defined in terms of fossils and less well preserved.</p><p>Various other techniques to <span class="highlight">estimate</span> Earth's age fell short, and particularly <span class="highlight">noteworthy</span> in this regard were <span class="question8">flawed</span> determinations of the Sun's age. It had been recognized by the German <span class="highlight">philosopher</span> Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) that chemical reactions could not <span class="highlight">supply</span> the <span class="highlight">tremendous</span><span class="highlight">amount</span> of energy flowing from the Sun for more than about a <span class="highlight">millennium</span>. Two physicists during the nineteenth <span class="highlight">century</span> both came up with ages for the Sun based on the Sun's energy coming from <span class="question9"><span class="highlight">gravitational</span> contraction.</span> Under the force of <span class="highlight">gravity</span>, the compression resulting from a <span class="highlight">collapse</span> of the object must <span class="highlight">release</span> energy. Ages for Earth were derived that were in the tens of millions of years, much less than the geologic estimates of the <span class="highlight">lime</span>.</p><p>It was the discovery of radioactivity at the end of the nineteenth <span class="highlight">century</span> that opened the door to determining both the Sun's energy <span class="highlight">source</span> and the age of Earth. From the <span class="highlight">initial</span> work came a suite of discoveries <span class="highlight">leading</span> to radio <span class="highlight">isotopic</span> dating, which quickly ted to the <span class="highlight">realization</span> that Earth must be billions of years old, and to the discovery of nuclear <span class="highlight">fusion</span> as an energy <span class="highlight">source</span><span class="highlight">capable</span> of sustaining the Sun's <span class="highlight">luminosity</span> for that <span class="highlight">amount</span> of time. By the 1960s, both <span class="highlight">analysis</span> of meteorites and refinements of <span class="highlight">solar</span><span class="highlight">evolution</span> models converged on an age for the <span class="highlight">solar</span> system, and hence for Earth, of 4 5 billion years.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">trivial</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. similar</p><p>B. inaccurate</p><p>C. small</p><p>D. significant</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The title is a vocabulary title, according to the given word trivial to the first paragraph More important than the amount of time Herodotus computed, which turns out to be trivial compared with the age of Earth, was the notion that one could estimate ages of geologic features by The term rates of the processes responsible for such features, and then assuming the rates to be roughly constant time. This sentence roughly means that the Herodotus person's calculated amount of time is trivial compared to the age of the Earth. What's more important is a concept. The concept is that one can estimate the age of geographic features by estimating the speed of a certain process of the corresponding geographic features... Then use Herodotus as a key to locate this time and find the third sentence of this paragraph. It was found that he was speculating that Nile Delta had taken thousands of years to form. According to common sense, we know that the age of a delta cannot be compared with the ancient world and is much smaller than the age of the earth.

Grab keywords Herodotus, Delta and significant back to the original paragraph positioning. The fourth sentence of the first paragraph, which is the sentence we analyzed in the first question, shows the three keywords at the same time. It requires the examinee to pay attention to the fact that the significant does not appear as it is, but is replaced by the important synonym. Candidates in the keyword positioning do not only look at the words appearing in the title, should pay attention to the place where the synonymous substitution occurs in the original text, which is often the answer. Once again reviewing the meaning of the next sentence, this time we shaved off the modified clause and directly grabbed the trunk: More important than the amount of time Herodotus computed, was the notion. Compared with the value calculated by Herodotus, there is a concept more important. Looking further, what is this notion? One can estimate ages of geologic features features by determining rates of the processes responsible for such features, and then assuming the rates to be roughly constant time. This sentence roughly means that one person can estimate the age of geographical features through some methods. After understanding the original to this level, we return to the topic and look at the four options: A provides a specific record of what? There is nothing in this sentence, Excluded; B found an age for calculating geographic features, right; C It is inferred that this delta is as old as the earth and nonsense; D speculates when the river is flooding and the original sentence is not mentioned.

In spite of Hutton's contributions to the understanding of geologic processes, what is known about Earth's history is minor compared with what is known about human history.</p><p>D. Hutton's examination of sedimentary layers was quite vigorous for his day, and his conclusions about geologic processes are among the most significant in human history.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>This question is a conversion sentence. Let's look at the target sentence in the original text: With the further assumption that these geologic processes were generally no more or less shaking than they are today, Hutton's examination of evaporated layers led him to realize that Earth's history must be enormous, that geologic time is an The term "abyss and human history a speck by comparison." This sentence roughly means that according to a more in-depth hypothesis (this hypothesis is that these geological activities were as active as they are today), Hutton's examination of the subsidence caused him to discover a fact. The fact is that compared with human history, the history of the earth is immense. The logical relationship of this sentence is that the first half of the sentence assumption is Hutton realize understand this level, we return to see the title, A Hutton realized that if the activity of the geological activity has been in line with the present, then the history of the earth is far longer than human history. This option can be. B Hutton's examination of the subsidence layer led him to a conclusion that in the long history of the earth, the geological process used to be the same today, the conditions were reversed, and no choice was made; C Although Hutton contributed to understanding the address process Our understanding of the history of the earth is far less than the understanding of human history. This option gives birth to a concession; D Hutton is very active in the examination of sediments. His conclusion is very important in the history of human beings.

This sentence and the following Means: The data calculated in the 20th century is 10 million to 40 million years old, but this data is underestimated because some sedimentary records are lost. Option A means that they have underestimated the age of the Earth because they neglected Hutton's discovery. The cause and effect relationship is wrong. The B option says that they can estimate the exact age of the Earth by using sedimentary records. The exact word is wrong. C is the original text.

The sentence is: two physicists In the 19th century, the age of the sun was calculated based on the amount of solar energy coming from the gravitational contraction. We can conclude that this paragraph mainly deals with the use of various methods to measure the age of the Earth, according to the sentence "Various other techniques to estimate Earth's age fell short, and particularly noteworthy in this regard were <span class="question8">flawed</span> determinations of the Sun's age." By combining the two sentences, it is inferred that the author's intention is to indicate that the age of the earth can be estimated by estimating the age of the sun. D correct. A is that the problem of the age of the earth is as interesting as the source of solar energy. It is said that Hutton's ideas have contributed to the advancement of physics astronomy and geography.

According to this person's name, it was been recognized by the German philosopher Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) that it could not supply the tremendous amount of energy flowing from the Sun for more than about. a millennium. The implication of this sentence is that Immanuel Kant discovered that the chemical reaction was not sufficient to provide the energy emitted from the sun for thousands of years. A option is the synonymous statement of this sentence, correct; B option is said that solar energy comes from the gravity generated by the extrusion, has nothing to do with this sentence; C is that most of the solar energy is provided by the chemical reaction, inconsistent with the original sentence, the original The sentence mainly means that the chemical reaction is not enough to provide the sun's energy; D means that the amount of solar energy is necessary for the chemical reaction on earth, and it is out of nothing.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 6, which of the following is NOT true about scientists most recent estimate of Earth's age?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.
