          <p>I think it's a great idea for my friend to take a year off to travel before university. Well, the first benefit that I can come up with is that it's a good way for one to get to know him/herself so that, you know, so that one can easily know who they are or what they really need to pursue before going to college. While the second benefit is to get to enjoy the outlandish experiences they probably won't be able to have when they are in college.Student's life is hectic, they are busy with their study, social life and lots of other stuff, it's really difficult for them to get something out of their schedule. I guess that's why I strongly recommend my friend travel before university.</p>
