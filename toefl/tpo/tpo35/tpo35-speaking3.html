          <h4 class="w3-center">University Should Allow Students to Audit Classes</h4>
          <p>Many universities allow students to audit classes. That is, students may attend lectures and discussions for a particular class without completing the assignments, receiving a grade, or earning credit for the class. I think our university should allow this. Auditing classes would be good for interested students, since they would be able to learn more and experience a variety of different classes that they would not otherwise be able to take. Furthermore, it shouldn't create ant difficulties or additional obligations for professors, because these students wouldn't take tests or white papers that need to be graded. </p>
          <p>Sincerely, </p>

          <p>Now listen to two students discussing the latter.</p>
          <p>Man: Did you see this letter Molly.</p>
          <p>Woman: Yeah but I don't agree with him.</p>
          <p>Man: Why not.</p>
          <p>Woman: Well it might have some educational benefit for the people doing it but overall for the other students who are actually taking the classes it wouldn't be good.</p>
          <p>Man: How come.</p>
          <p>Woman: Because anyone who is taking the class for a grade a for credit puts in a lot of time preparing for it doing the reading assignments wears people who aren't they might not be as well prepared and that would affect the quality of the class discussion.</p>
          <p>Man: You mean discussions wouldn't be a very high level.</p>
          <p>Woman: Right because people who aren't taking the class for grade would be asking really basic questions they'll be slowing down the class discussion by taking time to discuss basic stuff.</p>
          <p>Man: That was already covered in the reading assignments it's good point I can see how that might happen.</p>
          <p>Woman: Plus he's wrong about the work it requires for the professor.</p>
          <p>Man: But it's true professor doesn't have to grade anything.</p>
          <p>Woman: Sure but there are lots of other little things that can add up to more work like they have to prepare extra handouts for the class learn extra names and well possibly stay after class to answer those students questions.</p>
          <p>Man: Yeah I guess that's all extra work.</p>
          <p>Woman: Absolutely all these little things add up and require the professor's attention.</p>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>Well, according to the proposal, the university should allow the students to audit classes, which means the students won't need to finish their assignments for some particular classes. However, the woman is against the proposal for two main reasons. First, she thinks that it is unfair for the students who are taking the classes for credits because those auditing students might slow down the classes by asking really basic questions that are covered in the reading assignments, which will affect the quantity of the class discussions. Secondly, the woman is worried about some trivial things that could distract the professors' attention. For example, if there were auditing students in the classes, the professors would have to prepare extra handouts and stay after class to answer some basic questions from them. So the woman disagrees with the proposal for the reasons stated above.</p>
