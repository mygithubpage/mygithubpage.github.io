            <span class="time" data-times="4.23" data-time="13.79">[00:13.79]</span>The <span class="highlight">species</span> we'll look at is the <span class="highlight">blind</span> <span class="highlight">mole</span> rat.</p>

            <span class="highlight">Blind</span>
            <span class="highlight">mole</span> rats are interesting in terms of <span class="highlight">navigation</span> because they live <span class="highlight">entirely</span> in the dark-in <span class="highlight">elaborate</span> <span class="highlight">underground</span> <span class="highlight">tunnel</span> systems. <span class="time" data-times="7.03" data-time="25.91">[00:25.91]</span>So how do <span class="highlight">blind</span> <span class="highlight">mole</span> rats find their way around in these <span class="highlight">complicated</span> tunnels?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.43" data-time="32.94">[00:32.94]</span>Well, for some time we've known that <span class="highlight">blind</span> <span class="highlight">mole</span> rats use some <span class="highlight">combination</span> of two different <span class="highlight">navigation</span> systems.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.63" data-time="39.37">[00:39.37]</span>Um, one system relies on their <span class="highlight">sense</span> of time and their <span class="highlight">ability</span> to remember <span class="highlight">underground</span> landmarks. <span class="time" data-times="6.72" data-time="46">[00:46.00]</span>For example, let's say a <span class="highlight">mole</span> rat wants to find its way <span class="highlight">through</span> its <span class="highlight">tunnel</span> system back to its <span class="highlight">nest</span> where it sleeps. <span class="time" data-times="9.35" data-time="52.72">[00:52.72]</span>Well, it goes <span class="highlight">along</span>. Then it feels some hard stones or a tree <span class="highlight">root</span> under its feet and it basically says to itself. "Ok, here is where I took a left." <span class="time" data-times="4.88" data-time="62.07">[01:02.07]</span>And then it might remember how long it took to get to the next turn and so forth. <span class="time" data-times="9.01" data-time="66.95">[01:06.95]</span>The <span class="highlight">mole</span> rat goes straight or turns based on what it remembers having sensed <span class="highlight">along</span> the way on <span class="highlight">previous</span> trips and the time it took between turns.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.1" data-time="75.96">[01:15.96]</span>Now, the other <span class="highlight">navigation</span> system for the <span class="highlight">mole</span> rat relies on Earth's <span class="highlight">magnetic</span> <span class="highlight">field</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.69" data-time="81.06">[01:21.06]</span> <span class="highlight">Mole</span> rats have the <span class="highlight">ability</span> to <span class="highlight">sense</span> the <span class="highlight">magnetic</span> <span class="highlight">field</span> and use it to orient themselves directionally. <span class="time" data-times="5.48" data-time="87.75">[01:27.75]</span>But until recently scientists weren't sure about the role of these two different systems.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.6" data-time="93.23">[01:33.23]</span>Recently a team of researchers conducted an experiment to answer that question. <span class="time" data-times="3.65" data-time="97.83">[01:37.83]</span>Do these two <span class="highlight">navigation</span> systems play different roles? <span class="time" data-times="12.49" data-time="101.48">[01:41.48]</span>What they did was they designed a <span class="highlight">special</span> structure that very closely resembles a <span class="highlight">blind</span> <span class="highlight">mole</span> rat's <span class="highlight">tunnel</span> system, which looks like a bicycle wheel, a central hub with <span class="highlight">multiple</span> spokes radiating outward.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.73" data-time="113.97">[01:53.97]</span>Now this turned out to be quite important. <span class="time" data-times="9.94" data-time="116.7">[01:56.70]</span>Earlier experiments have used a more generic <span class="highlight">habitat</span>, basically a wide open circle, which was originally designed to test <span class="highlight">magnetic</span> <span class="highlight">navigation</span> in other animals. <span class="time" data-times="3.76" data-time="126.64">[02:06.64]</span>That design led to <span class="highlight">inconclusive</span> results with <span class="highlight">mole</span> rats.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="11.97" data-time="130.4">[02:10.40]</span>Now, with their bicycle wheel <span class="highlight">tunnel</span> system the researchers were able to <span class="highlight">vary</span> the distance that the <span class="highlight">mole</span> rats travel between their <span class="highlight">nest</span> and their food <span class="highlight">source</span> by creating long routes and short routes. <span class="time" data-times="8.03" data-time="142.37">[02:22.37]</span>In each <span class="highlight">trial</span>, the <span class="highlight">mole</span> rats started out in their <span class="highlight">nest</span>, went to the food <span class="highlight">source</span> and then had to find their way back home, back to the <span class="highlight">nest</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.78" data-time="150.4">[02:30.40]</span>To <span class="highlight">determine</span> which <span class="highlight">navigation</span> system they were using, the researchers tested the animals under two different conditions.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.63" data-time="157.18">[02:37.18]</span>First, the <span class="highlight">mole</span> rats were tested under conditions of normal magnetism for both the <span class="highlight">trip</span> to the food and the <span class="highlight">trip</span> home. <span class="time" data-times="7.37" data-time="163.81">[02:43.81]</span>And under these normal conditions, they all followed their <span class="highlight">original</span> <span class="highlight">route</span> back home, <span class="highlight">regardless</span> of the length of the <span class="highlight">trip</span> to the food <span class="highlight">source</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="14.47" data-time="171.18">[02:51.18]</span>Then in the <span class="highlight">second</span> part of the experiment, the <span class="highlight">magnetic</span> <span class="highlight">field</span> was altered but only for the <span class="highlight">trip</span> home, a specially constructed set of magnets was used to <span class="highlight">shift</span> the <span class="highlight">magnetic</span> <span class="highlight">field</span> around the <span class="highlight">habitat</span> 19 degrees eastward. <span class="time" data-times="4.08" data-time="185.65">[03:05.65]</span>The researchers <span class="highlight">wanted</span> to see how the <span class="highlight">mole</span> rats responded to this <span class="highlight">shift</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.63" data-time="189.73">[03:09.73]</span>Well, it turns out that the <span class="highlight">magnetic</span> <span class="highlight">shift</span> had no <span class="highlight">impact</span> on the return <span class="highlight">route</span> of the <span class="highlight">blind</span> <span class="highlight">mole</span> rats after a short <span class="highlight">trip</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.66" data-time="197.36">[03:17.36]</span>They returned to the point where they had started from.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="7.43" data-time="200.02">[03:20.02]</span>But after a longer <span class="highlight">trip</span>, they took a totally different route: one that led them nine degrees east of the <span class="highlight">nest</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.08" data-time="207.45">[03:27.45]</span> <span class="highlight">Essentially</span> they got lost. <span class="time" data-times="6.97" data-time="209.53">[03:29.53]</span>This was strong <span class="highlight">evidence</span> that <span class="highlight">blind</span> <span class="highlight">mole</span> rats use <span class="highlight">magnetic</span> <span class="highlight">navigation</span> only for longer trips.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.65" data-time="216.5">[03:36.50]</span>So why two <span class="highlight">navigation</span> systems: one for long trips and one for short trips?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="11.12" data-time="222.15">[03:42.15]</span>Well, for now we can only <span class="highlight">speculate</span>, but we think that when <span class="highlight">mole</span> rats <span class="highlight">rely</span> on the first system, using <span class="highlight">underground</span> landmarks or their <span class="highlight">sense</span> of time, well, they make small mistakes here and there. <span class="time" data-times="2.2" data-time="233.27">[03:53.27]</span>On a short <span class="highlight">trip</span>, this doesn't matter much. <span class="time" data-times="2.77" data-time="235.47">[03:55.47]</span>The <span class="highlight">trip</span> is short, so they can't make many mistakes.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="9.66" data-time="238.24">[03:58.24]</span>But on a long <span class="highlight">trip</span>, well, there are lots of opportunities to make small mistakes, and small mistakes can add up, <span class="highlight">leading</span> the <span class="highlight">mole</span> rat far from where it wants to be. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="247.9">[04:07.90]</span>So on a long <span class="highlight">trip</span>, a <span class="highlight">magnetic</span> <span class="highlight">navigation</span> system is better, more useful, since earth's <span class="highlight">magnetic</span> <span class="highlight">field</span> is <span class="highlight">stable</span>, a <span class="highlight">constant</span>, a more <span class="highlight">reliable</span> indicator of direction!</p>

              <p>At the beginning, the professor introduced the animal navigation, then proposed the navigation mode of blind mole rat and explained it separately, and then used the experiment to explain the choice of two navigation methods under different conditions. Therefore, Option B is correct. The A option says "blind mole rat underground cave structure". The tunnel system is mentioned in the article, but its structure is not mentioned and it is excluded. The C option says "A few animals navigate through the Earth's magnetic field." The article mentions that blind mole rat navigates through magnetic fields, but does not mention other animals and does not discuss "yes", so it is excluded. The D option says "Is there 2 or more navigation methods for blind mole rats?" The article clearly mentions that rat has 2 navigation methods and is therefore excluded.</p>

              <p>"Hum, one system relies on their sense of time, and their ability to remember underground land marks. For example, let's say a mole rat wants to find its way through its tunnels system back to its nest where it sleeps. Well, it goes Along, then feels some hard stones or tree root under its feet, and it generally says to itself, ok, here is where I took a left. And then it may remember how long it took to get to the next turn and so forth. The mole rat goes straight or turns based on what it remembers having sensed along the way on previous trips, and the time it took between turns."</p>

              <p>The article elicited the first navigation judgment of blind mole rat as a landmark on the ground, and then used a concrete example to explain it for students to understand. The example includes the synonyms of "tree roots and rocks", ie "some hard stones or tree roots". Under its feet." Therefore, Option C is correct. A option says "emphasizes the need for blind mole rat for both navigation methods". The tree roots and stones in the title are irrelevant to the second navigation method. Option B says "one of the reasons why blind mole rat is lost." "Go away" this shop in the experiment, misplaced, so ruled out. The D option says "Describe the material needed for the blind mole rat to cover the cave." The article did not mention "cover" caves and its "materials needed" and was ruled out.</p>

              <p>In this experiment, the researchers built a model based on the real caves of blind mole rat, and "Earlier applications have used more generic habitat, basically a wideopen circle, which was originally designed to test magnetic navigation in other animals. That design led To inconclusive results with mole rats." By comparing the props of the early and current experiments, the inaccuracy of the results of the earlier experiments is illustrated to show that the standard props will achieve more accurate results. Therefore, option D is correct. The A option says "to prevent people from misunderstanding the cave passage of blind mole rat", not mentioned, so it is excluded. The option B says "In order to point out how researchers were looking for animals for this experiment", it was not mentioned, so it was excluded.

              <p>The experimental results show that for shorter distances, rat will use the distance time and road marking as the basis for judging. For longer distances, rat will use the earth's magnetic field as the basis for judgment. Therefore, Option A is correct. Option B says "direction in the journey", not mentioned, so it is excluded. The C option says "complexity of the cave passage", not mentioned, so it is excluded. The D option says "there is no ground mark". The ground mark is the navigation basis of the blind mole rat, rather than the basis for choosing which kind of navigation to use, so it is excluded.</p>

              <p>The title of this question is the same as the fifth question. Because the two navigation modes of the mouse are larger or smaller than each other, the large deviation is used in the short-distance environment where the fault-tolerance rate is high, and the small-distance is used in the long-distance journey that does not generate large deviations. One system is more accurate than another. So choose A.</p>
