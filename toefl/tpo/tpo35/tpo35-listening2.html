the <span class="highlight">mole</span> rats started out in their <span class="highlight">nest</span>, went to the food <span class="highlight">source</span> and then had to find their way back home,

data-time="157.18">[02:37.18]</span>First, the <span class="highlight">mole</span> rats were tested under conditions of normal magnetism for both the <span class="highlight">trip</span> to the food

about?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The structure of the blind mole rats' underground tunnel system.</p><p>B. How blind mole rates find their way back to their nests.</p><p>C. Whether some animals use Earth's magnetic field for navigation.</p><p>D. Whether blind mole rats have more than one navigation system.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>At the beginning, the professor introduced the animal navigation, then proposed the navigation mode of blind mole rat and explained it separately, and then used the experiment to explain the choice of two navigation methods under different conditions. Therefore, Option B is correct. The A option says "blind mole rat underground cave structure". The tunnel system is mentioned in the article, but its structure is not mentioned and it is excluded. The C option says "A few animals navigate through the Earth's magnetic field." The article mentions that blind mole rat navigates through magnetic fields, but does not mention other animals and does not discuss "yes", so it is excluded. The D option says "Is there 2 or more navigation methods for blind mole rats?" The article clearly mentions that rat has 2 navigation methods and is therefore excluded.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor mention tree roots and rocks?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To emphasize the blind mole rat's need for two navigation systems.</p><p>B. To explain one reason why blind mole rats get lost.</p><p>C. To give examples of landmarks used by the blind mole rat.</p><p>D. To describe the materials the blind mole rat uses to build its nest.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>"Hum, one system relies on their sense of time, and their ability to remember underground land marks. For example, let's say a mole rat wants to find its way through its tunnels system back to its nest where it sleeps. Well, it goes Along, then feels some hard stones or tree root under its feet, and it generally says to itself, ok, here is where I took a left. And then it may remember how long it took to get to the next turn and so forth. The mole rat goes straight or turns based on what it remembers having sensed along the way on previous trips, and the time it took between turns."</p><p>The</p><p>The article elicited the first navigation judgment of blind mole rat as a landmark on the ground, and then used a concrete example to explain it for students to understand. The example includes the synonyms of "tree roots and rocks", ie "some hard stones or tree roots". Under its feet." Therefore, Option C is correct. A option says "emphasizes the need for blind mole rat for both navigation methods". The tree roots and stones in the title are irrelevant to the second navigation method. Option B says "one of the reasons why blind mole rat is lost." "Go away" this shop in the experiment, misplaced, so ruled out. The D option says "Describe the material needed for the blind mole rat to cover the cave." The article did not mention "cover" caves and its "materials needed" and was ruled out.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>In discussing the experiment, why does the professor refer to a generic habitat?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To prevent a misunderstanding about blind mole rats' tunnel systems.</p><p>B. To indicate how the researchers found the animals for the experiment.</p><p>C. To describe similarities between blind mole rats' natural habitat and those of other animals.</p><p>D. To emphasize the importance of habitat design to the success of the experiment.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>In this experiment, the researchers built a model based on the real caves of blind mole rat, and "Earlier applications have used more generic habitat, basically a wideopen circle, which was originally designed to test magnetic navigation in other animals. That design led To inconclusive results with mole rats." By comparing the props of the early and current experiments, the inaccuracy of the results of the earlier experiments is illustrated to show that the standard props will achieve more accurate results. Therefore, option D is correct. The A option says "to prevent people from misunderstanding the cave passage of blind mole rat", not mentioned, so it is excluded. The option B says "In order to point out how researchers were looking for animals for this experiment", it was not mentioned, so it was excluded. The C option says "to describe the similarities between the blind mole rat and the caves of other animals", not mentioned, so it was excluded.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What did the research team modify in the second part of their experiment?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They removed the food from the habitat.</p><p>B. They increased the distance between the nest and the food source.</p><p>C. They changed the magnetic field around the habitat.</p><p>D. They shifted the location of obstacles in the tunnels.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>"Then in the second part of the experiment, the magnetic field was altered, but only for the trip home. A featured constructed set of magnets was used to shift the magnetic field around the habitat 90 degrees eastward. " In the second experiment Researchers have changed the Earth's magnetic field, so Option C is correct. The A option says "they removed the habitat" and did not mention it, so it was excluded. Option B said that "they increase the distance between nests and feeding sites" and the original text does not match, so ruled out. The D option says "They changed the position of obstacles in the cave passage" and did not mention it, so it was ruled out.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor, what factor governs which navigation system the blind mole rat uses in a given situation?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The distance traveled.</p><p>B. The direction of travel.</p><p>C. The complexity of the tunnel system.</p><p>D. The presence or absence of landmarks.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The experimental results show that for shorter distances, rat will use the distance time and road marking as the basis for judging. For longer distances, rat will use the earth's magnetic field as the basis for judgment. Therefore, Option A is correct. Option B says "direction in the journey", not mentioned, so it is excluded. The C option says "complexity of the cave passage", not mentioned, so it is excluded. The D option says "there is no ground mark". The ground mark is the navigation basis of the blind mole rat, rather than the basis for choosing which kind of navigation to use, so it is excluded.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor imply when she explains why blind mole rats use two navigation systems?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. One system is more accurate than the other for long trips.</p><p>B. One system takes more time to use than the other one does.</p><p>C. Individual blind mole rats have a preference for on system or the other.</p><p>D. Animals usually do not rely on only one navigation system for long trips.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The title of this question is the same as the fifth question. Because the two navigation modes of the mouse are larger or smaller than each other, the large deviation is used in the short-distance environment where the fault-tolerance rate is high, and the small-distance is used in the long-distance journey that does not generate large deviations. One system is more accurate than another. So choose A.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
