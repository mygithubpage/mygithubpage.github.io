Then it feels some hard stones or a tree <span class="highlight">root</span> under its feet and it basically says to itself. "Ok, here is where I took a left." <span class="time" data-times="4.88" data-time="62.07">[01:02.07]</span>And then it might remember how long it took to get to the next turn and so forth. <span class="time" data-times="9.01" data-time="66.95">[01:06.95]</span>The <span class="highlight">mole</span> rat goes straight or turns based on what it remembers having sensed <span class="highlight">along</span> the way on <span class="highlight">previous</span> trips and the time it took between turns.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.1" data-time="75.96">[01:15.96]</span>Now, the other <span class="highlight">navigation</span> system for the <span class="highlight">mole</span> rat relies on Earth's <span class="highlight">magnetic</span><span class="highlight">field</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.69" data-time="81.06">[01:21.06]</span><span class="highlight">Mole</span> rats have the <span class="highlight">ability</span> to <span class="highlight">sense</span> the <span class="highlight">magnetic</span><span class="highlight">field</span> and use it to orient themselves directionally. <span class="time" data-times="5.48" data-time="87.75">[01:27.75]</span>But until recently scientists weren't sure about the role of these two different systems.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.6" data-time="93.23">[01:33.23]</span>Recently a team of researchers conducted an experiment to answer that question. <span class="time" data-times="3.65" data-time="97.83">[01:37.83]</span>Do these two <span class="highlight">navigation</span> systems play different roles? <span class="time" data-times="12.49" data-time="101.48">[01:41.48]</span>What they did was they designed a <span class="highlight">special</span> structure that very closely resembles a <span class="highlight">blind</span><span class="highlight">mole</span> rat's <span class="highlight">tunnel</span> system, which looks like a bicycle wheel, a central hub with <span class="highlight">multiple</span> spokes radiating outward.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.73" data-time="113.97">[01:53.97]</span>Now this turned out to be quite important. <span class="time" data-times="9.94" data-time="116.7">[01:56.70]</span>Earlier experiments have used a more generic <span class="highlight">habitat</span>, basically a wide open circle, which was originally designed to test <span class="highlight">magnetic</span><span class="highlight">navigation</span> in other animals. <span class="time" data-times="3.76" data-time="126.64">[02:06.64]</span>That design led to <span class="highlight">inconclusive</span> results with <span class="highlight">mole</span> rats.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="11.97" data-time="130.4">[02:10.40]</span>Now, with their bicycle wheel <span class="highlight">tunnel</span> system the researchers were able to <span class="highlight">vary</span> the distance that the <span class="highlight">mole</span> rats travel between their <span class="highlight">nest</span> and their food <span class="highlight">source</span> by creating long routes and short routes. <span class="time" data-times="8.03" data-time="142.37">[02:22.37]</span>In each <span class="highlight">trial</span>, the <span class="highlight">mole</span> rats started out in their <span class="highlight">nest</span>, went to the food <span class="highlight">source</span> and then had to find their way back home, back to the <span class="highlight">nest</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.78" data-time="150.4">[02:30.40]</span>To <span class="highlight">determine</span> which <span class="highlight">navigation</span> system they were using, the researchers tested the animals under two different conditions.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.63" data-time="157.18">[02:37.18]</span>First, the <span class="highlight">mole</span> rats were tested under conditions of normal magnetism for both the <span class="highlight">trip</span> to the food and the <span class="highlight">trip</span> home. <span class="time" data-times="7.37" data-time="163.81">[02:43.81]</span>And under these normal conditions, they all followed their <span class="highlight">original</span><span class="highlight">route</span> back home, <span class="highlight">regardless</span> of the length of the <span class="highlight">trip</span> to the food <span class="highlight">source</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="14.47" data-time="171.18">[02:51.18]</span>Then in the <span class="highlight">second</span> part of the experiment, the <span class="highlight">magnetic</span><span class="highlight">field</span> was altered but only for the <span class="highlight">trip</span> home, a specially constructed set of magnets was used to <span class="highlight">shift</span> the <span class="highlight">magnetic</span><span class="highlight">field</span> around the <span class="highlight">habitat</span> 19 degrees eastward. <span class="time" data-times="4.08" data-time="185.65">[03:05.65]</span>The researchers <span class="highlight">wanted</span> to see how the <span class="highlight">mole</span> rats responded to this <span class="highlight">shift</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.63" data-time="189.73">[03:09.73]</span>Well, it turns out that the <span class="highlight">magnetic</span><span class="highlight">shift</span> had no <span class="highlight">impact</span> on the return <span class="highlight">route</span> of the <span class="highlight">blind</span><span class="highlight">mole</span> rats after a short <span class="highlight">trip</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.66" data-time="197.36">[03:17.36]</span>They returned to the point where they had started from.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.43" data-time="200.02">[03:20.02]</span>But after a longer <span class="highlight">trip</span>, they took a totally different route: one that led them nine degrees east of the <span class="highlight">nest</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.08" data-time="207.45">[03:27.45]</span><span class="highlight">Essentially</span> they got lost. <span class="time" data-times="6.97" data-time="209.53">[03:29.53]</span>This was strong <span class="highlight">evidence</span> that <span class="highlight">blind</span><span class="highlight">mole</span> rats use <span class="highlight">magnetic</span><span class="highlight">navigation</span> only for longer trips.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.65" data-time="216.5">[03:36.50]</span>So why two <span class="highlight">navigation</span> systems: one for long trips and one for short trips?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="11.12" data-time="222.15">[03:42.15]</span>Well, for now we can only <span class="highlight">speculate</span>, but we think that when <span class="highlight">mole</span> rats <span class="highlight">rely</span> on the first system, using <span class="highlight">underground</span> landmarks or their <span class="highlight">sense</span> of time, well, they make small mistakes here and there. <span class="time" data-times="2.2" data-time="233.27">[03:53.27]</span>On a short <span class="highlight">trip</span>, this doesn't matter much. <span class="time" data-times="2.77" data-time="235.47">[03:55.47]</span>The <span class="highlight">trip</span> is short, so they can't make many mistakes.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="9.66" data-time="238.24">[03:58.24]</span>But on a long <span class="highlight">trip</span>, well, there are lots of opportunities to make small mistakes, and small mistakes can add up, <span class="highlight">leading</span> the <span class="highlight">mole</span> rat far from where it wants to be. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="247.9">[04:07.90]</span>So on a long <span class="highlight">trip</span>, a <span class="highlight">magnetic</span><span class="highlight">navigation</span> system is better, more useful, since earth's <span class="highlight">magnetic</span><span class="highlight">field</span> is <span class="highlight">stable</span>, a <span class="highlight">constant</span>, a more <span class="highlight">reliable</span> indicator of direction!</p></p></article></section><div id="question"><div id="question1"><p>What is the lecture mainly about?</p><label class="my-label"><span>A.
