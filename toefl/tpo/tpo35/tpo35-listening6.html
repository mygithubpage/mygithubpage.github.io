A possible cause of the Permian extinction</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The subject of this article was inspired by the content and questions of the previous lesson: The cause of the extinction of Permian: "Ok, but, did you know there was an earlier extinction far greater than the one killed out the dinosaurs? It was what we call the Permian Extinction. ." Therefore, option D is correct. A option says "new evidence of dinosaur extinction", not mentioned, so ruled out. Option B said "new method for collecting evidence of extinction", not mentioned, so ruled out. The C option says "The relationship between the two mass concentrations during the Permian period" is not mentioned, so it is excluded.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor, why did researchers begin looking for evidence that an asteroid may have caused the Permian extinction?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They discovery that mascons on the Moon were caused by asteroid impacts.</p><p>B. They found rock samples in Wilkes Land that appeared to be 250 million years old.</p><p>C. The theory that an asteroid caused the dinosaur extinction gained acceptance.</p><p>D.

We began asking ourselves, is it possible that another asteroid much earlier caused the Permian extinction? And so researchers have been looking for an impact crater. "</p><p>The article mentioned that because the subsequent asteroids collided with the Earth and caused the extinction of dinosaurs, they began to consider whether the extinction was caused by a collision between asteroids. Therefore, Option C is correct. The A option says "They found that the difference in mass concentration in the monthly area was caused by collisions of asteroids." It was in accordance with the original text, but it was not in accordance with the meaning of the question and was ruled out. Option B said "They found Wilkes Land's rock is 250 million years old". The article did not mention Wilkes Land's rock condition and was ruled out. The D option says "The theory of oxygen reduction in water is wrong." The article says that oxygen reduction is only a theory, but it is not explicitly stated that it is wrong, so it is excluded.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor mention getting a bump on the head?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

To compare the dinosaur extinction to the Permian extinction</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>"Evidence of what maybe a mascon. That's just short for mass concentration. When an asteroid hits earth, when it slams into earth crust, we think that causes molten rock from deep below the surface to rise up into the impacted area, sort of like If you bump your head, you get a big lump under the skin.</p><p>Fluid makes the area swell. Anyway, the material flowing up from below the crust is more dense than the crust itself. So that's how we get a mascon, a spot in the crust with newer material that's more dense that the material all around it.

Option B says "In order to explain how the supercontinent is separated," it is not mentioned and it is excluded.

And the spot where the gravity readings are especially high, this is right in the middle of a 500 kilometer wide circular ridge. What could be part of an old impact crater. Naka said that the macon on the moon was caused by asteroids, and Wilkes Land had a similar mason, so Option D was correct. The A option says "ice containing a higher concentration of oxygen", not mentioned, so it is excluded. The B option states that "a part of the crust has a lower density than the normal density." The article says that mascon is a density higher than normal, which is contrary to the original text and is therefore excluded. The C option says "rock fragments from the outer earth below the ice" and "rocks from the outer earth" are mentioned, but they are misplaced and therefore excluded.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor emphasize about some of the rock samples taken from the Bedout High near Australia?

They are from the same time period as the Permian extinction.</p><p>C. They have been exposed to extreme temperatures and pressure.</p><p>D. They contain fossils of many species that are now extinct.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="BC"><p>"And we have rock samples from the Bedout High. Some are apparently of extra-terrestrial origin. I mean they show the effects of extreme temperatures and pressures, the level of extremes produced only by an impact. And ask for their age? Well, They do, in fact, date back to about 250 million years ago."</p><p>The article clearly points out the characteristics of Bedout High's rock, which corresponds to the BC option, so the option BC is correct. The A option says "They are much like the rocks of the Yucatan peninsula". It is irrelevant and therefore excluded.
