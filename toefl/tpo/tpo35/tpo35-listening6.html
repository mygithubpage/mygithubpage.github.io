            <span class="time" data-times="8.23" data-time="20.22">[00:20.22]</span>Professor:Right. I wouldn't say that we've got 100% <span class="highlight">proof</span>, but there's very strong <span class="highlight">evidence</span> that this is why that <span class="highlight">mass</span> <span class="highlight">extinction</span> occurred.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.87" data-time="28.45">[00:28.45]</span>Okay.

          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="10.71" data-time="38.56">[00:38.56]</span>Now, way back about 290 million years ago, at the beginning of the Permian Period, there was just one big <span class="highlight">continent</span>, a super <span class="highlight">continent</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.74" data-time="49.27">[00:49.27]</span>And as the <span class="highlight">climate</span> warmed up, plant and animal <span class="highlight">species</span> began to diversify <span class="highlight">profusely</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.18" data-time="55.01">[00:55.01]</span>So life during the Permian Period was <span class="highlight">abundant</span> and <span class="highlight">diverse</span>. <span class="time" data-times="14.37" data-time="59.19">[00:59.19]</span>But about 250 million years ago, the Permian Period ended with a rapid <span class="highlight">mass</span> <span class="highlight">extinction</span>, something happened that wiped out 75% of the land animals and over 95% of ocean life.</p>

            <span class="time" data-times="1.65" data-time="73.56">[01:13.56]</span>So what was it? <span class="time" data-times="1.56" data-time="75.21">[01:15.21]</span>What could have caused this?</p>

            <span class="time" data-times="12.65" data-time="76.77">[01:16.77]</span>Well, with the all the <span class="highlight">evidence</span> that it was an <span class="highlight">asteroid</span> that led to the <span class="highlight">dinosaur</span> <span class="highlight">extinction</span>, we began asking ourselves: is it possible that another <span class="highlight">asteroid</span> much earlier caused the Permian <span class="highlight">Extinction</span>? <span class="time" data-times="4.02" data-time="89.42">[01:29.42]</span>And so researchers have been looking for an <span class="highlight">impact</span> <span class="highlight">crater</span>.</p>

            <span class="time" data-times="3.09" data-time="104.93">[01:44.93]</span>Student:And it mentions something about <span class="highlight">volcanic</span> eruptions too.</p>

It was in accordance with the original text, but it was not in accordance with the meaning of the question and was ruled out. Option B said "They found Wilkes Land's rock is 250 million years old".

              <p>The judgment basis is as follows:</p>
              <p>"Researchers noticed a gravity anomaly similar to those on the moon. And the spot where the gravity readings are especially high, this is right in the middle of a 500 kilometer wide circular ridge. What could be part of an old impact crater. Naka said that the macon on the moon was caused by asteroids, and Wilkes Land had a similar mason, so Option D was correct. The A option says "ice containing a higher concentration of oxygen", not mentioned, so it is excluded. The B option states that "a part of the crust has a lower density than the normal density." The article says that mascon is a density higher than normal, which is contrary to the original text and is therefore excluded. The C option says "rock fragments from the outer earth below the ice" and "rocks from the outer earth" are mentioned, but they are misplaced and therefore excluded.</p>

              <p>"And we have rock samples from the Bedout High. Some are apparently of extra-terrestrial origin. I mean they show the effects of extreme temperatures and pressures, the level of extremes produced only by an impact. And ask for their age? Well, They do, in fact, date back to about 250 million years ago."</p>
              <p>The article clearly points out the characteristics of Bedout High's rock, which corresponds to the BC option, so the option BC is correct. The A option says "They are much like the rocks of the Yucatan peninsula". It is irrelevant and therefore excluded. The D option says "they have fossils of animals that are now extinct", not mentioned, so it is ruled out.</p>

              <p>When the student analyzed the cause of the problem, the teacher said that the reason was merely a theory, Option B was correct. The A option says "Students need to read assignments before attending classes", which has nothing to do with this topic context The C option says "Students did not find sufficient theory to dismiss the theory in the book."</p>
              <p>The D option says that "the theory proposed by the students is the most reasonable", and is the opposite of the original, so it is excluded.</p>
