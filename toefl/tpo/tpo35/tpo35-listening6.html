              <span class="time" data-times="4.96" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator:Listen to part of a lecture in an Earth science class.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.46" data-time="4.96">[00:04.96]</span>Professor:Let's <span class="underline">review</span> something from last week. <span class="time" data-times="3.55" data-time="7.42">[00:07.42]</span>We talked about an event that happened 65 million years ago. <span class="time" data-times="0.79" data-time="10.97">[00:10.97]</span>Anyone?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.35" data-time="11.76">[00:11.76]</span>Student:An <span class="underline">asteroid</span> hit Earth. <span class="time" data-times="7.11" data-time="13.11">[00:13.11]</span>Um...well, we think an <span class="underline">asteroid</span> hit Earth, near the Yucatan Peninsula, in Mexico, and that wiped out all the dinosaurs.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.23" data-time="20.22">[00:20.22]</span>Professor:Right. I wouldn't say that we've got 100% <span class="underline">proof</span>, but there's very strong <span class="underline">evidence</span> that this is why that <span class="underline">mass</span> <span class="underline">extinction</span> occurred.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.87" data-time="28.45">[00:28.45]</span>Okay. But did you know there was an earlier <span class="underline">extinction</span> far greater than the one that killed off the dinosaurs? <span class="time" data-times="3.24" data-time="35.32">[00:35.32]</span>It was what we call the Permian <span class="underline">Extinction</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.71" data-time="38.56">[00:38.56]</span>Now, way back about 290 million years ago, at the beginning of the Permian Period, there was just one big <span class="underline">continent</span>, a super <span class="underline">continent</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.74" data-time="49.27">[00:49.27]</span>And as the <span class="underline">climate</span> warmed up, plant and animal <span class="underline">species</span> began to diversify <span class="underline">profusely</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.18" data-time="55.01">[00:55.01]</span>So life during the Permian Period was <span class="underline">abundant</span> and <span class="underline">diverse</span>. <span class="time" data-times="14.37" data-time="59.19">[00:59.19]</span>But about 250 million years ago, the Permian Period ended with a rapid <span class="underline">mass</span> <span class="underline">extinction</span>, something happened that wiped out 75% of the land animals and over 95% of ocean life.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.65" data-time="73.56">[01:13.56]</span>So what was it? <span class="time" data-times="1.56" data-time="75.21">[01:15.21]</span>What could have caused this?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="12.65" data-time="76.77">[01:16.77]</span>Well, with the all the <span class="underline">evidence</span> that it was an <span class="underline">asteroid</span> that led to the <span class="underline">dinosaur</span> <span class="underline">extinction</span>, we began asking ourselves: is it possible that another <span class="underline">asteroid</span> much earlier caused the Permian <span class="underline">Extinction</span>? <span class="time" data-times="4.02" data-time="89.42">[01:29.42]</span>And so researchers have been looking for an <span class="underline">impact</span> <span class="underline">crater</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.28" data-time="93.44">[01:33.44]</span>Student:I thought the Permian <span class="underline">Extinction</span> was caused by a <span class="underline">decline</span> in sea water <span class="underline">oxygen</span> levels. <span class="time" data-times="1.83" data-time="98.72">[01:38.72]</span>Isn't that what's in the textbook?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.38" data-time="100.55">[01:40.55]</span>Professor:But don't forget the textbook makes it very <span class="underline">clear</span> that's only a <span class="underline">theory</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.09" data-time="104.93">[01:44.93]</span>Student:And it mentions something about <span class="underline">volcanic</span> eruptions too.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.69" data-time="108.02">[01:48.02]</span>Professor:It does, but now this new <span class="underline">theory</span> has led to a search for <span class="underline">evidence</span> of an <span class="underline">asteroid</span> <span class="underline">impact</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6" data-time="113.71">[01:53.71]</span>And one place of <span class="underline">interest</span> is a <span class="underline">region</span> called Wilkes Land in eastern <span class="underline">Antarctica</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.39" data-time="119.71">[01:59.71]</span>A few years ago, a researcher reported a strange <span class="underline">anomaly</span> <span class="underline">beneath</span> the ice in Wilkes Land. <span class="time" data-times="2.4" data-time="125.1">[02:05.10]</span> <span class="underline">Evidence</span> of what may be a mascon. <span class="time" data-times="3.56" data-time="127.5">[02:07.50]</span>That's just short for <span class="underline">mass</span> <span class="underline">concentration</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.92" data-time="131.06">[02:11.06]</span>When an <span class="underline">asteroid</span> hits Earth, when it slams into Earth's <span class="underline">crust</span>, we think that causes <span class="underline">molten</span> rock from deep below the surface to rise up into the <span class="underline">impact</span> area. <span class="time" data-times="3.5" data-time="140.98">[02:20.98]</span> <span class="underline">Sort</span> of like if you <span class="underline">bump</span> your head, you get a big <span class="underline">lump</span> under the skin. <span class="time" data-times="2.09" data-time="144.48">[02:24.48]</span>Fluid makes the area <span class="underline">swell</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.49" data-time="146.57">[02:26.57]</span>Anyway, the <span class="underline">material</span> flowing up from below the <span class="underline">crust</span> is more <span class="underline"><span class="underline">dense</span></span> than the <span class="underline">crust</span> itself. <span class="time" data-times="7.63" data-time="152.06">[02:32.06]</span>So that's how we get a mascon, a <span class="underline">spot</span> in the <span class="underline">crust</span> with newer <span class="underline">crust</span> <span class="underline">material</span> that's more <span class="underline"><span class="underline">dense</span></span> than the <span class="underline">material</span> all around it.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.34" data-time="159.69">[02:39.69]</span>There're lots of mascons on the moon too, where a mascon's <span class="underline">density</span> causes a small increase in the <span class="underline">local</span> <span class="underline">gravity</span> that can be measured and mapped by orbiting <span class="underline">spacecraft</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.08" data-time="170.03">[02:50.03]</span>And where do these mascons <span class="underline">tend</span> to be found? <span class="time" data-times="4.34" data-time="173.11">[02:53.11]</span>In the centers of <span class="underline">impact</span> craters on the moon's surface.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.93" data-time="177.45">[02:57.45]</span>But back to Wilkes Land. <span class="time" data-times="10.45" data-time="179.38">[02:59.38]</span>We're not certain that the mascon there...what might be a mascon ...was actually caused by the <span class="underline">impact</span> of an <span class="underline">asteroid</span>, but there does <span class="underline">seem</span> to be <span class="underline">evidence</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.76" data-time="189.83">[03:09.83]</span>Researchers notice a <span class="underline">gravity</span> <span class="underline">anomaly</span> <span class="underline">similar</span> to those on the moon. <span class="time" data-times="10.5" data-time="194.59">[03:14.59]</span>And the <span class="underline">spot</span> where the <span class="underline">gravity</span> readings are especially high...this is right in the middle of a 500-kilometer wide, <span class="underline">circular</span> <span class="underline">ridge</span>, what could be part of an old <span class="underline">impact</span> <span class="underline">crater</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.2" data-time="205.09">[03:25.09]</span>And if there was an <span class="underline">asteroid</span> <span class="underline">impact</span> there in Wilkes Land, the next question is: did it happen 250 million years ago? <span class="time" data-times="3.32" data-time="213.29">[03:33.29]</span>Because that would put it when in geologic <span class="underline">history</span>?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.63" data-time="216.61">[03:36.61]</span>Student: At the end of the Permian Period? Right when those animals went <span class="underline">extinct</span>.</p>

              <span class="time" data-times="1.41" data-time="220.24">[03:40.24]</span>Professor:Exactly.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.05" data-time="221.65">[03:41.65]</span>Student: But can't researchers <span class="underline">figure</span> that out by studying the rocks there in Wilkes Land...where this <span class="underline">impact</span> <span class="underline">supposedly</span> took place?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.53" data-time="229.7">[03:49.70]</span>Professor: Well, to get to anything from that long ago, we would have to <span class="underline">drill</span> down to about a mile, about 1.6 kilometers of <span class="underline">solid</span> ice that covers the area today. <span class="time" data-times="1.88" data-time="239.23">[03:59.23]</span>And that's not likely to happen.</p>

              <span class="time" data-times="6.32" data-time="241.11">[04:01.11]</span>But speaking of rocks, I should <span class="underline">mention</span> that Wilkes Land is not the only place of <span class="underline">interest</span> here. <span class="time" data-times="4.39" data-time="247.43">[04:07.43]</span>There's another called the Bedout High off the <span class="underline">coast</span> of Australia. <span class="time" data-times="3.37" data-time="251.82">[04:11.82]</span>And we have rock samples from the Bedout High. <span class="time" data-times="2.77" data-time="255.19">[04:15.19]</span>Some apparently have extraterrestrial <span class="underline">origin</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.84" data-time="257.96">[04:17.96]</span>I mean, they show the effects of <span class="underline">extreme</span> temperatures and pressures, the <span class="underline">level</span> of extremes produced only by an <span class="underline">impact</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="265.8">[04:25.80]</span>And as for their age, well, they do in fact, <span class="underline">date</span> back to about 250 million years ago.</p>
