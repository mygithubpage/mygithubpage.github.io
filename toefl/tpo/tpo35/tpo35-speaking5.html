Got plans for the summer yet?</p><p>Man:Yeah, actually I got a month long internship in a town about 3 hours from here, working in a magazine. Pretty excited.</p><p>Woman: An internship with a magazine? Very cool! Man: Yeah! I'm excited to know a new area too.</p><p>Woman: So have you found a place to stay for the month?</p><p>Man: Actually I have. But I'm gonna keep my apartment here on campus while I'm gone. Keep paying rent of it. So I'm just going to be renting a room during the internship. You know, to save money.</p><p>Woman: Makes sense.Man: Yeah, and the room I found is pretty cheap, and in a great location. Very close to the magazine I'll be working. Only thing is, it doesn't come with any furniture.</p><p>Woman: Nothing?</p><p>Man: No, nothing. The room isn't furnished, no desk, no chairs, no bed, no sofa. So I have to do something about that. I was going to try to see if I could buy some inexpensive used furniture once I get up there.</p><p>Woman: Sounds good. I'm sure there are plenty of places you can buy cheap stuff.</p><p>Man: And maybe sell once internship is over. Only thing is, it's not guaranteed I'll be able to find everything I need for cheap prices. And I don't want to spend a lot since it's just for the month.</p><p>Woman: Well, what about the furniture you already have in your apartment here on campus?</p><p>Man: Yeah I do have some nice pieces of furniture in my apartment that I could move to the room. But I don't have a way to get it there. I have to rent a truck or something. It'll be kind of a hassle loading it in the truck, carrying it up and down the stairs, driving for three hours.</p><p>Woman: Yeah. And then you'd have to move it all back after the month was over.</p></article><section id="question"><h4>Question</h4><p>Briefly summarize the problem the speaker are discussing. Then state which of the two solutions from the conversation you would recommend. Explain the reasons for your recommendation. </p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>Well, the man's problem is that he is moving to a rented room for his internship but there's no furniture in the room. Accordingly, there are two solutions for the man: he could buy some inexpensive used furniture or he could move his already-have furniture on campus in his apartment to his new place. And I guess the man should try to buy some inexpensive furniture for two main reasons. First, he is just staying there for months for his internship which means he is not going to settle down there and live his life. So if he tries his best to look for some used furniture on special web sites like eBay, he will easily get some basic necessary cheap furniture like a bed, writing table and a chair. More importantly, he could put everything on line for sale again after his internship. Secondly, moving the furniture that he already have is too troublesome since he might damage something on his way carrying his stuff here and there. So it may cost even more time and money.</p></article></div></main></body></html>
