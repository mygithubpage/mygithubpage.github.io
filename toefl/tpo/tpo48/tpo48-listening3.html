            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.68" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator:Listen to part of a lecture in an Earth Science class. <span class="time" data-times="3.56" data-time="3.68">[00:03.68]</span>The class has been discussing volcanoes. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="12.04" data-time="7.24">[00:07.24]</span>Professor:Okay. We know the Earth's surface, the <span class="underline">crust</span>, is made up of <span class="underline">tectonic</span> plates, and these huge slabs of <span class="underline">rocky</span> <span class="underline">crust</span> are slowly sliding over or under or past each other, <span class="time" data-times="9.98" data-time="19.28">[00:19.28]</span>and we said that most of the world's volcanoes <span class="underline">occur</span> at the boundaries of these <span class="underline">tectonic</span> plates where you have hot <span class="underline">molten</span> rock squeezing up <span class="underline">through</span> gaps between the plates. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.62" data-time="29.26">[00:29.26]</span>But some volcanoes <span class="underline">occur</span> not at the edges, but in the middle of a <span class="underline">continental</span> or <span class="underline">oceanic</span> <span class="underline">plate</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.47" data-time="36.88">[00:36.88]</span>The Hawaiian Islands, for example, are thousands of kilometers away from any <span class="underline">plate</span> <span class="underline">boundary</span>, and yet you have <span class="underline">vast</span> amounts of <span class="underline">magma</span>, <span class="time" data-times="9.87" data-time="45.35">[00:45.35]</span> <span class="underline">molten</span> rock or <span class="underline">lava</span>, flowing up <span class="underline">through</span> the earth's <span class="underline">crust</span>, which means, of <span class="underline">course</span>, that <span class="underline">volcanic</span> <span class="underline">activity</span> there can't be explained <span class="underline">simply</span> by <span class="underline">plate</span> <span class="underline">tectonics</span>.<span class="time" data-times="6.58" data-time="55.22">[00:55.22]</span>So, how do we explain these <span class="underline">volcanic</span> anomalies, these exceptions to the general rule? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.82" data-time="61.8">[01:01.80]</span>Well, back in 1963, a geophysicist by the name of Wilson came up with a hot-spot <span class="underline">theory</span> to explain how this <span class="underline">particular</span> type of <span class="underline">volcanic</span> <span class="underline">activity</span> can <span class="underline">occur</span>, <span class="time" data-times="4.36" data-time="72.62">[01:12.62]</span>and can go on for maybe tens or <span class="underline">even</span> hundreds of millions of years. <span class="time" data-times="10.03" data-time="76.98">[01:16.98]</span>Wilson's <span class="underline">theory</span> was that: hot spots exist below <span class="underline">tectonic</span> plates, and they're the cause of these volcanoes.But what causes the hot spots? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.99" data-time="87.01">[01:27.01]</span>Hmm, well, the most <span class="underline">popular</span> <span class="underline">theory</span> that's been proposed is the plume <span class="underline">hypothesis</span>.According to this <span class="underline">hypothesis</span>, plumes, <span class="time" data-times="4.02" data-time="96">[01:36.00]</span>uh, basically columns of extremely hot <span class="underline">magma</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9.88" data-time="100.02">[01:40.02]</span>These plumes well up from deep inside the <span class="underline">planet</span>'s <span class="underline">interior</span>, maybe <span class="underline">even</span> as deep as its <span class="underline">core</span>, and rise all the way up to <span class="underline">melt</span> <span class="underline">through</span> the Earth's <span class="underline">crust</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.37" data-time="109.9">[01:49.90]</span>Imagine a burning candle, and imagine moving a sheet of heavy paper slowly over the <span class="underline">flame</span> of the candle. <span class="time" data-times="7.07" data-time="118.27">[01:58.27]</span>You're <span class="underline">gonna</span> get a <span class="underline">series</span> of burned spots in the paper, well, that's just like what's happening with the Hawaiian Islands, <span class="time" data-times="7.88" data-time="125.34">[02:05.34]</span>but <span class="underline">instead</span> of a sheet of paper, you've got a <span class="underline">tectonic</span> <span class="underline">plate</span>, and it's moving over this plume of intensely hot <span class="underline">magma</span>, <span class="time" data-times="3.01" data-time="133.22">[02:13.22]</span>and rather than a <span class="underline">series</span> of burned spots in the paper. <span class="time" data-times="14" data-time="136.23">[02:16.23]</span>You're getting a <span class="underline">chain</span> of <span class="underline">volcanic</span> islands where the hot plume melts <span class="underline">through</span> the <span class="underline">crust</span> under the <span class="underline">Pacific</span> Ocean at one point after another with active volcanoes on the younger islands that are now just above the plume, and the other islands, <span class="time" data-times="6.64" data-time="150.23">[02:30.23]</span>well, the farther away from the plume they are now, the older they are, and the longer ago their volcanoes went <span class="underline">dormant</span> or <span class="underline">extinct</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.92" data-time="156.87">[02:36.87]</span>Incidentally, <span class="underline">volcanic</span> islands may <span class="underline">seem</span> small, but the island known as the Big Island Hawaii is one of the tallest topographic features on the <span class="underline">planet</span>,<span class="time" data-times="7.5" data-time="166.79">[02:46.79]</span> more than five kilometers from the sea floor to the ocean surface, and almost that much again, up to its highest <span class="underline">peak</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.98" data-time="174.29">[02:54.29]</span>That's nearly ten kilometers from ocean floor to the highest point on the island, which makes it taller <span class="underline">even</span> than <span class="underline">Mount</span> Everest. <span class="time" data-times="12.15" data-time="183.27">[03:03.27]</span>So, you can imagine the huge amounts of <span class="underline">magma</span>, or <span class="underline">lava</span>, that've flowed up to form <span class="underline">even</span> just this one island, much less the whole <span class="underline">chain</span> of islands. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.09" data-time="195.42">[03:15.42]</span>Now, the Plume <span class="underline">Hypothesis</span> provides a <span class="underline">pretty</span> <span class="underline">elegant</span> explanation for a <span class="underline">volcanic</span> <span class="underline">anomaly</span>, like the Hawaiian Islands. <span class="time" data-times="7.05" data-time="204.51">[03:24.51]</span>But, while it's hypothetically <span class="underline">attractive</span>, there's very little direct <span class="underline">evidence</span> to support the <span class="underline">theory</span>, <span class="time" data-times="7.16" data-time="211.56">[03:31.56]</span>because so far, no one's been able to actually <span class="underline">observe</span> what's happening that far <span class="underline">beneath</span> the Earth's <span class="underline">crust</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.22" data-time="218.72">[03:38.72]</span>Some studies have been done, seismographic, geochemical, where the data's <span class="underline">consistent</span> with the model, but they aren't <span class="underline">definitive</span> <span class="underline">proof</span>.<span class="time" data-times="5.96" data-time="227.94">[03:47.94]</span> <span class="underline">Even</span> the model supporters are uncomfortable claiming that it explains every <span class="underline">volcanic</span> <span class="underline">anomaly</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.91" data-time="233.9">[03:53.90]</span>And like any <span class="underline">popular</span> <span class="underline">theory</span>, I <span class="underline">suppose</span>, it has some <span class="underline">determined</span> critics. <span class="time" data-times="5.93" data-time="238.81">[03:58.81]</span>These critics have put forth a number of <span class="underline">alternative</span> theories, all unproven so far. <span class="time" data-times="12.34" data-time="244.74">[04:04.74]</span>But one well-regarded <span class="underline">theory</span> is the <span class="underline">crack</span> <span class="underline">hypothesis</span>, which assumes that hot spots are created when a piece of the <span class="underline">crust</span> gets stretched thinner and thinner and the resulting <span class="underline">stress</span> causes small cracks to open up at weak spots in the <span class="underline">crust</span>, <span class="time" data-times="7.72" data-time="257.08">[04:17.08]</span>and it's <span class="underline">through</span> these cracks that <span class="underline">magma</span> pushes up to form volcanoes. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.45" data-time="264.8">[04:24.80]</span>Proponents of the <span class="underline">crack</span> <span class="underline">hypothesis</span> <span class="underline">consider</span> this a <span class="underline">widespread</span> <span class="underline">phenomenon</span> and believe that <span class="underline">magma</span>'s not coming up from deep <span class="underline">within</span> the Earth's <span class="underline">interior</span>, <span class="time" data-times="3.35" data-time="275.25">[04:35.25]</span>but rather from just <span class="underline">beneath</span> the surface <span class="underline">crust</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="12.25" data-time="278.6">[04:38.60]</span>This <span class="underline">hypothesis</span> is <span class="underline">attractive</span>, because it fits with what we already know about <span class="underline">plate</span> <span class="underline">tectonics</span> and it fits what we know about some secondary smaller hot spots, <span class="time" data-times="4.29" data-time="290.85">[04:50.85]</span>but how well does it explain the Hawaiian Islands? <span class="time" data-times="8.77" data-time="295.14">[04:55.14]</span>Could a <span class="underline">series</span> of <span class="underline">random</span> cracks produce that same <span class="underline">particular</span> <span class="underline">string</span> of Islands that's sequenced so neatly from old to young? <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="303.91">[05:03.91]</span>You know, it worries me when a <span class="underline">theory</span> depends on coincidence to produce results. </p>
