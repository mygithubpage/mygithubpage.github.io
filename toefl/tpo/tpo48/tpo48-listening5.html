            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.71" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator:Listen to part of the lecture in a <span class="underline">biology</span> class. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.38" data-time="3.71">[00:03.71]</span>Professor:Ok, today I'd like to spend some time going into more <span class="underline">detail</span> about symbiosis. <span class="time" data-times="3.91" data-time="9.09">[00:09.09]</span>Symbiosis, what is it? Anyone? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.18" data-time="13">[00:13.00]</span>Student:Um, I thought it's when two organisms are in a relationship that they both <span class="underline">benefit</span> from. <span class="time" data-times="4.08" data-time="18.18">[00:18.18]</span>Well, at <span class="underline">least</span> that's what I thought it was until I did the reading last night. <span class="time" data-times="5.74" data-time="22.26">[00:22.26]</span>Now, I am kind of <span class="underline">confused</span> about it, because the book used that <span class="underline">definition</span> to <span class="underline">describe</span> <span class="underline">mutualism</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2" data-time="28">[00:28.00]</span>Could you explain the <span class="underline">difference</span>? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.73" data-time="30">[00:30.00]</span>Professor:Good. I was hoping that someone would bring that up. <span class="time" data-times="6.17" data-time="32.73">[00:32.73]</span>Sometimes scientists working in different fields use the <span class="underline">term</span> symbiosis to mean <span class="underline">slightly</span> different things. <span class="time" data-times="1.98" data-time="38.9">[00:38.90]</span>And it can get confusing. <span class="time" data-times="4.32" data-time="40.88">[00:40.88]</span>Uh, for example, when symbiosis is used as a <span class="underline">synonym</span> for <span class="underline">mutualism</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.2" data-time="45.2">[00:45.20]</span>But there are quite a few of us out there who think there should be a clearer <span class="underline">distinction</span> made between the two. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7" data-time="51.4">[00:51.40]</span>Ok, where to begin... Um, the <span class="underline">original</span> <span class="underline">definition</span> of symbiosis is <span class="underline">pretty</span> simple. <span class="time" data-times="2.5" data-time="58.4">[00:58.40]</span>It <span class="underline">simply</span> means living together. <span class="time" data-times="10.52" data-time="60.9">[01:00.90]</span>So, any close relationship between two organisms of different <span class="underline">species</span> would be considered a symbiotic relationship, including <span class="underline">positive</span> and <span class="underline">negative</span> relationships. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.66" data-time="71.42">[01:11.42]</span>
              <span class="underline">Mutualism</span> then is a kind of symbiosis, a <span class="underline">specific</span> type of symbiotic relationship where both organisms <span class="underline">benefit</span> somehow. <span class="time" data-times="2.58" data-time="82.08">[01:22.08]</span>So, your book is correct. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.62" data-time="84.66">[01:24.66]</span>Now, I want to make it <span class="underline">clear</span> that, um, the <span class="underline">positive</span> result from being in a <span class="underline">mutualistic</span> relationship doesn't have to be <span class="underline">equal</span> for both organisms. <span class="time" data-times="2.72" data-time="93.28">[01:33.28]</span>It's not a one-to-one <span class="underline">ratio</span> here. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.98" data-time="96">[01:36.00]</span>Is everyone with me so far? <span class="time" data-times="9.41" data-time="97.98">[01:37.98]</span>Symbiosis, general <span class="underline">term</span>; <span class="underline">mutualism</span>, a narrower or more <span class="underline">specific</span> kind of symbiosis. Okay. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.15" data-time="107.39">[01:47.39]</span>Now, let's take a closer look at <span class="underline">mutualistic</span> relationships. <span class="time" data-times="7.81" data-time="111.54">[01:51.54]</span>Um, I'll start off by describing a case of <span class="underline">mutualism</span> that involves a certain butterfly <span class="underline">species</span> found in South Africa and Australia. <span class="time" data-times="4.97" data-time="119.35">[01:59.35]</span>It's a good example of how dependence on a <span class="underline">mutualistic</span> relationship can <span class="underline">vary</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.89" data-time="124.32">[02:04.32]</span>Ok, there's this butterfly family and I'll <span class="underline">spare</span> you the <span class="underline">fancy</span> <span class="underline">Latin</span> name because it is not important for our purposes here. <span class="time" data-times="7.62" data-time="132.21">[02:12.21]</span>Uh, I'll call them Coppers and <span class="underline">Blues</span>, well, because most members of this family have blue or <span class="underline">copper</span> colored wings. <span class="time" data-times="4.26" data-time="139.83">[02:19.83]</span>I think this is one of the most interesting cases of <span class="underline">mutualism</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.13" data-time="144.09">[02:24.09]</span>These butterflies <span class="underline">require</span> the presence of ants to complete their life <span class="underline">cycle</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.88" data-time="149.22">[02:29.22]</span>Their <span class="underline">interaction</span> with ants is obligatory. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.47" data-time="152.1">[02:32.10]</span>So, this is what happens. <span class="time" data-times="8.38" data-time="154.57">[02:34.57]</span>A <span class="underline">female</span> butterfly of these Coppers and <span class="underline">Blues</span> will <span class="underline">lay</span> eggs only on <span class="underline">vegetation</span> where there are ants of a <span class="underline">particular</span> <span class="underline">species</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.45" data-time="162.95">[02:42.95]</span>The butterflies can smell, well, ants leave behind pheromones, a <span class="underline">special</span> chemical <span class="underline">signal</span>.<span class="time" data-times="11.94" data-time="169.4">[02:49.40]</span> The butterfly recognizes the ants' pheromones on the plant and then the newly hatched butterflies, the caterpillars will feed on this plant after they <span class="underline">hatch</span> from the eggs. <span class="time" data-times="8.2" data-time="181.34">[03:01.34]</span>As the <span class="underline">caterpillar</span> gets a little older and find <span class="underline">shelter</span> under nearby rocks or stones to protect itself from predators. <span class="time" data-times="12.46" data-time="189.54">[03:09.54]</span>It's always attended or escorted by ants. And it alwaysmakes its way back to the <span class="underline">host</span> plant to feed, guided by the ants, the ant escort service, so to speak. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.32" data-time="202">[03:22.00]</span>Now, why would the ants go <span class="underline">through</span> all this trouble? <span class="time" data-times="2.8" data-time="205.32">[03:25.32]</span>What's their <span class="underline">benefit</span>? Mary? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.51" data-time="208.12">[03:28.12]</span>Student:It's probably related to food? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.77" data-time="210.63">[03:30.63]</span>Professor:Uh-huh? You are onto something. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.53" data-time="212.4">[03:32.40]</span>Student:Ok, ants feed on sweet <span class="underline">stuff</span>, right? <span class="time" data-times="7" data-time="215.93">[03:35.93]</span>So the <span class="underline">caterpillar</span> must have some kind of <span class="underline">special</span> <span class="underline">access</span> to honey or sugars, or something like that. <span class="time" data-times="2.87" data-time="222.93">[03:42.93]</span>Maybe caterpillars produce honey somehow. <span class="time" data-times="3.16" data-time="225.8">[03:45.80]</span>On <span class="underline">second</span> thought, um, I'm probably way off. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.86" data-time="228.96">[03:48.96]</span>Professor:You are <span class="underline">pretty</span> close actually. <span class="time" data-times="6.11" data-time="230.82">[03:50.82]</span>The caterpillars have a honey <span class="underline">gland</span>, an organ that secretes an <span class="underline">amino</span> <span class="underline">acid</span> and <span class="underline">carbohydrate</span> <span class="underline">liquid</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.84" data-time="236.93">[03:56.93]</span>The <span class="underline">caterpillar</span> secretes the <span class="underline">liquid</span> from the honey <span class="underline">gland</span>, rather large quantities, enough to feed several ants.<span class="time" data-times="4.39" data-time="244.77">[04:04.77]</span>But what makes this relationship obligatory for the <span class="underline">caterpillar</span>?<span class="time" data-times="8.46" data-time="249.16">[04:09.16]</span>Well, if the ants don't feed regularly on the <span class="underline">liquid</span> from the <span class="underline">caterpillar</span>'s honey <span class="underline">gland</span>, the <span class="underline">gland</span> overloads and gets infected. <span class="time" data-times="7.63" data-time="257.62">[04:17.62]</span>The <span class="underline">infection</span> will kill the <span class="underline">caterpillar</span> and it will never <span class="underline">reach</span> its final <span class="underline">stage</span> of <span class="underline">development</span>, becoming a butterfly.John? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.39" data-time="265.25">[04:25.25]</span>Student:Ok, I just want to make sure I'm following here. <span class="time" data-times="5.49" data-time="268.64">[04:28.64]</span>The <span class="underline">caterpillar</span> needs the ants or it won't make it to the <span class="underline">stage</span> where it can become a butterfly. <span class="time" data-times="4.49" data-time="274.13">[04:34.13]</span>And the ants do this because they get an easy meal out of it, right? <span class="time" data-times="6.61" data-time="278.62">[04:38.62]</span>But the ants don't <span class="underline">absolutely</span> need the <span class="underline">caterpillar</span> for <span class="underline">survival</span>, 'cause they can get food from other places right? <span class="time" data-times="6.37" data-time="285.23">[04:45.23]</span>So it's still called <span class="underline">mutualism</span> <span class="underline">even</span> though it seems like the <span class="underline">caterpillar</span>'s getting way more out of it. <span class="time" data-times="3.85" data-time="291.6">[04:51.60]</span>Oh, wait, you said they don't have to equally <span class="underline">benefit</span>. <span class="time" data-times="1.55" data-time="295.45">[04:55.45]</span>Never <span class="underline">mind</span>, sorry. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.49" data-time="297">[04:57.00]</span>Professor:Yes. But there is a type of <span class="underline">mutualism</span> where the relationship is necessary for both organisms to <span class="underline">survive</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.5" data-time="303.49">[05:03.49]</span>It's called obligatory <span class="underline">mutualism</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="305.99">[05:05.99]</span>And we'll talk about that in the next class. </p>
