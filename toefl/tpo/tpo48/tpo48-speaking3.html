          <h4 class="w3-center">An Art Museum at the University</h4>
          <p>Many universities have their own art museums, with collections of paintings and sculptures by well-known artists. I think our university should create a similar museum on our own campus. Such a museum would give our students an opportunity to learn to appreciate high-quality fine art. It would be a great way for us to see artworks that we might not have access to other wise. In order to pay for the museum, the university could write letters to alumni asking them to donate money to help build the museum. I'm sure many former students love art and would be glad to donate money to help the university build a museum here.SincerelyDiane Miller</p>

          <p>Listen to two students discussing the letter.</p>
          <p>Woman:Did you see this letter?</p>
          <p>Man:Yeah. It's a nice idea, but it'll never happen.</p>
          <p>Woman:Why do you say that?</p>
          <p>Man:Well, first of all, you can get on a bus right here on campus and in half an hour, you are downtown at the county art museum.</p>
          <p>Woman:That's true.</p>
          <p>Man:And if you show you student ID card, it only costs like two bucks to get in.</p>
          <p>Woman:Yeah. In fact, on Mondays, students get in for free.</p>
          <p>Man:Right. And you can see some of the greatest art in the world there. For example, you know Rembrandt, the famous Dutch painter?</p>
          <p>Woman:Yeah.</p>
          <p>Man:Well, right now they're showing something like twenty of his paintings.</p>
          <p>Woman:Wow!</p>
          <p>Man:Yeah. And you know, it's true. We do have a lot of very generous alumni. But we're already asking them for help building a new student center and a new library. And those are both very expensive projects.</p>
          <p>Woman:Yeah. That's right.</p>
          <p>Man:So I don't think we can expect them to donate much money for anything else anytime soon, especially for something we don't really need.</p>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p> It is suggested by the student that the university should construct an art museum on campus for students to appreciate high-quality fine works, the capital of which alumni can be invited to make a contribution to. The man in the conversation does not agree with the proposal. First of all, it takes only half an hour to go by bus from campus to the downtown art museum where pictures from masters such as Rembrandt will be exhibited. For students, it is free on Mondays and charges as little as two bucks on other days. Secondly, although alumni are bounteous, they have already shoulder the responsibility of a new student center and a new library, the two costly projects.</p>
