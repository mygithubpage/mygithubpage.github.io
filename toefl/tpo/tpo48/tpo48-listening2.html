              <span class="time" data-times="3.99" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a talk in an art <span class="underline">history</span> class.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.45" data-time="3.99">[00:03.99]</span>Professor:So today we are going to continue our discussion of 20th <span class="underline">century</span> <span class="underline">photography</span> in the United States. <span class="time" data-times="9.4" data-time="11.44">[00:11.44]</span>Last time we were talking about Alfred Stieglitz and we saw that one of his goals was to introduce Americans to European Art. <span class="time" data-times="7.79" data-time="20.84">[00:20.84]</span>Today, we are going to look at another photographer from the early 20th <span class="underline">century</span>. Yes, Jennifer?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.42" data-time="28.63">[00:28.63]</span>Student:Before we get to that, I had a question about Stieglitz.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="0.73" data-time="32.05">[00:32.05]</span>Professor:Sure.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.16" data-time="32.78">[00:32.78]</span>Student:Well, Stieglitz was married to Georgia O'Keeffe. Right?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.68" data-time="35.94">[00:35.94]</span>Professor:That's right. Stieglitz was married to her, promoted her work and actually, took some amazing portraits of her when they were married.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.06" data-time="43.62">[00:43.62]</span>Professor:For anyone who's not <span class="underline">familiar</span> with this, we are talking about the American painter: Georgia O'Keeffe.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.39" data-time="50.68">[00:50.68]</span>Student:Ok. Well, I was wondering...Georgia O'Keeffe. <span class="time" data-times="4.05" data-time="54.07">[00:54.07]</span>You know I've heard her name so many times and I've seen some of her work. <span class="time" data-times="4.08" data-time="58.12">[00:58.12]</span>But she's not mentioned in any of our reading about photographers from that time.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.18" data-time="62.2">[01:02.20]</span>Professor:Oh. Well, O'Keeffe was really more of a painter.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.19" data-time="66.38">[01:06.38]</span>Student: I thought she was a photographer, too. <span class="time" data-times="3.71" data-time="68.57">[01:08.57]</span>I mean, I just saw one of her photographs in a museum the other day.<span class="time" data-times="4.39" data-time="72.28">[01:12.28]</span> I think it was called "Red Leaves on White" or something like that.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.27" data-time="76.67">[01:16.67]</span>Professor:Oh, right! Yes. "Large Dark Red Leaves on White" is the complete title. <span class="time" data-times="3.76" data-time="82.94">[01:22.94]</span>It's a <span class="underline">fairly</span> well-known painting by O'Keeffe.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.28" data-time="86.7">[01:26.70]</span>Student:Oh, oh, okay. What was I thinking? <span class="time" data-times="1.11" data-time="90.98">[01:30.98]</span>I guess I should have had a closer look.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.81" data-time="92.09">[01:32.09]</span>Professor:No, no. That's a really good <span class="underline">observation</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.21" data-time="95.9">[01:35.90]</span>I mean chronologically that would be impossible. <span class="time" data-times="4.28" data-time="99.11">[01:39.11]</span>When she did that painting, color <span class="underline">film</span> hadn't <span class="underline">even</span> been invented yet. <span class="time" data-times="5.59" data-time="103.39">[01:43.39]</span>Neither had the right technology to blow pictures up that big to show that much <span class="underline">detail</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.24" data-time="108.98">[01:48.98]</span>But that painting and some of her other paintings do <span class="underline">reveal</span> the...the influence of <span class="underline">photography</span>, like, uh, she would crop her images. <span class="time" data-times="14.14" data-time="119.22">[01:59.22]</span>She would make a <span class="underline">frame</span> around part of an <span class="underline">image</span>, say, just the very center and then cut off certain parts, the parts outside that <span class="underline">frame</span>, to create the effect she <span class="underline">wanted</span>, the way a photographer does. <span class="time" data-times="7.6" data-time="133.36">[02:13.36]</span>And those paintings are close-ups, like you might see today, of a person or a flower in a <span class="underline">photograph</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.95" data-time="140.96">[02:20.96]</span>Now, those techniques were certainly around and being used by photographers then. <span class="time" data-times="5.49" data-time="146.91">[02:26.91]</span>But just in photographs, which were smaller not as big as what O'Keeffe was painting.<span class="time" data-times="6.06" data-time="152.4">[02:32.40]</span>Also, O'Keeffe studied under an artist named Arthur Wesley Dow. <span class="time" data-times="7.26" data-time="158.46">[02:38.46]</span>That's DOW, D-O-W, who advocated focusing on simple <span class="underline">basic</span> forms, <span class="time" data-times="7.47" data-time="165.72">[02:45.72]</span>like the lines of a flower and its petals and he <span class="underline">wanted</span> forms to be <span class="underline">isolated</span> from their <span class="underline">original</span> settings.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.08" data-time="173.19">[02:53.19]</span>He believed that, by doing that, an artist could <span class="underline">reveal</span> an object's, its <span class="underline">essence</span>. <span class="time" data-times="18.39" data-time="180.27">[03:00.27]</span>He'd do things like...like... have his students take a simple ordinary form, like a leaf, and <span class="underline">explore</span> various ways of fitting all of it into a <span class="underline">square</span>, maybe bending it around to make the whole thing fit into the <span class="underline">frame</span>. Pierr?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.48" data-time="198.66">[03:18.66]</span>Student:It sounds like maybe O'Keeffe borrowed most of her ideas. <span class="time" data-times="4.25" data-time="202.14">[03:22.14]</span>The <span class="underline">stuff</span> we might think of as being hers, she got them from other people. <span class="time" data-times="2.62" data-time="206.39">[03:26.39]</span>She didn't really have a style of her own.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.72" data-time="209.01">[03:29.01]</span>Professor:Well, <span class="underline">virtually</span>, all artists are influenced by other artists, by their predecessors, by their contemporaries, their teachers...</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="13.06" data-time="217.73">[03:37.73]</span>Artists build on what other artists have done. But if they are talented, they take it in some <span class="underline">unique</span> direction to develop their own <span class="underline">distinctive</span> style.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.17" data-time="230.79">[03:50.79]</span>O'Keeffe liked to create <span class="underline">abstract</span> interpretations of real objects. <span class="time" data-times="13.95" data-time="236.96">[03:56.96]</span>In the painting Jennifer mentioned, Large Dark Red Leaves on White, in <span class="underline">addition</span> to exaggerating the size of the leaf, O'Keeffe juxtaposes it against a silver or whitish background. <span class="time" data-times="5.17" data-time="250.91">[04:10.91]</span>So that's more of an <span class="underline">abstract</span> <span class="underline">setting</span> for it, and so on.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="12.91" data-time="256.08">[04:16.08]</span>Now, O'Keeffe wasn't the first artist to create an <span class="underline">abstract</span> <span class="underline">interpretation</span> of a real object but she used that <span class="underline">approach</span> to express her experience of the object she was painting. <span class="time" data-times="4.41" data-time="268.99">[04:28.99]</span>So she presented a <span class="underline">vision</span> that people hadn't seen before. <span class="time" data-times="3.03" data-time="273.4">[04:33.40]</span>It's <span class="underline">unique</span>. It's <span class="underline">compelling</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.7" data-time="276.43">[04:36.43]</span>She didn't <span class="underline">expect</span> other people to experience the object the way she did. <span class="time" data-times="7.65" data-time="281.13">[04:41.13]</span>She knew they'd look at her painting and hang their own associations on it, which is true for artwork in general, I think. <span class="time" data-times="2.98" data-time="288.78">[04:48.78]</span>That's just the way the human brain works. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="291.76">[04:51.76]</span>But at <span class="underline">least</span> they'd be taking a careful look at something they'd never really paid much <span class="underline">attention</span> to.</p>
