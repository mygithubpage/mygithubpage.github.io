            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.68" data-time="4.6">[00:04.60]</span>Professor:We have been talking about the <span class="underline">transformation</span>-the <span class="underline">industrialization</span> of United States <span class="underline">economy</span> in 19th <span class="underline">century</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.94" data-time="12.28">[00:12.28]</span>As the country shifted from an agricultural to an <span class="underline">industrial</span> <span class="underline">base</span>, <span class="underline">political</span> power shifted too. <span class="time" data-times="8.78" data-time="20.22">[00:20.22]</span>Businesses became... a lot of power went...went...went...went from the <span class="underline">government</span> into the hands of business leaders. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="16.2" data-time="29">[00:29.00]</span>So, why did this happen? How did an elite group, a few business giants, how did they end up dominating, controlling a number of important national industries in the last quarter of the 19th <span class="underline">century</span>? <span class="time" data-times="2.8" data-time="45.2">[00:45.20]</span>How did they get to be so <span class="underline">dominant</span>? <span class="time" data-times="3" data-time="48">[00:48.00]</span>How did they <span class="underline">figure</span> out? <span class="time" data-times="6" data-time="51">[00:51.00]</span>How did they take <span class="underline">advantage</span> of the new <span class="underline">industrialization</span> of American society? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.79" data-time="57">[00:57.00]</span>Well, <span class="underline">consider</span> the example of Andrew Carnegie and the <span class="underline">steel</span> <span class="underline">industry</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.9" data-time="63.79">[01:03.79]</span>We have already discussed the <span class="underline">development</span> of a national network...a national system of railroads. <span class="time" data-times="5.75" data-time="69.69">[01:09.69]</span>Well, this growth created a <span class="underline">tremendous</span> demand for <span class="underline">steel</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.49" data-time="75.44">[01:15.44]</span>A national <span class="underline">railroad</span> system needs a lot of <span class="underline">railroad</span> tracks, right? <span class="time" data-times="2.93" data-time="79.93">[01:19.93]</span>And Carnegie seized the <span class="underline">opportunity</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.14" data-time="82.86">[1:22.86]</span>He built the world's most modern <span class="underline">steel</span> <span class="underline">mill</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.99" data-time="86">[01:26.00]</span>And he came up with a system of business <span class="underline">organization</span> called Vertical Integration. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="11.86" data-time="93.99">[01:33.99]</span>Vertical Integration just means that...all...every single <span class="underline">activity</span> of a <span class="underline">particular</span> <span class="underline">industry</span>'s processing is performed by a single <span class="underline">company</span>. <span class="time" data-times="14.52" data-time="105.85">[01:45.85]</span>In the case of the <span class="underline">steel</span> <span class="underline">industry</span>, this means the <span class="underline">mining</span> of iron <span class="underline">ore</span>, the <span class="underline">transportation</span> used to get <span class="underline">ore</span> from the <span class="underline">mine</span> to the <span class="underline">mill</span>, turning the <span class="underline">ore</span> into the <span class="underline">steel</span>, the manufacturing <span class="underline">process</span> and sales. <span class="time" data-times="2.63" data-time="120.37">[02:00.37]</span>Carnegie controlled all of these. <span class="time" data-times="8.66" data-time="123">[02:03.00]</span>He practiced Vertical Integration on such a large <span class="underline">scale</span> that he <span class="underline">practically</span> owned the whole <span class="underline">steel</span> <span class="underline">industry</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.23" data-time="131.66">[02:11.66]</span>This, of <span class="underline">course</span>, gave him a lot of <span class="underline">political</span> clout. <span class="time" data-times="2.9" data-time="135.89">[2:15.89]</span>Just a quick <span class="underline">sketch</span>, but you get the idea, right? <span class="time" data-times="4.39" data-time="138.79">[2:18.79]</span>Here is another example: John D. Rockefeller. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.16" data-time="143.18">[02:23.18]</span>Rockefeller owned an oil refinery, but he <span class="underline">wanted</span> to <span class="underline">expand</span> his business. <span class="time" data-times="8.78" data-time="149.34">[02:29.34]</span>Since there was lots of competition in the <span class="underline">industry</span>, he thought the smart way to go about it would be to buy his competitors' businesses. <span class="time" data-times="5.59" data-time="158.12">[02:38.12]</span>But at the time it was illegal for one corporation to control another. <span class="time" data-times="7" data-time="163.71">[02:43.71]</span>So what he did was: he created an organizational structure called a trust. <span class="time" data-times="3.79" data-time="170.71">[2:50.71]</span>A trust is... well I don't have to go into that now. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.3" data-time="174.5">[02:54.50]</span>What matters is that a trust created a single, central <span class="underline">management</span> team. <span class="time" data-times="8.61" data-time="181.8">[03:01.80]</span>And that team directed the activities of what <span class="underline">otherwise</span> still appeared to be <span class="underline">independent</span> companies. <span class="time" data-times="16.59" data-time="190.41">[03:10.41]</span>This new...uh...legal entity worked so well that at one point Rockefeller controlled 90% of the country's oil refineries, which again gave him lots of <span class="underline">political</span> power. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.2" data-time="207">[03:27.00]</span>So you've got two different approaches to expanding a business, and both were quite <span class="underline">effective</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.8" data-time="213.2">[3:33.20]</span>Of <span class="underline">course</span>, these weren't the only two examples. <span class="time" data-times="10.87" data-time="217">[03:37.00]</span>A number of big businesses run by powerful individuals developed <span class="underline">across</span> a wide <span class="underline">range</span> of industries, like railroads, food processing, <span class="underline">electricity</span>. <span class="time" data-times="10.13" data-time="227.87">[03:47.87]</span>But what they all had in <span class="underline">common</span> was: the <span class="underline">government</span> let them <span class="underline">operate</span> <span class="underline">pretty</span> much how they <span class="underline">wanted</span> to. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.83" data-time="238">[03:58.00]</span>So why did they do that ? <span class="time" data-times="9.04" data-time="239.83">[3:59.83]</span>Why did the <span class="underline">government</span> keep such a low profile and allow individuals to gain so much control of the industries? <span class="time" data-times="7.13" data-time="248.87">[04:08.87]</span>Well, <span class="underline">obviously</span>, they had the wealth and the power to influence <span class="underline">political</span> leaders. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.29" data-time="256">[04:16.00]</span>But also, the truth is that these <span class="underline">industry</span> leaders made a <span class="underline">significant</span> <span class="underline">contribution</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9.51" data-time="263.29">[04:23.29]</span>Their investments in technologies led to the <span class="underline">development</span> of many new production techniques, which strengthened the <span class="underline">economy</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.62" data-time="272.8">[04:32.80]</span>And many of them gave lots of money to <span class="underline">charity</span>. Andrew Carnegie was particularly admired for his generosity. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.97" data-time="281.42">[04:41.42]</span>But there was one thing in <span class="underline">particular</span> that gave them power.<span class="time" data-times="20.11" data-time="285.39">[04:45.39]</span> And that's they were beneficiaries, probably the biggest beneficiaries of a <span class="underline">theory</span>, a <span class="underline">dominant</span> <span class="underline">political</span> <span class="underline">theory</span> in the 19th <span class="underline">century</span>, something called Laissez-faire <span class="underline">roughly</span> means "let it alone". <span class="time" data-times="4.5" data-time="305.5">[05:05.50]</span>And that <span class="underline">pretty</span> much summarized the <span class="underline">theory</span>'s <span class="underline">philosophy</span>.<span class="time" data-times="7.99" data-time="310">[05:10.00]</span> The idea was that <span class="underline">government</span> should leave business alone, allow it to <span class="underline">operate</span> unregulated.<span class="time" data-times="7.21" data-time="317.99">[05:17.99]</span> Legislators weren't supposed to pass a lot of laws, or worry about regulating business practices.<span class="time" data-times="13.43" data-time="325.2">[05:25.20]</span> When people did <span class="underline">challenge</span> a <span class="underline">company</span>'s business <span class="underline">conduct</span>, I mean, I mean, in <span class="underline">court</span> cases, well, the few laws that did exist were usually interpreted in <span class="underline">favor</span> of business interests. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.37" data-time="338.63">[05:38.63]</span>But over time, it started becoming increasingly <span class="underline">obvious</span> and troubling to the public that some of these big companies <span class="underline">simply</span> had too much control. <span class="time" data-times="11.67" data-time="349">[05:49.00]</span>There were criticisms that owners had too much <span class="underline">opportunity</span> to <span class="underline">exploit</span> workers, workers and consumers, because they could control prices and wages. <span class="time" data-times="4.55" data-time="360.67">[06:00.67]</span>And small business owners and small farmers couldn't <span class="underline">compete</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.84" data-time="365.22">[06:05.22]</span>So there was bad <span class="underline">press</span>, bad publicity, enough that the <span class="underline">government</span> <span class="underline">eventually</span> felt it had to do something. <span class="time" data-times="4.36" data-time="373.06">[06:13.06]</span>So it passed two key pieces of <span class="underline">legislation</span>. <span class="time" data-times="10.21" data-time="377.42">[06:17.42]</span>One law was designed to <span class="underline">regulate</span> the prices set by the railroads; another made it illegal for trusts to be used to limit competition. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="387.63">[06:27.63]</span>Both were aimed squarely at reducing the <span class="underline">exclusive</span> control that existed in some industries. </p>
