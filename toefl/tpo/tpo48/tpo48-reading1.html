            <b>Chinese Population Growth</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>Increases in <span class="underline">population</span> have usually been accompanied (indeed facilitated) by an increase in <span class="underline">trade</span>. <span class="light">In the Western experience, <span class="underline">commerce</span> provided the conditions that allowed <span class="underline">industrialization</span> to get started, which in turn led to growth in science, technology, <span class="underline">industry</span>, <span class="underline">transport</span>, communications, social change, and the like that we group under the <span class="underline">broad</span> <span class="underline">term</span> of "<span class="underline">development</span>."</span> However, the <span class="underline">massive</span> increase in <span class="underline">population</span> that in Europe was at first attributed to <span class="underline">industrialization</span> starting in the eighteenth <span class="underline">century</span> occurred also and at the same period in China, <span class="underline">even</span> though there was no <span class="underline">comparable</span> <span class="underline">industrialization</span>.</p>
          <p>It is estimated that the Chinese <span class="underline">population</span> by 1600 was close to 150 million. The <span class="underline">transition</span> between the Ming and Qing dynasties (the seventeenth <span class="underline">century</span>) may have seen a <span class="underline">decline</span>, but from 1741 to 1851 the <span class="underline">annual</span> figures rose steadily and spectacularly, perhaps beginning with 143 million and ending with 432 million. If we accept these totals, we are confronted with a situation in which the Chinese <span class="underline">population</span> doubled in the 50 years from 1790 to 1840. If, with greater <span class="underline">caution</span>, we <span class="underline">assume</span> <span class="underline">lower</span> totals in the early eighteenth <span class="underline">century</span> and only 400 million in 1850, we still face a <span class="underline">startling</span> fact: something like a doubling of the <span class="underline">vast</span> Chinese <span class="underline">population</span> in the <span class="underline">century</span> before Western <span class="underline">contact</span>, foreign <span class="underline">trade</span>, and <span class="underline">industrialization</span> could have had much effect.</p>
          <p>To explain this sudden increase we cannot point to factors <span class="underline">constant</span> in Chinese society but must find conditions or a <span class="underline">combination</span> of factors that were newly <span class="underline">effective</span> in this period. Among these is the almost complete <span class="underline">internal</span> peace maintained under Manchu rule during the eighteenth <span class="underline">century</span>. There was also an increase in foreign <span class="underline">trade</span> <span class="underline">through</span> Guangzhou (southern China) and some improvement of <span class="underline">transportation</span> <span class="underline">within</span> the <span class="underline">empire</span>. Control of <span class="underline">disease</span>, like the checking of smallpox by variolation may have been important. But of most <span class="underline">critical</span> importance was the food <span class="underline">supply</span>.</p>
          <p>Confronted with a <span class="underline">multitude</span> of unreliable figures, economists have compared the <span class="underline">population</span> records with the <span class="underline">aggregate</span> <span class="underline">data</span> for <span class="underline">cultivated</span> land area and <span class="underline">grain</span> production in the six centuries since 1368. Assuming that China's <span class="underline">population</span> in 1400 was about 80 million, the economist Dwight Perkins concludes that its growth to 700 million or more in the 1960s was made possible by a <span class="underline">steady</span> increase in the <span class="underline">grain</span> <span class="underline">supply</span>, which evidently grew five or six times between 1400 and 1800 and rose another 50 percent between 1800 and 1965. This increase of food <span class="underline">supply</span> was <span class="underline">due</span> perhaps half to the increase of <span class="underline">cultivated</span> area, particularly by <span class="underline">migration</span> and <span class="underline">settlement</span> in the central and western provinces, and half to greater <span class="underline">productivity</span> - the farmers' success in raising more crops per unit of land.</p>
          <p>This <span class="underline">technological</span> <span class="underline">advance</span> took many forms: one was the <span class="underline">continual</span> <span class="underline">introduction</span> from the south of earlier-ripening varieties of rice, which made possible double-cropping (the production of two harvests per year from one <span class="underline">field</span>). <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> New crops such as corn (<span class="underline">maize</span>) and sweet potatoes as well as peanuts and tobacco were introduced from the Americas. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> Corn, for <span class="underline">instance</span>, can be grown on the dry soil and marginal hill land of North China, where it is used for food, <span class="underline">fuel</span>, and fodder and provides something like one-seventh of the food energy <span class="underline">available</span> in the area. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span> The sweet potato, growing in sandy soil and providing more food energy per unit of land than other crops, became the main food of the poor in much of the South China rice area. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p>
          <p>
            <span class="underline">Productivity</span> in <span class="underline">agriculture</span> was also improved by capital investments, first of all in <span class="underline">irrigation</span>. From 1400 to 1900 the total of irrigated land seems to have increased almost three times. There was also a gain in farm tools, <span class="underline">draft</span> animals, and <span class="underline">fertilizer</span>, to say nothing of the <span class="underline">population</span> growth itself, which increased half again as fast as <span class="underline">cultivated</span> land area and so increased the <span class="underline">ratio</span> of human hands <span class="underline">available</span> per unit of land. Thus the rising <span class="underline">population</span> was fed by a more <span class="underline">intensive</span> <span class="underline">agriculture</span>, applying more labor and <span class="underline">fertilizer</span> to the land.</p>
