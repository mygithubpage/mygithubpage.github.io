Other people prefer to shop in small specialty stores or shops. Which do you prefer? Explain why.</p></section><section id="sample-response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><article><p>I favor department stores more than those small specialty stores. One reason is that all what I want can be purchased from large shopping malls, so it is an ideal place for me to buy dresses, tops, shorts, bags and shoes at the same time. Another reason is that other entertainment facilities can also be offered by shopping centers. When bored and tired, my parents or friends can go to café or restaurant and treat ourselves with a movie afterwards.</p></article></section></main></body></html>
