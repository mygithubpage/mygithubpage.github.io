Cindy. You look happy. Making plans for the summer vacation?</p><p>Woman:I'm just glad the semester is finally over. I just finished my final exam, so I'm taking off for summer vacation tomorrow. Aren't you?</p><p>Man:I wish.</p><p>Woman:What do you mean?</p><p>Man:I have to rewrite the lab report for my biology class. I guess I did it all wrong. So the professor's making me rewrite it before he'll submit a final grade.</p><p>Woman:I guess that's better than if he just gave you a bad grade on it, right?</p><p>Man:I guess so. But I was planning on leaving town tomorrow too, and now I'm not sure I can. I spoke with the professor and he gave me two options. I can either turn in the revised report in one week and get my grade, or he said I can wait, you know, taking incomplete in the class and submit the paper next semester in the fall.</p><p>Woman:So are you going to stay around to revise the report?</p><p>Man:I could. I'd get the grade for the class on time and I wouldn't have to think about it anymore. But there's a family reunion this weekend. I was really looking forward to it. If I stay around to revise the report, I'll miss the reunion.</p><p>Woman:Well, maybe you should take your time and work on the report over the summer. You can submit it when you return in the fall semester and get your grade then.</p><p>Man:That would be fine, but what if I need materials from the library to revise the report? I don't know if I'll be able to find the materials at the library at home.</p><p>Woman:Hmm...</p></article><section id="question"><h4>Question</h4><p>Briefly summarize the problem the speakers are discussing. Then state which solution you would recommend. Explain the reasons for your recommendation. </p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>The man is going to enjoy his summer vacation and have a family reunion this weekend. The problem is that he is required by the professor to rewrite the lab report for biology class before having a final grade. </p><p>To solve the problem, the man can rewrite the report either on weekends or during the summer holiday. I prefer the second solution. I believe a qualified report requires more than a weekend to prepare, organize and complete. The shortcoming of lack of material at home can be overcome by borrowing books ahead of time in library. On the other hand, dashing off the report will lose the opportunity of family reunion and ruin the chance of a better score. </p></article></div></main></body></html>
