            <b>Climate and Urban Development</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>The <span class="underline">urban</span> heat island is <span class="underline">due</span> to <span class="underline">industrial</span> and <span class="underline">urban</span> <span class="underline">development</span>. In <span class="underline">rural</span> areas, a large part of the <span class="underline">incoming</span> <span class="underline">solar</span> energy is used in evaporating water from <span class="underline">vegetation</span> and soil. In cities, where less <span class="underline">vegetation</span> and <span class="underline">exposed</span> soil exist, the <span class="underline">majority</span> of the Sun's energy is absorbed by <span class="underline">urban</span> structures and asphalt. Hence, during warm <span class="underline">daylight</span> hours, less <span class="underline">evaporative</span> cooling in cities allows surface temperatures to rise higher than in <span class="underline">rural</span> areas. The cause of the <span class="underline">urban</span> heat island is quite <span class="light">involved</span> Depending on the location, time of year, and time of day, any or all of the following differences between cities and their surroundings can be important: <span class="underline">albedo</span> (<span class="underline">reflectivity</span> of the surface), surface roughness, emissions of heat, emissions of <span class="underline">moisture</span>, and emissions of particles that <span class="underline">affect</span> net <span class="underline">radiation</span> and the growth of cloud droplets.</p>
          <p>At night, the <span class="underline">solar</span> energy (stored as <span class="underline">vast</span> quantities of heat in city buildings and roads) is slowly released into the city <span class="underline">air</span>. <span class="underline">Additional</span> city heat is <span class="underline">given</span> off at night (and during the day) by vehicles and factories, as well as by <span class="underline">industrial</span> and <span class="underline">domestic</span> heating and cooling units. The <span class="underline">release</span> of heat energy is retarded by the tall <span class="underline">vertical</span> city walls that do not allow <span class="underline">infrared</span> <span class="underline">radiation</span> to <span class="underline">escape</span> as <span class="underline">readily</span> as does the <span class="underline">relatively</span> <span class="underline">level</span> surface of the surrounding countryside. The slow <span class="underline">release</span> of heat tends to keep nighttime city temperatures higher than those of the faster-cooling <span class="underline">rural</span> areas. <span class="underline">Overall</span>, the heat island is strongest (1) at night when compensating sunlight is absent; (2) during the winter, when nights are longer and there is more heat generated in the city; and (3) when the <span class="underline">region</span> is dominated by a high-pressure area with light winds, <span class="underline">clear</span> skies, and less <span class="underline">humid</span> <span class="underline">air</span>. Over time, increasing <span class="underline">urban</span> heat islands <span class="underline">affect</span> climatological <span class="underline">temperature</span> records, producing <span class="underline">artificial</span> warming in <span class="underline">climatic</span> records taken in cities. This warming, <span class="underline">therefore</span>, must be accounted for in interpreting <span class="underline">climate</span> change over the past <span class="underline">century</span>.</p>
          <p>The <span class="underline">constant</span> outpouring of pollutants into the environment may influence the <span class="underline">climate</span> of the city. Certain particles <span class="underline">reflect</span> <span class="underline">solar</span> <span class="underline">radiation</span>, <span class="underline">thereby</span> reducing the sunlight that reaches the surface. Some particles serve as <span class="underline">nuclei</span> upon which water and ice form. Water <span class="underline">vapor</span> condenses onto these particles when the <span class="underline">relative</span> <span class="underline">humidity</span> is as low as 70 percent, forming haze that greatly reduces visibility. Moreover, the added <span class="underline">nuclei</span> increase the <span class="underline">frequency</span> of city fog.</p>
          <p>Studies suggest that <span class="underline">precipitation</span> may be greater in cities than in the surrounding countryside; this <span class="underline">phenomenon</span> may be <span class="underline">due</span> in part to the increased roughness of city <span class="underline">terrain</span>, brought on by large structures that cause surface <span class="underline">air</span> to slow and <span class="underline">gradually</span> <span class="underline">converge</span>. This piling up of <span class="underline">air</span> over the city then slowly rises, much like toothpaste does when its <span class="underline">tube</span> is squeezed. At the same time, city heat warms the surface <span class="underline">air</span>, making it more unstable, which enhances risings <span class="underline">air</span> motions, which, in turn, aids in forming clouds and thunderstorms. This <span class="underline">process</span> helps explain why both <span class="underline">tend</span> to be more frequent over cities.</p>
          <p>On <span class="underline">clear</span> still nights when the heat island is <span class="underline">pronounced</span>, a small <span class="underline">thermal</span> low-pressure area forms over the city. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>Sometimes a light <span class="underline">breeze</span>-called a country <span class="underline">breeze</span>-blows from the countryside into the city. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>If there are <span class="underline">major</span> <span class="underline">industrial</span> areas <span class="underline">along</span> the outskirts, pollutants are carried into the heat of town, where they <span class="underline">tend</span> to <span class="underline">concentrate</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>Such an event is especially probable if <span class="underline">vertical</span> mixing and dispersion of pollutants are inhibited. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>Pollutants from <span class="underline">urban</span> areas may <span class="underline">even</span> <span class="underline">affect</span> the weather downwind from them.</p>
