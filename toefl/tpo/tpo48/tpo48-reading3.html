In <span class="highlight">rural</span> areas, a large part of the <span class="highlight">incoming</span><span class="highlight">solar</span> energy is used in evaporating water from <span class="highlight">vegetation</span> and soil. In cities, where less <span class="highlight">vegetation</span> and <span class="highlight">exposed</span> soil exist, the <span class="highlight">majority</span> of the Sun's energy is absorbed by <span class="highlight">urban</span> structures and asphalt. Hence, during warm <span class="highlight">daylight</span> hours, less <span class="highlight">evaporative</span> cooling in cities allows surface temperatures to rise higher than in <span class="highlight">rural</span> areas. The cause of the <span class="highlight">urban</span> heat island is quite <span class="highlight question1">involved</span> Depending on the location, time of year, and time of day, any or all of the following differences between cities and their surroundings can be important: <span class="highlight">albedo</span> (<span class="highlight">reflectivity</span> of the surface), surface roughness, emissions of heat, emissions of <span class="highlight">moisture</span>, and emissions of particles that <span class="highlight">affect</span> net <span class="highlight">radiation</span> and the growth of cloud droplets.</p><p>At night, the <span class="highlight">solar</span> energy (stored as <span class="highlight">vast</span> quantities of heat in city buildings and roads) is slowly released into the city <span class="highlight">air</span>. <span class="highlight">Additional</span> city heat is <span class="highlight">given</span> off at night (and during the day) by vehicles and factories, as well as by <span class="highlight">industrial</span> and <span class="highlight">domestic</span> heating and cooling units. The <span class="highlight">release</span> of heat energy is <span class="question3">retarded</span> by the tall <span class="highlight">vertical</span> city walls that do not allow <span class="highlight">infrared</span><span class="highlight">radiation</span> to <span class="highlight">escape</span> as <span class="highlight">readily</span> as does the <span class="highlight">relatively</span><span class="highlight">level</span> surface of the surrounding countryside. The slow <span class="highlight">release</span> of heat tends to keep nighttime city temperatures higher than those of the faster-cooling <span class="highlight">rural</span> areas. <span class="highlight">Overall</span>, the heat island is strongest (1) at night when compensating sunlight is absent; (2) during the winter, when nights are longer and there is more heat generated in the city; and (3) when the <span class="highlight">region</span> is dominated by a high-pressure area with light winds, <span class="highlight">clear</span> skies, and less <span class="highlight">humid</span><span class="highlight">air</span>. Over time, increasing <span class="highlight">urban</span> heat islands <span class="highlight">affect</span> climatological <span class="highlight">temperature</span> records, producing <span class="highlight">artificial</span> warming in <span class="highlight">climatic</span> records taken in cities. This warming, <span class="highlight">therefore</span>, must be accounted for in interpreting <span class="highlight">climate</span> change over the past <span class="highlight">century</span>.</p><p>The <span class="highlight">constant</span> outpouring of pollutants into the environment may influence the <span class="highlight">climate</span> of the city. Certain particles <span class="highlight">reflect</span><span class="highlight">solar</span><span class="highlight">radiation</span>, <span class="highlight">thereby</span> reducing the sunlight that reaches the surface. Some particles serve as <span class="highlight">nuclei</span> upon which water and ice form. Water <span class="highlight">vapor</span> condenses onto these particles when the <span class="highlight">relative</span><span class="highlight">humidity</span> is as low as 70 percent, forming haze that greatly reduces visibility. Moreover, the added <span class="highlight">nuclei</span> increase the <span class="highlight">frequency</span> of city fog.</p><p><span class="question8">Studies suggest that <span class="highlight">precipitation</span> may be greater in cities than in the surrounding countryside; this <span class="highlight">phenomenon</span> may be <span class="highlight">due</span> in part to the increased roughness of city <span class="highlight">terrain</span>, brought on by large structures that cause surface <span class="highlight">air</span> to slow and <span class="highlight">gradually</span><span class="highlight">converge</span>.</span> This piling up of <span class="highlight">air</span> over the city then slowly rises, much like <span class="question9">toothpaste</span> does when its <span class="highlight">tube</span> is squeezed. At the same time, city heat warms the surface <span class="highlight">air</span>, making it more unstable, which enhances risings <span class="highlight">air</span> motions, which, in turn, aids in forming clouds and thunderstorms. This <span class="highlight">process</span> helps explain why <span class="question10">both</span><span class="highlight">tend</span> to be more frequent over cities.</p><p>On <span class="highlight">clear</span> still nights when the heat island is <span class="highlight"><span class="question11">pronounced</span></span>, a small <span class="highlight">thermal</span> low-pressure area forms over the city. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>Sometimes a light <span class="highlight">breeze</span>-called a country <span class="highlight">breeze</span>-blows from the countryside into the city. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>If there are <span class="highlight">major</span><span class="highlight">industrial</span> areas <span class="highlight">along</span> the outskirts, pollutants are carried into the heat of town, where they <span class="highlight">tend</span> to <span class="highlight">concentrate</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>Such an event is especially probable if <span class="highlight">vertical</span> mixing and dispersion of pollutants are inhibited. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>Pollutants from <span class="highlight">urban</span> areas may <span class="highlight">even</span><span class="highlight">affect</span> the weather downwind from them.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">involved</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. uncertain</p><p>B. complicated</p><p>C. common</p><p>D. clear</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Involved, complex.

In cities, ..., ... Sun's energy is absorbed by urban structures and asphalt, indicating that the sun can evaporate water from plants and soil, cooling the air, corresponding to option A. Medium: Solar energy causes evaporation from vegetation and soil, producing a cooling effect. The original At night, the solar energy (stored as ... heat in city buildings and roads) is slowly released into the city air, which means that the solar energy stored in buildings and roads at night is released into the air, corresponding to option D: Solar energy is stored Up in buildings and roads and emitted as heat during the night.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Paragraph 3 supports which of the following claims about the interpretation of temperature records?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The climate may not be warming as much as the increase of temperatures recorded in cities appears to suggest</p><p>B. Records show that the increase in urban heat islands has had a significant warming effect on the global climate</p><p>C. During most of the past century, temperature records have been misinterpreted</p><p>D. Scientists will not be able to account for climate change over the past century until they learn more about the urban heat island</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>This question is a detailed question. Position the last two sentences of this paragraph according to the stem position word "temperature record". The meaning of these two sentences is that with the passage of time, the intensified urban heat islands affect meteorological temperature records, causing artificial warming in the cities. Therefore, this artificial climate warming must be explained clearly when explaining the past climate change. It can be seen that the artificial climate warming factor is to be excluded when measuring the temperature of the city (but it was not ruled out in the past). The true temperature rise may not be as severe as the measurement (because warming up the artificial climate). Therefore, the A option is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>All of the following are mentioned in paragraph 3 as contributing to an increase in the amount of heat within a city EXCEPT</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. home air conditioners</p><p>B. cars and trucks</p><p>C. streetlights</p><p>D. factory buildings</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The original ... heat ... by vehicles and factories, ... industrial and domestic heating and cooling units, indicating that the automobile factory and air conditioning are all factors, corresponding to the option ABD.

Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Until more studies are done, suggestions about the causes of precipitation in cities will focus on the roughness of terrain rather than on surface air and convergence</p><p>B. Certain phenomena of city landscapes, such as large structures, cause surface air to slow and converge, which brings a change in weather patterns to cities and rural areas</p><p>C. One reason why precipitation may be greater in cities than in the countryside is that large buildings that are found in cities cause surface air to slow and converge</p><p>D. Studies that focus on large structures, which are only partly responsible for the increased roughness of city terrain, are incomplete in their explanation of increased precipitation</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The sentence means that the study shows that the urban rainfall is greater than the suburbs, because there are many tall buildings in the city that allow the air to slowly aggregate.
