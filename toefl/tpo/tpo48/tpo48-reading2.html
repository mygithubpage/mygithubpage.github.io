Many of these animals are also armed with sharp claws. The <span class="highlight">advantage</span> of teeth and claws as <span class="highlight">predatory</span> tools is <span class="highlight">obvious</span>. Now <span class="highlight">consider</span> animals like cows, horses, rabbits, and <span class="highlight">mice</span>. These animals have <span class="highlight">flat</span> teeth at the back of the <span class="highlight">jaw</span> that are <span class="highlight">analogous</span> to and have the same <span class="highlight">function</span> as grindstones. Unlike the meat-slicing and stabbing teeth of carnivores, the teeth of these animals <span class="highlight">grind</span> and shred plant <span class="highlight">material</span> before digestion.</p><p>More clues exist in other parts of the <span class="highlight">skull</span>. <span class="question4">The <span class="highlight">jaw</span><span class="highlight">joint</span> of carnivores such as dogs and cats has the <span class="highlight">mechanical</span><span class="highlight">advantage</span> of being at the same <span class="highlight">level</span> as the tooth row, allowing the jaws to close with <span class="highlight">tremendous</span> speed and forcing the upper teeth to occlude against the <span class="highlight">lower</span> teeth with great precision.</span> In <span class="highlight">herbivorous</span> animals, rapid <span class="highlight">jaw</span> closure is less important. Because the <span class="highlight">flat</span> teeth of herbivores work like grindstones, however, the jaws mush move both side to side and front to back. The <span class="highlight">jaw</span> joints of many <span class="highlight">advanced</span> herbivores, such as cows, lie at a different <span class="highlight">level</span> than the tooth row, allowing transverse tearing, shredding, and <span class="question5">compression</span> of plant <span class="highlight">material</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> If we <span class="highlight">extend</span> such observations to <span class="highlight">extinct</span> dinosaurs, we can infer <span class="highlight">dietary</span> preferences (such as carnivory and <span class="highlight">herbivory</span>), <span class="highlight">even</span> though we cannot <span class="highlight">determine</span> the <span class="highlight">exact</span><span class="highlight">diet</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> The duck-billed dinosaurs known as hadrosaurs are a good example of a group whose <span class="highlight">jaw</span><span class="highlight">joint</span> is below the <span class="highlight">level</span> of the tooth row, which probably helped them <span class="highlight">grind</span> up <span class="highlight">tough</span>, <span class="highlight">fibrous</span><span class="highlight">vegetation</span>.</p><p><span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>Paleontologists would like to be much more <span class="highlight">specific</span> about a <span class="highlight">dinosaur</span>'s <span class="highlight">diet</span> than <span class="highlight">simply</span> differentiating <span class="highlight">carnivore</span> from herbivore. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>This finer <span class="highlight">level</span> of <span class="highlight">resolution</span> requires direct <span class="highlight">fossil</span><span class="highlight">evidence</span> of <span class="highlight">dinosaur</span> meals. Stomach contents are only <span class="highlight">rarely</span> preserved, but when present, allow us to <span class="highlight">determine</span> exactly what these animals were eating.</p><p>In the stomach contents of specimens of Coelophysis (a small, long-necked <span class="highlight">dinosaur</span>) are bones from <span class="highlight">juvenile</span> animals of the same <span class="highlight">species</span>. At one time, these were thought to <span class="highlight">represent</span><span class="highlight">embryonic</span> animals, suggesting that this small <span class="highlight">dinosaur</span> gave birth to live young rather than laying eggs. Further research indicated that the small dinosaurs were too large and too well developed to be prehatching young. In <span class="highlight">addition</span>, the juveniles inside the body <span class="highlight">cavity</span> were of different sizes. All the <span class="highlight">evidence</span> points to the conclusion that these are the remains of <span class="highlight">prey</span> items and that, as an adult, Coelophysis was at <span class="highlight">least</span> in part a cannibal.</p><p>Fossilized stomach contents are not <span class="highlight"><span class="question8">restricted</span></span> to <span class="highlight">carnivorous</span> dinosaurs. In a few <span class="highlight">rare</span> cases, most of them "mummies" (unusually well preserved specimens), fossilized plant remains have been found inside the body <span class="highlight">cavity</span> of hadrosaurs. Some paleontologists have argued that these <span class="highlight">represent</span><span class="highlight">stream</span> accumulations rather than final meals. The best known of these cases is the <span class="highlight">second</span> Edmontosaurus mummy collected by the Sternbergs. In the chest <span class="highlight">cavity</span> of this <span class="highlight">specimen</span>, which is housed in the Senckenberg Museum in Germany, are the <span class="highlight">fossil</span> remains of <span class="highlight">conifer</span> needles, twigs, seeds, and fruits. <span class="highlight">Similar</span> finds in Corythosaurus specimens from Alberta, Canada, have also been reported, indicating that at <span class="highlight">least</span> two kinds of Late Cretaceous hadrosaurs fed on the sorts of tress that are <span class="highlight">common</span> in today's boreal woodlands.</p><p>A <span class="highlight">second</span> form of direct <span class="highlight">evidence</span> comes from coprolites (fossilized bodily <span class="highlight">waste</span>). Several <span class="highlight">dinosaur</span><span class="highlight">fossil</span> localities <span class="highlight">preserve</span> coprolites. Coprolites <span class="highlight">yield</span> unequivocal <span class="highlight">evidence</span> about the <span class="highlight">dietary</span> habits of dinosaurs. Many parts of plants and animals are extremely <span class="highlight">resistant</span> to the <span class="highlight">digestive</span> systems of animals and pass completely <span class="highlight">through</span> the body with little or no <span class="highlight">alteration</span>. Study of coprolites has indicated that the diets of some <span class="highlight">herbivorous</span> dinosaurs were <span class="highlight">relatively</span><span class="highlight"><span class="question10">diverse</span></span>, while other dinosaurs <span class="highlight">appear</span> to have been specialists, feeding on <span class="highlight">particular</span> types of plants. The problem with inferring diets from coprolites is the difficulty in accurately associating a <span class="highlight">particular</span> coprolite with a <span class="highlight">specific</span><span class="highlight">dinosaur</span>.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">Traditionally</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. typically</p><p>B. naturally</p><p>C. originally</p><p>D. partly</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>Traditionally means "traditionally, in general"; typically it means "usually; generally", so choose A.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 2, which of the following is true of the teeth of carnivores?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.
