          <h4 class="w3-center">Determining Dinosaur Diet</h4>
          <p>Determining what <span class="highlight">extinct</span> dinosaurs ate is difficult, but we can infer some aspects of their <span class="highlight">dietary</span> preferences. <span class="highlight question1">Traditionally</span> this information has been derived from direct <span class="highlight">evidence</span>, such as stomach contents, and indirect <span class="highlight">evidence</span>, such as establishing a correlation between <span class="highlight">particular</span> body characteristics and diets of living animals and then inferring habits for dinosaurs.</p>
          <p>Animals such as house cats and dogs have large, stabbing canine teeth at the front of the mouth and smaller, equally sharp teeth farther back in their jaws. Many of these animals are also armed with sharp claws. The <span class="highlight">advantage</span> of teeth and claws as <span class="highlight">predatory</span> tools is <span class="highlight">obvious</span>. Now <span class="highlight">consider</span> animals like cows, horses, rabbits, and <span class="highlight">mice</span>. These animals have <span class="highlight">flat</span> teeth at the back of the <span class="highlight">jaw</span> that are <span class="highlight">analogous</span> to and have the same <span class="highlight">function</span> as grindstones. Unlike the meat-slicing and stabbing teeth of carnivores, the teeth of these animals <span class="highlight">grind</span> and shred plant <span class="highlight">material</span> before digestion.</p>
          <p>More clues exist in other parts of the <span class="highlight">skull</span>. <span class="question4">The <span class="highlight">jaw</span> <span class="highlight">joint</span> of carnivores such as dogs and cats has the <span class="highlight">mechanical</span> <span class="highlight">advantage</span> of being at the same <span class="highlight">level</span> as the tooth row, allowing the jaws to close with <span class="highlight">tremendous</span> speed and forcing the upper teeth to occlude against the <span class="highlight">lower</span> teeth with great precision.</span> In <span class="highlight">herbivorous</span> animals, rapid <span class="highlight">jaw</span> closure is less important. Because the <span class="highlight">flat</span> teeth of herbivores work like grindstones, however, the jaws mush move both side to side and front to back. The <span class="highlight">jaw</span> joints of many <span class="highlight">advanced</span> herbivores, such as cows, lie at a different <span class="highlight">level</span> than the tooth row, allowing transverse tearing, shredding, and <span class="question5">compression</span> of plant <span class="highlight">material</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> If we <span class="highlight">extend</span> such observations to <span class="highlight">extinct</span> dinosaurs, we can infer <span class="highlight">dietary</span> preferences (such as carnivory and <span class="highlight">herbivory</span>), <span class="highlight">even</span> though we cannot <span class="highlight">determine</span> the <span class="highlight">exact</span> <span class="highlight">diet</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> The duck-billed dinosaurs known as hadrosaurs are a good example of a group whose <span class="highlight">jaw</span> <span class="highlight">joint</span> is below the <span class="highlight">level</span> of the tooth row, which probably helped them <span class="highlight">grind</span> up <span class="highlight">tough</span>, <span class="highlight">fibrous</span> <span class="highlight">vegetation</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C">
            </span>Paleontologists would like to be much more <span class="highlight">specific</span> about a <span class="highlight">dinosaur</span>'s <span class="highlight">diet</span> than <span class="highlight">simply</span> differentiating <span class="highlight">carnivore</span> from herbivore. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>This finer <span class="highlight">level</span> of <span class="highlight">resolution</span> requires direct <span class="highlight">fossil</span> <span class="highlight">evidence</span> of <span class="highlight">dinosaur</span> meals. Stomach contents are only <span class="highlight">rarely</span> preserved, but when present, allow us to <span class="highlight">determine</span> exactly what these animals were eating.</p>
          <p>In the stomach contents of specimens of Coelophysis (a small, long-necked <span class="highlight">dinosaur</span>) are bones from <span class="highlight">juvenile</span> animals of the same <span class="highlight">species</span>. At one time, these were thought to <span class="highlight">represent</span> <span class="highlight">embryonic</span> animals, suggesting that this small <span class="highlight">dinosaur</span> gave birth to live young rather than laying eggs. Further research indicated that the small dinosaurs were too large and too well developed to be prehatching young. In <span class="highlight">addition</span>, the juveniles inside the body <span class="highlight">cavity</span> were of different sizes. All the <span class="highlight">evidence</span> points to the conclusion that these are the remains of <span class="highlight">prey</span> items and that, as an adult, Coelophysis was at <span class="highlight">least</span> in part a cannibal.</p>
          <p>Fossilized stomach contents are not <span class="highlight"><span class="question8">restricted</span></span> to <span class="highlight">carnivorous</span> dinosaurs. In a few <span class="highlight">rare</span> cases, most of them "mummies" (unusually well preserved specimens), fossilized plant remains have been found inside the body <span class="highlight">cavity</span> of hadrosaurs. Some paleontologists have argued that these <span class="highlight">represent</span> <span class="highlight">stream</span> accumulations rather than final meals. The best known of these cases is the <span class="highlight">second</span> Edmontosaurus mummy collected by the Sternbergs. In the chest <span class="highlight">cavity</span> of this <span class="highlight">specimen</span>, which is housed in the Senckenberg Museum in Germany, are the <span class="highlight">fossil</span> remains of <span class="highlight">conifer</span> needles, twigs, seeds, and fruits. <span class="highlight">Similar</span> finds in Corythosaurus specimens from Alberta, Canada, have also been reported, indicating that at <span class="highlight">least</span> two kinds of Late Cretaceous hadrosaurs fed on the sorts of tress that are <span class="highlight">common</span> in today's boreal woodlands.</p>
          <p>A <span class="highlight">second</span> form of direct <span class="highlight">evidence</span> comes from coprolites (fossilized bodily <span class="highlight">waste</span>). Several <span class="highlight">dinosaur</span> <span class="highlight">fossil</span> localities <span class="highlight">preserve</span> coprolites. Coprolites <span class="highlight">yield</span> unequivocal <span class="highlight">evidence</span> about the <span class="highlight">dietary</span> habits of dinosaurs. Many parts of plants and animals are extremely <span class="highlight">resistant</span> to the <span class="highlight">digestive</span> systems of animals and pass completely <span class="highlight">through</span> the body with little or no <span class="highlight">alteration</span>. Study of coprolites has indicated that the diets of some <span class="highlight">herbivorous</span> dinosaurs were <span class="highlight">relatively</span> <span class="highlight"><span class="question10">diverse</span></span>, while other dinosaurs <span class="highlight">appear</span> to have been specialists, feeding on <span class="highlight">particular</span> types of plants. The problem with inferring diets from coprolites is the difficulty in accurately associating a <span class="highlight">particular</span> coprolite with a <span class="highlight">specific</span> <span class="highlight">dinosaur</span>.</p>
