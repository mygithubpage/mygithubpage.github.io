To ask for heap in choosing a topic for his term paper.</p><p>B. To ask the professor to explain how to complete an assignment.</p><p>C. To ask about a point raised in a recent lecture.</p><p>D. To offer to help the professor with her research project.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>But the idea that animals of the same species intentionally deceive each other,</p><p>I have never heard that before</p><p>From the dialogue we can see that the professor put forward a point of view in a recent lecture that attracted the interest of boys. Therefore, boys came to the professor to discuss this topic.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor mention male frogs that lower their voices?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To give an example of a behavior that can be predicted using game theory.</p><p>B. To reinforce the definition of "selective adaptation".</p><p>C. To give an example of deceptive behavior in animals.</p><p>D. To compare the behavior of butterflies and frogs.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Right, like, there are male frogs who lower their voices and end up sounding bigger than they really are.</p><p>From the dialogue, it can be known that the male students themselves have never heard that animals of the same type would deceive each other and the professor cited examples of male frogs to illustrate the fraud between animals.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor talk about computers?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To help the man understand game theory.</p><p>B. To describe how biologists analyze data about adaptation.</p><p>C. To suggest a way for the man to find information about game theory.</p><p>D. To explain the format required for the man's term paper.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>Student: Yeah, I can see how that might do the trick. But, anyway, what I wanted to ask was, when you started talking about game theory. Well, I know a little bit about it, but I am not clear about its Use in biology.</p><p>Professor: Yeah, it is fairly new to biology. Basically, it uses math to predict what an individual would do under certain circumstances. But for example, a business sells, oh computer, say, and they want to sell their computers to a big University. But there is another company bidding too. So, what should they do?</p><p>Boys said that their understanding of the biological use of game theory is not clear. The professor proposed examples of selling computers to help boys understand.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the man need to do for his term paper?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Interpret the statistical data in a journal article.</p><p>B. Summarize the information in several published studies.</p><p>C. Discuss a current controversy in biological research.</p><p>D. Design an experiment that uses game theory.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Professor: Well, you know, if you are interested in this topic, it would be perfect for your term paper.</p><p>Student: The literature review?</p><p>If there is a conflict in the conclusions or something, that would be important to discuss</p><p>From this dialogue, it can be seen that the professor directs the boys to read the articles, and if there is a conflict, the discussion is focused.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The man expresses reservations about the suggested topic for his term paper. What is the professor's attitude toward the man's reservations?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. She thinks the man has demonstrated the necessary background in statistics.</p><p>B. She thinks the man should choose a topic he is more comfortable with.</p><p>C. She thinks the man should ask another student to help him understand the statistics.</p><p>D. She thinks the man's worries are unnecessary.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>Professor: Well, I can point you to some that it is quite basic studies, that don't assume much background knowledge. You'll just need to answer assume a few specific questions: What was the researchers' hypothesis? What did they want to find Out? And how did they conduct their research? An then the conclusions they came to. Learning to interpret these statistics will come later.</p><p>From the dialogue, the professor thinks that boys only need to show some basic research and does not need a lot of background knowledge, so it can be inferred that she thinks that the boys do not need to worry.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
