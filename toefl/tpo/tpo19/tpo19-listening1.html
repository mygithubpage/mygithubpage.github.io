              <span class="time" data-times="6.5" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to a <span class="highlight">conversation</span> between a student and the professor. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.67" data-time="6.5">[00:06.50]</span>Student: Hi, professor Handerson. <span class="time" data-times="2.64" data-time="8.17">[00:08.17]</span>That was a really interesting lecture in class today. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.01" data-time="10.81">[00:10.81]</span>Professor: Thanks, Tom. <span class="time" data-times="6.3" data-time="11.82">[00:11.82]</span>Yeah, animals' use of <span class="highlight">deception</span>, ways they play tricks on other animals, that's a <span class="highlight">fascinating</span> area. <span class="time" data-times="2.39" data-time="18.12">[00:18.12]</span>One we are really just starting to understand. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.49" data-time="20.51">[00:20.51]</span>Student: Yeah, you know, <span class="highlight">selective</span> adaptations over time are one thing. <span class="time" data-times="5.17" data-time="25">[00:25.00]</span>Oh, like, non-poisonous butterflies that have come to look like <span class="highlight">poisonous</span> ones. <span class="time" data-times="6.7" data-time="30.17">[00:30.17]</span>But the idea that animals of the same <span class="highlight">species</span> <span class="highlight">intentionally</span> <span class="highlight">deceive</span> each other, I have never heard that before. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.62" data-time="36.87">[00:36.87]</span>Professor: Right, like, there are <span class="highlight">male</span> frogs who <span class="highlight">lower</span> their voices and end up sounding bigger than they really are. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.25" data-time="44.49">[00:44.49]</span>Student: So they do that to keep other frogs from invading their <span class="highlight">territory</span>? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.65" data-time="47.74">[00:47.74]</span>Professor: Right, bigger frogs have deeper voices, so if a smaller frog can <span class="highlight">imitate</span> that deep voice. Well ... </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.66" data-time="54.39">[00:54.39]</span>Student: Yeah, I can see how that might do the trick. <span class="time" data-times="6.53" data-time="57.05">[00:57.05]</span>But, anyway, what I <span class="highlight">wanted</span> to ask was, when you started talking about game <span class="highlight">theory</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.04" data-time="63.58">[01:03.58]</span>Well, I know a little bit about it, but I am not <span class="highlight">clear</span> about its use in <span class="highlight">biology</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.98" data-time="68.62">[01:08.62]</span>Professor: Yeah, it is <span class="highlight">fairly</span> new to <span class="highlight">biology</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.2" data-time="71.6">[01:11.60]</span>Basically, it uses math to <span class="highlight">predict</span> what an <span class="highlight">individual</span> would do under certain circumstances. <span class="time" data-times="8.01" data-time="78.8">[01:18.80]</span>But for example, a business sells, oh computer, say, and they want to sell their computers to a big university. <span class="time" data-times="2.4" data-time="86.81">[01:26.81]</span>But there is another <span class="highlight">company</span> bidding too. <span class="time" data-times="1.93" data-time="89.21">[01:29.21]</span>So, what should they do? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.46" data-time="91.14">[01:31.14]</span>Student: Well, try to <span class="highlight">offer</span> the lowest price so they can <span class="highlight">compete</span>, but still make money. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.11" data-time="95.6">[01:35.60]</span>Professor: Right, they are <span class="highlight">competing</span>, like a game, like the frogs. <span class="time" data-times="9.19" data-time="99.71">[01:39.71]</span>There are risks with pricing too high, the other <span class="highlight">company</span> might get the sale; there is also the number and types of computers to <span class="highlight">consider</span>.<span class="time" data-times="4.34" data-time="108.9">[01:48.90]</span>Each <span class="highlight">company</span> has to find a <span class="highlight">balance</span> between the <span class="highlight">cost</span> and benefits. <span class="time" data-times="8.05" data-time="113.24">[01:53.24]</span>Well, game <span class="highlight">theory</span> creates mathematical models that <span class="highlight">analyze</span> different conditions like this to <span class="highlight">predict</span> outcomes. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.67" data-time="121.29">[02:01.29]</span>Student: Ok, I get that. <span class="time" data-times="2.24" data-time="122.96">[02:02.96]</span>But how does it <span class="highlight">apply</span> to animals? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.33" data-time="125.2">[02:05.20]</span>Professor: Well, you know, if you are interested in this topic, it would be <span class="highlight">perfect</span> for your <span class="highlight">term</span> paper. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.31" data-time="130.53">[02:10.53]</span>Student: The <span class="highlight">literature</span> <span class="highlight">review</span>? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.45" data-time="131.84">[02:11.84]</span>Professor: Yeah, find three <span class="highlight">journal</span> articles about this or another topic that interests you and discuss them. <span class="time" data-times="4.5" data-time="138.29">[02:18.29]</span>If there is a <span class="highlight">conflict</span> in the conclusions or something, that would be important to discuss. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.05" data-time="142.79">[02:22.79]</span>Student: Well, from what I have looked at dealing with game <span class="highlight">theory</span>, I can't say I understand much of the statistics end. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.84" data-time="149.84">[02:29.84]</span>Professor: Well, I can point you to some that presents <span class="highlight">fairly</span> <span class="highlight">basic</span> studies, that don't <span class="highlight">assume</span> much background knowledge. <span class="time" data-times="5.54" data-time="156.68">[02:36.68]</span>You'll just need to answer a few <span class="highlight">specific</span> questions: What was the researchers' <span class="highlight">hypothesis</span>? <span class="time" data-times="1.88" data-time="162.22">[02:42.22]</span>What did they want to find out? <span class="time" data-times="2.53" data-time="164.1">[02:44.10]</span>And how did they <span class="highlight">conduct</span> their research? <span class="time" data-times="1.89" data-time="166.63">[02:46.63]</span>And then the conclusions they came to. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="168.52">[02:48.52]</span>Learning to <span class="highlight">interpret</span> these statistics will come later. </p>
