            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.56" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a discussion in an art <span class="underline">history</span> class. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.8" data-time="6.56">[00:06.56]</span>Professor: All right, let's continue our discussion of <span class="underline">portrait</span> artists (portraitist) and <span class="underline">portraiture</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.62" data-time="11.36">[00:11.36]</span>Who remembers any of the important points we made last time? Sandra? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="13.17" data-time="16.98">[00:16.98]</span>Student: Well, artists have done portraits of people for centuries, of famous people and <span class="underline">regular</span> people, and most portraits <span class="underline">convey</span> the artists' <span class="underline">personal</span> <span class="underline">vision</span>, like their feelings and insights about a person. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.93" data-time="30.15">[00:30.15]</span>Professor: Great, that's a <span class="underline">crucial</span> point, and I'd like to <span class="underline">explore</span> that a little today. <span class="time" data-times="6.28" data-time="35.08">[00:35.08]</span>A great example of that, that <span class="underline">vision</span> in <span class="underline">portraiture</span>, is Cecilia Beaux. <span class="time" data-times="13.37" data-time="41.36">[00:41.36]</span>Cecilia Beaux was born in 1854, and after learning to paint and studying with several important artists of the time, Beaux became known as one of the best <span class="underline">portrait</span> painters in the United States. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.72" data-time="54.73">[00:54.73]</span>She was very successful. <span class="time" data-times="5.7" data-time="56.45">[00:56.45]</span>She <span class="underline">even</span> had portraits of the wife and children of Theodore Roosevelt, while he was <span class="underline">president</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.05" data-time="62.15">[01:02.15]</span>Some did not get much more <span class="underline">prestige</span> than that. <span class="time" data-times="7.96" data-time="65.2">[01:05.20]</span>Now, those portraits also <span class="underline">reflect</span> the kind of subjects that Beaux tended to use, which were mostly women and children.<span class="time" data-times="8.23" data-time="73.16">[01:13.16]</span>For example, in her first <span class="underline">major</span> work, her subjects were ..., the painting featured her sister and her nephew. <span class="time" data-times="2.82" data-time="81.39">[01:21.39]</span>Yes, Mark? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.67" data-time="84.21">[01:24.21]</span>Student: Yeah, it just seems interesting. <span class="time" data-times="7.79" data-time="86.88">[01:26.88]</span>I was wondering if that was unusual to have a <span class="underline">portrait</span> artist who is a woman become so well-known and successful in the 19th <span class="underline">century</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.67" data-time="94.67">[01:34.67]</span>Professor: Great question. Yeah, she really stood out back in the 1800s. <span class="time" data-times="5.07" data-time="99.34">[01:39.34]</span>And today, she is still considered one of the greatest <span class="underline">portrait</span> painters of her time, <span class="underline">male</span> or <span class="underline">female</span>. <span class="time" data-times="11.21" data-time="104.41">[01:44.41]</span>In fact, she was the first full-time <span class="underline">female</span> <span class="underline">instructor</span> at the Pennsylvania <span class="underline">Academy</span> of the Fine Arts, and she was a full member of the National <span class="underline">Academy</span> of Design. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.22" data-time="115.62">[01:55.62]</span>These are <span class="underline">pretty</span> important institutions, so, yeah, she <span class="underline">definitely</span> made headway for women artists. <span class="time" data-times="4.27" data-time="121.84">[02:01.84]</span>Ok, so let's look at one of her portraits now. <span class="time" data-times="3.27" data-time="126.11">[02:06.11]</span>This painting is called The Dreamer. <span class="time" data-times="1.58" data-time="129.38">[02:09.38]</span>It is one of my favorites. <span class="time" data-times="3.57" data-time="130.96">[02:10.96]</span>And I think it is especially <span class="underline">characteristic</span> of Beaux's work. <span class="time" data-times="5.15" data-time="134.53">[02:14.53]</span>So what you see here is a <span class="underline">portrait</span> of a close friend of Cecilia Beaux. <span class="time" data-times="3.81" data-time="139.68">[02:19.68]</span>So tell me what's the first thing that draws you to this painting?<span class="time" data-times="2.46" data-time="143.49">[02:23.49]</span> What catches your eye first? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="12.01" data-time="145.95">[02:25.95]</span>Student: Well, for me, it is her face and hands, I think they are really <span class="underline">expressive</span>, and also, they make the woman <span class="underline">seem</span> very contemplative, seems like she is thinking <span class="underline">pretty</span> seriously about something. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.41" data-time="157.96">[02:37.96]</span>Student: Yeah, her eyes kind of <span class="underline">draw</span> you in. <span class="time" data-times="4.85" data-time="160.37">[02:40.37]</span>But what strikes me is the contrasting colors, the white <span class="underline">dress</span> and the dark background. <span class="time" data-times="6.49" data-time="165.22">[02:45.22]</span>It kind of reminds me of that painting we discussed a few weeks ago, by ...eh... John Singer Sargent. <span class="time" data-times="2.47" data-time="171.71">[02:51.71]</span>I think it was called Madame X? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.83" data-time="174.18">[02:54.18]</span>Professor: I agree, good point. <span class="time" data-times="3.11" data-time="176.01">[02:56.01]</span>Yes, Beaux had high regard for Sargent's work.<span class="time" data-times="4.98" data-time="179.12">[02:59.12]</span> And this is something, a <span class="underline">technique</span> you will find in both of their work. <span class="time" data-times="4.5" data-time="184.1">[03:04.10]</span>Ok, but the painting is called The Dreamer. <span class="time" data-times="2.7" data-time="188.6">[03:08.60]</span>What do you see is dreamlike about it? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.51" data-time="191.3">[03:11.30]</span>Student: Well, the background behind the woman is <span class="underline">pretty</span> <span class="underline">vague</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.47" data-time="195.81">[03:15.81]</span>Like, maybe there is no real <span class="underline">context</span>, like no <span class="underline">definite</span> surroundings, especially compared to the woman herself, since she is so <span class="underline">clear</span> and well-defined. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.97" data-time="204.28">[03:24.28]</span>Professor: Yes, the unclear background <span class="underline">definitely</span> contributes to that dreaminess. <span class="time" data-times="3" data-time="208.25">[03:28.25]</span>It is meant to show a <span class="underline">sense</span> of isolation I think. <span class="time" data-times="4.44" data-time="211.25">[03:31.25]</span>With the woman is deep in a daydream and not really <span class="underline">aware</span> of anything else. <span class="time" data-times="4.86" data-time="215.69">[03:35.69]</span>This painting shows how insightful Cecilia Beaux was as a <span class="underline">portrait</span> artist. <span class="time" data-times="8.2" data-time="220.55">[03:40.55]</span> <span class="underline">Besides</span> her excellent <span class="underline">technical</span> skills, like her use of <span class="underline">brush</span> strokes and color to make an <span class="underline">impression</span>, both <span class="underline">perspective</span> come <span class="underline">through</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.97" data-time="228.75">[03:48.75]</span>Her portraits <span class="underline">reveal</span> her own <span class="underline">interpretation</span> of her <span class="underline">subject</span>'s <span class="underline">state</span> of <span class="underline">mind</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.5" data-time="233.72">[03:53.72]</span>This is what it is all about, not just likenesses. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="12.64" data-time="237.22">[03:57.22]</span>Now, the undefined background also shows how Cecilia Beaux was influenced by the French Impressionists, who believed, like Beaux, in a <span class="underline">personal</span> rather than <span class="underline">conventional</span> <span class="underline">approach</span> to their <span class="underline">subject</span> matter. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="249.86">[04:09.86]</span>Beaux used some <span class="underline">impressionist</span> techniques and share much of their <span class="underline">philosophy</span>, but her style, it was all her own. </p>
