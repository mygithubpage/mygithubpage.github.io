The higher fee, which all students are required to pay, will provide funds to upgrade the facility and provide newer, more modern exercise equipment at the center. "We expect the improvements to increase student use of the facility," explained David Smith, director of the student activities office. Mr. Smith also noted that the decision was approved because "we feel that $25 is a reasonable increase that will be affordable for individual students."</p></article></section><div><audio src="tpo19-speaking3.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></div><section id="listening-text"><h3>Listening Text</h3><article><p>Now listen to two students discussing the article.</p><p>(man) Did you see this announcement in the newspaper? It sounds like a great idea.</p><p>(woman) You really think so? Not many people even use the place.</p><p>(man) I know, that's the point, people don't go there because the facilities are old and the exercise equipment breaks down. I think the director is right that they get more use out of it this way. Right now, the place is usually empty and that's too bad. Students can get pretty stressed out if they don't get some exercise.</p><p>(woman) That's a good point. But doesn't it seem like a lot of money?</p><p>(man) It's really not all that much, if you figured a lot of people spend that kind of money on a CD or when they go out to the movies, this is just one charge for the whole year.</p><p>(woman) That's true, and instead of some little thing we get a recreation center people might actually use.</p><p>(man) Right, so considering the benefits, it's really not that much to pay.</p><p>(woman) Yeah, I guess you're right.</p></article></section><section id="question"><h4>Question</h4><p>The man expresses his opinion of the university's plan. State his opinion and explain the reasons he gives for holding that opinion. </p></section><section id="sample-response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><article><p>Well, the man agrees with the university's plan for two main reasons. Firstly, he points out that students don't go to the recreation center mainly because the facilities there are old and excise equipment breaks down, but yet they need to get some exercise or they will get stressed out. The second reason from the man is that he thinks that the increased fee is not at all that much, compared with the money students spend on CDs or movies. This one-year-charge is really worth it considering the benefits. So based on the reasons stated above the man agrees with the university's plan.
