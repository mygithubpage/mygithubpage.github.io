Areas rapidly incorporated into the <span class="highlight">empire</span> were not long affected by the <span class="highlight">military</span>. Where the army remained stationed, its presence was much more <span class="highlight">influential</span>. The imposition of a <span class="highlight">military</span><span class="highlight">base</span> involved the requisition of native lands for both the <span class="highlight">fort</span> and the <span class="highlight">territory</span> needed to feed and <span class="highlight">exercise</span> the soldiers' animals. The imposition of <span class="highlight">military</span> rule also robbed <span class="highlight">local</span> leaders of opportunities to <span class="highlight">participate</span> in <span class="highlight">local</span><span class="highlight">government</span>, so social <span class="highlight">development</span> was stunted and the seeds of disaffection sown. This then meant that the <span class="highlight">military</span> had to <span class="highlight">remain</span> to <span class="highlight"><span class="question4">suppress</span></span><span class="highlight">rebellion</span> and organize <span class="highlight">government</span>.</p><p><span class="highlight">Economic</span><span class="highlight">exchange</span> was clearly very important as the Roman army brought with it very <span class="highlight">substantial</span> spending power. <span class="highlight">Locally</span> a <span class="highlight">fort</span> had two kinds of <span class="highlight">impact</span>.
Its large <span class="highlight">population</span> needed food and other supplies. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>Some of these were certainly brought from long distances, but demands were <span class="highlight">inevitably</span> placed on the <span class="highlight">local</span> area. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>Although goods could be requisitioned, they were usually paid for, and this probably <span class="highlight">stimulated</span> changes in the <span class="highlight">local</span><span class="highlight">economy</span>.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>When not campaigning, soldiers needed to be occupied; <span class="highlight">otherwise</span> they represented a potentially dangerous <span class="highlight">source</span> of <span class="highlight"><span class="question5">friction</span></span> and disloyalty. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>Hence a writing tablet <span class="highlight">dated</span> 25 April tells of <span class="question6">343 men at one <span class="highlight">fort</span> engaged on tasks like shoemaking, building a bathhouse, operating kilns, digging <span class="highlight">clay</span>, and working <span class="highlight">lead</span>.</span>
Such activities had a <span class="highlight">major</span> effect on the <span class="highlight">local</span> area, in <span class="highlight">particular</span> with the <span class="highlight">construction</span> of <span class="highlight">infrastructure</span> such as roads, which improved <span class="highlight">access</span> to <span class="highlight">remote</span> areas.</p><p>Each soldier received his <span class="highlight">pay</span>, but in regions without a developed <span class="highlight">economy</span> there was <span class="highlight">initially</span> little on which it could be spent. The pool of <span class="highlight">excess</span> cash rapidly <span class="highlight">stimulated</span> a thriving <span class="highlight">economy</span> outside <span class="highlight">fort</span> gates. Some of the demand for the services and goods was no <span class="highlight">doubt</span> fulfilled by people drawn from far <span class="highlight">afield</span>, but some <span class="highlight">local</span> people certainly became entwined in this new <span class="highlight">economy</span>. There was informal marriage with soldiers, who until AD 197 were not legally <span class="question7">entitled to</span> wed, and whole new communities grew up near the forts. These settlements acted like small towns, becoming centers for the <span class="highlight">artisan</span> and trading populations.</p><p>The army also provided a means of <span class="highlight">personal</span> advancement for <span class="highlight">auxiliary</span> soldiers recruited from the native peoples, as a man obtained <span class="highlight">hereditary</span> Roman citizenship on retirement after service in an <span class="highlight">auxiliary</span> regiment. Such units recruited on an ad hoc (as needed) basis from the area in which they were stationed, and there was evidently large-scale <span class="highlight">recruitment</span><span class="highlight">within</span> Britain. The total numbers were at <span class="highlight">least</span> 12,500 men up to the reign of the <span class="highlight">emperor</span> Hadrian (A.D. 117-138), with a <span class="highlight">peak</span> around A.D. 80. Although a small <span class="highlight">proportion</span> of the total <span class="highlight">population</span>, this perhaps had a <span class="highlight">massive</span><span class="highlight">local</span><span class="highlight">impact</span> when a large <span class="highlight">proportion</span> of the young men were removed from an area. Newly raised regiments were <span class="highlight">normally</span> transferred to another province from whence it was <span class="highlight">unlikely</span> that <span class="highlight">individual</span> recruits would ever return. Most units raised in Britain went elsewhere on the European <span class="highlight">continent</span>, although one is recorded in Morocco. The <span class="highlight">reverse</span><span class="highlight">process</span> brought young men to Britain, where many continued to live after their 20 to 25 years of service, and this added to the cosmopolitan Roman <span class="highlight">character</span> of the <span class="highlight">frontier</span><span class="highlight">population</span>. By the later Roman period, <span class="highlight">frontier</span> garrisons (groups of soldiers) were only <span class="highlight">rarely</span> transferred, service in units became effectively <span class="highlight">hereditary</span>, and forts were no longer populated or maintained at full strength.</p><p>This <span class="highlight">process</span> of settling in as a <span class="highlight">community</span> over several generations, combined with <span class="highlight">local</span><span class="highlight">recruitment</span>, <span class="highlight">presumably</span> accounts for the <span class="highlight">apparent</span><span class="highlight">stability</span> of the British northern <span class="highlight">frontier</span> in the later Roman period. It also explains why <span class="question11">some of the forts continued in occupation long after Rome ceased to have any <span class="highlight">formal</span><span class="highlight">authority</span> in Britain</span>, at the beginning of the fifth <span class="highlight">century</span> A.D. The <span class="question12">circumstances</span> that had allowed natives to become Romanized also led the self-sustaining <span class="highlight">military</span><span class="highlight">community</span> of the <span class="highlight">frontier</span> area to become effectively British.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Many Roman soldiers remained in Britain after conquering it, and their presence had a strong influence.</p><p>B. The new Roman province of Britain seemed to awaken in the first century as the local economy improved.</p><p>C. Camps, fortifications, and economic change contributed to the Roman conquest of Britain.</p><p>D. With the conquest of Britain by Roman troops, the Roman Empire gained considerable economic strength.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A. The part of the original in is the non-major adverbial component. The main structure of the main sentence is juxtaposed: 1) the army stays in a new province; 2) has an influence. So the answer is A, A shows the main logic, and covers two parts of the content. B. Makes the non-essential components of the original text awake, C the main component of the original text fortification into a major part, and changes the structure of the sentence, all wrong; D's economic strength original did not say, wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 1, the Roman army had the most influence on those areas of Britain that were</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. conquered first</p><p>B. near population centers</p><p>C. used as military bases</p><p>D. rapidly incorporated into the empire</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C. Use the area and the most influence keywords to locate the fourth sentence. The place where the army has been stationed has the most far-reaching impact. Therefore, the answer is C, as a military base. Both B and D are clearly indecisive. The first conquer first occupied by A does not always have to be stationed. The military base is</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 1, what effect did military occupation have on the local population?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It encouraged more even distribution of the population and the settlement of previously undeveloped territory.</p><p>B. It created discontent and made continuing military occupation necessary.</p><p>C. It required local labor to construct forts and feed and exercise the soldiers' animals.</p><p>D. It provided local leaders with opportunities to participate in governance.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B. Using the local population keyword to locate the penultimate sentence, saying that the military presence deprives the local people of their power to participate in the government, stagnating development, planting the seeds of hatred, and then saying that this hatred makes the military presence continuous, so it is correct. The answer is B. A and C did not say the original, D and the original opposite</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question4">suppress</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. respond to</p><p>B. warn against</p><p>C. avoid the impact of</p><p>D. stop by force</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" D"><p>D <span class="question4">suppress</span>: <span class="question4">suppress</span>, <span class="question4">suppress</span>. A is a response; B is a warning... Do not; C is to prevent the influence of ...; D is stopped by force. So D's stop by force is the correct answer.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question5">friction</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. rebellion</p><p>B. conflict</p><p>C. neglect</p><p>D. crime</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>B <span class="question5">friction</span>: <span class="question5">friction</span>, conflict. A is revolt; B is conflict, conflict; C is neglect, negligence; D is criminal. So the correct answer is B conflict.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The author mentions "<span class="highlight">343 men at one fort engaged on tasks like shoemaking, building a bathhouse, operating kilns, digging clay, and working lead</span>" in order to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. describe the kinds of tasks soldiers were required to perform as punishment for disloyalty or misdeeds</p><p>B. illustrate some of the duties assigned to soldiers to keep them busy and well-behaved when not involved in military campaigns</p><p>C. provide evidence that Roman soldiers had a negative effect on the local area by performing jobs that had been performed by native workers</p><p>D. argue that the soldiers would have been better employed in the construction of infrastructure such as roads</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="343 men at one fort engaged on tasks like shoemaking, building a bathhouse, operating kilns, digging clay, and working lead B"><p>B. The rhetorical purpose question. The sentence where the rhetorical point is located is simply an example. Therefore, it is not an answer. Looking ahead, the preceding sentence has already read the above question, saying that the soldier must have something to do, otherwise it will cause trouble and will be given immediately. 343 soldiers are doing that, so 343 soldiers are an example of what soldiers must do, so the answer is B.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The phrase "<span class="highlight"><span class="question7">entitled to</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. given the right to</p><p>B. able to afford to</p><p>C. encouraged to</p><p>D. required to</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" A"><p>A entitle: empowerment, authorization. A is to give full strength; B is capable to undertake...; encourage to do it...; D is required to go.... So the correct answer is A.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 3, how did the soldiers meet their needs for goods and services?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Their needs were met by the army, and all of their economic transactions took place within the fort.</p><p>B. Most of their needs were met by traveling tradespeople who visit the forts.</p><p>C. During their days off, soldiers traveled to distant towns to make purchases.</p><p>D. They bought what they needed from the artisans and traders in nearby towns.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D. Use keywords "goods and services" to locate the third sentence, saying that people from afar satisfied the soldiers' needs for goods and services. The correct answer is D. A's army and C's travelers travel is obviously wrong; B is somewhat confusing, but the original said that some local people also participate in, did not say who is satisfied, so most of the need for tradespeople to meet is wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, which of the following is true of Britain's auxiliary regiments of the Roman army?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Membership in these regiments reached its highest point during the reign of the emperor Hadrian.</p><p>B. Most of the units recruited in Britain were sent to Morocco and other stations outside Europe.</p><p>C. Soldiers served in the regiments for many years and after retirement generally stayed where they had been stationed.</p><p>D. Most of the regiments stationed on the frontier were new units transferred from a neighboring province.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C. Positioning to the penultimate sentence using Britain's auxiliary regiments. Note that although there is an auxiliary regiment in the first sentence, it is not English but Roman, so it is not the first sentence. The original sentence said that British troops have gone to other European countries. There is a unit in Morocco. The troops of other countries have come to the United Kingdom. Many people have served in the United Kingdom 20 to 25 years later. So the answer is C. A's Hardrian and D's neighboring land did not say the original; B's most opposed to the original, because the original said that only one squadron was sent to Morocco.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, all of the following changes could be seen in the frontier garrisons by the later Roman period EXCEPT:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Membership in the units passed from father to son.</p><p>B. Fewer soldiers were stationed at the forts.</p><p>C. Soldiers usually were not transferred to different locations.</p><p>D. Frontier units became more effective and proficient.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D EXCEPT questions, exclusion, A from father to son do keyword positioning to the last sentence of the hereditary, correct, not selected; B's fort keyword positioning to the last sentence, correct, not selected; C transfer to different location Do keyword positioning to the last sentence, correct, not selected; D original did not say, so wrong, choose.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the author mention that "<span class="highlight">some of the forts continued in occupation long after Rome ceased to have any formal authority in Britain</span>" ?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To emphasize the degree to which the stability of the British northern frontier depended on firm military control</p><p>B. To suggest that the Romans continued to occupy Britain even after they had formally given up the right to do so</p><p>C. To support the claim that forts continued to serve an import economic function even after they ceased to be of any military use</p><p>D. To describe one of the things that resulted from frontier garrisons' becoming part of the local community over a long period</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="some of the forts continued in occupation long after Rome ceased to have any formal authority in Britain D"><p>D. The rhetorical purpose question, the sentence where the rhetorical point is used simply states an example, and it also explains that the United Kingdom looks ahead. The previous sentence states that it will take several generations to settle in one place. This behavior can explain the stability of the northern border of Britain. , so the answer is D, the other did not say.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question12">circumstances</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. experiences</p><p>B. communities</p><p>C. conditions</p><p>D. laws</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" C"><p>C, circumstance: Environment, situation. A is experience, experience; B is community; C is condition, condition; D is law. So the answer is C's condition.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>One solution was to keep them busy as sources of labor..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D three transition points, noun source of labour, noun solution and phrase keep them busy, keep them busy and occupied synonymous substitutions, so C or D is correct; after 343 men and source of labour are synonymous replacement, so D Is the answer. Moreover, solution just echoed the source of <span class="question5">friction</span> and disloyalty.</p></div></div><div id="question14" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>
The Roman army's occupation of Britain influenced and changed the local population.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.Although the presence of the army in certain areas caused resentment among the local population, it provided important services such as building infrastructure.</p><p>B.By recruiting unemployed young men for its auxiliary units, the army made it possible for them to stay in their home towns and provide financial support for their families.</p><p>C.Large quantities of cash from soldiers' pay stimulated development, but also drove up prices, making it hard for local residents to afford goods and services.</p><p>D.Though the army appropriated land and some goods, it also paid for many supplies, stimulating local economic growth.</p><p>E.The forts contributed to the quality of local crafts by bringing in artisans from distant places who brought with them new skills and techniques.</p><p>F.Roman soldiers started families with local inhabitants, and over the generations, the military community became a stable part of British society.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="ADF"><p>The ADF option corresponds to the last sentence of the second paragraph. Correct. The unemployed men in the By recruiting option did not say so. Do not select. The previous sentence in the "Large Quantity" option is correct, but the drive up price in the latter half of the sentence is not stated, but the .Though option is not selected.
