            <b>The Roman Army's Impact on Britain</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>
            <span class="light">In the wake of the Roman <span class="underline">Empire</span>'s <span class="underline">conquest</span> of Britain in the first <span class="underline">century</span> A.D., a large number of troops stayed in the new province, and these troops had a <span class="underline">considerable</span> <span class="underline">impact</span> on Britain with their camps, fortifications, and participation in the <span class="underline">local</span> <span class="underline">economy</span></span> Assessing the <span class="underline">impact</span> of the army on the <span class="underline">civilian</span> <span class="underline">population</span> starts from the <span class="underline">realization</span> that the soldiers were always unevenly distributed <span class="underline">across</span> the country. Areas rapidly incorporated into the <span class="underline">empire</span> were not long affected by the <span class="underline">military</span>. Where the army remained stationed, its presence was much more <span class="underline">influential</span>. The imposition of a <span class="underline">military</span> <span class="underline">base</span> involved the requisition of native lands for both the <span class="underline">fort</span> and the <span class="underline">territory</span> needed to feed and <span class="underline">exercise</span> the soldiers' animals. The imposition of <span class="underline">military</span> rule also robbed <span class="underline">local</span> leaders of opportunities to <span class="underline">participate</span> in <span class="underline">local</span> <span class="underline">government</span>, so social <span class="underline">development</span> was stunted and the seeds of disaffection sown. This then meant that the <span class="underline">military</span> had to <span class="underline">remain</span> to <span class="underline">suppress</span> <span class="underline">rebellion</span> and organize <span class="underline">government</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="underline">Economic</span>
            <span class="underline">exchange</span> was clearly very important as the Roman army brought with it very <span class="underline">substantial</span> spending power. <span class="underline">Locally</span> a <span class="underline">fort</span> had two kinds of <span class="underline">impact</span>. 
Its large <span class="underline">population</span> needed food and other supplies. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>Some of these were certainly brought from long distances, but demands were <span class="underline">inevitably</span> placed on the <span class="underline">local</span> area. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>Although goods could be requisitioned, they were usually paid for, and this probably <span class="underline">stimulated</span> changes in the <span class="underline">local</span> <span class="underline">economy</span>.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>When not campaigning, soldiers needed to be occupied; <span class="underline">otherwise</span> they represented a potentially dangerous <span class="underline">source</span> of <span class="underline">friction</span> and disloyalty. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>Hence a writing tablet <span class="underline">dated</span> 25 April tells of 343 men at one <span class="underline">fort</span> engaged on tasks like shoemaking, building a bathhouse, operating kilns, digging <span class="underline">clay</span>, and working <span class="underline">lead</span>. 
Such activities had a <span class="underline">major</span> effect on the <span class="underline">local</span> area, in <span class="underline">particular</span> with the <span class="underline">construction</span> of <span class="underline">infrastructure</span> such as roads, which improved <span class="underline">access</span> to <span class="underline">remote</span> areas.</p>
          <p>Each soldier received his <span class="underline">pay</span>, but in regions without a developed <span class="underline">economy</span> there was <span class="underline">initially</span> little on which it could be spent. The pool of <span class="underline">excess</span> cash rapidly <span class="underline">stimulated</span> a thriving <span class="underline">economy</span> outside <span class="underline">fort</span> gates. Some of the demand for the services and goods was no <span class="underline">doubt</span> fulfilled by people drawn from far <span class="underline">afield</span>, but some <span class="underline">local</span> people certainly became entwined in this new <span class="underline">economy</span>. There was informal marriage with soldiers, who until AD 197 were not legally entitled to wed, and whole new communities grew up near the forts. These settlements acted like small towns, becoming centers for the <span class="underline">artisan</span> and trading populations.</p>
          <p>The army also provided a means of <span class="underline">personal</span> advancement for <span class="underline">auxiliary</span> soldiers recruited from the native peoples, as a man obtained <span class="underline">hereditary</span> Roman citizenship on retirement after service in an <span class="underline">auxiliary</span> regiment. Such units recruited on an ad hoc (as needed) basis from the area in which they were stationed, and there was evidently large-scale <span class="underline">recruitment</span> <span class="underline">within</span> Britain. The total numbers were at <span class="underline">least</span> 12,500 men up to the reign of the <span class="underline">emperor</span> Hadrian (A.D. 117-138), with a <span class="underline">peak</span> around A.D. 80. Although a small <span class="underline">proportion</span> of the total <span class="underline">population</span>, this perhaps had a <span class="underline">massive</span> <span class="underline">local</span> <span class="underline">impact</span> when a large <span class="underline">proportion</span> of the young men were removed from an area. Newly raised regiments were <span class="underline">normally</span> transferred to another province from whence it was <span class="underline">unlikely</span> that <span class="underline">individual</span> recruits would ever return. Most units raised in Britain went elsewhere on the European <span class="underline">continent</span>, although one is recorded in Morocco. The <span class="underline">reverse</span> <span class="underline">process</span> brought young men to Britain, where many continued to live after their 20 to 25 years of service, and this added to the cosmopolitan Roman <span class="underline">character</span> of the <span class="underline">frontier</span> <span class="underline">population</span>. By the later Roman period, <span class="underline">frontier</span> garrisons (groups of soldiers) were only <span class="underline">rarely</span> transferred, service in units became effectively <span class="underline">hereditary</span>, and forts were no longer populated or maintained at full strength.</p>
          <p>This <span class="underline">process</span> of settling in as a <span class="underline">community</span> over several generations, combined with <span class="underline">local</span> <span class="underline">recruitment</span>, <span class="underline">presumably</span> accounts for the <span class="underline">apparent</span> <span class="underline">stability</span> of the British northern <span class="underline">frontier</span> in the later Roman period. It also explains why some of the forts continued in occupation long after Rome ceased to have any <span class="underline">formal</span> <span class="underline">authority</span> in Britain, at the beginning of the fifth <span class="underline">century</span> A.D. The circumstances that had allowed natives to become Romanized also led the self-sustaining <span class="underline">military</span> <span class="underline">community</span> of the <span class="underline">frontier</span> area to become effectively British.</p>
