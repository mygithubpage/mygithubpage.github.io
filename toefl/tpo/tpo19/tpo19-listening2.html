of a lecture in a linguistics class.  </p><p><span class="time" data-times="18.29" data-time="5.57">[00:05.57]</span>Professor: All right, so far we have been looking at some of the <span class="highlight">core</span> areas of linguistics, like syntax, phonology, semantics, and these are things that we can study by looking at one language at a time, how sounds, and words, and sentences work in a <span class="highlight">given</span> language. <span class="time" data-times="10.02" data-time="23.86">[00:23.86]</span>But the <span class="highlight">branch</span> of historical linguistics, involves the <span class="highlight">comparison</span> of several different languages, or the <span class="highlight">comparison</span> of different stages of a single language. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.54" data-time="33.88">[00:33.88]</span>Now, if you are comparing different languages, and you notice that they have a lot in <span class="highlight">common</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.33" data-time="39.42">[00:39.42]</span>Maybe they have <span class="highlight">similar</span> sounds and words that <span class="highlight">correspond</span> to one another that have the same meaning and that <span class="highlight">sound</span><span class="highlight">similar</span>. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.98" data-time="47.75">[00:47.75]</span>Let's use a real-world example. <span class="time" data-times="11.81" data-time="50.73">[00:50.73]</span>In the 18th <span class="highlight">century</span>, scholars who have studied the <span class="highlight">ancient</span> languages, Sanskrit, <span class="highlight">Latin</span> and Greek, noticed that these three languages had many similarities. <span class="time" data-times="5.3" data-time="62.54">[01:02.54]</span>And there might be several reasons why languages such as these had so much in <span class="highlight">common</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.81" data-time="67.84">[01:07.84]</span>Maybe it happened by <span class="highlight">chance</span>, maybe one language was heavily influenced by borrowed words from the other. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="15.24" data-time="75.65">[01:15.65]</span>Or maybe, maybe the languages developed from the same <span class="highlight">source</span> language long ago, that is, maybe they are <span class="highlight">genetically</span> related, that was what happened with Sanskrit, <span class="highlight">Latin</span> and Greek. <span class="time" data-times="8.58" data-time="90.89">[01:30.89]</span>These languages had so many similarities that it was concluded that they must have all come from the same <span class="highlight">source</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.61" data-time="99.47">[01:39.47]</span>And talk about important discoveries in linguistics, this was certainly one of them. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.85" data-time="106.08">[01:46.08]</span>The scholars referred to that <span class="highlight">source</span> language as Proto-Indo-European. <span class="time" data-times="13.32" data-time="112.93">[01:52.93]</span>Proto-Indo-European is a reconstructed language, meaning it is what linguists concluded a parent language of Sanskrit, <span class="highlight">Latin</span> and Greek would have to be like. <span class="time" data-times="20.95" data-time="126.25">[02:06.25]</span>And Proto-Indo-European branched out into other languages, which evolved into others, so in the end, many languages spoken all over the world today can <span class="highlight">trace</span> their ancestry back to one language, Proto-Indo-European, which was spoken several thousand years ago. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="10.62" data-time="147.2">[02:27.20]</span>Now, one way of representing the <span class="highlight">evolution</span> of languages, showing the way languages are related to each other, is with the family tree model. <span class="time" data-times="13.05" data-time="157.82">[02:37.82]</span>Like a family tree that you might use to <span class="highlight">trace</span> back <span class="highlight">through</span> generations of ancestors, only it's showing a family of <span class="highlight">genetically</span> related languages <span class="highlight">instead</span> of people. <span class="time" data-times="10.79" data-time="170.87">[02:50.87]</span>A tree model for a language family starts with one language, which we call a mother language, for example, Proto-Indo-European. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="18.99" data-time="181.66">[03:01.66]</span>The mother language, is the <span class="highlight">line</span> on the top of this <span class="highlight">diagram</span>, over time, it branches off into new daughter languages, which <span class="highlight">branch</span> into daughter languages of their own, and languages that have the same <span class="highlight">source</span>, the same mother, are called sisters. <span class="time" data-times="8.23" data-time="200.65">[03:20.65]</span>They share a lot of characteristics, and this went on until we are looking at a big upside down tree languages like this. <span class="time" data-times="3.29" data-time="208.88">[03:28.88]</span>It is incomplete of <span class="highlight">course</span>, just to give you an idea. <span class="time" data-times="3.43" data-time="212.17">[03:32.17]</span>So that's the family tree model, basically. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="10.28" data-time="215.6">[03:35.60]</span>Now, the tree model is a <span class="highlight">convenient</span> way of representing the <span class="highlight">development</span> of a language family and of showing how closely related two of more languages are. <span class="time" data-times="13.09" data-time="225.88">[03:45.88]</span>But it is <span class="highlight">obviously</span> very simplified, having a whole language represented by just one <span class="highlight">branch</span> on a tree doesn't really do <span class="highlight">justice</span> to all the variations <span class="highlight">within</span> that language. <span class="time" data-times="7.23" data-time="238.97">[03:58.97]</span>You know, Spanish that spoken in Spain isn't exactly the same as Spanish that is spoken in Mexico, for example. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="15.68" data-time="246.2">[04:06.20]</span>Another <span class="highlight">issue</span> is that languages <span class="highlight">evolve</span> very <span class="highlight">gradually</span>, but the tree model makes it look like they <span class="highlight">evolve</span> over night, like there was a <span class="highlight">distinct</span> moment in time when a mother language clearly broke off into daughter languages. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="261.88">[04:21.88]</span>But it seems to me it probably wasn't quite like that.  </p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor mainly discuss?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Same characteristics that are common in several languages.</p><p>B. A way to represent languages that are genetically related.</p><p>C. Which languages probably evolved from Proto-Indo-European.</p><p>D. Linguists' opinions about why languages change over time.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Through the full text we can see that the article began to suggest that there are similarities in different languages. Then, the reasons why this situation may occur are proposed. Let's talk about a phenomenon discovered by linguists: Sanskrit, Greek, and Latin may have originated from the same source language. After that, a tree model was proposed to show that different languages evolved into the same language.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What point does the professor make when she says that some languages have similar-sounding words</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Most languages with similar-sounding words seem related but are not.</p><p>B. Eighteenth-century scholars reached an inaccurate conclusion about ancient languages.</p><p>C. There is limited information available about how ancient languages sounded.</p><p>D. There is more than one possible explanation for similarities among languages.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>And there might be a number of reasons why languages such as these had so much in common. As we can see from the above, when it comes to the similarities between different languages, professors use maybe to explain the reasons, indicating that the reasons are diverse.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor say was an important discovery in linguistics?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Sanskrit,Greek,and Latin had the same parent language.</p><p>B. Sanskrit,Greek,and Latin borrowed words from each other.</p><p>C. Proto-Indo-European was not a real language.</p><p>D. Most languages have several sister languages.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>Meaning, it is what linguists concluded a parent language of Sanskrit, Latin and Greek would have to be like. It can be seen from Lecture that a major finding of linguistics is that linguists point out that Sanskrit, Latin and Greek have the same parent language.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Based on the discussion,what information can be shown on a tree model?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. That several languages share a common ancestor.</p><p>B. Whether a language is in the process of dying out.</p><p>C. When a certain language came into existence.</p><p>D. Why sister languages exist in the same geographical area.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>Like a family tree that you might use to trace back through generations of ancestors, only it's showing a family of geneticall related languages instead of people. It can be seen from lecture that the tree model of language can show whether different languages originate from the same The source language.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor mention variation within a language?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To reinforce a point she made about Proto-Indo-European.</p><p>B. To explain the original purpose of the tree model.</p><p>C. To point out information that the tree model does not show.</p><p>D. To explain why tree models have become overly complicated.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>It is simple very simplified, having a whole language represented by just one branch on a tree doesn't really do justice to all the changes within that language. From lecture it can be seen that the tree model does not show all the Variations.</p></div></div><div class="replay" id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What can be inferred about the professor when she says this.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. She is not sure what causes languages to change.</p><p>B. She does not think that languages change quickly.</p><p>C. She thinks a fact she just mentioned about language might be hard to believe.</p><p>D. She thinks languages evolved differently in the past than they do now.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Another issue is that language evolve very gradually, but the tree model makes it look like they evolve over night, like there was a distinct moment in time when a mother tongue was broken off into daughter languages. But it seems to me it probably wasn' t quite like that. It is known from lecture that the evolution of the language represented by the tree model is very rapid, and the professor himself does not agree with this view.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
