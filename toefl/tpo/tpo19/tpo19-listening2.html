            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.57" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in a linguistics class.  </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="18.29" data-time="5.57">[00:05.57]</span>Professor: All right, so far we have been looking at some of the <span class="underline">core</span> areas of linguistics, like syntax, phonology, semantics, and these are things that we can study by looking at one language at a time, how sounds, and words, and sentences work in a <span class="underline">given</span> language. <span class="time" data-times="10.02" data-time="23.86">[00:23.86]</span>But the <span class="underline">branch</span> of historical linguistics, involves the <span class="underline">comparison</span> of several different languages, or the <span class="underline">comparison</span> of different stages of a single language. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.54" data-time="33.88">[00:33.88]</span>Now, if you are comparing different languages, and you notice that they have a lot in <span class="underline">common</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.33" data-time="39.42">[00:39.42]</span>Maybe they have <span class="underline">similar</span> sounds and words that <span class="underline"><span class="underline">correspond</span></span> to one another that have the same meaning and that <span class="underline">sound</span> <span class="underline">similar</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.98" data-time="47.75">[00:47.75]</span>Let's use a real-world example. <span class="time" data-times="11.81" data-time="50.73">[00:50.73]</span>In the 18th <span class="underline">century</span>, scholars who have studied the <span class="underline">ancient</span> languages, Sanskrit, <span class="underline">Latin</span> and Greek, noticed that these three languages had many similarities. <span class="time" data-times="5.3" data-time="62.54">[01:02.54]</span>And there might be several reasons why languages such as these had so much in <span class="underline">common</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.81" data-time="67.84">[01:07.84]</span>Maybe it happened by <span class="underline">chance</span>, maybe one language was heavily influenced by borrowed words from the other. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="15.24" data-time="75.65">[01:15.65]</span>Or maybe, maybe the languages developed from the same <span class="underline">source</span> language long ago, that is, maybe they are <span class="underline">genetically</span> related, that was what happened with Sanskrit, <span class="underline">Latin</span> and Greek. <span class="time" data-times="8.58" data-time="90.89">[01:30.89]</span>These languages had so many similarities that it was concluded that they must have all come from the same <span class="underline">source</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.61" data-time="99.47">[01:39.47]</span>And talk about important discoveries in linguistics, this was certainly one of them. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.85" data-time="106.08">[01:46.08]</span>The scholars referred to that <span class="underline">source</span> language as Proto-Indo-European. <span class="time" data-times="13.32" data-time="112.93">[01:52.93]</span>Proto-Indo-European is a reconstructed language, meaning it is what linguists concluded a parent language of Sanskrit, <span class="underline">Latin</span> and Greek would have to be like. <span class="time" data-times="20.95" data-time="126.25">[02:06.25]</span>And Proto-Indo-European branched out into other languages, which evolved into others, so in the end, many languages spoken all over the world today can <span class="underline">trace</span> their ancestry back to one language, Proto-Indo-European, which was spoken several thousand years ago. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.62" data-time="147.2">[02:27.20]</span>Now, one way of representing the <span class="underline">evolution</span> of languages, showing the way languages are related to each other, is with the family tree model. <span class="time" data-times="13.05" data-time="157.82">[02:37.82]</span>Like a family tree that you might use to <span class="underline">trace</span> back <span class="underline">through</span> generations of ancestors, only it's showing a family of <span class="underline">genetically</span> related languages <span class="underline">instead</span> of people. <span class="time" data-times="10.79" data-time="170.87">[02:50.87]</span>A tree model for a language family starts with one language, which we call a mother language, for example, Proto-Indo-European. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="18.99" data-time="181.66">[03:01.66]</span>The mother language, is the <span class="underline">line</span> on the top of this <span class="underline">diagram</span>, over time, it branches off into new daughter languages, which <span class="underline">branch</span> into daughter languages of their own, and languages that have the same <span class="underline">source</span>, the same mother, are called sisters. <span class="time" data-times="8.23" data-time="200.65">[03:20.65]</span>They share a lot of characteristics, and this went on until we are looking at a big upside down tree languages like this. <span class="time" data-times="3.29" data-time="208.88">[03:28.88]</span>It is incomplete of <span class="underline">course</span>, just to give you an idea. <span class="time" data-times="3.43" data-time="212.17">[03:32.17]</span>So that's the family tree model, basically. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.28" data-time="215.6">[03:35.60]</span>Now, the tree model is a <span class="underline">convenient</span> way of representing the <span class="underline">development</span> of a language family and of showing how closely related two of more languages are. <span class="time" data-times="13.09" data-time="225.88">[03:45.88]</span>But it is <span class="underline">obviously</span> very simplified, having a whole language represented by just one <span class="underline">branch</span> on a tree doesn't really do <span class="underline">justice</span> to all the variations <span class="underline">within</span> that language. <span class="time" data-times="7.23" data-time="238.97">[03:58.97]</span>You know, Spanish that spoken in Spain isn't exactly the same as Spanish that is spoken in Mexico, for example. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="15.68" data-time="246.2">[04:06.20]</span>Another <span class="underline">issue</span> is that languages <span class="underline">evolve</span> very <span class="underline">gradually</span>, but the tree model makes it look like they <span class="underline">evolve</span> over night, like there was a <span class="underline">distinct</span> moment in time when a mother language clearly broke off into daughter languages. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="261.88">[04:21.88]</span>But it seems to me it probably wasn't quite like that.  </p>
