Not too many. <span class="time" data-times="6.66" data-time="21.18">[00:21.18]</span>Isn't that strange that the Milky Way is the <span class="highlight">galaxy</span> that the <span class="highlight">planet</span> earth is in, and most of us have never seen it? <span class="time" data-times="1.89" data-time="27.84">[00:27.84]</span>Now, what's the problem here? </p><p><span class="time" data-times="1.72" data-time="29.73">[00:29.73]</span>Student: Light pollution, right? <span class="time" data-times="1.72" data-time="31.45">[00:31.45]</span>From street lights and <span class="highlight">stuff</span> ... </p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.75" data-time="33.17">[00:33.17]</span>Professor: Yes, Especially unshielded street light, you know, ones that aren't <span class="highlight">pointed</span><span class="highlight">downward</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.57" data-time="38.92">[00:38.92]</span>Now, here's an <span class="highlight">irony</span>, the building we are in now, the <span class="highlight">astronomy</span> building not far from our observatory, has unshielded lights. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.4" data-time="47.49">[00:47.49]</span>Student: So the problem is <span class="highlight">pretty</span><span class="highlight">widespread</span>. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.73" data-time="49.89">[00:49.89]</span>Professor: It is basically beyond control, as far as expecting to view the night sky anywhere near city, I mean. <span class="time" data-times="2.33" data-time="55.62">[00:55.62]</span>I have lived around here my whole life. <span class="time" data-times="4.74" data-time="57.95">[00:57.95]</span>And I have never seen the Milky Way <span class="highlight">within</span> city limits, and I probably never will. <span class="time" data-times="1.94" data-time="62.69">[01:02.69]</span>There is a price for progress, eh? <span class="time" data-times="8.25" data-time="64.63">[01:04.63]</span>But let's think beyond light pollution, that's only one kind of a <span class="highlight">technological</span><span class="highlight">advance</span> that has interfered with <span class="highlight">astronomical</span> research. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.38" data-time="72.88">[01:12.88]</span>Can anyone think of another? No? <span class="time" data-times="11.22" data-time="76.26">[01:16.26]</span>Ok, let's look at it this way, we don't only gain information by looking at the stars, for the past 70 years or so, we have also used radio <span class="highlight">astronomy</span>, which lets us study radio waves from the sky. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.46" data-time="87.48">[01:27.48]</span>Student: How can you <span class="highlight">observe</span> radio waves? <span class="time" data-times="2.99" data-time="89.94">[01:29.94]</span>I mean, tell anything about the stars from that. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.3" data-time="92.93">[01:32.93]</span>Professor: Well, in <span class="highlight">optical</span><span class="highlight">astronomy</span>, using a <span class="highlight">telescope</span> and observing the stars that way, we <span class="highlight">rely</span> on <span class="highlight">visible</span> light waves. <span class="time" data-times="4.99" data-time="100.23">[01:40.23]</span>What we are seeing from earth is actually <span class="highlight">electromagnetic</span><span class="highlight">radiation</span> that's coming from stars. <span class="time" data-times="2.58" data-time="105.22">[01:45.22]</span>And just one part of it is <span class="highlight">visible</span> light. <span class="time" data-times="1.52" data-time="107.8">[01:47.80]</span>But there are problems with that. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.79" data-time="109.32">[01:49.32]</span>When photons and light waves hit objects in our <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span>, water droplets, <span class="highlight">oxygen</span> and <span class="highlight">nitrogen</span> molecules, dust particles and so on, <span class="time" data-times="9.03" data-time="117.11">[01:57.11]</span>these objects are illuminated, they are lit up, and those things are also being lit by all our street lights, by the moon, all these <span class="highlight">ambient</span> light. <span class="time" data-times="6.59" data-time="126.14">[02:06.14]</span>And on top of that, when that <span class="highlight">visible</span><span class="highlight">radiation</span> bounces off those molecules, it scatters in all directions. <span class="time" data-times="6.22" data-time="132.73">[02:12.73]</span>And well, light from stars, <span class="highlight">even</span> nearby in our own <span class="highlight">galaxy</span>, doesn't stand a <span class="highlight">chance</span> against that. <span class="time" data-times="5.85" data-time="138.95">[02:18.95]</span>Basically the light bouncing off all these objects close to earth is brighter than what's coming from the stars. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.67" data-time="144.8">[02:24.80]</span>Now, radio waves are <span class="highlight">electromagnetic</span><span class="highlight">radiation</span> that we can't see. <span class="time" data-times="9.12" data-time="149.47">[02:29.47]</span>Nearly all <span class="highlight">astronomical</span> objects in <span class="highlight">space</span><span class="highlight">emit</span> radio waves, whether nearby stars, objects in faraway galaxies, they all give off radio waves. <span class="time" data-times="9.74" data-time="158.59">[02:38.59]</span>And unlike <span class="highlight">visible</span> light waves, these radio waves can get <span class="highlight">through</span> the various gases and dusts in <span class="highlight">space</span>, and <span class="highlight">through</span> our own earth's <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span><span class="highlight">comparatively</span> easily. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.41" data-time="168.33">[02:48.33]</span>Student: Ok, then we might as well give up on <span class="highlight">optical</span><span class="highlight">astronomy</span> and go with radio <span class="highlight">astronomy</span>. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.55" data-time="173.74">[02:53.74]</span>Professor: Well, the thing is, with the radio <span class="highlight">astronomy</span>, you can't just set up a <span class="highlight">telescope</span> in your backyard and <span class="highlight">observe</span> stars. <span class="time" data-times="5.99" data-time="180.29">[03:00.29]</span>One problem is that radio waves from these far away objects, <span class="highlight">even</span> though they can get <span class="highlight">through</span>, are extremely <span class="highlight">faint</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9.72" data-time="186.28">[03:06.28]</span>So we need to use radio telescopes, specially designed to receive these waves and then, well, we can use computers to create pictures based on the information we receive. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="0.94" data-time="196">[03:16.00]</span>Student: That sounds cool. <span class="time" data-times="1.56" data-time="196.94">[03:16.94]</span>So, how do they do that? </p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.1" data-time="198.5">[03:18.50]</span>Professor: Well, it is kind of like the same way a <span class="highlight">satellite</span> dish receives its <span class="highlight">signal</span>, if you are <span class="highlight">familiar</span> with that. <span class="time" data-times="7.94" data-time="203.6">[03:23.60]</span>But radio telescopes are sometimes grouped together, is the same effect as having one big <span class="highlight">telescope</span> to increase radio wave gathering power. <span class="time" data-times="3.4" data-time="211.54">[03:31.54]</span>And they use electronics, quite <span class="highlight">sophisticated</span>. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.1" data-time="214.94">[03:34.94]</span>Yeah, it is neat how they do it, but for now why don't we just <span class="highlight">stick</span> with what we can learn from it. <span class="time" data-times="9.97" data-time="220.04">[03:40.04]</span>Some very important discoveries have been made by this technology, especially you <span class="highlight">consider</span> that some objects in <span class="highlight">space</span> give off radio waves but don't <span class="highlight">emit</span> any light. <span class="time" data-times="5.48" data-time="230.01">[03:50.01]</span>We have trouble discovering those sorts of bodies, much less studying them using just <span class="highlight">optical</span> telescopes. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.97" data-time="235.49">[03:55.49]</span>Student: Well, if the radio waves are so good at getting <span class="highlight">through</span> the <span class="highlight">universe</span>, what's the problem? </p><p><span class="time" data-times="1.51" data-time="240.46">[04:00.46]</span>Professor: Well, answer this. <span class="time" data-times="5.58" data-time="241.97">[04:01.97]</span>How come people have to turn off their <span class="highlight">cell</span> phones and all our electronic devices when an airplane is about to take off? </p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.72" data-time="247.55">[04:07.55]</span>Student: The phones <span class="highlight">interfere</span> with the radio communication at the airport, right? </p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.17" data-time="251.27">[04:11.27]</span>Student: Oh, so our radio waves here on earth <span class="highlight">interfere</span> with the waves from <span class="highlight">space</span>?
