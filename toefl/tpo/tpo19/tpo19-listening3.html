Radio waves can pass through particles in space.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="AD"><p>Professor: ...Nearly all astronomical objects in space emit radio waves, whether nearby stars, objects in faraway galaxies, they all give off radio waves. And unusual visible light waves, these radio waves can get through the various gases and dusts in space And through our own earth's atmosphere comparatively easily.</p><p>From the professor's explanation, the reason why ratio waves can be used in astronomical observations: 1. Basically all astronomical objects emit radio waves 2. Ratio waves can pass through a large number of gasses and dusts in space, as well as through the atmosphere.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor imply is an advantage of optical astronomy over radio astronomy?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.
