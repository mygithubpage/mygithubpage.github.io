            <b>Succession, Climax, and Ecosystems</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>Clements and other early ecologists saw almost lawlike regularity in the order of <span class="underline">succession</span>, but that has not been substantiated. A general <span class="underline">trend</span> can be recognized, but the details are usually <span class="underline">unpredictable</span>. <span class="underline">Succession</span> is influenced by many factors: the nature of the soil, <span class="underline">exposure</span> to sun and wind, regularity of <span class="underline">precipitation</span>, <span class="underline">chance</span> colonizations, and many other <span class="underline">random</span> processes.</p>
          <p>The final <span class="underline">stage</span> of a <span class="underline">succession</span>, called the <span class="underline">climax</span> by Clements and early ecologists, is <span class="underline">likewise</span> not <span class="underline">predictable</span> or of <span class="underline">uniform</span> <span class="underline">composition</span>. There is usually a good <span class="underline">deal</span> of turnover in <span class="underline">species</span> <span class="underline">composition</span>, <span class="underline">even</span> in a <span class="underline">mature</span> <span class="underline">community</span>. The nature of the <span class="underline">climax</span> is influenced by the same factors that influenced <span class="underline">succession</span>. <span class="underline">Nevertheless</span>, <span class="underline">mature</span> natural environments are usually in <span class="underline">equilibrium</span>. They change <span class="underline">relatively</span> little <span class="underline">through</span> time unless the environment itself changes.</p>
          <p>For Clements, the <span class="underline">climax</span> was a "superorganism," an <span class="underline">organic</span> entity. <span class="underline">Even</span> some authors who accepted the <span class="underline">climax</span> <span class="underline">concept</span> rejected Clements' characterization of it as a superorganism, and it is indeed a misleading <span class="underline">metaphor</span>. An ant <span class="underline">colony</span> may be legitimately called a superorganism because its communication system is so highly organized that the <span class="underline">colony</span> always works as a whole and appropriately according to the circumstances. But there is no <span class="underline">evidence</span> for such an interacting communicative network in a <span class="underline">climax</span> plant <span class="underline">formation</span>. Many authors <span class="underline">prefer</span> the <span class="underline">term</span> "association" to the <span class="underline">term</span> "community" in order to <span class="underline">stress</span> the looseness of the <span class="underline">interaction</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="underline">Even</span> less fortunate was the <span class="underline">extension</span> of this type of thinking to include animals as well as plants. This resulted in the "biome," a <span class="underline">combination</span> of coexisting <span class="underline">flora</span> and <span class="underline">fauna</span>. Though it is true that many animals are strictly <span class="underline">associated</span> with certain plants, it is misleading to speak of a "spruce-moose biome," for example, because there is no <span class="underline">internal</span> <span class="underline">cohesion</span> to their <span class="underline">association</span> as in an <span class="underline">organism</span>. The spruce <span class="underline">community</span> is not <span class="underline">substantially</span> affected by either the presence or <span class="underline">absence</span> of moose. Indeed, there are <span class="underline">vast</span> areas of spruce forest without moose. The <span class="underline">opposition</span> to the Clementsian <span class="underline">concept</span> of plant <span class="underline">ecology</span> was initiated by Herbert Gleason, soon joined by various other ecologists. Their <span class="underline">major</span> point was that the <span class="underline">distribution</span> of a <span class="underline">given</span> <span class="underline">species</span> was controlled by the <span class="underline">habitat</span> requirements of that <span class="underline">species</span> and that <span class="underline">therefore</span> the <span class="underline">vegetation</span> types were a simple <span class="underline">consequence</span> of the ecologies of <span class="underline">individual</span> plant <span class="underline">species</span>.</p>
          <p>With "<span class="underline">climax</span>," "biome," "superorganism," and various other <span class="underline">technical</span> terms for the <span class="underline">association</span> of animals and plants at a <span class="underline">given</span> <span class="underline">locality</span> being criticized, the <span class="underline">term</span> "ecosystem" was more and more widely adopted for the whole system of <span class="underline">associated</span> organisms together with the <span class="underline">physical</span> factors of their environment. <span class="underline">Eventually</span>, the energy-transforming role of such a system was emphasized. Ecosystems thus <span class="underline">involve</span> the <span class="underline">circulation</span>, <span class="underline">transformation</span>, and <span class="underline">accumulation</span> of energy and matter <span class="underline">through</span> the <span class="underline">medium</span> of living things and their activities. The ecologist is concerned <span class="underline">primarily</span> with the quantities of matter and energy that pass <span class="underline">through</span> a <span class="underline">given</span> <span class="underline">ecosystem</span>, and with the rates at which they do so.</p>
          <p>Although the <span class="underline">ecosystem</span> <span class="underline">concept</span> was very <span class="underline">popular</span> in the 1950s and 1960s, it is no longer the <span class="underline">dominant</span> paradigm. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>Gleason's arguments against <span class="underline">climax</span> and biome are largely <span class="underline">valid</span> 
against ecosystems as well. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>Furthermore, the number of interactions is so great that they are difficult to <span class="underline">analyze</span>, <span class="underline">even</span> with the help of large computers. Finally, younger ecologists have found <span class="underline">ecological</span> problems involving <span class="underline">behavior</span> and life-history adaptations more <span class="underline">attractive</span> than measuring <span class="underline">physical</span> constants. 
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span> <span class="underline">Nevertheless</span>, one still speaks of the <span class="underline">ecosystem</span> when referring to a <span class="underline">local</span> <span class="underline">association</span> of animals and plants, usually without 
paying much <span class="underline">attention</span> to the energy aspects. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p>
