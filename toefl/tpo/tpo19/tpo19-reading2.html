A general <span class="highlight"><span class="question3">trend</span></span> can be recognized, but the details are usually <span class="highlight">unpredictable</span>. <span class="highlight">Succession</span> is influenced by many factors: the nature of the soil, <span class="highlight">exposure</span> to sun and wind, regularity of <span class="highlight">precipitation</span>, <span class="highlight">chance</span> colonizations, and many other <span class="highlight">random</span> processes.</p><p>The final <span class="highlight">stage</span> of a <span class="highlight">succession</span>, called the <span class="highlight">climax</span> by Clements and early ecologists, is <span class="highlight"><span class="question4">likewise</span></span> not <span class="highlight">predictable</span> or of <span class="highlight">uniform</span><span class="highlight">composition</span>. There is usually a good <span class="highlight">deal</span> of turnover in <span class="highlight">species</span><span class="highlight">composition</span>, <span class="highlight">even</span> in a <span class="highlight">mature</span><span class="highlight">community</span>. The nature of the <span class="highlight">climax</span> is influenced by the same factors that influenced <span class="highlight">succession</span>. <span class="highlight">Nevertheless</span>, <span class="highlight">mature</span> natural environments are usually in <span class="highlight">equilibrium</span>. They change <span class="highlight">relatively</span> little <span class="highlight">through</span> time unless the environment itself changes.</p><p>For Clements, the <span class="highlight">climax</span> was a "superorganism," an <span class="highlight">organic</span> entity. <span class="highlight">Even</span> some authors who accepted the <span class="highlight">climax</span><span class="highlight">concept</span> rejected Clements' characterization of it as a superorganism, and it is indeed a misleading <span class="highlight">metaphor</span>. An ant <span class="highlight">colony</span> may be <span class="question5">legitimately</span> called a superorganism because its communication system is so highly organized that the <span class="highlight">colony</span> always works as a whole and appropriately according to the circumstances. But there is no <span class="highlight">evidence</span> for such an interacting communicative network in a <span class="highlight">climax</span> plant <span class="highlight">formation</span>. Many authors <span class="highlight">prefer</span> the <span class="highlight">term</span> "association" to the <span class="highlight">term</span> "community" in order to <span class="highlight">stress</span> the looseness of the <span class="highlight">interaction</span>.</p><p><span class="highlight">Even</span> less fortunate was the <span class="highlight">extension</span> of this type of thinking to include animals as well as plants. This resulted in the "biome," a <span class="highlight">combination</span> of coexisting <span class="highlight">flora</span> and <span class="highlight">fauna</span>. Though it is true that many animals are strictly <span class="highlight">associated</span> with certain plants, it is misleading to speak of a "spruce-moose biome," for example, because there is no <span class="highlight">internal</span><span class="highlight">cohesion</span> to their <span class="highlight">association</span> as in an <span class="highlight">organism</span>. The spruce <span class="highlight">community</span> is not <span class="highlight">substantially</span> affected by either the presence or <span class="highlight">absence</span> of moose. <span class="question8">Indeed, there are <span class="highlight">vast</span> areas of spruce forest without moose.</span> The <span class="highlight">opposition</span> to the Clementsian <span class="highlight">concept</span> of plant <span class="highlight">ecology</span> was <span class="question9">initiated</span> by Herbert Gleason, soon joined by various other ecologists. Their <span class="highlight">major</span> point was that the <span class="highlight">distribution</span> of a <span class="highlight">given</span><span class="highlight">species</span> was controlled by the <span class="highlight">habitat</span> requirements of that <span class="highlight">species</span> and that <span class="highlight">therefore</span> the <span class="highlight">vegetation</span> types were a simple <span class="highlight">consequence</span> of the ecologies of <span class="highlight">individual</span> plant <span class="highlight">species</span>.</p><p><span class="question11">With "<span class="highlight">climax</span>," "biome," "superorganism," and various other <span class="highlight">technical</span> terms for the <span class="highlight">association</span> of animals and plants at a <span class="highlight">given</span><span class="highlight">locality</span> being criticized, the <span class="highlight">term</span> "ecosystem" was more and more widely adopted for the whole system of <span class="highlight">associated</span> organisms together with the <span class="highlight">physical</span> factors of their environment.</span><span class="highlight">Eventually</span>, the energy-transforming role of such a system was emphasized. Ecosystems thus <span class="highlight">involve</span> the <span class="highlight">circulation</span>, <span class="highlight">transformation</span>, and <span class="highlight">accumulation</span> of energy and matter <span class="highlight">through</span> the <span class="highlight">medium</span> of living things and their activities. The ecologist is concerned <span class="highlight">primarily</span> with the quantities of matter and energy that pass <span class="highlight">through</span> a <span class="highlight">given</span><span class="highlight">ecosystem</span>, and with the rates at which they do so.</p><p>Although the <span class="highlight">ecosystem</span><span class="highlight">concept</span> was very <span class="highlight">popular</span> in the 1950s and 1960s, it is no longer the <span class="highlight">dominant</span> paradigm. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>Gleason's arguments against <span class="highlight">climax</span> and biome are largely <span class="highlight">valid</span> 
against ecosystems as well. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>Furthermore, the number of interactions is so great that they are difficult to <span class="highlight">analyze</span>, <span class="highlight">even</span> with the help of large computers. Finally, younger ecologists have found <span class="highlight">ecological</span> problems involving <span class="highlight">behavior</span> and life-history adaptations more <span class="highlight">attractive</span> than measuring <span class="highlight">physical</span> constants. 
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span><span class="highlight">Nevertheless</span>, one still speaks of the <span class="highlight">ecosystem</span> when referring to a <span class="highlight">local</span><span class="highlight">association</span> of animals and plants, usually without 
paying much <span class="highlight">attention</span> to the energy aspects. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 2, which of the following is a criticism of Clements' view of succession?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The principles of succession are more lawlike than Clements thought they are.</p><p>B. More evidence is needed to establish Clements' predictions about succession.</p><p>C. The details of succession are affected by random processes.</p><p>D. Many of the factors that determine which plants will grow in an environment, such as the nature of the soil and the exposure to sun, do not change at all.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C This paragraph is short, you can quickly sweep, you can also use the name and succession keyword positioning to the last sentence, saying that many factors can affect succession, so the correct answer is C. D mentioned many factors, but the change was not original, wrong; A's comparison of the original did not say, wrong; B is the most confusing option, because the original statement has not been confirmed, that is, has been established but not confirmed, but B Saying that more evidence is needed to build Clemens's predictions, that is, that it has not been established and that the predictions are not correct, so A is wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question2">substantiated</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. confirmed</p><p>B. noticed</p><p>C. defined</p><p>D. publicized</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" A"><p>A substantiate: Confirmation, confirmation. A is confirmation; B is discovery; C is definition; D is promotion. So the correct answer is A's confirmation.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question3">trend</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. probability</p><p>B. picture</p><p>C. lawlike regularity</p><p>D. tendency</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" D"><p>D, <span class="question3">trend</span>: <span class="question3">trend</span>. A is the possibility; B is the picture, scenery; C is like the rule of law; D is the <span class="question3">trend</span>. So the rightness of D is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question4">likewise</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. sometimes</p><p>B. similarly</p><p>C. apparently</p><p>D. consequently</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>B <span class="question4">likewise</span>: In addition, in addition. A is sometimes; similar; obvious; therefore, the result. So B's similarly is the correct answer.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question5">legitimately</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. commonly</p><p>B. broadly</p><p>C. properly</p><p>D. officially</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" C"><p>C. Many students mistakenly chose D. In fact, C properly is better. The preceding sentence states that some scholars accept Clements for the concept of climax, but reject C for the generalization of climax as the feature of superorganism. Then made a contrasting distinction. An ant colony may</p><p>This is a distinction between two categories, animal and plant. It is called <span class="question5">legitimately</span> called a superorganism.... But there is no evidence for such an interacting communicative network in a climax plant formation. If <span class="question5">legitimately</span> understood as officially, formally, we should only give an example of a plant category, which constitutes a "formal, official, authoritative" and a turning point in the actual situation. It is now a comparison between the two categories. It should be understood as follows: One field is "reasonable, reasonable and correct," and the other is "no evidence and no reason."</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, why do many authors prefer the term "association" to "community" when describing a climax plant formation?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Because the term "association" does not suggest the presence of a tight network involving interactive communication.</p><p>B. Because the term "association" indicates that the grouping is not necessarily beneficial to all members.</p><p>C. Because the term "community" indicates continuing dynamic development that a climax formation does not have.</p><p>D. Because the term "community" suggests an organization that has been designed for a specific purpose</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A detailed question, first read the sentence where the rhetorical point, in order to tell you that this sentence contains the purpose, read the content in the in order to find the answer, the original sentence in order to emphasize the looseness of this interaction Many authors prefer to use association. The original language is to emphasize looseness, so the answer is A. There is no tight network. B's beneficial to all members, C's dynamic development and D's specific purpose did not say anything.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>In paragraph 5, the author challenges the idea of a "biome" by noting that</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. there are usually no very strong connections among the plants and animals living in a place</p><p>B. plants and animals respond in the same way to the same circumstances</p><p>C. particular combinations of flora and fauna do not generally come about purely by chance</p><p>D. some animals are dependent on specific kinds of plants for food</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A biome keyword positioning to the second sentence, because this sentence just gives the concept of biome, no challenge, in the past look, the next sentence that although some animals and plants are closely related, but still can not say biome For example, there is no internal cohesion between them, so the answer is A, there is no close relationship between animals and plants. None of the B and C originals were spoken; D's food did not say anything, and D was not a concept mentioned in challenge above, so it was not correct.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the author make the statement, "<span class="highlight">Indeed, there are vast areas of spruce forest without moose</span>" ?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To highlight a fact whose significance the ecologist Herbert Gleason had missed</p><p>B. To propose the idea that a spruce forest is by itself a superorganism</p><p>C. To emphasize that moose are not limited to a single kind of environment</p><p>D. To criticize the idea of a spruce-moose biome</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="Indeed, there are vast areas of spruce forest without moose D"><p>D rhetoric goal, the rhetorical point is a sentence, so look at the previous sentence, the previous sentence that spruce population is not affected by the presence of moose is still an example, so look at the central sentence, pay attention to the central sentence of the text is not the first sentence But the second sentence mentioned in the previous question, said spruce-moose biome is wrong, so the answer is D.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question9">initiated</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. approved</p><p>B. identified</p><p>C. started</p><p>D. foreseen</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" C"><p>C initiate: Start, first. A is the consent; B is the verification; C is the beginning; D is the foresight. So the correct answer is C's started.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 5, Gleason's opposition to the Clementsian views of plant ecology was based on the claim that plant species grow in places where</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. they can enter into mutually beneficial relationships with other species</p><p>B. conditions suit them, regardless of whether particular other species are present</p><p>C. habitats are available for a wide variety of plant and animal species</p><p>D. their requirements are met, and those of most other species are not</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B. With Christian and species as the key words to the last two sentences, the penultimate sentence says opposition. The last sentence says that the reason for the opposition is that the distribution of species depends on the environment. It is only the result of its own ecology. That is, nothing to do with other species, so the answer is B. Since it has nothing to do with other species, A and D are wrong. C also said a large number of species, different from the original.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Unlike the terms "climax", "biome," and "superorganism," which refer to the particular association of plants and animals at a given location, the term "ecosystem" refers specifically to the physical factors within an environment.</p><p>B. The terms "climax," "biome," "superorganism," and "ecosystem" all refer to the system of plants and animals in an associated environment, but some are more controversial than others.</p><p>C. When the older terms of ecology became too technical, they were replaced by the more popular and more widely used term "ecosystem."</p><p>D. The term "ecosystem" gradually replaced discredited terms for the combination of a physical environment and the plants and animals living together in it.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The "with" structure in the original sentence of D is not the main component. The main components are: using the ecosystem to describe the associated system of living things and the environment, correct answer D. The latter part of A is wrong. Eco is not a single physical factor but a system. Both B and C are mixed in the backbone and non-trunk of the original sentence.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 6, what did ecologists mainly study when the ecosystem concept was the dominant paradigm?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The physical factors present in different environments</p><p>B. The typical activities of animals and the effect of those activities on plants</p><p>C. The rates at which ecosystems changed from one kind to another</p><p>D. The flow of energy and matter through ecosystems</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D. Positioning the ecologist as a key word to the last sentence, saying that ecologists are most concerned about the transfer of material and energy in specific ecosystems and their rate, so the answer is D. Both A and B did not say that the C's rate was originally stated, but the original text stated that the rate of material and energy transmission was not the rate at which the answer said that the ecosystem changed, so C was wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>They may be more interested in researching, for example, the adaptations that some aquatic animals undergo to survive in dry desert environments..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C two transition points, pronouns they and noun adaption, from the nounadaption can be drawn B or C is correct; pronouns they refer to the younger ecologists in the penultimate sentence, so they should be placed after the noun, so B wrong C pairs .</p></div></div><div id="question14" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>The study of the combination of plant species that inhabit a particular locality became a scientific discipline toward the end of the nineteenth century.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.Areas that are recovering from serious disturbances like volcanic eruptions and heavy floods provide special opportunities to observe the development of plant communities.</p><p>B.Whether a given species will be found in a given ecosystem strongly depends on what other species it would interact with in that ecosystem.</p><p>C.Computer-aided studies of entire system of associated organisms together with their environment provide a solid basis for current studies of specific ecological problems.</p><p>D.According to the earliest theories of ecology, the development of plant communities proceeds in lawlike fashion and results in stable climax communities.</p><p>E.The idea of associations of plants and animals that function as "superorganisms" was later rejected by biologists who saw no strong evidence in support of that idea.</p><p>F.The once popular idea of communities as integrated ecosystems has been largely rejected by modern ecologists, who are more interested in problems involving behavior and adaptations.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="DEF"><p>The D.E.F Areas option MS is a detail in the first paragraph, but the source of the research opportunity is completely left blank and is not selected. The Whether option is the opposite of the last sentence of the fifth paragraph and is not selected. The Computer option contradicts the third sentence of the seventh paragraph and even if the pair is a detail, it is not selected. The According option corresponds to the first sentence of the second and third paragraphs of the original text. Correct. The idea option corresponds to the second sentence of the fourth paragraph of the original text, correct. The once option corresponds to the first sentence of the seventh paragraph of the original text, correct.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
