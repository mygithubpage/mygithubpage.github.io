The effect of the tidal flow on the salt marsh.</p><p>B. Ways that some plants have adapted to living in salt marshes.</p><p>C. The process of osmosis in plants.</p><p>D. Differences between plants that grow in salt marshes and plants that grow elsewhere.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Ok, today we are going to continue our discussion of plant life in coastal salt marshes 5 of North America. Salt marshes are among the least inviting environments for plants. The water is salty, there is little shade and the ocean tide comes in and out , constantly flooding the marsh, so the variety of plants found in salt marshes is limited, but there is a plant genus that thrives there, the Spartina. In the above design of the professor, the theme of this lecture was Spartina's The reason for living in the salt marshes, the next step is to begin to elaborate.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is one result of reverse osmosis in the spartina?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Salt from seawater strengthens the plant's cells.</p><p>B. All parts of the plant are able to receive oxygen.</p><p>C. Salt evaporates off the stems and leaves of the plant.</p><p>D. Water is unable to move across the plant cell walls.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>So instead of fresh water moving out of the plant cells, salt from the seawater enters, reverse osmosis, and this actually strengthens the cells.</p><p>According to the professor's explanation, reverse osmosis will strengthen the cells instead of fresh water moving out of the plant cells.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor mention reddish mud on the roots of a spartina?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To illustrate the high density of salt-marsh soil.</p><p>B. To explain how spartina rhizomes move through the soil.</p><p>C. To point out the problems spartinas face in getting fresh water.</p><p>D. To provide evidence that oxygen is present in the spartina s roots.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>If you pull up a Spartina, you might even notice some reddish mud on some of the roots, this is caused by oxygen reacting with iron sulfide in the soil, and it produces iron oxide or rust.</p><p>By showing that reddish mud appears in the root of Spartina, iron sulfide reacts with oxygen and iron oxide or rust is generated to provide evidence for the presence of oxygen in the root of spartina.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>In what way are rhizomes important for spartinas?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They allow plants to remain cool in direct sunlight.</p><p>B. They reduce the possibility of plants being uprooted during storms.</p><p>C. They help plants in dense soil process oxygen.</p><p>D. They reduce the concentration of salt in the surrounding seawater.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Professor: So as you might have guessed, they have developed a means of solidly anchoring themselves into the soil. How? They have tough sort of underground stems called rhizome, rhizomes from one plant grow through the muddy soil and interlock with those of other nearby Plants, the plants form a kind of colony, a community that will thrive and perish together. Because alone as single plants, they cannot survive. Through the professor's elaboration, spartinas can firmly fix themselves in the soil through rhizomes.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What can be inferred about the process that prevents spartinas from breaking in violent storms?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It is the same process that helps them survive being immersed in saltwater.</p><p>B. The process is also responsible for causing their air tubes to form.</p><p>C. The process sometimes damages their rhizomes.</p><p>D. Many other plants have developed a similar process.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>Well, we are back to reverse osmosis again, by adjusting the osmotic pressure so that the cells are always fully inflated, the plant is able to withstand great pressure before snapping, so Spartinas may look like simple marsh grass, but they are really a wonder Of chemistry, physics and structural engineering that allows them to survive and even thrive in an environment in which most plants will wilt and die within hours.</p><p>The professor first made it clear that Spartinas survived the violent storm and it was rhizomes. The article also stated that they had another adaptation to reverse osmosis, and reverse osmosis helped Spartinas to survive in salt water. After conversion, it can be seen that the process of helping Spartinas to survive in the storm is the same as the process of helping Spartinas to survive in salt water.</p></div></div><div class="replay" id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor say this:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To point out an incorrect conclusion.</p><p>B. To clarify the meaning of a term.</p><p>C. To admit that there is little evidence of the phenomenon she just described.</p><p>D. To emphasize the difference between a fact and an opinion.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>What's reflecting the light is not salt from seawater that has evaporated, although that's a good guess. But it is actually the salt that came from within the plant. Pretty cool, eh?</p><p>In the professor's presentation, it was obvious that there was a turning point in but that although the front was a good guess, the conclusion was not correct. After but starts to elaborate on the correct conclusion.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
