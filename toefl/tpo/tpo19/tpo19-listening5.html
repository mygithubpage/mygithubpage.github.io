            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.42" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in a <span class="underline">marine</span> <span class="underline">biology</span> class.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.57" data-time="8.42">[00:08.42]</span>Professor: Ok, today we are going to continue our discussion of plant life in coastal salt marshes of North America. <span class="time" data-times="4.84" data-time="15.99">[00:15.99]</span>Salt marshes are among the <span class="underline">least</span> <span class="underline">inviting</span> environments for plants. <span class="time" data-times="15.68" data-time="20.83">[00:20.83]</span>The water is salty, there is little <span class="underline">shade</span> and the ocean <span class="underline">tide</span> comes in and out, <span class="underline">constantly</span> flooding the <span class="underline">marsh</span>, so the <span class="underline">variety</span> of plants found in salt marshes is limited, but there is a plant <span class="underline"><span class="underline"><span class="underline">genus</span></span></span> that thrives there, the Spartina.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.62" data-time="36.51">[00:36.51]</span>In fact, the Spartina <span class="underline"><span class="underline"><span class="underline">genus</span></span></span> is the <span class="underline">dominant</span> plant found in salt marshes. <span class="time" data-times="6.16" data-time="43.13">[00:43.13]</span>You can find one type of the Spartina, Saltmarsh Cordgrass, growing in low <span class="underline">marsh</span> areas. <span class="time" data-times="5.74" data-time="49.29">[00:49.29]</span>In higher <span class="underline">marsh</span> areas, you are likely to find a Spartina commonly called Salt-meadow <span class="underline">Hay</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.43" data-time="55.03">[00:55.03]</span>So how is the Spartina able to <span class="underline">survive</span> in an environment that would kill most plants? <span class="time" data-times="5.91" data-time="61.46">[01:01.46]</span>Well, it is because salt <span class="underline">marsh</span> grasses have found ways to <span class="underline">adapt</span> to the conditions there.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.47" data-time="67.37">[01:07.37]</span>First of all, they are able to <span class="underline">withstand</span> highly saline conditions. <span class="time" data-times="6.44" data-time="71.84">[01:11.84]</span>One really interesting <span class="underline">adaptation</span> is the <span class="underline">ability</span> to <span class="underline">reverse</span> the <span class="underline">process</span> of osmosis. <span class="time" data-times="3.59" data-time="78.28">[01:18.28]</span>Typically, the <span class="underline">process</span> of osmosis works... <span class="time" data-times="12.43" data-time="81.87">[01:21.87]</span>Well, when water moves <span class="underline">through</span> the wall of a plant <span class="underline">cell</span>, it will move from the side containing water with the lowest <span class="underline">amount</span> of salt into the side containing the highest <span class="underline">amount</span> of salt.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="14.84" data-time="94.3">[01:34.30]</span>So imagine what would happen if a <span class="underline">typical</span> plant suddenly found itself in salt water, the water contained in the plant cells, that is water with very little salt would be drawn out toward the seawater, water with a lot of salt. <span class="time" data-times="8.52" data-time="109.14">[01:49.14]</span>So you can see the fresh water contained in the plant will be removed and the plant will quickly lose all its water and <span class="underline">dehydrate</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="14.36" data-time="117.66">[01:57.66]</span>But what about the Spartinas, well, they allow a certain <span class="underline">amount</span> of salt to enter their cells, bringing the salt <span class="underline">content</span> of the water <span class="underline">within</span> the plant, to a <span class="underline">slightly</span> higher <span class="underline">concentration</span> than that of the surrounding seawater. <span class="time" data-times="10.77" data-time="132.02">[02:12.02]</span>So <span class="underline">instead</span> of fresh water moving out of the plant cells, salt from the seawater enters, <span class="underline">reverse</span> osmosis, and this actually strengthens the cells.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.83" data-time="142.79">[02:22.79]</span>Another <span class="underline">adaptation</span> to the salty environment is the <span class="underline">ability</span> to excrete <span class="underline">excess</span> salt back to the environment. <span class="time" data-times="3.85" data-time="149.62">[02:29.62]</span>That's why you might see a Spartina <span class="underline">shimmering</span> in the sunlight. <span class="time" data-times="7.08" data-time="153.47">[02:33.47]</span>What's reflecting the light is not salt from seawater that has evaporated, although that's a good guess. <span class="time" data-times="3.81" data-time="160.55">[02:40.55]</span>But it is actually the salt that came from <span class="underline">within</span> the plant. <span class="time" data-times="1.78" data-time="164.36">[02:44.36]</span> <span class="underline">Pretty</span> cool, eh? <span class="time" data-times="4.49" data-time="166.14">[02:46.14]</span>You can really impress your friends and family with that little tidbit the next time you are in a salt <span class="underline">marsh</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.96" data-time="170.63">[02:50.63]</span>But coping with salt is not the only <span class="underline">challenge</span> for plants in the salt <span class="underline">marsh</span>. <span class="time" data-times="17.22" data-time="175.59">[02:55.59]</span>Soil there is <span class="underline"><span class="underline">dense</span></span> and very low in <span class="underline">oxygen</span>, so Spartinas have <span class="underline">air</span> tubes, <span class="underline">air</span> enters <span class="underline">through</span> tiny openings on the leaves, the tubes provide direct <span class="underline">pipe</span> <span class="underline">line</span> for <span class="underline">oxygen</span>, carrying it down the leaves <span class="underline">through</span> the stems and into the roots, where it is needed. <span class="time" data-times="13.37" data-time="192.81">[03:12.81]</span>If you pull up a Spartina, you might <span class="underline">even</span> notice some <span class="underline">reddish</span> mud on some of the roots, this is caused by <span class="underline">oxygen</span> reacting with iron <span class="underline">sulfide</span> in the soil, and it produces iron <span class="underline">oxide</span> or <span class="underline">rust</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.67" data-time="206.18">[03:26.18]</span>Now, although the Spartinas have adapted several chemical and <span class="underline">physical</span> mechanisms that allow them to <span class="underline">thrive</span> in salt water and to feed <span class="underline">oxygen</span> to their roots. <span class="time" data-times="8.51" data-time="215.85">[03:35.85]</span>There is yet another <span class="underline">aspect</span> of the <span class="underline">harsh</span> environment that they have to <span class="underline">adapt</span> to, the force of tides and <span class="underline">occasional</span> <span class="underline">violent</span> storms. <span class="time" data-times="3.56" data-time="224.36">[03:44.36]</span>Wind and water are <span class="underline">constantly</span> crashing into these plants. <span class="time" data-times="6.67" data-time="227.92">[03:47.92]</span>So as you might have guessed, they have developed a means of solidly anchoring themselves into the soil.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.62" data-time="234.59">[03:54.59]</span>How? They have <span class="underline">tough</span> <span class="underline">sort</span> of <span class="underline">underground</span> stems called rhizome.<span class="time" data-times="13.29" data-time="242.21">[04:02.21]</span>Rhizomes from one plant grow <span class="underline">through</span> the <span class="underline">muddy</span> soil and interlock with those of other nearby plants, the plants form a kind of <span class="underline">colony</span>, a <span class="underline">community</span> that will <span class="underline">thrive</span> and <span class="underline">perish</span> together. <span class="time" data-times="3.61" data-time="255.5">[04:15.50]</span>Because alone, as single plants, they cannot <span class="underline">survive</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.87" data-time="259.11">[04:19.11]</span>Of <span class="underline">course</span> the plants in these colonies also need <span class="underline">tough</span> <span class="underline">resilient</span> stems above the soil, stems that can bent a lot but not <span class="underline">break</span> as water <span class="underline">constantly</span> crashes into them. <span class="time" data-times="9.71" data-time="269.98">[04:29.98]</span>So in <span class="underline">addition</span> to the interlocking <span class="underline">underground</span> rhizomes, they have yet another <span class="underline">adaptation</span>, and it is ... well, we are back to <span class="underline">reverse</span> osmosis again.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="279.69">[04:39.69]</span>By adjusting the osmotic <span class="underline">pressure</span> so that the cells are always fully inflated, the plant is able to <span class="underline">withstand</span> great <span class="underline">pressure</span> before snapping, so Spartinas may look like simple <span class="underline">marsh</span> grass, but they are really a <span class="underline">wonder</span> of chemistry, physics and <span class="underline">structural</span> <span class="underline">engineering</span> that allows them to <span class="underline">survive</span> and <span class="underline">even</span> <span class="underline">thrive</span> in an environment in which most plants will wilt and die <span class="underline">within</span> hours. </p>
