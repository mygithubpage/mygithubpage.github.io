Which do you prefer, and why?</p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>I prefer to buy things on the Internet rather than do shopping in a store. Firstly, it's very easy to find things on Internet. You just have to input the key words into search engine on a web store, the results will be listed on the screen immediately. Then you pick the one you need and use credit card to pay the item. After a few days or so, the item will be delivered directly to your house or apartment. Secondly, Internet has more items than does store. Many times I walk in a bookstore and walk out without the book I want. But I never meet the problem buying books online. I can either buy books from Web bookstores such as Amazon or buy second-handed books from individuals. So, these are the reasons why I choose to buy items on the Internet.</p></article></div></main></body></html>
