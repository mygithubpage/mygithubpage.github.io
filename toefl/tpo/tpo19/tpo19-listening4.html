            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.62" data-time="7.42">[00:07.42]</span>Student: Hi, I... I am sorry to <span class="underline">interrupt</span>, could I ask you a few questions? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.29" data-time="12.04">[00:12.04]</span>Director: Sure, but if it is about you meal plan, you'll need to go to Room 45, just down the hall. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.45" data-time="16.33">[00:16.33]</span>Student: Eh, no, I am OK with my meal plan. <span class="time" data-times="2.64" data-time="18.78">[00:18.78]</span>I am actually here about the food in the student <span class="underline">cafeteria</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.56" data-time="21.42">[00:21.42]</span>Director: Oh, we do feed a lot of students, so we can't always honor <span class="underline">individual</span> requests. <span class="time" data-times="1.08" data-time="26.98">[00:26.98]</span>I am sure you understand. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7" data-time="28.06">[00:28.06]</span>Student: Of <span class="underline">course</span>. It is just that I am a little concerned, I mean, a lot of us are, that a lot of the food you serve isn't really that healthy. <span class="time" data-times="2.45" data-time="35.06">[00:35.06]</span>Like there are so many deep-fried foods. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.47" data-time="37.51">[00:37.51]</span>Director: As a matter of fact, we recently changed the type of oil we use in our fryer. <span class="time" data-times="1.57" data-time="41.98">[00:41.98]</span>It is the healthiest <span class="underline">available</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.6" data-time="43.55">[00:43.55]</span>And would you believe that at <span class="underline">least</span> ten students have already complaint that their French fries and fried chicken don't <span class="underline">taste</span> as good since we switched? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.61" data-time="51.15">[00:51.15]</span>Student: Oh, I try not to eat too many fried foods anyway. <span class="time" data-times="4.13" data-time="53.76">[00:53.76]</span>I am just <span class="underline">aware</span> that, eh...You see, I used to work in a natural food store. <span class="time" data-times="4.35" data-time="57.89">[00:57.89]</span>They had all these <span class="underline">literature</span> advising people to eat fresh <span class="underline">organic</span> growing food. <span class="time" data-times="2.11" data-time="62.24">[01:02.24]</span>Working there really open my eyes. </p>

              <span class="time" data-times="1.85" data-time="68.62">[01:08.62]</span>Student: Oh, sorry, I must have missed that. </p>

              <span class="time" data-times="4.81" data-time="70.47">[01:10.47]</span>Director: We served only certified <span class="underline">organic</span> food, most of which was from <span class="underline">local</span> farms. <span class="time" data-times="6.3" data-time="75.28">[01:15.28]</span>It is not something we can <span class="underline">afford</span> to do on a daily basis, and there aren't too many <span class="underline">organic</span> farms around here. <span class="time" data-times="3.1" data-time="81.58">[01:21.58]</span>But sometime the produce we <span class="underline">offer</span> is organically grown. <span class="time" data-times="2.28" data-time="84.68">[01:24.68]</span>It depends on the <span class="underline">season</span> and the prices of <span class="underline">course</span>. </p>

              <span class="time" data-times="1.38" data-time="86.96">[01:26.96]</span>Student: That's good to know. <span class="time" data-times="5.88" data-time="88.34">[01:28.34]</span>I like the fact that <span class="underline">organic</span> farms don't use chemical pesticides or anything that can pollute the soil or the water. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.2" data-time="94.22">[01:34.22]</span>Director: I do too. <span class="time" data-times="1.78" data-time="95.42">[01:35.42]</span>But let me ask you this. <span class="time" data-times="12.17" data-time="97.2">[01:37.20]</span>Is it better to buy <span class="underline">locally</span> grown produce that is not certified as <span class="underline">organic</span> or is it better to get organically grown fruits and vegetables that must be trucked in from California, three thousand mile away? <span class="time" data-times="3.22" data-time="109.37">[01:49.37]</span>What about <span class="underline">fossil</span> fuels burned by the trucks' <span class="underline">engine</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.45" data-time="112.59">[01:52.59]</span>Plus the expense of shipping food <span class="underline">across</span> long distances.<span class="time" data-times="4.38" data-time="116.04">[01:56.04]</span>And nutritionally speaking, an apple is an apple however it is grown. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.31" data-time="120.42">[02:00.42]</span>Student: I see your point. <span class="time" data-times="1.57" data-time="121.73">[02:01.73]</span>It is not so clear-cut. </p>
