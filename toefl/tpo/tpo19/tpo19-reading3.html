            <b>Discovering the Ice Ages</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>In the middle of the nineteenth <span class="underline">century</span>, Louis Agassiz, one of the first scientists to study glaciers, immigrated to the United States from Switzerland and became a professor at 
 Harvard University, where he continued his studies in <span class="underline">geology</span> and other sciences. For his research, Agassiz visited many places in the northern parts of Europe and North America, from the mountains of <span class="underline">Scandinavia</span> and New England to the rolling hills of the American Midwest. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>In all these <span class="underline">diverse</span> regions, Agassiz saw signs of <span class="underline">glacial</span> <span class="underline">erosion</span> 
 and <span class="underline">sedimentation</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>In <span class="underline">flat</span> plains country, he saw moraines (<span class="light">accumulations</span> of earth and <span class="underline">loose</span> rock that form at the edges of glaciers) that reminded him of the <span class="underline">terminal</span> moraines 
 found at the end of <span class="underline">valley</span> glaciers in the Alps. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>The heterogeneous <span class="underline">material</span> of the <span class="underline">drift</span> (sand, <span class="underline">clay</span>, and rocks deposited there) 
 convinced him of its <span class="underline">glacial</span> <span class="underline">origin</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p>
          <p>The areas covered by this <span class="underline">material</span> were so <span class="underline">vast</span> that the ice that deposited it must have been a <span class="underline">continental</span> <span class="underline">glacier</span> larger than Greenland or <span class="underline">Antarctica</span>. Eventually, Agassiz and others convinced geologists and the general public that a great <span class="underline">continental</span> <span class="underline">glaciation</span> had extended the <span class="underline">polar</span> ice caps far into regions that now enjoy <span class="underline">temperate</span> climates. For the first time, people began to talk about ice ages. It was also <span class="underline">apparent</span> that the <span class="underline">glaciation</span> occurred in the <span class="underline">relatively</span> recent past because the <span class="underline">drift</span> was <span class="underline">soft</span>, like <span class="underline">freshly</span> deposited <span class="underline">sediment</span>. We now know the age of the <span class="underline">glaciation</span> accurately from radiometric dating of the carbon-14 in logs buried in the <span class="underline">drift</span>. The <span class="underline">drift</span> of the last <span class="underline">glaciation</span> was deposited during one of the most recent epochs of geologic time, the <span class="underline">Pleistocene</span>, which lasted from 1.8 million to 10,000 years ago. <span class="underline">Along</span> the east <span class="underline">coast</span> of the United States, the southernmost <span class="underline">advance</span> of this ice is recorded by the <span class="underline">enormous</span> sand and <span class="underline">drift</span> deposits of the <span class="underline">terminal</span> moraines that form Long Island and <span class="underline">Cape</span> Cod.</p>
          <p>It soon became <span class="underline">clear</span> that there were <span class="underline">multiple</span> <span class="underline">glacial</span> ages during the <span class="underline">Pleistocene</span>, with warmer <span class="underline">interglacial</span> intervals between them. As geologists mapped <span class="underline">glacial</span> deposits in the late nineteenth <span class="underline">century</span>, they became <span class="underline">aware</span> that there were several layers of <span class="underline">drift</span>, the <span class="underline">lower</span> ones corresponding to earlier ice ages. Between the older layers of <span class="underline">glacial</span> <span class="underline">material</span> were well-developed soils containing fossils of warm-climate plants. These soils were <span class="underline">evidence</span> that the glaciers retreated as the <span class="underline">climate</span> warmed. By the early part of the twentieth <span class="underline">century</span>, scientists believed that four <span class="underline">distinct</span> glaciations had affected North America and Europe during the <span class="underline">Pleistocene</span> <span class="underline">epoch</span>.</p>
          <p>This idea was modified in the late twentieth <span class="underline">century</span>, when geologists and oceanographers examining <span class="underline">oceanic</span> <span class="underline">sediment</span> found <span class="underline">fossil</span> <span class="underline">evidence</span> of warming and cooling of the oceans. Ocean sediments presented a much more complete geologic <span class="underline">record</span> of the <span class="underline">Pleistocene</span> than <span class="underline">continental</span> <span class="underline">glacial</span> deposits did. The fossils buried in <span class="underline">Pleistocene</span> and earlier ocean sediments were of foraminifera-small, single-celled <span class="underline">marine</span> organisms that <span class="underline">secrete</span> shells of <span class="underline">calcium</span> <span class="underline">carbonate</span>, or calcite. These shells differ in their <span class="underline">proportion</span> of ordinary <span class="underline">oxygen</span> (oxygen-16) and the heavy <span class="underline">oxygen</span> <span class="underline">isotope</span> (oxygen-18). The <span class="underline">ratio</span> of oxygen-16 to oxygen-18 found in the calcite of a foraminifer's <span class="underline">shell</span> depends on the <span class="underline">temperature</span> of the water in which the <span class="underline">organism</span> lived. Different ratios in the shells preserved in various layers of <span class="underline">sediment</span> <span class="underline">reveal</span> the <span class="underline">temperature</span> changes in the oceans during the <span class="underline">Pleistocene</span> <span class="underline">epoch</span>.</p>
          <p>Isotopic <span class="underline">analysis</span> of shells allowed geologists to <span class="underline">measure</span> another <span class="underline">glacial</span> effect. They could <span class="underline">trace</span> the growth and <span class="underline">shrinkage</span> of <span class="underline">continental</span> glaciers, <span class="underline">even</span> in parts of the ocean where there may have been no great change in <span class="underline">temperature</span>-around the <span class="underline">equator</span>, for example. The <span class="underline">oxygen</span> <span class="underline">isotope</span> <span class="underline">ratio</span> of the ocean changes as a great <span class="underline">deal</span> of water is withdrawn from it by <span class="underline">evaporation</span> and is precipitated as snow to form <span class="underline">glacial</span> ice. During glaciations, the lighter oxygen-16 has a greater <span class="underline">tendency</span> to <span class="underline">evaporate</span> from the ocean surface than the heavier oxygen-18 does. Thus, more of the heavy <span class="underline">isotope</span> is left behind in the ocean and absorbed by <span class="underline">marine</span> organisms. From this <span class="underline">analysis</span> of <span class="underline">marine</span> sediments, geologists have learned that there were many shorter, more <span class="underline">regular</span> cycles of <span class="underline">glaciation</span> and deglaciation than geologists had recognized from the <span class="underline">glacial</span> <span class="underline">drift</span> of the continents alone.</p>
