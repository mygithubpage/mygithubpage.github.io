 Harvard University, where he continued his studies in <span class="highlight">geology</span> and other sciences. For his research, Agassiz visited many places in the northern parts of Europe and North America, from the mountains of <span class="highlight">Scandinavia</span> and New England to the rolling hills of the American Midwest. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>In all these <span class="highlight">diverse</span> regions, Agassiz saw signs of <span class="highlight">glacial</span><span class="highlight">erosion</span> 
 and <span class="highlight">sedimentation</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>In <span class="highlight">flat</span> plains country, he saw moraines (<span class="highlight question1">accumulations</span> of earth and <span class="highlight">loose</span> rock that form at the edges of glaciers) that reminded him of the <span class="highlight">terminal</span> moraines 
 found at the end of <span class="highlight">valley</span> glaciers in the Alps. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>The <span class="question2">heterogeneous</span><span class="highlight">material</span> of the <span class="highlight">drift</span> (sand, <span class="highlight">clay</span>, and rocks deposited there) 
 convinced him of its <span class="highlight">glacial</span><span class="highlight">origin</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p><p>The areas covered by this <span class="highlight">material</span> were so <span class="highlight">vast</span> that the ice that deposited it must have been a <span class="highlight">continental</span><span class="highlight">glacier</span> larger than Greenland or <span class="highlight">Antarctica</span>. Eventually, Agassiz and others convinced geologists and the general public that a great <span class="highlight">continental</span><span class="highlight">glaciation</span> had extended the <span class="highlight">polar</span> ice caps far into regions that now <span class="question4">enjoy</span><span class="highlight">temperate</span> climates. For the first time, people began to talk about ice ages. It was also <span class="highlight">apparent</span> that the <span class="highlight">glaciation</span> occurred in the <span class="highlight">relatively</span> recent past because the <span class="highlight">drift</span> was <span class="highlight">soft</span>, like <span class="highlight">freshly</span> deposited <span class="highlight">sediment</span>. We now know the age of the <span class="highlight">glaciation</span> accurately from radiometric dating of the carbon-14 in logs buried in the <span class="highlight">drift</span>. The <span class="highlight">drift</span> of the last <span class="highlight">glaciation</span> was deposited during one of the most recent epochs of geologic time, the <span class="highlight">Pleistocene</span>, which lasted from 1.8 million to 10,000 years ago. <span class="highlight">Along</span> the east <span class="highlight">coast</span> of the United States, the southernmost <span class="highlight">advance</span> of this ice is recorded by the <span class="highlight">enormous</span> sand and <span class="highlight">drift</span> deposits of the <span class="highlight">terminal</span> moraines that form Long Island and <span class="highlight">Cape</span> Cod.</p><p>It soon became <span class="highlight">clear</span> that there were <span class="highlight">multiple</span><span class="highlight">glacial</span> ages during the <span class="highlight">Pleistocene</span>, with warmer <span class="highlight">interglacial</span> intervals between them. As geologists mapped <span class="highlight">glacial</span> deposits in the late nineteenth <span class="highlight">century</span>, they became <span class="highlight">aware</span> that there were several layers of <span class="highlight">drift</span>, the <span class="highlight">lower</span> ones corresponding to earlier ice ages. Between the older layers of <span class="highlight">glacial</span><span class="highlight">material</span> were well-developed soils containing fossils of warm-climate plants. These soils were <span class="highlight">evidence</span> that the glaciers retreated as the <span class="highlight">climate</span> warmed. By the early part of the twentieth <span class="highlight">century</span>, scientists believed that four <span class="highlight">distinct</span> glaciations had affected North America and Europe during the <span class="highlight">Pleistocene</span><span class="highlight">epoch</span>.</p><p>This idea was modified in the late twentieth <span class="highlight">century</span>, when geologists and oceanographers examining <span class="highlight">oceanic</span><span class="highlight">sediment</span> found <span class="highlight">fossil</span><span class="highlight">evidence</span> of warming and cooling of the oceans. Ocean sediments presented a much more complete geologic <span class="highlight">record</span> of the <span class="highlight">Pleistocene</span> than <span class="highlight">continental</span><span class="highlight">glacial</span> deposits did. The fossils buried in <span class="highlight">Pleistocene</span> and earlier ocean sediments were of foraminifera-small, single-celled <span class="highlight">marine</span> organisms that <span class="highlight">secrete</span> shells of <span class="highlight">calcium</span><span class="highlight">carbonate</span>, or calcite. These shells differ in their <span class="highlight">proportion</span> of ordinary <span class="highlight">oxygen</span> (oxygen-16) and the heavy <span class="highlight">oxygen</span><span class="highlight">isotope</span> (oxygen-18). The <span class="highlight">ratio</span> of oxygen-16 to oxygen-18 found in the calcite of a foraminifer's <span class="highlight">shell</span> depends on the <span class="highlight">temperature</span> of the water in which the <span class="highlight">organism</span> lived. Different ratios in the shells preserved in various layers of <span class="highlight">sediment</span><span class="highlight"><span class="question8">reveal</span></span> the <span class="highlight">temperature</span> changes in the oceans during the <span class="highlight">Pleistocene</span><span class="highlight">epoch</span>.</p><p>Isotopic <span class="highlight">analysis</span> of shells allowed geologists to <span class="highlight">measure</span> another <span class="highlight">glacial</span> effect. They could <span class="highlight">trace</span> the growth and <span class="highlight">shrinkage</span> of <span class="highlight">continental</span> glaciers, <span class="highlight">even</span> in parts of the ocean where there may have been no great change in <span class="highlight">temperature</span>-around the <span class="highlight">equator</span>, for example. The <span class="question11"><span class="highlight">oxygen</span><span class="highlight">isotope</span><span class="highlight">ratio</span> of the ocean changes as a great <span class="highlight">deal</span> of water is withdrawn from it by <span class="highlight">evaporation</span> and is precipitated as snow to form <span class="highlight">glacial</span> ice.</span> During glaciations, the lighter oxygen-16 has a greater <span class="highlight">tendency</span> to <span class="highlight">evaporate</span> from the ocean surface than the heavier oxygen-18 does. Thus, more of the heavy <span class="highlight">isotope</span> is left behind in the ocean and absorbed by <span class="highlight">marine</span> organisms. From this <span class="highlight">analysis</span> of <span class="highlight">marine</span> sediments, geologists have learned that there were many shorter, more <span class="highlight">regular</span> cycles of <span class="highlight">glaciation</span> and deglaciation than geologists had recognized from the <span class="highlight">glacial</span><span class="highlight">drift</span> of the continents alone.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">accumulations</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. signs</p><p>B. pieces</p><p>C. types</p><p>D. deposits</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D accumulation: deposition, aggregation. A is a symbol, a sign; B is a horse, a block; C is a kind; D is a sediment. So the answer is D's deposit.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question2">heterogeneous</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. remaining</p><p>B. varied</p><p>C. familiar</p><p>D. layered</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>B <span class="question2">heterogeneous</span>: Heterogeneous, formed by different components. A is the rest; B is all kinds; C is common; D is layered, layered. So the correct answer is B.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 1, what persuaded Louis Agassiz that glaciation in the past had been widespread?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Geologic differences between mountain valleys and flat plains</p><p>B. The presence of similar glacial material in many different regions</p><p>C. Geologic research on mountain glaciers in the Alps</p><p>D. Evidence of regional differences in the drift caused by glacial erosion</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B. The name of the person appears many times, so simply using the person's name as the key word is not good, and cooperate with the glacial glacier as a key word. A total of two occurrences occurred. The first sentence was the first sentence to introduce this person. It was not related to the answer. The second time was that this man had found signs of ice erosion and deposition in different places. So the answer was B. D's regional difference was negative; A's geologic difference did not say, and C was not asked.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question4">enjoy</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. experience</p><p>B. resemble</p><p>C. expect</p><p>D. dominate</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" A"><p>A <span class="question4">enjoy</span>: Enjoy, experience. A is an experience; B is similar; C is an expectation, expectation; D is a control, domination. So A's experience is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>It can be inferred from paragraph 2 that Agassiz and other geologists of his time were not able to determine</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. which geographic regions had been covered with ice sheets in the last ice age</p><p>B. the exact dates at which drifts had been deposited during the last ice age</p><p>C. the exact composition of the drifts laid during the last ice age</p><p>D. how far south along the east coast of the United States the ice had advanced during the last ice age</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B This keyword is not easy to find, so the elimination method is better. A's last ice age keyword positioning to the penultimate sentence, said last glaciation deposition time, look down to see the United States east coast, so the deposition of the area can be determined, not selected; B's date to do keyword Positioning to the penultimate sentence, said that now knows the age of the glaciers, according to the time comparison, that is, previously did not know, is precisely the answer, so B is correct; C composition component keywords to the last sentence, said drift is morain, So the composition is known; D's how far south does keyword positioning to the second sentence's temperate climate, so D is also wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 3, what did geologists conclude as a result of finding well-developed soils containing warm-climate plant fossils between layers of glacial drift?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. There had been only one warm period before the Pleistocene epoch.</p><p>B. There had been multiple periods of mild weather between ice ages.</p><p>C. Several glacial periods occurred after the Pleistocene epoch.</p><p>D. Some earlier epochs were warmer thant the Pleistocene.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B. Using warm-climate plant fossils as a key word to locate the third sentence, but this sentence did not say what the conclusion was. Looking down, the next sentence says that these soils are evidence of a glacier retreat, so the correct answer is B. Note that C's severe glacial periods are wrong, and the original text says there are several heaters.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 3 and 4, scientists modified their theory about the exact number of glaciations because of evidence obtained from</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. ocean sediments</p><p>B. interglacial soils</p><p>C. glacial deposits</p><p>D. air samples</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A: Using modified their theory as the key word to locate the first sentence, said that the reason for changing the idea is that they looked at fossils in the oceanic sediment, so the evidence came from the ocean sediment and the answer was A.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question8">reveal</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. result from</p><p>B. vary with</p><p>C. show</p><p>D. preserve</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" C"><p>C <span class="question8">reveal</span>: Reveal, unveil. A is the result; B is the change with... C is the show, explanation; D is the save. So C's show is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, scientists use foraminifera shells to learn about Pleistocene ocean conditions by</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. measuring the amount of calcium carbonate present in the shells</p><p>B. determining the proportion of shell in each layer of sediment</p><p>C. comparing shells deposited during the Pleistocene with those buried earlier</p><p>D. calculating the relative quantity of two oxygen isotopes in the calcite</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D. Using Pleistocene and foraminifer as the key words to locate the third sentence, but this sentence only said that there is a kind of marine micro-organism called foraminifer. It doesn't say what can be used for it. In the past, the next sentence was able to say Calculate the ratio of two oxygen isotopes in the foraminifera shell to reflect the temperature of seawater. So the answer is D, and calculate the ratio of oxygen isotopes.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>In can be inferred from paragraph 5 that foraminifera fossil shells containing calcite with high percentages of oxygen-16 were deposited at times when</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. polar ice extended as far as equatorial regions of land and sea</p><p>B. extensive glaciation was not occurring</p><p>C. there were no great increases in ocean temperature</p><p>D. there was heavy snowfall on continental glaciers</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B. Use oxygen-16 as the key word to point to the fourth sentence, saying that during the ice age, oxygen 16 is more likely to evaporate, making the oxygen in the seawater more than 18, and vice versa, that is, the question should be The warm period, so the answer is B, there is no extensive glaciers. All three of the ACDs are talking about the cold period, so they say the opposite.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>In paragraph 5, why does the author include the information that the "<span class="highlight">oxygen isotope ratio of the ocean changes as a great deal of water is withdrawn from it by evaporation and is precipitated as snow to form glacial ice</span>" ?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To explain how scientists were able to calculate how frequently the continental ice sheets expanded and contracted</p><p>B. To explain how scientists have determined that there was no great change in ocean temperatures at the equator during past glaciations</p><p>C. To provide evidence that oxygen-16 has a greater tendency to evaporate than does oxygen-18</p><p>D. To suggest that equatorial marine organisms absorb more heavy isotopes than do marine organisms elsewhere</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="oxygen isotope ratio of the ocean changes as a great deal of water is withdrawn from it by evaporation and is precipitated as snow to form glacial ice A"><p>A. The rhetorical purpose question, the whole sentence of the rhetorical point is an example. In the past, the former said that the scientists could analyze the progress of the glaciers, so the answer is A. B is a detail of the previous sentence, C and D did not say.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the passage, when did scientists begin to realize that more than one ice age had occurred ?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

In the late twentieth century</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B, the answer to this question is simple, there are only two times, and it is to find the full text, so use the exclusion method. In the last sentence of the third paragraph, the 20th century was found. Looking closer, the second sentence of this paragraph stated that many layers of sediments were found in the late 19th century. The lower sediments corresponded to the early glacial periods. , so the correct time should be in the late 19th century, so the answer is B.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>In his view, there could be no other explanation for the composition of such drift..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D three insertion points, pronoun phrases his view and such drift, as well as the term other explanation, this question is rather special, only one insertion point is enough, because such drift must be placed after drift first appearance, so only left The next D may also be plausible after substituting other insertion points.</p></div></div><div id="question14" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>
