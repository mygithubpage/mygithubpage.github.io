        <h3>Listening Text</h3>
        <article>
          <p>Listen to a conversation between a student and the head of building maintenance.</p>
          <p>:Teacher: Can I help you?</p>
          <p>:Student: Yeah, I um......I'm taking summer classes right now and they put me in Robert's Dormitory, offered by the library.</p>
          <p>:Teacher: Ok.</p>
          <p>:Student: And I guess they are painting the library or doing something to the outside of the building?</p>
          <p>:Teacher: Ah......yes, they are. They are replacing the bricks on the outside walls.</p>
          <p>:Student: Well, whatever it is, it's like......really disturbing, for those of us with windows facing the library. They are working on the wall right opposite us. I mean, dust is everywhere coming in the windows, and, the noise, cos we are like...... what, ten feet away. And......well, it is just not a pretty picture.</p>
          <p>:Teacher: Right, well, that's why we waited until now to start work on it. I mean, most students have already left campus for summer vacation.</p>
          <p>:Student: Yeah, but Robert's Hall has been used by all the summer students.</p>
          <p>:Teacher: Really? The housing didn't notify us of that.</p>
          <p>:Student: Yeah. It's pretty full. I mean, I can't sleep at night, because of the smell and the dust and......You know, I'd love to just like close the windows but you know (it's) being summer now.</p>
          <p>:Teacher: Yes, I know. There is no air-conditioning in that building.</p>
          <p>:Student: Right! So I mean, we got five more weeks of classes left, and we were really wondering how much longer they are going to be working on that particular wall. Because maybe it's going to be a while.Do you think they could maybe work on a different side of the building for now, one that's not facing people's dorm rooms, and wait until the students are gone? To come back and finish this side? I mean, that way the dust and noise won't be coming directly into our windows while we are here.</p>
          <p>:Teacher: You know, I wish it weren't being done this way and it doesn't make sense. But......this particular decision was made by a special committee and their plan was finalized several months ago. They just didn't realize there would be students in Robert's Hall now.</p>
          <p>:Student: Yeah.</p>
          <p>:Teacher: Plus, well, the equipment is all set up, you know, the scaffolding is up on that side of the building and......oh it just won't be practical to have the construction workers move everything to another side and leave a whole side of the library all torn out like that.</p>
          <p>:Student: I guess not. Isn't there another dorm open anywhere?</p>
          <p>:Teacher: Not that I know. Oh, wait. I overheard someone saying today that Manchester Hall isn't being used by the city's summer camp after all. You know, most years they house their participants in that dorm all summer.</p>
          <p>:Student: Well, there is an idea.</p>
          <p>:Teacher: Now it's a smaller dorm and it's a little out of the way but......well, I bet......I bet they could move the affected student from Robert's Hall.</p>
          <p>:Student: Wow, I think a lot of people would definitely appreciate that.</p>
          <p>:Teacher: Ok, well, let me call the housing people and I will get back to you. Leave your name and number, ok? And I will let you know what I find out.</p>
          <p>:Student: Great. Thanks. </p>
