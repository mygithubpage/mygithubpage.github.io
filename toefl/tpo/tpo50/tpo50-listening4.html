We thought that some wiggled and moved around and others were green and just sat there. So the ones that moved like animals were classified as animals, and the more Plant-like ones as plants.</p><p>Here is when the microscope was first invented, people still classified the new species discovered under the microscope according to Aristotle's simple classification of animals and plants. Option C is correct. Option A said that the microscope was invented for the purpose of researching and classifying microorganisms, out of nothing, not selected; Option B said that the invention of the microscope helped scientists confirm the predictions about the characteristics of microorganisms, out of nothing, not selected; Option D said microscopes help scientists distinguish between plants and animals.

You think they could maybe work on a Different side of the building for now, one that not facing people's dorm rooms, and wait until the students are gone? To come back and finish this side? I mean, that way the dust and noise won't be coming directly into our windows While we are here.</p><p>The students proposed their own solutions in this paragraph: First let the workers decorate the other side, and wait for the summer residence students to walk away and then renovate the wall. Option D is appropriate. Option A stated that the project would be stopped before the end of the summer course. Option B would start later and work again. Option C said that it would be inappropriate to decorate another building.

The teacher needs to ask the housing management department and give the student a reply. Option A said that she felt that there was no need to relocate the students to another building. It was a mistake. The teacher felt that it was necessary for the students to avoid the inconvenience caused by the renovation. Option C said that students had to wait for the dormitory to be free, but the original said This building is now no one used, wrong, not selected; Option D said that the student should contact the lodging control department to ask for permission, but the teacher said she contacted herself and contacted the student after the contact.
