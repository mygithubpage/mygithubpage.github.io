              <span class="time" data-times="6.8" data-time="0.7">[00:00.70]</span>Listen to a <span class="underline">conversation</span> between a student and the head of building <span class="underline">maintenance</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.59" data-time="7.5">[00:07.50]</span>Teacher: Can I help you?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.18" data-time="9.09">[00:09.09]</span>Student: Yeah, I um......I'm taking summer classes right now and they put me in Robert's <span class="underline">Dormitory</span>, offered by the library.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.01" data-time="16.27">[00:16.27]</span>Teacher: Ok.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.22" data-time="17.28">[00:17.28]</span>Student: And I guess they are painting the library or doing something to the outside of the building?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.56" data-time="22.5">[00:22.50]</span>Teacher: Ah......yes, they are. They are replacing the bricks on the outside walls.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.93" data-time="26.06">[00:26.06]</span>Student: Well, whatever it is, it's like......really disturbing, for those of us with windows facing the library.<span class="time" data-times="2.11" data-time="31.99">[00:31.99]</span> They are working on the wall right <span class="underline">opposite</span> us.<span class="time" data-times="7.16" data-time="34.1">[00:34.10]</span> I mean, dust is everywhere coming in the windows, and, the noise, cos we are like...... what, ten feet away.<span class="time" data-times="3.62" data-time="41.26">[00:41.26]</span> And......well, it is just not a <span class="underline">pretty</span> picture.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.72" data-time="44.88">[00:44.88]</span>Teacher: Right, well, that's why we waited until now to start work on it.<span class="time" data-times="3.53" data-time="48.6">[00:48.60]</span> I mean, most students have already left <span class="underline">campus</span> for summer <span class="underline">vacation</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.24" data-time="52.13">[00:52.13]</span>Student: Yeah, but Robert's Hall has been used by all the summer students.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="0.77" data-time="55.37">[00:55.37]</span>Teacher: Really? <span class="time" data-times="2.2" data-time="56.14">[00:56.14]</span>The housing didn't <span class="underline">notify</span> us of that.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.13" data-time="58.34">[00:58.34]</span>Student: Yeah. It's <span class="underline">pretty</span> full.<span class="time" data-times="4.66" data-time="59.47">[00:59.47]</span> I mean, I can't sleep at night, because of the smell and the dust and......<span class="time" data-times="5.32" data-time="64.13">[01:04.13]</span>You know, I'd love to just like close the windows but you know (it's) being summer now.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="0.94" data-time="69.45">[01:09.45]</span>Teacher: Yes, I know.<span class="time" data-times="1.73" data-time="70.39">[01:10.39]</span> There is no air-conditioning in that building.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.87" data-time="72.12">[01:12.12]</span>Student: Right! So I mean, we got five more weeks of classes left, and we were really wondering how much longer they are going to be working on that <span class="underline">particular</span> wall.<span class="time" data-times="2.11" data-time="79.99">[01:19.99]</span> Because maybe it's going to be a while.<span class="time" data-times="7.9" data-time="82.1">[01:22.10]</span>Do you think they could maybe work on a different side of the building for now, one that's not facing people's dorm rooms, and wait until the students are gone? <span class="time" data-times="1.87" data-time="90">[01:30.00]</span>To come back and finish this side?<span class="time" data-times="4.95" data-time="91.87">[01:31.87]</span> I mean, that way the dust and noise won't be coming directly into our windows while we are here.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.63" data-time="96.82">[01:36.82]</span>Teacher: You know, I wish it weren't being done this way and it doesn't make <span class="underline">sense</span>.<span class="time" data-times="6.55" data-time="101.45">[01:41.45]</span> But......this <span class="underline">particular</span> decision was made by a <span class="underline">special</span> <span class="underline">committee</span> and their plan was finalized several months ago.<span class="time" data-times="3.7" data-time="108">[01:48.00]</span> They just didn't realize there would be students in Robert's Hall now.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="0.48" data-time="111.7">[01:51.70]</span>Student: Yeah.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="14.73" data-time="112.18">[01:52.18]</span>Teacher: Plus, well, the equipment is all set up, you know, the scaffolding is up on that side of the building and......oh it just won't be <span class="underline">practical</span> to have the <span class="underline">construction</span> workers move everything to another side and leave a whole side of the library all torn out like that.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.51" data-time="126.91">[02:06.91]</span>Student: I guess not.<span class="time" data-times="2.83" data-time="128.42">[02:08.42]</span> Isn't there another dorm open anywhere?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.85" data-time="131.25">[02:11.25]</span>Teacher: Not that I know.<span class="time" data-times="1.85" data-time="133.1">[02:13.10]</span> Oh, wait.<span class="time" data-times="6.12" data-time="134.95">[02:14.95]</span> I overheard someone saying today that Manchester Hall isn't being used by the city's summer camp after all. <span class="time" data-times="3.65" data-time="141.07">[02:21.07]</span>You know, most years they house their participants in that dorm all summer.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.13" data-time="144.72">[02:24.72]</span>Student: Well, there is an idea.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.81" data-time="145.85">[02:25.85]</span>Teacher: Now it's a smaller dorm and it's a little out of the way but......well, I <span class="underline">bet</span>......I <span class="underline">bet</span> they could move the affected student from Robert's Hall.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.39" data-time="153.66">[02:33.66]</span>Student: Wow, I think a lot of people would <span class="underline">definitely</span> <span class="underline">appreciate</span> that.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.7" data-time="156.05">[02:36.05]</span>Teacher: Ok, well, let me call the housing people and I will get back to you.<span class="time" data-times="1.8" data-time="160.75">[02:40.75]</span> Leave your name and number, ok?<span class="time" data-times="1.47" data-time="162.55">[02:42.55]</span> And I will let you know what I find out.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="164.02">[02:44.02]</span>Student: Great. Thanks.</p>
