The idea of Brazilian independence first arose in the late eighteenth <span class="highlight">century</span> as a Brazilian <span class="highlight">reaction</span> to the Portuguese <span class="highlight">policy</span> of tightening <span class="highlight">political</span> and <span class="highlight">economic</span> control over the <span class="highlight">colony</span> in the interests of the mother country. The first <span class="highlight">significant</span> conspiracy against Portuguese rule was organized from 1788-1799 in the province of Minas Gerais, where <span class="highlight">rigid</span> governmental control over the production and prices of gold and diamonds, as well as heavy taxes, caused much <span class="highlight">discontent</span>. But this conspiracy never went beyond the <span class="highlight">stage</span> of discussion and was easily discovered and crushed. Other conspiracies in the late eighteenth <span class="highlight">century</span> as well as a <span class="highlight">brief</span><span class="highlight">revolt</span> in 1817 reflected the influence of republican ideas over sections of the elite and <span class="highlight">even</span> the <span class="highlight">lower</span><span class="highlight">strata</span> of <span class="highlight">urban</span> society. All proved abortive or were soon crushed. Were it not for an <span class="highlight">accident</span> of European <span class="highlight">history</span>, the independence of Brazil might have been long delayed.</p><p>The French <span class="highlight">invasion</span> of Portugal in 1807 followed by the flight of the Portuguese <span class="highlight">court</span> (<span class="highlight">sovereign</span> and <span class="highlight">government</span> officers) to Rio de Janeiro brought large benefits to Brazil. Indeed, the <span class="highlight">transfer</span> of the <span class="highlight">court</span> in effect signified achievement of Brazilian independence. The Portuguese prince and future King Joao VI opened Brazil's ports to the <span class="highlight">trade</span> of friendly nations, permitted the rise of <span class="highlight">local</span> industries, and founded the Bank of Brazil. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> In 1815 he elevated Brazil to the legal <span class="highlight">status</span> of a <span class="highlight">kingdom</span> coequal with Portugal. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> ln one <span class="highlight">sense</span>, however, Brazil's new <span class="highlight">status</span> signified the substitution of one dependence for another. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span> Freed from Portuguese control, Brazil came under the <span class="highlight">economic</span> dominance of England, which obtained <span class="highlight">major</span><span class="highlight">tariff</span> concessions and other privileges by the Strangford Treaty of 1810 between Portugal and Great Britain. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span> The treaty provided for the <span class="highlight">importation</span> of British manufactures into Brazil and the <span class="highlight">export</span> of Brazilian agricultural produce to Great Britain. One result was an <span class="highlight">influx</span> of cheap machine-made goods that swamped the handicrafts <span class="highlight">industry</span> of the country.</p><p>Brazilian elites took satisfaction in Brazil's new role and the growth of educational, cultural, and <span class="highlight">economic</span> opportunities for their class. But the feeling was mixed with resentment toward the thousands of Portuguese courtiers (officials) and hangers-on who came with the <span class="highlight">court</span> and who competed with Brazilians for jobs and favors. Thus, the change in the <span class="highlight">status</span> of Brazil sharpened the <span class="highlight">conflict</span> between Portuguese elites born in Brazil and elites born in Portugal and <span class="highlight">loyal</span> to the Portuguese <span class="highlight">crown</span>.</p><p>The event that <span class="question6">precipitated</span> the <span class="highlight">break</span> with the mother country was the <span class="highlight">revolution</span> of 1820 in Portugal. The Portuguese revolutionaries framed a liberal <span class="highlight">constitution</span> for the <span class="highlight">kingdom</span>, but they were <span class="highlight">conservative</span> or reactionary in relation to Brazil. They demanded the <span class="highlight">immediate</span> return of King Joao to Lisbon, an end to the system of dual monarchy that he had devised, and the <span class="highlight">restoration</span> of the Portuguese <span class="highlight">commercial</span><span class="highlight">monopoly</span>. <span class="question8">Timid</span> and vacillating, King Joao did not know which way to turn. Under the <span class="highlight">pressure</span> of his courtiers, who <span class="question9">hungered to return to Portugal and their lost estates</span>, he finally approved the new <span class="highlight">constitution</span> and sailed for Portugal. He left behind him, however, his son and <span class="highlight">heir</span>, Pedro, and in a private letter advised him that in the event the Brazilians should demand independence, he should <span class="highlight">assume</span> leadership of the movement and set the <span class="highlight">crown</span> of Brazil on his head.</p><p>Soon it became <span class="highlight">clear</span> that the Portuguese <span class="highlight">parliament</span> intended to set the clock back by abrogating all the liberties and concessions won by Brazil since 1808. One of its decrees insisted on the <span class="highlight">immediate</span> return of Pedro from Brazil. The pace of events moved more rapidly in 1822. <span class="question11">On January 9, urged on by Brazilian advisers who perceived a golden <span class="highlight">opportunity</span> to make an orderly <span class="highlight">transition</span> to independence without the intervention of the masses, Pedro refused an order from the <span class="highlight">parliament</span> to return to Portugal, saying famously, "l <span class="highlight">remain</span>.</span>" On September 7, regarded by all Brazilians as Independence Day, he issued the <span class="highlight">even</span> more <span class="highlight">celebrated</span> proclamation, "Independence or death!" In December 1822, having <span class="highlight">overcome</span><span class="highlight">slight</span><span class="highlight">resistance</span> by Portuguese troops, Dom Pedro was formally proclaimed constitutional Emperor of Brazil.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">anarchy</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. uncertainty</p><p>B. disorder</p><p>C. powerlessness</p><p>D. violence</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The title is a vocabulary title, "anarchy" means "chaos; anarchy", the lexical sentence "In contrast to the political anarchy, economic dislocation, and military destruction in Spanish America, Brazil's drive toward independence from Portuguese proceeded as Bloodless transition between 1808 and 1822." In contrast to the anarchy, economic chaos, and military destruction in the Americas of Spain, the transition from Brazil to independence from Portugal in 1808 to 1822 was relatively a bloodless coup. ."</p><p>The A option "uncertainty" means "unsure, indefinite", meaning inconsistent, excluded.</p><p>The B option "disorder" means "chaos; turmoil," meaning the closest, so it is the correct answer.</p><p>The C option "powerlessness" means "inability to do anything".</p><p>The D option "violence" means "violence", which means inconsistent and exclusion.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 1, what first caused Brazilians to think seriously about trying to achieve independence from Portugal?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

The drive toward independence going on at the time in parts of Spanish America</p><p>D. The Portuguese reaction to Brazil's efforts to gain control over its economy</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The title is a detailed question. According to the keyword "first" in the title question, we position the first paragraph of the second sentence "The idea of ??the Brazilian independence first arose in the late eighteenth century as a Brazilian reaction to the Portuguese policy of tightening political And economic control over the colony in the interests of the mother country." In this sentence, Portugal strengthens its control over the colonial politics and economy of Brazil for the benefit of its own country. The idea of ??Brazilian independence is exactly what Portugal does. Revolt. Therefore, option B: Portugal controls Brazil's politics and economy for its own benefit, which is the root cause of Brazilian independence. Let's look at other options:</p><p>Option A: Portugal's interest in overseas colonies weakened. Wrong, because the first paragraph did not mention this information.</p><p>Option C: At that time, in some parts of Spain and the Americas, independent movement continued. In the first paragraph, only the first sentence mentioned the state of anarchy, economic chaos, and military destruction in the Spanish Americas, but this is in contrast to the non-bloodless coup in the Brazilian independence movement and not the reason for the independence of Brazil . It belongs to unrelated winding information, so it is excluded.</p><p>Option D: Portugal's resistance to Brazil's struggle for economic rights. Wrong because the article is about Portugal's strengthening of its political and economic rule in Brazil and Brazil's resistance. Therefore, the logic of the D option is reversed and contradicts the original information, so it is excluded.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 1, what happened to the 1788-1799 conspiracy against Portuguese rule?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It ended up creating discontent in certain provinces of Brazil</p><p>B. It increasingly came under the influence of republican ideas from Portugal</p><p>C. It was crushed before it got beyond the planning stage</p><p>D. It gradually lost the support of the lower strata of urban society</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The title is a detailed question. According to the positioning word "1788-1799" in the title, we can directly locate the third sentence of the first paragraph: "The first significant conspiracy against Portuguese rule...caused much discontent." Brazil in 1788 By 1799, the first major rebellion against Portuguese rule was organized in the state of Minas Gerais. The harsh government controlled the prices of production, gold, and gemstones and caused the people to bear heavy taxes. Many dissatisfaction. Then, the fourth sentence is also describing the mutiny "But this conspiracy never went beyond the stage of discussion and was easily discovered and crushed." It shows that the mutiny has been revealed and has been suppressed after it has not been discussed. In accordance with the C option, the rebellion was suppressed after it had not been planned. Therefore, the C option was correct.</p><p>Option A said that this mutiny caused a lot of dissatisfaction in some Brazilian provinces. However, the harsh government rule and heavy taxation in the original text caused the "discontent" of the masses and was not a dissatisfaction caused by the treason.</p><p>Option B said that the treason was increasingly influenced by Portuguese Republican thinking. But according to the keyword "republican ideas" we find the penultimate sentence of the first paragraph " Other conspiracies in the late eighteenth century as well as a brief revolt in 1817 reflected the influence of republican ideas over sections of the elite and even the lower strata "The phrase "of urban society." This statement is about other treason, reflecting the influence of Republican ideas on some elites and even on the lower classes.It has nothing to do with the 1788-1799 coup. Can be excluded directly.</p><p>Option D said that this mutiny gradually lost the support of the lower classes. The sentence "lower strata" is similar to the sentence in option B above. It does not refer to the lower social support in the text but is not related to the 1788-1799 coup.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 2, Brazil gained a significant measure of independence early in the nineteenth century primarily as a result of</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. the Portuguese prince's desire to become King of Brazil rather than King of Portugal</p><p>B. Brazil's growing industrial and financial importance</p><p>C. the flight of the Portuguese court to Rio de Janeiro</p><p>D. the Strangford Treaty with England</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>This question is a detailed question. The question asked about independence in Brazil in the 19th century. What caused the incident? Although the subject asked us to look for the answer in the second paragraph, the attentive classmates will find that the last sentence of the first paragraph already gave such a hint "Were it not for an accident of European history, the independence of Brazil might "have been long delayed." So the historical event to be described in the second paragraph is the key to solving problems. We look at the second paragraph of the first and second sentences: "The French invasion of Portugal in 1807 followed by the flight of the Portuguese court (sovereign and government officers) to Rio de Janeiro brought large benefits to Brazil. Indeed, the transfer of the court In the two sentences, the invasion of France caused the Portuguese government to flee to Rio de Janeiro. The transfer of government actually means the realization of Brazil's independence. So the C option: The Portuguese government fled to Rio de Janeiro, right.</p><p>A: The prince of Portugal wants to be the king of Brazil and not the king of Portugal. This information was not mentioned in the second paragraph and was ruled out.</p><p>Option B: Brazil's growing industrial and economic importance. In the second paragraph, only the measures taken by the Portuguese prince who came to Brazil to benefit the industry and economic development are mentioned. This is not the reason for Brazil's independence.D option: Treaty between Brazil and the United Kingdom. Wrong, the article stated that Britain had obtained major tariff concessions and other privileges through the Treaty of Strangford signed with Portugal in 1810. However, the signing of the treaty was not the reason for the independence of Brazil. This option is irrelevant interference information and can be excluded.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 2, King Joao did each of the following for Brazil EXCEPT</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. establish a national bank</p><p>B. support Brazilian industries</p><p>C. obtain important tariff concessions from England</p><p>D. encourage trade with a wider range of nations</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>This question is to negate the factual information question. The question asked which of the following is not what Joao VI did for Brazil. According to the keyword "King Joao", the third sentence of the second paragraph is positioned "The Portuguese prince and future King Joao VI opened Brazil's ports to the trade of friendly nations, permitted the rise of local industries, and founded the Bank of Brazil." The sentence outlines three things Joao VI did: (1) Open the port of Brazil and trade with friendly countries; (2) Make the rise of local industry possible; (3) Establish a Brazilian bank. (1) corresponds to D option; (2) corresponds to B option; (3) corresponds to A option. So there is only C: getting an important tariff concession from the UK is not mentioned in the text, so C is the correct answer.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question6">precipitated</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. came before</p><p>B. brought about</p><p>C. resulted from</p><p>D. slowed down</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>This title is a vocabulary question. Although "precipitate" means "precipitation," it is used here as a verb that means "make (usually a bad event or situation) suddenly occur." The word "The event that <span class="question6">precipitated</span> the break with the mother country was the revolution of 1820 in Portugal." means "The event that broke Brazil and the sovereign (Portugal) was the Portuguese bourgeois revolution of 1820." Here we come See options:</p><p>A: came before, meaning "before ... before ...", meaning not, so ruled out.</p><p>B:brought about, meaning "cause, cause; cause (something)", the closest meaning, it is the correct answer.</p><p>The result of the C option result from is "caused by ..., caused by ...", meaning inconsistent, so ruled out.</p><p>The D option slowed down means "(make) slow down."</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, the Portuguese revolutionaries insisted on each of the following EXCEPT</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

Which of the following is not required by the title of the Portuguese revolutionary? According to the keyword "Portuguese Revolutionaryes", the second paragraph of the fourth paragraph is located: "The Portuguese revolutionaries framed a liberal constitution for the kingdom, but they were conservative or reactionary in relation to Brazil." Mentioned that the Portuguese revolutionaries were their own countries. A free constitution was enacted, but Option B stated that Portugal had established a free constitution for Brazil. This contradicts the original text, so it can be directly determined that the B option is the correct answer. Then we look down at the third sentence "They demanded the immediate return of King Joao to Lisbon, an end to the system of dual monarchy that he had devised, and the restoration of the Portuguese commercial monopoly." The revolutionists mentioned three requirements: (1) Requested King Joao VI to return to Lisbon immediately; (2) Ended the dual monarchy; (3) Restored Portuguese commercial monopoly. (1) corresponds to the A option; (2) corresponds to the C option; (3) corresponds to the D option, so only the B option is not mentioned in the text.

King Joao's decision to leave his son Pedro in Brazil</p><p>D. the growing threat of intervention by the Brazilian masses</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The title of this topic is the topic of function. First of all, we look at the sentence in the title: "The courtiers are eager to return to Portugal and return to their lost homeland." Returning to the original text, according to the above we know that Joao VI is a very indecisive person and does not know how to make choices. According to the following, he finally approved the new constitution and returned to Portugal by boat. So the key figure for him to make a decision is courtiers. In the sentence, "Under the pressure of his courtiers", it can be seen that the attribute in the question is to emphasize the status of the courtiers. They can exert pressure on Joao VI and force him to make a decision, so the B option is correct.</p><p>Option A: Explain how conservative the courtiers are. The word "conservative" was mentioned above, "The Portuguese revolutionaries framed a liberal constitution for the kingdom, but they were conservative or reactionary in relation to Brazil." But the subject of the sentence is revolutionaries, so it has nothing to do with courtiers. exclude.</p><p>Option C: Illustrates the impact of the revolution. Wrong, because the content of the shadow is just an attributive, not an example. It is intended to modify "courtiers", so C excludes.</p><p>D option: Explain why Joao VI suggested his son do that in his letter. According to what follows, Joao VI advised Pedro in the letter that if Brazil asked for independence, he should lead the independence movement, but this is not directly related to courtiers. D option is excluded....</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. On January 9, 1822, Brazil achieved independence without any involvement by the masses when Pedro, despite the urging of his Brazilian advisers, defied a parliamentary order to return to Portugal</p><p>B.

First of all, let's look at the simplified sentence, which means "On January 9th, the Brazilian aides considered this a golden opportunity to allow Brazil to orderly and excessively independent in the absence of interference. The Kingdom of the Kingdom, under the advice of the aides, Pedro refused the order of the Portuguese Parliament to ask him to return to Portugal and said the famous one: 'I will stay here.'"</p><p>The "despite the urging of his Brazilian advisers" in the A option is in contradiction with the original text. The article does not have such a transitional relationship because the adviser recommends that Pedro declare Brazil independent. So the A option is wrong.</p><p>The B option subject is wrong. The original said that Pedro rejected the order of the Portuguese Parliament to ask him to return to Portugal on the advice of advisers, but Option B stated that on the advice of advisers, the Portuguese Parliament asked Pedro to return. So, the B option is wrong.</p><p>Translating the C option to January 9 is a good opportunity for Brazil to orderly become an independent kingdom in the absence of interference, but Pedro says "I will stay here" and refuses to return to Portugal. This sentence itself is self-contradictory. Moreover, "but" indicates a turning point, and there is no logical word for turning in the original text. Therefore, the C option is wrong.</p><p>The D option is an overview of the original sentence, the subject is correct, and the main body is complete, and the logic is fluent.

In the following text, "In December 1822, having a slight resistance by Portuguese troops, Dom Pedro was formally proclaimed constitutional Emperor of Brazil." Pedro officially became the king of Brazil.</p><p>Option B was wrong, because Pedro refused the Portuguese Council's order to return him to Portugal on January 9, 1822, not on Independence Day.</p><p>The C option is wrong because this option is not mentioned in the text and can be excluded.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Therefore, although still closely linked to Portugal, Brazil was no longer formally considered a colony.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>This question is a sentence insertion question.

We must pay attention to grasp the logical word "therefore" in this sentence, with the front There should be a causal relationship in one sentence. Returning to the original text, the previous sentence of Box A is about the contribution of Joao VI to Brazil. The next sentence of Box A is that he raised Brazil to the Kingdom of Brazil to make it equal to Portugal. Legal Status. This sentence and the sentence to be inserted can constitute a causal link, because Brazil and Portugal enjoy the same legal status, so despite the close relationship between Brazil and Portugal, Brazil is no longer a Portuguese colony. So the sentence is best inserted at B. The content behind the B box is to say that the British rule over Brazil, so the sentences inserted at C, D are not suitable.

But what the text says is that the Treaty of Strangford stipulates which British goods can be imported into Brazil and which Brazilian agricultural products can be exported to the United Kingdom, leading to a large number of cheap machine-made goods flowing into Brazilian handicrafts.
