            <b>The Achievement of Brazilian Independence</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>In <span class="underline">contrast</span> to the <span class="underline">political</span><span class="light">anarchy</span> <span class="underline">economic</span> dislocation, and <span class="underline">military</span> <span class="underline">destruction</span> in Spanish America, Brazil's <span class="underline">drive</span> toward independence from Portugal proceeded as a <span class="underline">relatively</span> bloodless <span class="underline">transition</span> between 1808 and 1822. The idea of Brazilian independence first arose in the late eighteenth <span class="underline">century</span> as a Brazilian <span class="underline">reaction</span> to the Portuguese <span class="underline">policy</span> of tightening <span class="underline">political</span> and <span class="underline">economic</span> control over the <span class="underline">colony</span> in the interests of the mother country. The first <span class="underline">significant</span> conspiracy against Portuguese rule was organized from 1788-1799 in the province of Minas Gerais, where <span class="underline">rigid</span> governmental control over the production and prices of gold and diamonds, as well as heavy taxes, caused much <span class="underline">discontent</span>. But this conspiracy never went beyond the <span class="underline">stage</span> of discussion and was easily discovered and crushed. Other conspiracies in the late eighteenth <span class="underline">century</span> as well as a <span class="underline">brief</span> <span class="underline">revolt</span> in 1817 reflected the influence of republican ideas over sections of the elite and <span class="underline">even</span> the <span class="underline">lower</span> <span class="underline">strata</span> of <span class="underline">urban</span> society. All proved abortive or were soon crushed. Were it not for an <span class="underline">accident</span> of European <span class="underline">history</span>, the independence of Brazil might have been long delayed.</p>
          <p>The French <span class="underline">invasion</span> of Portugal in 1807 followed by the flight of the Portuguese <span class="underline">court</span> (<span class="underline">sovereign</span> and <span class="underline">government</span> officers) to Rio de Janeiro brought large benefits to Brazil. Indeed, the <span class="underline">transfer</span> of the <span class="underline">court</span> in effect signified achievement of Brazilian independence. The Portuguese prince and future King Joao VI opened Brazil's ports to the <span class="underline">trade</span> of friendly nations, permitted the rise of <span class="underline">local</span> industries, and founded the Bank of Brazil. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> In 1815 he elevated Brazil to the legal <span class="underline">status</span> of a <span class="underline">kingdom</span> coequal with Portugal. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> ln one <span class="underline">sense</span>, however, Brazil's new <span class="underline">status</span> signified the substitution of one dependence for another. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span> Freed from Portuguese control, Brazil came under the <span class="underline">economic</span> dominance of England, which obtained <span class="underline">major</span> <span class="underline">tariff</span> concessions and other privileges by the Strangford Treaty of 1810 between Portugal and Great Britain. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span> The treaty provided for the <span class="underline">importation</span> of British manufactures into Brazil and the <span class="underline">export</span> of Brazilian agricultural produce to Great Britain. One result was an <span class="underline">influx</span> of cheap machine-made goods that swamped the handicrafts <span class="underline">industry</span> of the country.</p>
          <p>Brazilian elites took satisfaction in Brazil's new role and the growth of educational, cultural, and <span class="underline">economic</span> opportunities for their class. But the feeling was mixed with resentment toward the thousands of Portuguese courtiers (officials) and hangers-on who came with the <span class="underline">court</span> and who competed with Brazilians for jobs and favors. Thus, the change in the <span class="underline">status</span> of Brazil sharpened the <span class="underline">conflict</span> between Portuguese elites born in Brazil and elites born in Portugal and <span class="underline">loyal</span> to the Portuguese <span class="underline">crown</span>.</p>
          <p>The event that precipitated the <span class="underline">break</span> with the mother country was the <span class="underline">revolution</span> of 1820 in Portugal. The Portuguese revolutionaries framed a liberal <span class="underline">constitution</span> for the <span class="underline">kingdom</span>, but they were <span class="underline">conservative</span> or reactionary in relation to Brazil. They demanded the <span class="underline">immediate</span> return of King Joao to Lisbon, an end to the system of dual monarchy that he had devised, and the <span class="underline">restoration</span> of the Portuguese <span class="underline">commercial</span> <span class="underline">monopoly</span>. Timid and vacillating, King Joao did not know which way to turn. Under the <span class="underline">pressure</span> of his courtiers, who hungered to return to Portugal and their lost estates, he finally approved the new <span class="underline">constitution</span> and sailed for Portugal. He left behind him, however, his son and <span class="underline">heir</span>, Pedro, and in a private letter advised him that in the event the Brazilians should demand independence, he should <span class="underline">assume</span> leadership of the movement and set the <span class="underline">crown</span> of Brazil on his head.</p>
          <p>Soon it became <span class="underline">clear</span> that the Portuguese <span class="underline">parliament</span> intended to set the clock back by abrogating all the liberties and concessions won by Brazil since 1808. One of its decrees insisted on the <span class="underline">immediate</span> return of Pedro from Brazil. The pace of events moved more rapidly in 1822. On January 9, urged on by Brazilian advisers who perceived a golden <span class="underline">opportunity</span> to make an orderly <span class="underline">transition</span> to independence without the intervention of the masses, Pedro refused an order from the <span class="underline">parliament</span> to return to Portugal, saying famously, "l <span class="underline">remain</span>." On September 7, regarded by all Brazilians as Independence Day, he issued the <span class="underline">even</span> more <span class="underline">celebrated</span> proclamation, "Independence or death!" In December 1822, having <span class="underline">overcome</span> <span class="underline">slight</span> <span class="underline">resistance</span> by Portuguese troops, Dom Pedro was formally proclaimed constitutional Emperor of Brazil.</p>
