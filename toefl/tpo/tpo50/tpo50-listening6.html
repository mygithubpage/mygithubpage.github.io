<span class="highlight">geology</span> class.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="1.88" data-time="4.94">[00:04.94]</span>Professor: Hi, class, let's get started. <span class="time" data-times="6.73" data-time="6.82">[00:06.82]</span>Um, last time we finished up the <span class="highlight">section</span> of <span class="highlight">coal</span>, so we have just two <span class="highlight">fossil</span> fuels left to talk about.<span class="time" data-times="3.06" data-time="13.55">[00:13.55]</span> Those are <span class="highlight">petroleum</span> and natural gas.<span class="time" data-times="4.68" data-time="16.61">[00:16.61]</span> Today I will <span class="highlight">concentrate</span> on <span class="highlight">petroleum</span> and we will get into natural gas tomorrow.<span class="time" data-times="9.03" data-time="21.29">[00:21.29]</span> Like <span class="highlight">coal</span> and natural gas, <span class="highlight">petroleum</span> has been formed over millions of years, from remains of <span class="highlight">prehistoric</span> plants and animals.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.94" data-time="30.32">[00:30.32]</span>And like <span class="highlight">coal</span> and natural gas, it's found in the rocks of Earth's crusts.<span class="time" data-times="4.27" data-time="35.26">[00:35.26]</span> In fact, the word "<span class="highlight">petroleum</span>" <span class="highlight">literally</span> means "rock oil".<span class="time" data-times="10.77" data-time="39.53">[00:39.53]</span> And in its' <span class="highlight">original</span><span class="highlight">state</span>, the way we find it in Earth's <span class="highlight">crust</span>, it is called <span class="highlight">crude</span> oil, sometime people will short it up, and just <span class="highlight">refer</span> to it as <span class="highlight">crude</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="13.71" data-time="50.3">[00:50.30]</span>Um, <span class="highlight">petroleum</span> also contains natural gas, so usually the <span class="highlight">petroleum</span><span class="highlight">industry</span> is naturally searching for and utilizing deposits of both <span class="highlight">crude</span> oil and natural gas at the same time.<span class="time" data-times="8.25" data-time="64.01">[01:04.01]</span> In other words, companies might as well gather, use and sell both the oil and the gas when they find it, since both are <span class="highlight">valuable</span>.<span class="time" data-times="1.73" data-time="72.26">[01:12.26]</span> And......</p><p><span class="time" data-times="8.26" data-time="73.99">[01:13.99]</span>Student: But what kind of <span class="highlight">organic</span> materials, I mean, <span class="highlight">specifically</span> what kind of dead plant and animals make up <span class="highlight">petroleum</span> exactly? <span class="time" data-times="3.05" data-time="82.25">[01:22.25]</span>Do you mean like trees and dinosaurs?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.77" data-time="85.3">[01:25.30]</span>Professor: Well, apparently <span class="highlight">petroleum</span> is usually made from simple, one-celled <span class="highlight">marine</span> animals and plants, <span class="highlight">algae</span>, for example.<span class="time" data-times="7.32" data-time="93.07">[01:33.07]</span> Um, what happens is this accumulated plant and animal <span class="highlight">material</span> that originally came from the ocean gets covered by <span class="highlight">sediment</span>.<span class="time" data-times="7.06" data-time="100.39">[01:40.39]</span> And then is...um, <span class="highlight">eventually</span><span class="highlight">exposed</span> to earth <span class="highlight">internal</span> heat and <span class="highlight">pressure</span>, for millions of years.<span class="time" data-times="9.02" data-time="107.45">[01:47.45]</span> And over those millions of years, the heat cooks and the <span class="highlight">pressure</span> molds that <span class="highlight">material</span>, turning it into a thick, <span class="highlight">sticky</span><span class="highlight">liquid</span>.<span class="time" data-times="9.7" data-time="116.47">[01:56.47]</span> And since <span class="highlight">petroleum</span> is made from these ocean organisms, you can guess where it was found, it makes <span class="highlight">sense</span> that we usually find it under the ocean or near <span class="highlight">shore</span>, right?<span class="time" data-times="1.39" data-time="126.17">[02:06.17]</span> Yes, Ann?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.78" data-time="127.56">[02:07.56]</span>Ann: I've heard people talk of......ah......live and dead oils?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.17" data-time="132.34">[02:12.34]</span>Professor: Well, um, when <span class="highlight">crude</span> oil has a lot of natural gas mixed up with it, it's called live oil.<span class="time" data-times="4.27" data-time="139.51">[02:19.51]</span> But if the gas escapes from the mixture, then oil is said to be dead.<span class="time" data-times="3.35" data-time="143.78">[02:23.78]</span> And it's heavy and more difficult to <span class="highlight">pump</span>.<span class="time" data-times="4.38" data-time="147.13">[02:27.13]</span> Does anyone know how the gas separates from the oil? <span class="time" data-times="1.25" data-time="151.51">[02:31.51]</span>Sam, go ahead.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.6" data-time="152.76">[02:32.76]</span>Sam: Doesn't it happen when the oil shoots up to the surface?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="1.04" data-time="156.36">[02:36.36]</span>Professor: Yes, that's right.<span class="time" data-times="4.05" data-time="157.4">[02:37.40]</span> When oil reaches the surface of the Earth, there is less <span class="highlight">pressure</span> on it.<span class="time" data-times="3.79" data-time="161.45">[02:41.45]</span> And with less <span class="highlight">pressure</span>, the oil and gas were able to <span class="highlight">separate</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.42" data-time="165.24">[02:45.24]</span>The other way the <span class="highlight">crude</span> oil was able to come up to the surface is by people pumping it up out of the ground.<span class="time" data-times="7.32" data-time="170.66">[02:50.66]</span> And, um, it's the same thing that happens at the surface, there is less <span class="highlight">pressure</span>, and, so the oil and gas <span class="highlight">separate</span>. <span class="time" data-times="12" data-time="177.98">[02:57.98]</span>But when we talked about how would actually exists inside earth's <span class="highlight">crust</span>, most people think that there are huge, pools of oil sitting around in caverns somewhere under there. <span class="time" data-times="1.47" data-time="189.98">[03:09.98]</span>That's really <span class="highlight">rare</span>.<span class="time" data-times="7.1" data-time="191.45">[03:11.45]</span> The <span class="highlight">majority</span> of <span class="highlight">petroleum</span> is just filling in the tiny pores and cracks in rocks.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.89" data-time="198.55">[03:18.55]</span>Now, um, a little more on the <span class="highlight">petroleum</span><span class="highlight">industry</span>.<span class="time" data-times="13.8" data-time="202.44">[03:22.44]</span> As far as the extraction <span class="highlight">process</span> the <span class="highlight">petroleum</span><span class="highlight">industry</span> digs deep wells to <span class="highlight">reach</span><span class="highlight">underground</span> oil fields where <span class="highlight">crude</span> oil has accumulated over a large area and <span class="highlight">extract</span> between layers of rocks.<span class="time" data-times="2.53" data-time="216.24">[03:36.24]</span> Then it pumps the <span class="highlight">crude</span> oil out. <span class="time" data-times="11.23" data-time="218.77">[03:38.77]</span>Then its refineries have two main tasks, <span class="highlight">convert</span> less <span class="highlight">valuable</span><span class="highlight">crude</span> oil into a more <span class="highlight">valuable</span> form and create usable products from <span class="highlight">refined</span> oil.<span class="time" data-times="3.11" data-time="230">[03:50.00]</span> Basically, the refiner will do this by boiling the oil.<span class="time" data-times="15.11" data-time="233.11">[03:53.11]</span> When the oil cools off, the <span class="highlight">stuff</span> that is left is turned into a <span class="highlight">variety</span> of products, like <span class="highlight">gasoline</span>, <span class="highlight">diesel</span><span class="highlight">fuel</span> for cars and trucks, asphalt for roads, um, paints, plastics, <span class="highlight">even</span> soaps.<span class="time" data-times="8.34" data-time="248.22">[04:08.22]</span> And <span class="highlight">check</span> what you're wearing, if you are wearing something with <span class="highlight">synthetic</span> fibers, what that really means is that it is made of the <span class="highlight">petroleum</span>.<span class="time" data-times="5.71" data-time="256.56">[04:16.56]</span> So you can see <span class="highlight">petroleum</span> is <span class="highlight">essential</span> to today's <span class="highlight">industrial</span> society.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="11.09" data-time="262.27">[04:22.27]</span>Now, next week we will be joined the graduate students from the <span class="highlight">department</span> of <span class="highlight">petroleum</span><span class="highlight">engineering</span> to examine the <span class="highlight">comprehensive</span><span class="highlight">field</span> study they're working on in our <span class="highlight">local</span> oil fields.<span class="time" data-times="5.52" data-time="273.36">[04:33.36]</span> And I'd like you to read over the <span class="highlight">pack</span> of information I'm about to hand out to you before we go.<span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="278.88">[04:38.88]</span> It should <span class="highlight">familiarize</span> you with the <span

id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the lecture mainly about?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Efforts to increase the production of petroleum and natural gas</p><p>B. Problems associated with the refining of dead oil</p><p>C. Recent improvements in methods used to locate petroleum</p><p>D. Background information essential to understanding the petroleum industry</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The relevant text of this question is:</p><p>Professor:</p><p>Hi, class, let's get started. Um, last time we finished up the section of coal, so we have just two fossil fuels left to talk about. Those are petroleum and natural gas. Today I will concentrate on petroleum and we will get into Natural gas tomorrow.</p><p>This question asks the main content of the lecture. From the opening remarks of the professor, we can see that this lesson is mainly about a section of general knowledge about petroleum. Option D is an important background knowledge of the oil industry. Option A is the method of increasing production of oil and natural gas, Option B is the problem of dead oil refining, and Option C is the improvement of positioning of petroleum technology. It is not the main content of the lecture. Select D.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor, why does the petroleum industry search for crude oil and natural gas at the same time? Click on 2 answers.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Both tend to be located together.</p><p>B. The industry can profit by exploiting both.</p><p>C. Natural gas is used to refine crude oil.</p><p>D. Natural gas is used to operate crude oil pumps.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="AB"><p>The relevant text of this question is:</p><p>Professor:</p><p>Um, petroleum also contains natural gas, so usually the petroleum industry is naturally searching for and utilizing deposits of both crude oil and natural gas at the same time. In other words, companies might as well gather, use and sell both the oil and the Gas when they find it, since both are valuable. And......</p><p>The professor here stated the reason why two oil and natural gas are mined together: one is that oil and gas are always stored in one place, and the other is that both have the value of exploitation, so the oil industry always processes the two at the same time. These two correspond to Option A and Option B respectively. Option C is that natural gas is used to purify oil, and Option D is to say that natural gas is the dye that is used to pump oil. It is not correct. Double-select AB.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor, why does the petroleum industry usually look for petroleum under the ocean or near the shore?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Petroleum often rises to the surface of the water, where it can be easily seen.</p><p>B. Petroleum was formed from ocean plants and animals.</p><p>C. Water pressure from the ocean prevents petroleum from leaking away.</p><p>D. Oil drills can easily penetrate the ocean floor.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The relevant text of this question is:</p><p>Professor:</p><p>Well, apparently petroleum is usually made from simple, one-celled marine animals and plants, algae, for example. Um, what happens is this accumulated plant and animal material that originally came from the ocean gets covered by sediment. And then is...um !first exposed to earth internal heat and pressure, for millions of years. And over those millions of years, the heat cooks and the pressure molds that material, turning it into a thick, sticky liquid. And since petroleum is made from these ocean organisms , you can guess where it was found, it makes sense that we usually find it under the ocean or near shore, right?</p><p>The professor said here that the animals and plants that produce oil are single-celled plants and animals in the ocean, so oil is usually found in the sea or on the coast. Option B is correct. Option A means that because oil often floats to the surface of the sea, it is easy to be seen; Option C says that the pressure of water causes oil to leak; Option D says that oil drilling can easily penetrate the seabed, and it does not comply with the original text. Select B.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor, what determines the difference between live and dead oil?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The age of the oil</p><p>B. The natural gas content of the oil</p><p>C. The percentage of organic material in the oil</p><p>D. The amount of heat the oil will produce when burned</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The relevant text of this question is:</p><p>Ann:</p><p>I've heard people talk of......ah...live and dead oils?</p><p>Professor:</p><p>Well, um, when crude oil has a lot of natural gas mixed up with it, it's called live oil. But if the gas escapes from the mixture, then oil is said to be dead. And it's heavy and more difficult to pump.</p><p>Here, because of female students' questions, the professor distinguishes between live oil and dead oil. The difference between the two is how much natural gas is contained, mostly live oil and less dead oil. Option B is correct. Option A is the age of oil, Option C is the content of organic matter in petroleum, and Option D is the amount of heat that oil can produce. Select B.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor mention crude oil that is found in pools?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To point out a common misconception about crude oil</p><p>B. To explain why crude oil must be refined before it can be burned</p><p>C. To describe the state in which most crude oil is found</p><p>D. To support a previous statement about low pressure on crude oil</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The relevant text of this question is:</p><p>Professor:</p><p>But when we talked about how would actually much think inside earth's crust, most people think that there are huge, pools of oil sitting around in caverns somewhere under there. That's seriously rare. The majority of petroleum is just filling in the tiny pores and cracks in Rocks.</p><p>The professor here said that people generally think that oil is stored in large quantities in the sea, but in fact, most of the oil is in tiny holes and cracks in the rock, which shows people's storage of oil. There is a misunderstanding. Option A is correct. Option B was meant to explain why oil was refined before it was burned, Option C was to describe the state when crude oil was found, and Option D was to support some claim that crude oil under low pressure was not in compliance with the original text. Select A.</p></div></div><div class="replay" id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor say this:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To clarify the meaning of the word "synthetic"</p><p>B. To demonstrate how important petroleum is in everyday life</p><p>C. To show that the students need to do more research about petroleum</p><p>D. To explain why synthetic fibers have useful characteristics</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The relevant text of this question is:</p><p>Professor:</p><p>When the oil cools off, the stuff that is left is turned into a variety of products, like gasoline, diesel fuel for cars and trucks, asphalt for roads, um, paints, plastics, even soaps. And check what you're wearing, If you are wearing something with spandex fibers, what that really means is that it is made of the petroleum. So you can see petroleum is essential to today's industrial society.</p><p>The part of the subject that focuses on listening is that professors let students check their clothes for non-spandex. Or in a specific example, it shows that oil can make a lot of daily necessities, which has a huge effect on industrial production. Option B is correct. Option A is that in order to clarify the meaning of spandex, Option C is to say that in order to show the students also need to do more research on oil, Option D is to explain why spandex fibers have useful features, do not meet the original text. Option B.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
