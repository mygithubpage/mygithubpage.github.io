              <span class="time" data-times="4.54" data-time="0.4">[00:00.40]</span>Listen to part of a lecture in a <span class="underline">geology</span> class.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.88" data-time="4.94">[00:04.94]</span>Professor: Hi, class, let's get started. <span class="time" data-times="6.73" data-time="6.82">[00:06.82]</span>Um, last time we finished up the <span class="underline">section</span> of <span class="underline">coal</span>, so we have just two <span class="underline">fossil</span> fuels left to talk about.<span class="time" data-times="3.06" data-time="13.55">[00:13.55]</span> Those are <span class="underline">petroleum</span> and natural gas.<span class="time" data-times="4.68" data-time="16.61">[00:16.61]</span> Today I will <span class="underline">concentrate</span> on <span class="underline">petroleum</span> and we will get into natural gas tomorrow.<span class="time" data-times="9.03" data-time="21.29">[00:21.29]</span> Like <span class="underline">coal</span> and natural gas, <span class="underline">petroleum</span> has been formed over millions of years, from remains of <span class="underline">prehistoric</span> plants and animals.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.94" data-time="30.32">[00:30.32]</span>And like <span class="underline">coal</span> and natural gas, it's found in the rocks of Earth's crusts.<span class="time" data-times="4.27" data-time="35.26">[00:35.26]</span> In fact, the word "<span class="underline">petroleum</span>" <span class="underline">literally</span> means "rock oil".<span class="time" data-times="10.77" data-time="39.53">[00:39.53]</span> And in its' <span class="underline">original</span> <span class="underline">state</span>, the way we find it in Earth's <span class="underline">crust</span>, it is called <span class="underline">crude</span> oil, sometime people will short it up, and just <span class="underline">refer</span> to it as <span class="underline">crude</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="13.71" data-time="50.3">[00:50.30]</span>Um, <span class="underline">petroleum</span> also contains natural gas, so usually the <span class="underline">petroleum</span> <span class="underline">industry</span> is naturally searching for and utilizing deposits of both <span class="underline">crude</span> oil and natural gas at the same time.<span class="time" data-times="8.25" data-time="64.01">[01:04.01]</span> In other words, companies might as well gather, use and sell both the oil and the gas when they find it, since both are <span class="underline">valuable</span>.<span class="time" data-times="1.73" data-time="72.26">[01:12.26]</span> And......</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.26" data-time="73.99">[01:13.99]</span>Student: But what kind of <span class="underline">organic</span> materials, I mean, <span class="underline">specifically</span> what kind of dead plant and animals make up <span class="underline">petroleum</span> exactly? <span class="time" data-times="3.05" data-time="82.25">[01:22.25]</span>Do you mean like trees and dinosaurs?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.77" data-time="85.3">[01:25.30]</span>Professor: Well, apparently <span class="underline">petroleum</span> is usually made from simple, one-celled <span class="underline">marine</span> animals and plants, <span class="underline">algae</span>, for example.<span class="time" data-times="7.32" data-time="93.07">[01:33.07]</span> Um, what happens is this accumulated plant and animal <span class="underline">material</span> that originally came from the ocean gets covered by <span class="underline">sediment</span>.<span class="time" data-times="7.06" data-time="100.39">[01:40.39]</span> And then is...um, <span class="underline">eventually</span> <span class="underline">exposed</span> to earth <span class="underline">internal</span> heat and <span class="underline">pressure</span>, for millions of years.<span class="time" data-times="9.02" data-time="107.45">[01:47.45]</span> And over those millions of years, the heat cooks and the <span class="underline">pressure</span> molds that <span class="underline">material</span>, turning it into a thick, <span class="underline">sticky</span> <span class="underline">liquid</span>.<span class="time" data-times="9.7" data-time="116.47">[01:56.47]</span> And since <span class="underline">petroleum</span> is made from these ocean organisms, you can guess where it was found, it makes <span class="underline">sense</span> that we usually find it under the ocean or near <span class="underline">shore</span>, right?<span class="time" data-times="1.39" data-time="126.17">[02:06.17]</span> Yes, Ann?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.78" data-time="127.56">[02:07.56]</span>Ann: I've heard people talk of......ah......live and dead oils?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.17" data-time="132.34">[02:12.34]</span>Professor: Well, um, when <span class="underline">crude</span> oil has a lot of natural gas mixed up with it, it's called live oil.<span class="time" data-times="4.27" data-time="139.51">[02:19.51]</span> But if the gas escapes from the mixture, then oil is said to be dead.<span class="time" data-times="3.35" data-time="143.78">[02:23.78]</span> And it's heavy and more difficult to <span class="underline">pump</span>.<span class="time" data-times="4.38" data-time="147.13">[02:27.13]</span> Does anyone know how the gas separates from the oil? <span class="time" data-times="1.25" data-time="151.51">[02:31.51]</span>Sam, go ahead.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.6" data-time="152.76">[02:32.76]</span>Sam: Doesn't it happen when the oil shoots up to the surface?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.04" data-time="156.36">[02:36.36]</span>Professor: Yes, that's right.<span class="time" data-times="4.05" data-time="157.4">[02:37.40]</span> When oil reaches the surface of the Earth, there is less <span class="underline">pressure</span> on it.<span class="time" data-times="3.79" data-time="161.45">[02:41.45]</span> And with less <span class="underline">pressure</span>, the oil and gas were able to <span class="underline">separate</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.42" data-time="165.24">[02:45.24]</span>The other way the <span class="underline">crude</span> oil was able to come up to the surface is by people pumping it up out of the ground.<span class="time" data-times="7.32" data-time="170.66">[02:50.66]</span> And, um, it's the same thing that happens at the surface, there is less <span class="underline">pressure</span>, and, so the oil and gas <span class="underline">separate</span>. <span class="time" data-times="12" data-time="177.98">[02:57.98]</span>But when we talked about how would actually exists inside earth's <span class="underline">crust</span>, most people think that there are huge, pools of oil sitting around in caverns somewhere under there. <span class="time" data-times="1.47" data-time="189.98">[03:09.98]</span>That's really <span class="underline">rare</span>.<span class="time" data-times="7.1" data-time="191.45">[03:11.45]</span> The <span class="underline">majority</span> of <span class="underline">petroleum</span> is just filling in the tiny pores and cracks in rocks.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.89" data-time="198.55">[03:18.55]</span>Now, um, a little more on the <span class="underline">petroleum</span> <span class="underline">industry</span>.<span class="time" data-times="13.8" data-time="202.44">[03:22.44]</span> As far as the extraction <span class="underline">process</span> the <span class="underline">petroleum</span> <span class="underline">industry</span> digs deep wells to <span class="underline">reach</span> <span class="underline">underground</span> oil fields where <span class="underline">crude</span> oil has accumulated over a large area and <span class="underline">extract</span> between layers of rocks.<span class="time" data-times="2.53" data-time="216.24">[03:36.24]</span> Then it pumps the <span class="underline">crude</span> oil out. <span class="time" data-times="11.23" data-time="218.77">[03:38.77]</span>Then its refineries have two main tasks, <span class="underline">convert</span> less <span class="underline">valuable</span> <span class="underline">crude</span> oil into a more <span class="underline">valuable</span> form and create usable products from <span class="underline">refined</span> oil.<span class="time" data-times="3.11" data-time="230">[03:50.00]</span> Basically, the refiner will do this by boiling the oil.<span class="time" data-times="15.11" data-time="233.11">[03:53.11]</span> When the oil cools off, the <span class="underline">stuff</span> that is left is turned into a <span class="underline">variety</span> of products, like <span class="underline">gasoline</span>, <span class="underline">diesel</span> <span class="underline">fuel</span> for cars and trucks, asphalt for roads, um, paints, plastics, <span class="underline">even</span> soaps.<span class="time" data-times="8.34" data-time="248.22">[04:08.22]</span> And <span class="underline">check</span> what you're wearing, if you are wearing something with <span class="underline">synthetic</span> fibers, what that really means is that it is made of the <span class="underline">petroleum</span>.<span class="time" data-times="5.71" data-time="256.56">[04:16.56]</span> So you can see <span class="underline">petroleum</span> is <span class="underline">essential</span> to today's <span class="underline">industrial</span> society.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="11.09" data-time="262.27">[04:22.27]</span>Now, next week we will be joined the graduate students from the <span class="underline">department</span> of <span class="underline">petroleum</span> <span class="underline">engineering</span> to examine the <span class="underline">comprehensive</span> <span class="underline">field</span> study they're working on in our <span class="underline">local</span> oil fields.<span class="time" data-times="5.52" data-time="273.36">[04:33.36]</span> And I'd like you to read over the <span class="underline">pack</span> of information I'm about to hand out to you before we go.<span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="278.88">[04:38.88]</span> It should <span class="underline">familiarize</span> you with the <span class="underline">history</span> of the oil <span class="underline">field</span> we will be touring as well as the details of their <span class="underline">project</span>.</p>
