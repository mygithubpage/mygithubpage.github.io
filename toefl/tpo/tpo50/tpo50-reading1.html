            <b>American Railroads</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>In the United States, railroads spearheaded the <span class="highlight">second</span> <span class="highlight">phase</span> of the <span class="highlight">transportation</span> <span class="highlight">revolution</span> by overtaking the <span class="highlight">previous</span> importance of canals. The mid-1800s saw a great <span class="highlight">expansion</span> of American railroads. The <span class="highlight">major</span> cities east of the Mississippi River were linked by a spiderweb of <span class="highlight">railroad</span> tracks. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> Chicago's growth illustrates the <span class="highlight">impact</span> of these rail links. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> In 1849 Chicago was a village of a few hundred people with <span class="highlight">virtually</span> no rail service. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span> By 1860 it had become a city of 100,000, served by eleven railroads. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span> Farmers to the north and west of Chicago no longer had to ship their <span class="highlight">grain</span>, <span class="highlight">livestock</span>, and <span class="highlight">dairy</span> products down the Mississippi River to New Orleans; they could now ship their products directly east. Chicago supplanted New Orleans as the <span class="highlight">interior</span> of America's main <span class="highlight">commercial</span> hub.</p>
          <p>The east-west rail lines <span class="highlight">stimulated</span> the <span class="highlight">settlement</span> and agricultural <span class="highlight">development</span> of the Midwest. By 1860 Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin had replaced Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York as the <span class="highlight">leading</span> wheat-growing states. Enabling farmers to speed their products to the East, railroads increased the value of farmland and <span class="question3">promoted <span class="highlight"></span>additional</span> <span class="highlight">settlement</span>. In turn, <span class="highlight">population</span> growth in agricultural areas triggered <span class="highlight">industrial</span> <span class="highlight">development</span> in cities such as Chicago, Davenport (Iowa), and Minneapolis, for the new settlers needed <span class="highlight">lumber</span> for fences and houses and mills to <span class="highlight">grind</span> wheat into <span class="highlight">flour</span>.</p>
          <p>Railroads also propelled the growth of small towns <span class="highlight">along</span> their routes. The Illinois Central <span class="highlight">Railroad</span>, which had more <span class="highlight">track</span> than any other <span class="highlight">railroad</span> in 1855, made money not only from its traffic but also from real <span class="highlight">estate</span> speculation. Purchasing land for stations <span class="highlight">along</span> its <span class="highlight">path</span>, the Illinois Central then laid out towns around the stations. The <span class="highlight">selection</span> of <span class="question5">Manteno, Illinois, </span>as a stop of the Illinois Central, for example, transformed the site from a crossroads without a single house in 1854 into a <span class="highlight"><span class="question6">bustling</span> </span>town of nearly a thousand in 1860, replete with hotels, lumberyards, <span class="highlight">grain</span> elevators, and gristmills. By the <span class="highlight">Civil</span> War (1861-1865), few thought of the railroad-linked Midwest as a <span class="highlight">frontier</span> <span class="highlight">region</span> or viewed its inhabitants as pioneers.</p>
          <p>As the nation's first big business, the railroads transformed the <span class="highlight">conduct</span> of business. During the early 1830s, railroads, like canals, depended on <span class="highlight">financial</span> aid from <span class="highlight">state</span> governments. With the <span class="question7">onset </span>of <span class="highlight">economic</span> <span class="highlight">depression</span> in the late 1830s, however, <span class="highlight">state</span> governments scrapped overly <span class="highlight">ambitious</span> <span class="highlight">railroad</span> projects. Convinced that railroads burdened them with high taxes and blasted hopes, voters turned against <span class="highlight">state</span> aid, and in the early 1840s, several states amended their constitutions to bar <span class="highlight">state</span> <span class="highlight">funding</span> for railroads and canals. The <span class="highlight">federal</span> <span class="highlight">government</span> took up some of the <span class="highlight">slack</span>, but <span class="highlight">federal</span> aid did not provide a <span class="highlight">major</span> <span class="highlight">stimulus</span> to railroads before 1860. Rather, part of the burden of <span class="highlight">finance</span> passed to city and <span class="highlight">county</span> governments in agricultural areas that <span class="highlight">wanted</span> to <span class="highlight">attract</span> railroads. Such <span class="highlight">municipal</span> governments, for example, often gave railroads rights-of-way, grants of land for stations, and public funds.</p>
          <p><span class="question9">The <span class="highlight">dramatic</span> <span class="highlight">expansion</span> of the <span class="highlight">railroad</span> network in the 1850s, however, strained the financing <span class="highlight">capacity</span> of <span class="highlight">local</span> governments and required a turn toward private investment, which had never been absent from the picture. </span>Well <span class="highlight">aware</span> of the <span class="highlight">economic</span> benefits of railroads, individuals living near them had long purchased <span class="highlight">railroad</span> <span class="highlight">stock</span> issued by governments and had directly bought <span class="highlight">stock</span> in railroads, often paying by contributing their labor to building the railroads. But the large railroads of the 1850s needed more capital than such small investors could <span class="highlight">generate</span>. <span class="highlight">Gradually</span>, the center of <span class="highlight">railroad</span> financing shifted to New York City, and in fact, it was the <span class="highlight">railroad</span> <span class="highlight">boom</span> of the 1850s that helped make Wall Street in New York City the nation's greatest capital <span class="highlight">market</span>. The stocks of all the <span class="highlight">leading</span> railroads were traded on the floor of the New York <span class="highlight">Stock</span> <span class="highlight">Exchange</span> during the 1850s. In <span class="highlight">addition</span>, the growth of railroads turned New York City into the center of modern investment firms. The investment firms evaluated the <span class="highlight">stock</span> of railroads in the smaller American cities and then found purchasers for these stocks in New York City, <span class="highlight">Philadelphia</span>, Paris, London, Amsterdam, and Hamburg. Controlling the <span class="question12">flow </span>of funds to railroads, the investment bankers began to <span class="highlight">exert</span> influence over the railroads' <span class="highlight">internal</span> affairs by supervising administrative reorganizations in times of trouble.</p>
