The mid-1800s saw a great <span class="highlight">expansion</span> of American railroads. The <span class="highlight">major</span> cities east of the Mississippi River were linked by a spiderweb of <span class="highlight">railroad</span> tracks. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> Chicago's growth illustrates the <span class="highlight">impact</span> of these rail links. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> In 1849 Chicago was a village of a few hundred people with <span class="highlight">virtually</span> no rail service. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span> By 1860 it had become a city of 100,000, served by eleven railroads. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span> Farmers to the north and west of Chicago no longer had to ship their <span class="highlight">grain</span>, <span class="highlight">livestock</span>, and <span class="highlight">dairy</span> products down the Mississippi River to New Orleans; they could now ship their products directly east. Chicago supplanted New Orleans as the <span class="highlight">interior</span> of America's main <span class="highlight">commercial</span> hub.</p><p>The east-west rail lines <span class="highlight">stimulated</span> the <span class="highlight">settlement</span> and agricultural <span class="highlight">development</span> of the Midwest. By 1860 Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin had replaced Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York as the <span class="highlight">leading</span> wheat-growing states. Enabling farmers to speed their products to the East, railroads increased the value of farmland and <span class="question3">promoted</span><span class="highlight">additional</span><span class="highlight">settlement</span>. In turn, <span class="highlight">population</span> growth in agricultural areas triggered <span class="highlight">industrial</span><span class="highlight">development</span> in cities such as Chicago, Davenport (Iowa), and Minneapolis, for the new settlers needed <span class="highlight">lumber</span> for fences and houses and mills to <span class="highlight">grind</span> wheat into <span class="highlight">flour</span>.</p><p>Railroads also propelled the growth of small towns <span class="highlight">along</span> their routes. The Illinois Central <span class="highlight">Railroad</span>, which had more <span class="highlight">track</span> than any other <span class="highlight">railroad</span> in 1855, made money not only from its traffic but also from real <span class="highlight">estate</span> speculation. Purchasing land for stations <span class="highlight">along</span> its <span class="highlight">path</span>, the Illinois Central then laid out towns around the stations. The <span class="highlight">selection</span> of <span class="question5">Manteno, Illinois</span>, as a stop of the Illinois Central, for example, transformed the site from a crossroads without a single house in 1854 into a <span class="highlight"><span class="question6">bustling</span></span> town of nearly a thousand in 1860, replete with hotels, lumberyards, <span class="highlight">grain</span> elevators, and gristmills. By the <span class="highlight">Civil</span> War (1861-1865), few thought of the railroad-linked Midwest as a <span class="highlight">frontier</span><span class="highlight">region</span> or viewed its inhabitants as pioneers.</p><p>As the nation's first big business, the railroads transformed the <span class="highlight">conduct</span> of business. During the early 1830s, railroads, like canals, depended on <span class="highlight">financial</span> aid from <span class="highlight">state</span> governments. With the <span class="question7">onset</span> of <span class="highlight">economic</span><span class="highlight">depression</span> in the late 1830s, however, <span class="highlight">state</span> governments scrapped overly <span class="highlight">ambitious</span><span class="highlight">railroad</span> projects. Convinced that railroads burdened them with high taxes and blasted hopes, voters turned against <span class="highlight">state</span> aid, and in the early 1840s, several states amended their constitutions to bar <span class="highlight">state</span><span class="highlight">funding</span> for railroads and canals. The <span class="highlight">federal</span><span class="highlight">government</span> took up some of the <span class="highlight">slack</span>, but <span class="highlight">federal</span> aid did not provide a <span class="highlight">major</span><span class="highlight">stimulus</span> to railroads before 1860. Rather, part of the burden of <span class="highlight">finance</span> passed to city and <span class="highlight">county</span> governments in agricultural areas that <span class="highlight">wanted</span> to <span class="highlight">attract</span> railroads. Such <span class="highlight">municipal</span> governments, for example, often gave railroads rights-of-way, grants of land for stations, and public funds.</p><p><span class="question9">The <span class="highlight">dramatic</span><span class="highlight">expansion</span> of the <span class="highlight">railroad</span> network in the 1850s, however, strained the financing <span class="highlight">capacity</span> of <span class="highlight">local</span> governments and required a turn toward private investment, which had never been absent from the picture.</span> Well <span class="highlight">aware</span> of the <span class="highlight">economic</span> benefits of railroads, individuals living near them had long purchased <span class="highlight">railroad</span><span class="highlight">stock</span> issued by governments and had directly bought <span class="highlight">stock</span> in railroads, often paying by contributing their labor to building the railroads. But the large railroads of the 1850s needed more capital than such small investors could <span class="highlight">generate</span>. <span class="highlight">Gradually</span>, the center of <span class="highlight">railroad</span> financing shifted to New York City, and in fact, it was the <span class="highlight">railroad</span><span class="highlight">boom</span> of the 1850s that helped make Wall Street in New York City the nation's greatest capital <span class="highlight">market</span>. The stocks of all the <span class="highlight">leading</span> railroads were traded on the floor of the New York <span class="highlight">Stock</span><span class="highlight">Exchange</span> during the 1850s. In <span class="highlight">addition</span>, the growth of railroads turned New York City into the center of modern investment firms. The investment firms evaluated the <span class="highlight">stock</span> of railroads in the smaller American cities and then found purchasers for these stocks in New York City, <span class="highlight">Philadelphia</span>, Paris, London, Amsterdam, and Hamburg. Controlling the <span class="question12">flow</span> of funds to railroads, the investment bankers began to <span class="highlight">exert</span> influence over the railroads' <span class="highlight">internal</span> affairs by supervising administrative reorganizations in times of trouble.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 1, what effect did the expansion of rail links have on Chicago?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Chicago became the headquarters for eleven new railroads</p><p>B. Chicago became the most important city east of the Mississippi River</p><p>C. Chicago was transformed from a village into a large city</p><p>D. Chicago replaced eastern cities as the main buyer of farm products from the region</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The title is a detailed question. According to the key word "Chicago" in the title, we locate the first paragraph of the fourth sentence "Chicago's growth illustrates the impact of these rail links." The content after this sentence is related to Chicago. Describe the impact of the railway on the development of Chicago, turning Chicago from a small village into a big city, allowing Chicago farmers to move agricultural products to the east more quickly. Then we look at the options:</p><p>Option A: Chicago has become the headquarters of 11 new railways. error. Because according to the keyword "eleven new railroads" in the option, we locate the first paragraph of the sixth sentence "By 1860 it had become a city of 100,000, served by eleven railroads." The article only mentioned that after Chicago developed into a big city, There are 11 railways running through it, but it does not say that Chicago is the headquarters of 11 railways, so the A option is wrong.</p><p>Option B: Chicago became the most important city in the east of the Mississippi. error. According to the keyword "east of the Mississippi River" in the option, the third sentence of the first paragraph is "The major cities east of the Mississippi River were linked by a spider web of railroad tracks." This is the main city east of the Mississippi River. Connected by a series of railroad tracks, but not mentioned in Chicago, so the B option is wrong.Option C: Chicago changed from a small village to a big city. It is exactly the same as the original text, so it is the correct answer.</p><p>Option D: Chicago replaced the eastern city as a major purchase of agricultural products. Wrong, because there is no mention of relevant information in the text. The article only mentions that the railway enables farmers in northern and western Chicago to deliver their products directly to the east. So the D option is wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Paragraph 2 supports the idea that Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin were able to become the leading wheat-growing states by 1860 in large part because</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. by 1860 there were more railroads in Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin than in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York</p><p>B. the expansion of east-west rail lines made transporting Midwestern products to East Coast markets relatively fast and easy</p><p>C. by 1860 states such as Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York had become more interested in industrial development than in agriculture</p><p>D. most of the farmers who had grown wheat in Ohio, Pennsylvania, or New York resettled in the Midwest after the expansion of east-west rail lines</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The title is a detailed question. According to the keyword "Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin" in the title, we locate the second sentence of the second sentence "By 1860 Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin had replaced Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York as "Leading wheat-growing states." Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin have become the main wheat producing areas. It is in the first sentence of the corresponding paragraph that East-West Railway has <span class="question3">promoted</span> agricultural development. We then look down at the third sentence "Enabling farmers to speed their products to the East, railroads increased the value of farmland and <span class="question3">promoted</span> additional settlement." The third sentence is a concrete explanation of the second sentence: because the railway can make Farmers can quickly transport crops to the east, so Illinois, Indiana and Wisconsin are known as the main wheat producing areas. Among the options, only the B option meets the original text, so it is the correct answer.</p><p>The A option states that Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin have more railroads than Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York City. However, this comparison was not mentioned in the original text and was ruled out.</p><p>Option C says that in 1860, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York City were more interested in developing industry than developing agriculture.Wrong, because there is no mention of this comparison in the original text, the article just says "In turn, population growth in agricultural areas triggered industrial development in cities such as Chicago, Davenport (Iowa), and Minneapolis" means the population in agricultural areas Growth has <span class="question3">promoted</span> industrial development in some areas. Therefore, the C option is wrong.</p><p>The D option states that wheat farmers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York City moved to the Midwest after the expansion of the East-West Railway. The information article was not mentioned at all, but it was excluded and was ruled out.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question3">promoted</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. encouraged</p><p>B. controlled</p><p>C. promised</p><p>D. predicted</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" A"><p>The title is the vocabulary title, "promote" means "promote, advance," and the phrase "Enabling farmers to speed their products to the East, railroads increased the value of farmland and <span class="question3">promoted</span> additional settlement." The speed of transporting agricultural products to the east has been accelerated, the value of cultivated land has increased, and many new settlements have been created."</p><p>The "encourage" option of A means "promote; support"; the meaning is correct, so it is the correct answer.</p><p>The B option "control" means "control" and does not match, so it is excluded.</p><p>The C option "promise" means "promise, promise," meaning inconsistent, so it is excluded.</p><p>The D option "predict" means "prediction, prediction".

The question asks what is the role of agricultural development in the central and western regions.

Therefore, it is clear that Option B is correct, because Option B says that one of the functions of agricultural development is to increase the demand for industrial products in cities in the Midwest.</p><p>The A option says that agricultural development has slowed the urban population growth rate in the central and western regions, but we can already know that the population of the agricultural region has increased through the above-mentioned fourth sentence. Therefore, the A option contradicts the original and is excluded.</p><p>The C option says that agricultural development can promote the expansion of the east-west railway to the central and western regions. However, the first sentence of the second paragraph says "The east-west rail lines stimulated the settlement and agricultural development of the Midwest." In fact, the expansion of the railway has <span class="question3">promoted</span> the development of agriculture, and the logic of the C option has been completely reversed, so it was ruled out.</p><p>The D option says that the pressure on farmers in the Midwest to transport their crops to the market faster can be reduced.

The following content was all about the impact of the Great Depression on railway construction. The beginning of the Great Depression caused the state government to cancel the railroad construction projects that were too large. In the following text, "Convinced that railroads...several states amended their constitutions to bar state funding for railroads and canals." Explain that voters opposed the government to provide financial assistance for the construction of railways, and some states amended their constitutions to prohibit railways and canals. Construction provides national funds. Here corresponds to the A option: The railway company has lost important financial funds provided by the state government. So the A option is correct.</p><p>Option B: The railway companies realized that their project was too ambitious and wrong, because the article only mentioned that the Great Depression caused the state government to cancel the railway construction project that was too large.</p><p>Option C: Railway companies must compete with the construction of the canal in order to obtain government funding.

Then we went back to the original text. The phrase before the box "The major cities east of the Mississippi River were linked by a spiderweb of railroad tracks." The main cities east of the Mississippi River are connected by railroad tracks that are numerous and numerous. The "a spiderweb of railroad tracks" corresponds exactly to the "dense" in the sentence to be inserted, so there must be a logical association between the two sentences. Looking at the sentence after the A box is all narrating the importance of the railway for the development of Chicago, the logic is very strict, and there is a contextual connection, so there is no need to insert any sentence at the B, C, and D boxes.

The first paragraph describes the railway's positive impact on the development of Chicago, making Chicago a large city with a population of 100,000. The third paragraph mainly describes the development of small towns along the railway line. So the A option is a summary of the probability of one or three segments, so it is correct.</p><p>Option B said that the railway company's investment in real estate increased the value of the farm and many farmers sold their land in order to start a new life in the city. However, the article did not mention that farmers sold their land and moved to urban life. Therefore, the B option was not mentioned in the text and was excluded.</p><p>The C option stated that in the 1940s both the canal construction and the railway construction lost their support, but in the mid-1950s, due to the economic benefits of the railway, the construction of the railway was again valued. According to the keyword "1850s", corresponding to the last paragraph in the article, the article emphasizes that the expansion of the railway in the 1950s put pressure on the local government financing, and can only seek private investment. It does not say that because of economic benefits, the railway has been re-emphasized by people. Therefore, the C option is excluded.</p><p>The D option says that because of the construction of the railway, Chicago has become a major commercial hinterland, and farmers in the Midwest are no longer restricted to selling crops locally. The D option corresponds to the first paragraph of the article, but the article does not mention farmers selling crops locally, but says "North and West Chicago farmers no longer need to ship their grain, livestock and dairy products along the Mississippi River. Down to New Orleans; they can now ship their products directly to the east." So the D option is ruled out.</p><p>The E option corresponds to the fourth and fifth paragraphs of the article. The fourth paragraph stated that because of the economic crisis, the state government no longer provided funds for the construction of the railway, and the financial burden was transferred to the local government and the federal government. The fifth paragraph emphasized the importance of private investment in railway construction. Therefore, the E option is a summary of the fourth and fifth paragraphs of the article, so the E option is correct.</p><p>The F option corresponds to the fifth paragraph of the article, saying that in the 1950s, the railway companies turned to New York's investment bank for funding, making New York a US economic center. The F option is fully in line with the contents of the fifth paragraph. It is a summary of the fifth paragraph. Therefore, the F option is correct.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
