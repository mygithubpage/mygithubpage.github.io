The university says it would make our historic campus more attractive by illuminating our buildings at night. However, the university would spend an extra $1,000 per month for electricity. Instead, I recommend the money be used to complete the library renovation project as quickly as possible.
That's not the only reason we shouldn't get the new system. These powerful lights would brighten the sky as well as the buildings and seriously interfere with the use of our astronomy equipment. Our academic mission must come first - and the practice of astronomy is done best when the sky is darkest.

Heinrich, Professor of Astronomy</p></article><div><audio src="tpo50-speaking3.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></div><article id="listening-passage" class="passage"><h3>Listening Text</h3><p>M: I totally agree with the letter.</p><p>W: How come? Don't you think the campus looked pretty at night?</p><p>M: Well...it might make the buildings look nice at night but why should we waste so much money on something we really don't need? Just for looks, there are more important things than that.</p><p>W: I can see your point.</p><p>M: I mean how long has that library project been going on?</p><p>W: Yeah, the whole third floor has been closed for the last few months.</p><p>M: Exactly. And just last night, I had my astronomy class with professor Henrik. He told us something that was totally disappointing. We've been tracking a comet all semester long and he says if the university's plan goes through, we won't be able to see the comet through telescopes anymore.</p><p>W: That's so sad. You chose the school just because of the astronomy program, didn't you?</p><p>M: Yeah, it's such a good program. But if it's too bright around here at night, we'll have to go back to looking at the pictures of comets in the textbook. You could tell Professor Henrik is disappointed too. It's the hands-on experience that gets everyone all excited.</p></article><section id="question"><h4>Question</h4><p>Explain why the man agrees with the professor's opinion. </p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>In the reading, one professor proposes that the school shouldn't spend money purchasing a new lighting system because of two reasons. The first reason is that this new lighting system is too costly and this amount of money could be used to do other meaningful things. The second is that this new system is too bright and it may interfere with school's academic project. In the listening, the man approves of the professor's proposal. The first reason is that it is better for the school to spend the money finishing the library renovation, which is more urgent. And secondly, the students and their astronomy professor are recording a comet through a telescope. If this system is installed, it will make the sky at night too bright and the whole recording would be impossible to finish. Therefore, because of these two reasons the man agrees with the professor's proposal letter.</p></article></div></main></body></html>
