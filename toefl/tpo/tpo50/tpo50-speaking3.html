          <h4 class="w3-center">Response to the Plan for an Additional Lighting System</h4>
          <p>I oppose the university's plan to purchase an additional outdoor lighting system. The university says it would make our historic campus more attractive by illuminating our buildings at night. However, the university would spend an extra $1,000 per month for electricity. Instead, I recommend the money be used to complete the library renovation project as quickly as possible.</p>
          <p>That's not the only reason we shouldn't get the new system. These powerful lights would brighten the sky as well as the buildings and seriously interfere with the use of our astronomy equipment. Our academic mission must come first - and the practice of astronomy is done best when the sky is darkest.</p>
          <p>-R. N. Heinrich, Professor of Astronomy</p>

        <h3>Listening Text</h3>
        <article>
          <p>Now listen to two students discussing the opinion expressed in the letter.</p>
          <p>Man: I totally agree with the latter.</p>
          <p>Woman: How come don't you think the campus a look prettier at night.</p>
          <p>Man: Well what it might make the buildings look nice at night but why should we waste so much money on something we really don't need.</p>
          <p>Woman: Just for looks.</p>
          <p>Man: There are more important things than that.</p>
          <p>Woman: I can see your point.</p>
          <p>Man: I mean how long is that library project thing going on.</p>
          <p>Woman: Yeah the whole third floor has been closed for the last few months.</p>
          <p>Man: Exactly and just last night I had my astronomy class with professor Heinrich he told us something that was totally disappointing. We've been tracking a comment all semester long and he says that if the university's plan goes through we won't be able to see the comet through the telescopes anymore.</p>
          <p>Woman: So sad you chose the school just because the astronomy program didn't you.</p>
          <p>Man: Yeah it's such a good program but if it's too bright around here at night will have to go back to looking at pictures of comets in the text book. You can tell professor Heinrich is disappointed too it's the hands on experience that gets everyone all excited.</p>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>In the reading, one professor proposes that the school shouldn't spend money purchasing a new lighting system because of two reasons. The first reason is that this new lighting system is too costly and this amount of money could be used to do other meaningful things. The second is that this new system is too bright and it may interfere with school's academic project. In the listening, the man approves of the professor's proposal. The first reason is that it is better for the school to spend the money finishing the library renovation, which is more urgent. And secondly, the students and their astronomy professor are recording a comet through a telescope. If this system is installed, it will make the sky at night too bright and the whole recording would be impossible to finish. Therefore, because of these two reasons the man agrees with the professor's proposal letter.</p>
