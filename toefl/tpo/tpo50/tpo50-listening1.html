              <span class="time" data-times="3.76" data-time="6.22">[00:06.22]</span>Student:I'm not sure if you know but I would like to go to the student <span class="highlight">government</span> this year.</p>

            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="0.89" data-time="24.24">[00:24.24]</span>Student: Cool! <span class="time" data-times="8.67" data-time="25.13">[00:25.13]</span>Anyway, the <span class="highlight">reason</span> I came by is we are getting ready to <span class="highlight">conduct</span> a straw <span class="highlight">poll</span> on <span class="highlight">campus</span>, you know, hold an informal ballot since the general election is just a <span class="highlight">couple</span> of months away.<span class="time" data-times="8.41" data-time="33.8">[00:33.80]</span> We want to get a <span class="highlight">field</span> from the students' bodies <span class="highlight">political</span> leanings, like who students are planning to vote for, which <span class="highlight">political</span> party people <span class="highlight">identify</span> with, that <span class="highlight">sort</span> of thing.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="0.89" data-time="42.21">[00:42.21]</span>Teacher: I'm sure.<span class="time" data-times="5.25" data-time="43.1">[00:43.10]</span> I help students run the straw <span class="highlight">poll</span> once years ago, uh, it was a lot of work.<span class="time" data-times="3.5" data-time="48.35">[00:48.35]</span> Mostly because we use paper ballots, and stayed up all night counting them.<span class="time" data-times="2.28" data-time="51.85">[00:51.85]</span> But if you use computers......</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.86" data-time="54.13">[00:54.13]</span>Student: Yeah, we are creating a website for our students to be able to vote online.<span class="time" data-times="3.81" data-time="57.99">[00:57.99]</span> Em, we are looking for a <span class="highlight">faculty</span> advisor to help, actually.<span class="time" data-times="2.51" data-time="61.8">[01:01.80]</span> I was hoping you might be interested.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.65" data-time="64.31">[01:04.31]</span>Teacher: Oh, I'm flattered, John.<span class="time" data-times="1.96" data-time="65.96">[01:05.96]</span> But my <span class="highlight">schedule</span> is so jammed.<span class="time" data-times="4.54" data-time="67.92">[01:07.92]</span> I'm teaching two seminars, your intro-course, finishing up my research.<span class="time" data-times="3.24" data-time="72.46">[01:12.46]</span> But, what about Professor Clan?<span class="time" data-times="1.53" data-time="75.7">[01:15.70]</span> She is new in our <span class="highlight">department</span>.<span class="time" data-times="1.82" data-time="77.23">[01:17.23]</span> Plus, she is a wiz with computers.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.3" data-time="79.05">[01:19.05]</span>Student: Ok, I will ask her.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.56" data-time="80.35">[01:20.35]</span>Teacher: So, have you decided on the topic for your <span class="highlight">term</span> paper yet?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.04" data-time="83.91">[01:23.91]</span>Student: Not really.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.14" data-time="84.95">[01:24.95]</span>Teacher: Why not write about your straw <span class="highlight">poll</span>? <span class="time" data-times="4.23" data-time="87.09">[01:27.09]</span>Since the paper is not <span class="highlight">due</span> till after the election, you could include your results.<span class="time" data-times="2.56" data-time="91.32">[01:31.32]</span> Maybe <span class="highlight">compare</span> them with the real election results.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.23" data-time="93.88">[01:33.88]</span>Student: But would that be enough?<span class="time" data-times="2.01" data-time="95.11">[01:35.11]</span> I mean, just comparing numbers?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.61" data-time="97.12">[01:37.12]</span>Teacher: Well, no, you need to provide some <span class="highlight">analysis</span>, too.<span class="time" data-times="4" data-time="100.73">[01:40.73]</span> But I was thinking, there is a <span class="highlight">couple</span> of <span class="highlight">local</span> ballot questions this year.<span class="time" data-times="3.73" data-time="104.73">[01:44.73]</span> You know, referenda, the voters can either support or not support?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.79" data-time="108.46">[01:48.46]</span>Student: Right. There is one on whether to <span class="highlight">ban</span> smoking in restaurants, and another one......<span class="time" data-times="4.39" data-time="112.25">[01:52.25]</span>I think is whether to spend tax dollars for a new sports <span class="highlight">arena</span> in the city.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.85" data-time="116.64">[01:56.64]</span>Teacher: Ah, Ok. Here is an idea. <span class="time" data-times="4.66" data-time="118.49">[01:58.49]</span>In <span class="highlight">regular</span> elections, the <span class="highlight">vast</span> <span class="highlight">majority</span> of voters <span class="highlight">ignore</span> referenda. <span class="time" data-times="4.5" data-time="123.15">[02:03.15]</span>They vote for their favorite candidates but <span class="highlight">avoid</span> ballot questions.<span class="time" data-times="5.34" data-time="127.65">[02:07.65]</span> We believe it's because voters aren't <span class="highlight">familiar</span> with the questions or don't understand them. <span class="time" data-times="6.95" data-time="132.99">[02:12.99]</span>But actively educating people on ballot questions right before they vote can <span class="highlight">improve</span> referendum participation rates.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.13" data-time="139.94">[02:19.94]</span>Student: In that case, maybe we could have our straw <span class="highlight">poll</span> website providing information on the ballot questions, like how each <span class="highlight">proposal</span> would <span class="highlight">affect</span> students.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.02" data-time="147.07">[02:27.07]</span>Teacher: Exactly.<span class="time" data-times="5.85" data-time="148.09">[02:28.09]</span> And when you write your paper, you could <span class="highlight">compare</span> the students' referendum voting <span class="highlight">rate</span> to the general publics.<span class="time" data-times="2.46" data-time="153.94">[02:33.94]</span> And include you own <span class="highlight">analysis</span> of the results. <span class="time" data-times="3.86" data-time="156.4">[02:36.40]</span>Plus, there is plenty of <span class="highlight">publish</span> research on referendum voting <span class="highlight">behavior</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.46" data-time="160.26">[02:40.26]</span>Student: Thanks, Professor Miller.<span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="161.72">[02:41.72]</span> I have no idea the straw <span class="highlight">poll</span> can actually help me in my <span class="highlight">course</span> work.</p>
