            <span class="time" data-times="1.85" data-time="116.64">[01:56.64]</span>Teacher: Ah, Ok.

          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="7.13" data-time="139.94">[02:19.94]</span>Student: In that case, maybe we could have our straw <span class="highlight">poll</span> website providing information on the ballot questions, like how each <span class="highlight">proposal</span> would <span class="highlight">affect</span> students.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.02" data-time="147.07">[02:27.07]</span>Teacher: Exactly.<span class="time" data-times="5.85" data-time="148.09">[02:28.09]</span> And when you write your paper, you could <span class="highlight">compare</span> the students' referendum voting <span class="highlight">rate</span> to the general publics.<span class="time" data-times="2.46" data-time="153.94">[02:33.94]</span> And include you own <span class="highlight">analysis</span> of the results. <span class="time" data-times="3.86" data-time="156.4">[02:36.40]</span>Plus, there is plenty of <span class="highlight">publish</span> research on referendum voting <span class="highlight">behavior</span>.</p>
          <p>

              <p>Option A means that students are looking for a professor to talk about a topic about their paper. But in fact, the purpose of the student's beginning is not this, but the latter professor reminds the student to write this poll into the paper and the student knows the original test. For his own dissertation, there is help. Option A is wrong. Option B is to tell the teacher that he was elected to the student council. He said that he was only planning to go to the student council this year and did not really go in. Option B is wrong; Option C is consistent with the source of the problem. The original meaning of the text is that students come to invite teachers to be the instructors of their project, right; Option D says that students are coming to discuss ways to collect public opinions. This is not the point in the dialogue. Option D is wrong. Select C.</p>

              <p>Here, the teacher mentioned paper ballots. He said that using paper ballots requires people to stay up late to count the votes, which corresponds to the heavy lifting of the work in the previous sentence.

              <p>Ah, Ok.</p>
              <p>Here is my idea.</p>
              <p>In regular elections, the vast majority of mere ignore ignore referendum.</p>
              <p>They vote for their favorite candidates but avoid ballot questions.</p>
              <p>We believe it was because voters aren't familiar with the questions or don't understand them.</p>
              <p>But ascending educating people on ballot questions right before they vote can improve referendum participation rates.</p>
              <p>The</p>
              <p>Student:</p>
              <p>In that case, maybe we could have our straw poll website providing information on ballot questions, like how each proposal would affect students.</p>
              <p>The</p>
              <p>Teacher:</p>
              <p>Exactly.</p>
              <p>And when writing your paper, you could compare the students' referendum voting rate to the general publics.</p>
              <p>And include you own analysis of the results.</p>
              <p>Professors and students discussed the behavior of voters in the voting process. It can be seen that when professors finish their vote, they can increase the voting rate of their referendum. After introducing the topic to the student's thesis, the professor can include the poll. on. Therefore, the professor is providing ideas and themes for the student's dissertation. Option B is consistent with the meaning of the questions.</p>
              <p>Option A is meant to encourage students to vote in local elections, Option C is meant to express the suspicion that professors can change their voting behavior, and Option D means to let students know what the professor is currently studying. Do not meet the original text. Select B.</p>
