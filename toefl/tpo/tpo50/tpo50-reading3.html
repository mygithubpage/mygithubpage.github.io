          <h4 class="w3-center">Star Death</h4>
          <p>Until the early- to mid-twentieth <span class="highlight">century</span>, scientists believed that stars <span class="highlight">generate</span> energy by shrinking. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> As stars contracted, it was thought, they would get hotter and hotter, giving off light in the <span class="highlight">process</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> This could not be the <span class="highlight">primary</span> way that stars shine, however. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span> If it were, they would <span class="highlight">scarcely</span> last a million years, rather than the billions of years in age that we know they are. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span> We now know that stars are fueled by nuclear <span class="highlight">fusion</span>. Each time <span class="highlight">fusion</span> takes place, energy is released as a <span class="highlight">by-product</span>. This energy, expelled into <span class="highlight">space</span>, is what we see as starlight. The <span class="highlight">fusion</span> <span class="highlight">process</span> begins when two <span class="highlight">hydrogen</span> <span class="highlight">nuclei</span> smash together to form a <span class="highlight">particle</span> called the deuteron (a <span class="highlight">combination</span> of a <span class="highlight">positive</span> proton and a <span class="highlight">neutral</span> <span class="highlight">neutron</span>). Deuterons <span class="highlight question1">readily</span> <span class="highlight">combine</span> with <span class="highlight">additional</span> protons to form <span class="highlight">helium</span>. <span class="highlight">Helium</span>, in turn, can <span class="highlight">fuse</span> together to form heavier elements, such as <span class="highlight">carbon</span>. In a <span class="highlight">typical</span> star, merger after merger takes place until <span class="highlight">significant</span> quantities of heavy elements are built up.</p>
          <p>We must <span class="highlight">distinguish</span>, at this point, between two different <span class="highlight">stellar</span> types: <span class="highlight">Population</span> I and <span class="highlight">Population</span> ll, the <span class="highlight">latter</span> being much older than the <span class="highlight">former</span>. These groups can also be <span class="highlight">distinguished</span> by their locations. Our <span class="highlight">galaxy</span>, the Milky Way, is shaped like a <span class="highlight">flat</span> disk surrounding a central <span class="highlight">bulge</span>. Whereas <span class="highlight">Population</span> I stars are found mainly in the galactic disk, <span class="highlight">Population</span> II stars mostly <span class="highlight">reside</span> in the central <span class="highlight">bulge</span> of the <span class="highlight">galaxy</span> and in the halo surrounding this <span class="highlight">bulge</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="highlight">Population</span> II stars <span class="highlight">date</span> to the early stages of the <span class="highlight">universe</span>. Formed when the <span class="highlight">cosmos</span> was filled with <span class="highlight">hydrogen</span> and <span class="highlight">helium</span> gases, they <span class="highlight">initially</span> contained <span class="highlight"><span class="question6">virtually</span></span> no heavy elements. They shine until their fusible <span class="highlight">material</span> is <span class="question7">exhausted</span>. When <span class="highlight">Population</span> II stars die, their <span class="highlight">material</span> is <span class="highlight">spread</span> out into <span class="highlight">space</span>. Some of this dust is <span class="highlight">eventually</span> incorporated into newly formed <span class="highlight">Population</span> I stars. Though <span class="highlight">Population</span> I stars <span class="highlight">consist</span> mostly of <span class="highlight">hydrogen</span> and <span class="highlight">helium</span> gas, they also <span class="highlight">contain</span> heavy elements (heavier than <span class="highlight">helium</span>), which <span class="highlight"><span class="question8">comprise</span></span> about 1 or 2 percent of their <span class="highlight">mass</span>. These heavier materials are fused from the lighter elements that the stars have collected. Thus, <span class="highlight">Population</span> I stars <span class="highlight">contain</span> <span class="highlight">material</span> that once belonged to stars from <span class="highlight">previous</span> generations. The Sun is a good example of a <span class="highlight">Population</span> I star.</p>
          <p><span class="question9">What will happen when the Sun dies</span>? In several billion years, our mother star will burn much brighter. It will expend more and more of its nuclear <span class="highlight">fuel</span>, until little is left of its <span class="highlight">original</span> <span class="highlight">hydrogen</span>. Then, at some point in the far future, all nuclear reactions in the Sun's center will <span class="highlight">cease</span>.</p>
          <p>Once the Sun passes into its "<span class="question10">postnuclear</span>" <span class="highlight">phase</span>, it will <span class="highlight">separate</span> effectively into two different regions: an <span class="highlight">inner</span> <span class="highlight">zone</span> and an outer <span class="highlight">zone</span>. While no more <span class="highlight">hydrogen</span> <span class="highlight">fuel</span> will <span class="highlight">remain</span> in the <span class="highlight">inner</span> <span class="highlight">zone</span>, there will be a small <span class="highlight">amount</span> left in the outer <span class="highlight">zone</span>. Rapidly, changes will begin to take place that will serve to tear the Sun apart. The <span class="highlight">inner</span> <span class="highlight">zone</span>, its nuclear fires no longer burning, will begin to <span class="highlight">collapse</span> under the influence of its own weight and will <span class="highlight">contract</span> into a tiny hot <span class="highlight">core</span>, <span class="highlight question1">dense</span> and <span class="highlight">dim</span>. An <span class="highlight">opposite</span> fate will await the outer <span class="highlight">region</span>, a loosely held-together ball of gas. A shock wave caused by the <span class="highlight">inner</span> <span class="highlight">zone</span>'s contraction will send ripples <span class="highlight">through</span> the dying star, pushing the <span class="highlight">stellar</span> <span class="highlight">exterior</span>'s <span class="highlight">material</span> farther and farther outward. The outer <span class="highlight">envelope</span> will then grow rapidly, increasing, in a short <span class="highlight">interval</span>, hundreds of times in size. As it expands, it will cool down by thousands of degrees. <span class="highlight">Eventually</span>, the Sun will become a red <span class="highlight">giant</span> star, cool and bright. It will be so large that it will <span class="highlight">occupy</span> the whole <span class="highlight">space</span> that used to be the Earth's <span class="highlight">orbit</span> and so <span class="highlight">brilliant</span> that it would be able to be seen with the <span class="highlight">naked</span> eye thousands of light-years away. It will exist that way for millions of years, <span class="highlight">gradually</span> releasing the <span class="highlight">material</span> of its outer <span class="highlight">envelope</span> into <span class="highlight">space</span>. Finally, nothing will be left of the <span class="highlight">gaseous</span> <span class="highlight">exterior</span> of the Sun; all that will <span class="highlight">remain</span> will be the hot, white <span class="highlight">core</span>. The Sun will have become a white <span class="highlight question1">dwarf</span> star. The <span class="highlight">core</span> will <span class="highlight">shrink</span>, giving off the last of its energy, and the Sun will finally die.</p>

            <div class="explanation">
              <p>The title is a detailed question. The title asks the energy released by the stars. What is the starlight we see? According to the key words "energy" and "light" in the sentence, we can locate the first paragraph of the seventh sentence "This energy, expelled into space, is what we see as starlight." Then in this sentence "this energy What exactly is meant? Let's look back at the sixth sentence "Each time fusion takes place, energy is released as a by-product." From this sentence we know that this energy is a by-product of nuclear fusion. Therefore, the answer to this question should be nuclear fusion. Although there is no "nuclear fusion" fusion directly in the answer, the C option "fusion of various particles" is actually an explanation for nuclear fusion. In the text "The fusion process begins when two hydrogen nuclei smash together ...can fuse together to form heavier elements, such as carbon." This is a description of the process of nuclear fusion, that is, two hydrogen atoms collide. Nuclear + other protons ? helium, helium fusion ? heavy elements, eg carbon. In short, the process of nuclear fusion is the process of collision and fusion of particles. Therefore, the C option is correct.</p>
              <p>A option: protons combine with deuterium atoms.Wrong, because the text only says that protons and neutrons combine to form a helium nucleus, and helium nucleus combines with other protons to form helium. It does not say that protons combine with helium atoms, so it is excluded.</p>
              <p>Option B: atoms of heavy elements collide with each other. Wrong, because the text only said that two hydrogen atoms collided to form a helium nucleus, and did not mention the collision of heavy element atoms, so it was excluded.</p>
              <p>D option: hydrogen atom splitting. Wrong, because the whole paragraph did not mention hydrogen atom splitting, so it was ruled out.</p>

            <div class="explanation">
              <p>The title of the title of the function, the title asked why the author mentioned that the stars existed for several billion years? First, we find this sentence in the original text. The first sentence of the fourth sentence, "If it was, they would scarcely last a million years, rather than the billions of years in age that we know they are." "If so, they are almost impossible to exist for a million years, and as far as we know, they have been there for billions of years." "If it was" is a subjunctive tone - "if that is the case." What if? We need to look ahead. The first and second sentences say that scientists have always believed that stars generate energy through contraction. In the process, they emit light. But in the third sentence, this may not be the main way of stellar light. So the hypothesis of the hypothetic tone is that assuming that the stars emit light by contracting their energy, they cannot exist for a million years. In fact, they have existed for several billion years, so we can conclude that the contraction is even less likely to be the way stars shine. Thus, Corresponding to the C option: mentioning the existence of stars for several billion years is intended to illustrate that contraction cannot be the main mode of stellar light, right.</p>
              <p>A option: Explain that stellar light is produced by a continuous process, not a one-time event.Wrong, because there is no mention of this information in the text.</p>
              <p>Option B: Explain that the star's contraction is slower than previously thought. However, the information on the speed of star contraction is not mentioned in the text and is excluded.</p>
              <p>Option D: As a large number of heavy materials are produced, the stellar internal nuclear fusion slows down. The theory of nuclear fusion was mentioned in the second half of the first paragraph, and the first half was devoted to the theory of star luminescence. Therefore, the D option has nothing to do with the task, so it is excluded.</p>

            </p>
            <div class="explanation">
              <p>The title is a detailed question, and the question asks what are the two differences between the I and II. The answer to this question is very clear. The first and second sentence of the second paragraph is to say that their difference is "We must distinguish, at this point, between two different stellar types: Population I and Population II, the latter being much older than the These groups can also be distinguished by their locations." So these two differences are: (1) The age of the star group II is greater than that of the star family I; (2) they are in different locations. So the A option corresponds exactly to these two differences and is exactly correct.</p>
              <p>Option B: How old they are and whether they have halos around them. Age difference is indeed a difference, but the word "halo" halo only refers to "Population II stars mostly reside in the central bulge of the galaxy and in the halo surrounding this bulge." Most of the family II stars are located in the central part of the galactic bulge and in the halo around the raised part. Therefore, whether or not there is a halo is not the difference between the Star Group I and the Star Group II.</p>
              <p>C options: their position in the galaxy and whether their center is raised.The former is correct, but "whether or not the center is convex" is not their difference because the text says "Our galaxy, the Milky Way, is shaped like a flat disk surrounding a central bulge." Therefore, the central bulge is a feature of the galaxy. , not the characteristics of stars. Therefore, C is wrong.</p>
              <p>D option: whether they are in the center of the flat disc and if they have a glow. By the last sentence of the second paragraph, it can be known that the stars of the I-family I are mainly located above the silver plate, while the stars of the II-II are mostly located in the central convex part of the galaxy and in the halo around the raised part. Therefore, the previous difference of the D option can be barely calculated, but the latter difference "has no halo" is the same as the B option. Therefore, the D option is excluded.</p>

              <p>This question is a negative factual information question. The title asks which of the following descriptions of stellar I stars is wrong. After reading through the second and third paragraphs, we use the keywords in the options to locate and use the exclusion method to solve the problem.</p>
              <p>A option: Star I stars contain substances that were originally Star II stars. By the keyword "material", the fourth and fifth sentence of the third paragraph is positioned "When Population II stars die, their material is spread out into space. Some of this dust is called into newly integrated into population I stars." When the stars of II died, the substances they contained would be dispersed into the universe. Some of these dusts eventually merged into the newly formed Star I stars. Therefore, the A option is in accordance with the original text, so it is excluded.</p>
              <p>Option B: They are mainly composed of hydrogen and helium. According to the keyword "hydrogen and helium", it is positioned to the third paragraph of the sixth sentence "Though Population I stars consist mostly of hydrogen and helium gas, they also contain heavy elements" so they are really composed mainly of hydrogen and helium, but also contain A small amount of heavy elements, so B options meet the original, exclude.</p>
              <p>C options: They contain elements formed by nuclear fusion of lighter elements. Corresponding to the third sentence of the third paragraph, "These heavier materials are fused from the lighter elements that the stars have collected."</p>
              <p>Option D: The lifespan of stellar I stars does not have the longevity of stellar II stars. This information is not mentioned in the text. Only the second paragraph of the first sentence mentions that the Age of Star II is higher than that of Star I, but this does not mean that life is longer. Therefore, the D option is not mentioned in the article, so it is the correct answer.</p>

              <p>This question is titled Functional. Question: Why does the author ask, "What happens when the sun goes down?" First we find the position of this sentence in the article, which is the first sentence of the fourth paragraph. Looking further back, all the contents of the fourth and fifth paragraphs are to describe the decline of the sun. The first, second, and third paragraphs describe the process and classification of stars. Therefore, this question is very obvious. What we have played is a role that serves as a link between the two. It is a typical questioning sentence. Of the four options, only the B option says: This question is intended to start citing topics to be discussed later. So the B option is correct.</p>
              <p>A option: This question is to illustrate the most serious problems scientists face with regard to the death of a star. Later in the article did not mention scientists, so the A option is out of nothing, so ruled out.</p>
              <p>Option C: Scientists are still not sure about some aspects of star death. Similarly, there is no mention of scientists in the post, not to mention the attitude of scientists, so C excluded.</p>
              <p>Option D: Explain that the sun is not a good example of a Star I star. Corresponding to the last sentence of the third paragraph, "The Sun is a good example of a population I star.", but the third paragraph is about the characteristics of each of the star I and star II stars, and the sun is the star I An example of this is not linked to the "star death process" described in the fourth and fifth paragraphs. So the questions are to open new topics, not to refute the content above. Therefore, the D option is excluded.</p>

            <div class="explanation">
              <p>The title is a detailed question. According to the keyword "<span class="question10">postnuclear</span>" in the title, the first paragraph of the fifth paragraph is located, saying that once the sun enters the "post" stage, it will actually be divided into two parts: internal and external. The following sections are all about changes in the inner and outer areas. The second sentence goes on to say "While no more hydrogen fuel will remain in the inner zone, there will be a small amount left in the outer zone." This sentence actually contains a difference between the inner zone and the outer zone. It contains hydrogen, leaving a small amount of hydrogen outside. So, the D option: The outer zone still contains some hydrogen. correct. Let's see why other options are wrong:</p>
              <p>A option: External volume change is smaller. The fifth paragraph says "The outer envelope will then grow rapidly rapidly, increasing, in a short interval, hundreds of times in size." The outer layer of the star will grow rapidly, and in a short time, the volume will increase hundreds of times. It can be seen that the external volume change is actually very large, but the text does not make a specific comparison of the internal and external volume changes, so anyway the A option is wrong.Option B: The external temperature will be more stable. Wrong, because we found the phrase "As it expands, it will cool down by thousands of degrees." When it expands, its temperature will drop by a few thousand degrees. It can be seen that the temperature changes violently, so the B option contradicts the original text and is therefore excluded.</p>
              <p>C option: Stop generating heat. False, because the article mentions "The inner zone, its nuclear fires will not cause burning to its influence of its own weight." This visible energy is generated inside the star. In the "post" stage, the core of the star Will no longer burn, not outside. So the C option is wrong.</p>

            <div class="explanation">
              <p>The title is a detailed question. The question asks which of the following statements about the dying sun's kernel is correct. According to the keyword "inner", we focus on the description of the internal changes in the sun in the fifth paragraph. First of all, the fourth sentence says "The inner zone, its nuclear fires, no burning burning, will begin to collapse under the influence of its own weight and will contract into a tiny hot core, dense and dim." Under the influence of its own gravity, it will begin to collapse and shrink into a tiny, hot core with high density and dim colors. This is the first change. Then, the phrase "A shock wave caused by the inner zone's contraction will send ripples through the dying star, pushing the stellar exterior's material farther and farther outward." This sentence says that the shock wave caused by the inner zone contraction will make the dying star Issue a ripple that pushes the surface of the star farther outward. This is the second change inside the sun. This sentence exactly corresponds to the A option, the kernel will shrink, emit energy waves. So the A option is correct.</p>
              <p>Option B: The kernel emits a dazzling red light, then shrinks and dies.But we find the words "Eventually, the Sun will become a red giant star, cool and bright." According to the foregoing, we can see that it is the common change of the inside and the outside of the sun that makes the sun finally become a red and bright. The red giant star, but not the core, emits a dazzling red light because the kernel mentioned earlier has become "dense and dim", with high density and dim colors, so the B option is ruled out.</p>
              <p>C option: It will expand hundreds of times. Wrong, because the text says "The outer envelope will then grow rapidly rapidly, increasing, in a short interval, hundreds of times in size." It is clear that the expansion is the outer layer, and the kernel is shrinking. Therefore, the C option contradicts the original and is therefore excluded.</p>
              <p>D option: The kernel shrinks due to the gravity of the outer layer. Error, the text in the original sentence says "begin to collapse under the influence of its own weight" so the kernel collapses because of its own gravity. Therefore, the D option does not meet the original description and is excluded.</p>

              <p>The title is a detailed question, and the title asks: In the fifth paragraph about the description of the death of the sun, which of the following is correct? We will eliminate the wrong option one by one.</p>
              <p>The A option says that the outer layer of the sun will expand dramatically, which is caused by a drop in the temperature of the outer layer. But the original sentence says "The outer envelope will then grow rapidly rapidly, increasing, in a short interval, hundreds of times in size. As it expands, it will cool down by thousands of degrees." It is a phenomenon that accompanies "swelling", not the expansion caused by a drop in temperature. There is no such causal relationship, so A is excluded.</p>
              <p>The B option says that the sun will become a red giant before it will turn into a white dwarf after a few million years. The article said that the red giant would "it will exist that way for millions of years" in this way for millions of years, then turn into a white dwarf and die gradually. So the B option complies with the original text, correct.</p>
              <p>Option C says that when the sun releases external matter into the universe, its core will continue to undergo nuclear fusion for some time. But the original text says "The core will shrink, giving off the last of its energy, and the Sun will finally die." The kernel will shrink, not nuclear fusion. Therefore, the C option is not in compliance with the original text.</p>
              <p>The D option says that when the outer layer of the sun expands, it releases all matter into the universe. But the article says "It will exist that way for millions of years, gradually releasing the material of its outer envelope into space." So gradually releasing the outer layer of material is a matter of millions of years after the formation of the red giant star. Instead of swelling in the outer layer of the sun and not finally forming a red giant star. Moreover, the sun released the outer material but also retained the inner part. So the D option does not meet the original text and is excluded.</p>

              <p>This question is a sentence insertion question. First of all, let's see, the meaning of the sentence to be inserted is "it is clear that we need a more rational mechanism to explain how the sun produces energy". Then we go back to the original text. Before the D-box, we described the "shrinkage theory" that scientists originally believed, but the two sentences in front of the C box and in front of the D box have overturned the "shrinkage theory". "I think this theory is impossible. The content after the D box begins to describe the second theory - "nuclear fusion." Therefore, the sentence should be inserted at D, which serves as a link between the two: Because the contraction theory is unreasonable ? So we need a more rational mechanism to explain how the sun generates energy ? This theory is nuclear fusion. Therefore, the D option is correct.</p>

              <p>This question is a summary of the problem, we look at the options one by one to find out the correct answer.</p>
              <p>The A option says the sun is an example of a star I family because it generates energy through nuclear fusion rather than producing energy through contraction. First, the latter half of the sentence is erroneous. Corresponding to the third paragraph of the article, the key to distinguish between the star family I and the star group II is the star age, but the star position, which has nothing to do with nuclear fusion. Second, this sentence is just an example. It belongs to the minutiae. It is not an article summary, so it is excluded.</p>
              <p>The B option says that in the Milky Way, the star of the I family is at or around the center of the bulge, while the star of the II family is on the flat disk. This sentence is in direct contradiction with the last sentence of the second paragraph, so B is excluded.</p>
              <p>The C option says that the sun and its similar stars will first split into the inside and the outside, and then the nuclear fusion of the core will stop, and eventually the star will die. Corresponds to the fourth and fifth paragraphs of the article.But at the end of the fourth paragraph, mentioning "Then, at some point in the far future, all the reaction in the Sun's center will cease." Then the fifth paragraph began to describe the situation in which the sun was divided into the interior and exterior, so it was nuclear Fusion stopped earlier and then the sun began to divide into two parts. The C option is reversed in time, so it is excluded.</p>
              <p>The D option describes the stellar stars of the II family, corresponding to the third paragraph of the article 1~3 sentences, which is in accordance with the original text, and therefore is the correct answer.</p>
              <p>The E option describes the stars of the star family I, which correspond to the contents of the second and third paragraphs of the article and is in line with the original text, so it is the correct option.</p>
              <p>The F option corresponds to the fifth paragraph of the article. It describes the process after the sun becomes a red giant. The outside will release all the substances first, then the kernel becomes a white dwarf. After releasing the final energy of the kernel, the sun will die. The F option complies with the original text and is therefore the correct answer.</p>
