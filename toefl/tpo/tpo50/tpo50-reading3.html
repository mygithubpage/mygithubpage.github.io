            <b>Star Death</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>Until the early- to mid-twentieth <span class="underline">century</span>, scientists believed that stars <span class="underline">generate</span> energy by shrinking. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> As stars contracted, it was thought, they would get hotter and hotter, giving off light in the <span class="underline">process</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> This could not be the <span class="underline">primary</span> way that stars shine, however. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span> If it were, they would <span class="underline">scarcely</span> last a million years, rather than the billions of years in age that we know they are. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span> We now know that stars are fueled by nuclear <span class="underline">fusion</span>. Each time <span class="underline">fusion</span> takes place, energy is released as a <span class="underline">by-product</span>. This energy, expelled into <span class="underline">space</span>, is what we see as starlight. The <span class="underline">fusion</span> <span class="underline">process</span> begins when two <span class="underline">hydrogen</span> <span class="underline">nuclei</span> smash together to form a <span class="underline">particle</span> called the deuteron (a <span class="underline">combination</span> of a <span class="underline">positive</span> proton and a <span class="underline">neutral</span> <span class="underline">neutron</span>). Deuterons <span class="light"><span class="underline">readily</span></span> <span class="underline">combine</span> with <span class="underline">additional</span> protons to form <span class="underline">helium</span>. <span class="underline">Helium</span>, in turn, can <span class="underline">fuse</span> together to form heavier elements, such as <span class="underline">carbon</span>. In a <span class="underline">typical</span> star, merger after merger takes place until <span class="underline">significant</span> quantities of heavy elements are built up.</p>
          <p>We must <span class="underline">distinguish</span>, at this point, between two different <span class="underline">stellar</span> types: <span class="underline">Population</span> I and <span class="underline">Population</span> ll, the <span class="underline">latter</span> being much older than the <span class="underline">former</span>. These groups can also be <span class="underline">distinguished</span> by their locations. Our <span class="underline">galaxy</span>, the Milky Way, is shaped like a <span class="underline">flat</span> disk surrounding a central <span class="underline">bulge</span>. Whereas <span class="underline">Population</span> I stars are found mainly in the galactic disk, <span class="underline">Population</span> II stars mostly <span class="underline">reside</span> in the central <span class="underline">bulge</span> of the <span class="underline">galaxy</span> and in the halo surrounding this <span class="underline">bulge</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="underline">Population</span> II stars <span class="underline">date</span> to the early stages of the <span class="underline">universe</span>. Formed when the <span class="underline">cosmos</span> was filled with <span class="underline">hydrogen</span> and <span class="underline">helium</span> gases, they <span class="underline">initially</span> contained <span class="underline">virtually</span> no heavy elements. They shine until their fusible <span class="underline">material</span> is exhausted. When <span class="underline">Population</span> II stars die, their <span class="underline">material</span> is <span class="underline">spread</span> out into <span class="underline">space</span>. Some of this dust is <span class="underline">eventually</span> incorporated into newly formed <span class="underline">Population</span> I stars. Though <span class="underline">Population</span> I stars <span class="underline">consist</span> mostly of <span class="underline">hydrogen</span> and <span class="underline">helium</span> gas, they also <span class="underline">contain</span> heavy elements (heavier than <span class="underline">helium</span>), which <span class="underline">comprise</span> about 1 or 2 percent of their <span class="underline">mass</span>. These heavier materials are fused from the lighter elements that the stars have collected. Thus, <span class="underline">Population</span> I stars <span class="underline">contain</span> <span class="underline">material</span> that once belonged to stars from <span class="underline">previous</span> generations. The Sun is a good example of a <span class="underline">Population</span> I star.</p>
          <p>What will happen when the Sun dies? In several billion years, our mother star will burn much brighter. It will expend more and more of its nuclear <span class="underline">fuel</span>, until little is left of its <span class="underline">original</span> <span class="underline">hydrogen</span>. Then, at some point in the far future, all nuclear reactions in the Sun's center will <span class="underline">cease</span>.</p>
          <p>Once the Sun passes into its "postnuclear" <span class="underline">phase</span>, it will <span class="underline">separate</span> effectively into two different regions: an <span class="underline">inner</span> <span class="underline">zone</span> and an outer <span class="underline">zone</span>. While no more <span class="underline">hydrogen</span> <span class="underline">fuel</span> will <span class="underline">remain</span> in the <span class="underline">inner</span> <span class="underline">zone</span>, there will be a small <span class="underline">amount</span> left in the outer <span class="underline">zone</span>. Rapidly, changes will begin to take place that will serve to tear the Sun apart. The <span class="underline">inner</span> <span class="underline">zone</span>, its nuclear fires no longer burning, will begin to <span class="underline">collapse</span> under the influence of its own weight and will <span class="underline">contract</span> into a tiny hot <span class="underline">core</span>, <span class="underline"><span class="underline">dense</span></span> and <span class="underline">dim</span>. An <span class="underline">opposite</span> fate will await the outer <span class="underline">region</span>, a loosely held-together ball of gas. A shock wave caused by the <span class="underline">inner</span> <span class="underline">zone</span>'s contraction will send ripples <span class="underline">through</span> the dying star, pushing the <span class="underline">stellar</span> <span class="underline">exterior</span>'s <span class="underline">material</span> farther and farther outward. The outer <span class="underline">envelope</span> will then grow rapidly, increasing, in a short <span class="underline">interval</span>, hundreds of times in size. As it expands, it will cool down by thousands of degrees. <span class="underline">Eventually</span>, the Sun will become a red <span class="underline">giant</span> star, cool and bright. It will be so large that it will <span class="underline">occupy</span> the whole <span class="underline">space</span> that used to be the Earth's <span class="underline">orbit</span> and so <span class="underline">brilliant</span> that it would be able to be seen with the <span class="underline">naked</span> eye thousands of light-years away. It will exist that way for millions of years, <span class="underline">gradually</span> releasing the <span class="underline">material</span> of its outer <span class="underline">envelope</span> into <span class="underline">space</span>. Finally, nothing will be left of the <span class="underline">gaseous</span> <span class="underline">exterior</span> of the Sun; all that will <span class="underline">remain</span> will be the hot, white <span class="underline">core</span>. The Sun will have become a white <span class="underline"><span class="underline">dwarf</span></span> star. The <span class="underline">core</span> will <span class="underline">shrink</span>, giving off the last of its energy, and the Sun will finally die.</p>
