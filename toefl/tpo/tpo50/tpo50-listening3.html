part of a lecture in a <span class="highlight">biology</span> class.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="1.58" data-time="5.3">[00:05.30]</span>Processor: Ok.<span class="time" data-times="7.45" data-time="6.88">[00:06.88]</span> There are two <span class="highlight">major</span> types of classifiers in the world, people we call lumpers and people we call splitters.<span class="time" data-times="5.37" data-time="14.33">[00:14.33]</span> A lumper is someone who tries to put as many things as possible in one <span class="highlight">category</span>.<span class="time" data-times="6" data-time="19.7">[00:19.70]</span> Splitters like to work for the differences and put things in as many different categories as possible.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.61" data-time="25.7">[00:25.70]</span>Both lumpers and splitters work in the business of defining biological classifications. <span class="time" data-times="6.64" data-time="31.31">[00:31.31]</span>The great <span class="highlight">philosopher</span><span class="highlight">Aristotle</span> is generally considered the first person to <span class="highlight">systematically</span><span class="highlight">categorize</span> things. <span class="time" data-times="2.96" data-time="37.95">[00:37.95]</span>He divided all living things into two groups.<span class="time" data-times="2.34" data-time="40.91">[00:40.91]</span> They were either animal or vegetable. <span class="time" data-times="4.08" data-time="43.25">[00:43.25]</span>And these categories are what biologists came to call "kingdoms".<span class="time" data-times="5.06" data-time="47.33">[00:47.33]</span> So if it ran around, it was an animal, a member of the animal <span class="highlight">kingdom</span>.<span class="time" data-times="6.27" data-time="52.39">[00:52.39]</span> And if it stood still, and grew in the soil, it was a plant, a member of the plant <span class="highlight">kingdom</span>.<span class="time" data-times="8.08" data-time="58.66">[00:58.66]</span> This system, organizing all life into these two kingdoms, worked very well for quite a while, <span class="highlight">even</span> into the age of the <span class="highlight">microscope</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.96" data-time="66.74">[01:06.74]</span>With the invention of the <span class="highlight">microscope</span>, in the late 1500s, we discovered the first microorganisms.<span class="time" data-times="5.76" data-time="73.7">[01:13.70]</span> We thought that some wiggled and moved around and others were green and just sat there.<span class="time" data-times="6.48" data-time="79.46">[01:19.46]</span> So the ones that moved like animals were classified as animals, and the more plant-like ones as plants.<span class="time" data-times="3.7" data-time="85.94">[01:25.94]</span> Oh, before I go on I must <span class="highlight">mention</span> Carolus Linnaeus.<span class="time" data-times="15.02" data-time="89.64">[01:29.64]</span> A hundred years or so after the invention of the <span class="highlight">microscope</span>, Carolus Linnaeus devised a simple and <span class="highlight">practical</span> system for classifying living things, according to the ranks of categorization still in use today--class, order, family and so on.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="9.84" data-time="104.66">[01:44.66]</span>And by further best <span class="highlight">aspect</span> of the Linnaeus system, is the general use of binomial nomenclature, having just two names to <span class="highlight">describe</span> any living <span class="highlight">organism</span>.<span class="time" data-times="7.59" data-time="114.5">[01:54.50]</span> This replaced the use of long <span class="highlight">descriptive</span> names, as well as <span class="highlight">common</span> names which <span class="highlight">vary</span> from place to place and language to language.<span class="time" data-times="9.35" data-time="122.09">[02:02.09]</span> Binomial nomenclature gives every <span class="highlight">species</span> a <span class="highlight">unique</span> and <span class="highlight">stable</span> two-word name, agreed upon by biologists worldwide.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.23" data-time="131.44">[02:11.44]</span>But not everything about this system remained unchanged.<span class="time" data-times="3.03" data-time="135.67">[02:15.67]</span> Take for example the <span class="highlight">mushroom</span>, a <span class="highlight">fungus</span>.<span class="time" data-times="3.5" data-time="138.7">[02:18.70]</span> It grew up from the ground and looked like a plant.<span class="time" data-times="2.26" data-time="142.2">[02:22.20]</span> So it was classified as a plant.<span class="time" data-times="8.34" data-time="144.46">[02:24.46]</span> But using the <span class="highlight">microscope</span> we discovered that a <span class="highlight">fungus</span> contains these <span class="highlight">microscopic</span> thread-like cells that run all over the place.<span class="time" data-times="2.94" data-time="152.8">[02:32.80]</span> And so it's actually not that plant-like.<span class="time" data-times="6.26" data-time="155.74">[02:35.74]</span> So in this case, the splitters <span class="highlight">eventually</span> won, and got a third <span class="highlight">kingdom</span> just for the <span class="highlight">fungus</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.55" data-time="162">[02:42.00]</span>And as microscopes improved, we discovered some microorganisms that were incredibly small.<span class="time" data-times="1.95" data-time="168.55">[02:48.55]</span> I'm talking about <span class="highlight">bacteria</span>.<span class="time" data-times="3.55" data-time="170.5">[02:50.50]</span> And we could see that they didn't have what we call a <span class="highlight">nucleus</span>.<span class="time" data-times="5.45" data-time="174.05">[02:54.05]</span> So they got their own <span class="highlight">kingdom</span>, a <span class="highlight">kingdom</span> of very tiny things without nucleoli.<span class="time" data-times="8.4" data-time="179.5">[02:59.50]</span> So then we had several kingdoms for plants and for animals, and the different kinds of <span class="highlight">fungus</span> like mushrooms, and for these tiny <span class="highlight">bacteria</span>.<span class="time" data-times="4.51" data-time="187.9">[03:07.90]</span> But we also had some other microorganisms that didn't fit anywhere.<span class="time" data-times="3.07" data-time="192.41">[03:12.41]</span> So biologist gave them their own <span class="highlight">kingdom</span>.<span class="time" data-times="6.43" data-time="195.48">[03:15.48]</span> And this fifth <span class="highlight">kingdom</span> was <span class="highlight">sort</span> of anything that doesn't fit in the first four <span class="highlight">kingdom</span>, which <span class="highlight">upset</span> some people.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.12" data-time="201.91">[03:21.91]</span>And then there was a question of viruses. <span class="time" data-times="6.24" data-time="205.03">[03:25.03]</span>Viruses have some characteristics of life but don't <span class="highlight">reproduce</span> on their own or use energy.<span class="time" data-times="2.93" data-time="211.27">[03:31.27]</span> So we still don't know what to do with them.<span class="time" data-times="3.17" data-time="214.2">[03:34.20]</span> The lumpers want to keep viruses in the <span class="highlight">current</span> system.<span class="time" data-times="3.17" data-time="217.37">[03:37.37]</span> Some of the splitters say to give them a <span class="highlight">separate</span><span class="highlight">kingdom</span>.<span class="time" data-times="7.94" data-time="220.54">[03:40.54]</span> And the <span class="highlight">extreme</span> splitters say that viruses have nothing at all to do with living things and keep them out of my <span class="highlight">department</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.15" data-time="228.48">[03:48.48]</span>Recent research though has moved to see yet another direction.<span class="time" data-times="7.59" data-time="232.63">[03:52.63]</span> Nowadays when we want to <span class="highlight">determine</span> the characteristics of something, we look at its biochemistry and its <span class="highlight">genetic</span><span class="highlight">material</span>.<span class="time" data-times="4.7" data-time="240.22">[4:00.22]</span> And what we've discovered is that some <span class="highlight">bacteria</span> are not like the others.<span class="time" data-times="2.85" data-time="244.92">[04:04.92]</span> Many of these are called extremophiles. <span class="time" data-times="10.33" data-time="247.77">[04:07.77]</span>They live in very strange places, in <span class="highlight">polar</span> ice or in a boiling water of hot springs or in water so salty (that) other organisms couldn't live there.<span class="time" data-times="10.68" data-time="258.1">[04:18.10]</span> Extremophiles <span class="highlight">tend</span> to have a different chemistry from other <span class="highlight">bacteria</span>, a chemistry that in some case is actually more related to plants and animals than to <span class="highlight">previously</span> known <span class="highlight">bacteria</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.41" data-time="268.78">[04:28.78]</span>So what to do with this strange <span class="highlight">bacteria</span>?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.25" data-time="273.19">[04:33.19]</span>Well, one thing we've done is creating a new set of categories, the domains, overarching the different kingdoms.<span class="time" data-times="3.22" data-time="280.44">[04:40.44]</span> Biologists now <span class="highlight">recognize</span> three domains.<span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="283.66">[04:43.66]</span> But <span class="highlight">even</span> as we talk about these new domains, well, come back in a few years and it might all be different.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1"

The student apparently took glass raw materials and made glass products as one thing. He was questioning whether the professor was talking about self-contradictory words. Professor is here to emphasize that Egyptians manufacture glass objects that are made after secondary processing of glass, not glass itself. Therefore, there is no contradiction in what the professor said. Option C meets the meaning. Option A means that in order to stress that glass was made only in ancient Egypt, Option B means that the professor is confused about finding students, and Option D means to correct what she said before.

Combined with the development of the entire lecture, we can know that in the taxonomy, people of different categories and people in small classes also have their own opinions. Actually, these two people represent the biologists in the history of taxonomy. Two different ways. Option D is in accordance with the original meaning. Option A is meant to emphasize the difference between early and modern biologists. Option B is meant to point out that early taxa are not based on scientific principles; Option C is meant to provide examples for early taxonomy systems that do not conform to the original text.

This replaced the use of long descriptive names, as well as common names which vary from place to place and language To language. Binomial nomenclature gives every species a unique and stable two-word name, agreed upon by biologists worldwide.</p><p>This shows that before Linnaeus created the double name method, people named the creatures with descriptive long names, and people used different names for the same creatures in different languages ​​and different regions. It was very inconvenient. . But after Linnaeu's dual name approach came out, biologists around the world generally agreed with this naming approach. This shows that before Lin Nai's double-name method came into being, biologists did not name the many creatures in a unified manner. They called each of the names, and Option A met the original meaning. Option B means that few people use microscopes, but the original text says that Linnaeus created the double name method a hundred years after the invention of the microscope. At this time, many people use microscopes and mistakes; Option C says that because they have no nuclei The discovery of microbes is confusing, out of nothing, and wrong; Option D says that they must publish their own research to be proficient in several languages, but also out of nothing, wrong.
