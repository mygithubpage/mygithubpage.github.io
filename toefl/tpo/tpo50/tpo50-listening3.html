a <span class="highlight">biology</span> class.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="1.58" data-time="5.3">[00:05.30]</span>Processor: Ok.<span class="time" data-times="7.45" data-time="6.88">[00:06.88]</span> There are two <span class="highlight">major</span> types of classifiers in the world, people we call lumpers and people we call splitters.<span class="time" data-times="5.37" data-time="14.33">[00:14.33]</span> A lumper is someone who tries to put as many things as possible in one <span class="highlight">category</span>.<span class="time" data-times="6" data-time="19.7">[00:19.70]</span> Splitters like to work for the differences and put things in as many different categories as possible.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.61" data-time="25.7">[00:25.70]</span>Both lumpers and splitters work in the business of defining biological classifications. <span class="time" data-times="6.64" data-time="31.31">[00:31.31]</span>The great <span class="highlight">philosopher</span><span class="highlight">Aristotle</span> is generally considered the first person to <span class="highlight">systematically</span><span class="highlight">categorize</span> things. <span class="time" data-times="2.96" data-time="37.95">[00:37.95]</span>He divided all living things into two groups.<span class="time" data-times="2.34" data-time="40.91">[00:40.91]</span> They were either animal or vegetable. <span class="time" data-times="4.08" data-time="43.25">[00:43.25]</span>And these categories are what biologists came to call "kingdoms".<span class="time" data-times="5.06" data-time="47.33">[00:47.33]</span> So if it ran around, it was an animal, a member of the animal <span class="highlight">kingdom</span>.<span class="time" data-times="6.27" data-time="52.39">[00:52.39]</span> And if it stood still, and grew in the soil, it was a plant, a member of the plant <span class="highlight">kingdom</span>.<span class="time" data-times="8.08" data-time="58.66">[00:58.66]</span> This system, organizing all life into these two kingdoms, worked very well for quite a while, <span class="highlight">even</span> into the age of the <span class="highlight">microscope</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.96" data-time="66.74">[01:06.74]</span>With the invention of the <span class="highlight">microscope</span>, in the late 1500s, we discovered the first microorganisms.<span class="time" data-times="5.76" data-time="73.7">[01:13.70]</span> We thought that some wiggled and moved around and others were green and just sat there.<span class="time" data-times="6.48" data-time="79.46">[01:19.46]</span> So the ones that moved like animals were classified as animals, and the more plant-like ones as plants.<span class="time" data-times="3.7" data-time="85.94">[01:25.94]</span> Oh, before I go on I must <span class="highlight">mention</span> Carolus Linnaeus.<span class="time" data-times="15.02" data-time="89.64">[01:29.64]</span> A hundred years or so after the invention of the <span class="highlight">microscope</span>, Carolus Linnaeus devised a simple and <span class="highlight">practical</span> system for classifying living things, according to the ranks of categorization still in use today--class, order, family and so on.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="9.84" data-time="104.66">[01:44.66]</span>And by further best <span class="highlight">aspect</span> of the Linnaeus system, is the general use of binomial nomenclature, having just two names to <span class="highlight">describe</span> any living <span class="highlight">organism</span>.<span class="time" data-times="7.59" data-time="114.5">[01:54.50]</span> This replaced the use of long <span class="highlight">descriptive</span> names, as well as <span class="highlight">common</span> names which <span class="highlight">vary</span> from place to place and language to language.<span class="time" data-times="9.35" data-time="122.09">[02:02.09]</span> Binomial nomenclature gives every <span class="highlight">species</span> a <span class="highlight">unique</span> and <span class="highlight">stable</span> two-word name, agreed upon by biologists worldwide.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.23" data-time="131.44">[02:11.44]</span>But not everything about this system remained unchanged.<span class="time" data-times="3.03" data-time="135.67">[02:15.67]</span> Take for example the <span class="highlight">mushroom</span>, a <span class="highlight">fungus</span>.<span class="time" data-times="3.5" data-time="138.7">[02:18.70]</span> It grew up from the ground and looked like a plant.<span class="time" data-times="2.26" data-time="142.2">[02:22.20]</span> So it was classified as a plant.<span class="time" data-times="8.34" data-time="144.46">[02:24.46]</span> But using the <span class="highlight">microscope</span> we discovered that a <span class="highlight">fungus</span> contains these <span class="highlight">microscopic</span> thread-like cells that run all over the place.<span class="time" data-times="2.94" data-time="152.8">[02:32.80]</span> And so it's actually not that plant-like.<span class="time" data-times="6.26" data-time="155.74">[02:35.74]</span> So in this case, the splitters <span class="highlight">eventually</span> won, and got a third <span class="highlight">kingdom</span> just for the <span class="highlight">fungus</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.55" data-time="162">[02:42.00]</span>And as microscopes improved, we discovered some microorganisms that were incredibly small.<span class="time" data-times="1.95" data-time="168.55">[02:48.55]</span> I'm talking about <span class="highlight">bacteria</span>.<span class="time" data-times="3.55" data-time="170.5">[02:50.50]</span> And we could see that they didn't have what we call a <span class="highlight">nucleus</span>.<span class="time" data-times="5.45" data-time="174.05">[02:54.05]</span> So they got their own <span class="highlight">kingdom</span>, a <span class="highlight">kingdom</span> of very tiny things without nucleoli.<span class="time" data-times="8.4" data-time="179.5">[02:59.50]</span> So then we had several kingdoms for plants and for animals, and the different kinds of <span class="highlight">fungus</span> like mushrooms, and for these tiny <span class="highlight">bacteria</span>.<span class="time" data-times="4.51" data-time="187.9">[03:07.90]</span> But we also had some other microorganisms that didn't fit anywhere.<span class="time" data-times="3.07" data-time="192.41">[03:12.41]</span> So biologist gave them their own <span class="highlight">kingdom</span>.<span class="time" data-times="6.43" data-time="195.48">[03:15.48]</span> And this fifth <span class="highlight">kingdom</span> was <span class="highlight">sort</span> of anything that doesn't fit in the first four <span class="highlight">kingdom</span>, which <span class="highlight">upset</span> some people.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.12" data-time="201.91">[03:21.91]</span>And then there was a question of viruses. <span class="time" data-times="6.24" data-time="205.03">[03:25.03]</span>Viruses have some characteristics of life but don't <span class="highlight">reproduce</span> on their own or use energy.<span class="time" data-times="2.93" data-time="211.27">[03:31.27]</span> So we still don't know what to do with them.<span class="time" data-times="3.17" data-time="214.2">[03:34.20]</span> The lumpers want to keep viruses in the <span class="highlight">current</span> system.<span class="time" data-times="3.17" data-time="217.37">[03:37.37]</span> Some of the splitters say to give them a <span class="highlight">separate</span><span class="highlight">kingdom</span>.<span class="time" data-times="7.94" data-time="220.54">[03:40.54]</span> And the <span class="highlight">extreme</span> splitters say that viruses have nothing at all to do with living things and keep them out of my <span class="highlight">department</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.15" data-time="228.48">[03:48.48]</span>Recent research though has moved to see yet another direction.<span class="time" data-times="7.59" data-time="232.63">[03:52.63]</span> Nowadays when we want to <span class="highlight">determine</span> the characteristics of something, we look at its biochemistry and its <span class="highlight">genetic</span><span class="highlight">material</span>.<span class="time" data-times="4.7" data-time="240.22">[4:00.22]</span> And what we've discovered is that some <span class="highlight">bacteria</span> are not like the others.<span class="time" data-times="2.85" data-time="244.92">[04:04.92]</span> Many of these are called extremophiles. <span class="time" data-times="10.33" data-time="247.77">[04:07.77]</span>They live in very strange places, in <span class="highlight">polar</span> ice or in a boiling water of hot springs or in water so salty (that) other organisms couldn't live there.<span class="time" data-times="10.68" data-time="258.1">[04:18.10]</span> Extremophiles <span class="highlight">tend</span> to have a different chemistry from other <span class="highlight">bacteria</span>, a chemistry that in some case is actually more related to plants and animals than to <span class="highlight">previously</span> known <span class="highlight">bacteria</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.41" data-time="268.78">[04:28.78]</span>So what to do with this strange <span class="highlight">bacteria</span>?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.25" data-time="273.19">[04:33.19]</span>Well, one thing we've done is creating a new set of categories, the domains, overarching the different kingdoms.<span class="time" data-times="3.22" data-time="280.44">[04:40.44]</span> Biologists now <span class="highlight">recognize</span> three domains.<span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="283.66">[04:43.66]</span> But <span class="highlight">even</span> as we talk about these new domains, well, come back in a few years and it might all be different.</p></p></article></section><div id="question"><div
