Am......Am I missing something? <span class="time" data-times="3.27" data-time="65.95">[01:05.95]</span>They are making glass but they are not making glass?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.44" data-time="69.22">[01:09.22]</span>Professor: I said they were making glass objects, right?<span class="time" data-times="17.67" data-time="72.66">[01:12.66]</span> You see, it was <span class="highlight">previously</span> thought that they weren't actually making the <span class="highlight">raw</span> glass itself that they were importing unfinished glass from <span class="highlight">Mesopotamia</span>, which today is a <span class="highlight">region</span> consisting of Iraq and parts of Syria and <span class="highlight">Turkey</span> and Iran, and <span class="highlight">simply</span> reworking it.<span class="time" data-times="9.44" data-time="90.33">[01:30.33]</span> Most archeologists believed that the glass factories were in <span class="highlight">Mesopotamia</span> because that's where the oldest known glass remains come from.<span class="time" data-times="2.61" data-time="99.77">[01:39.77]</span> You see, there was two stages of glass making.<span class="time" data-times="5.25" data-time="102.38">[01:42.38]</span> The <span class="highlight">primary</span> production <span class="highlight">stage</span> where they made disks of <span class="highlight">raw</span> glass.<span class="time" data-times="10.81" data-time="107.63">[01:47.63]</span> And there was the secondary <span class="highlight">stage</span> where they melted the <span class="highlight">raw</span> glass, the glass disks, and created <span class="highlight">decorative</span> objects, so, or whatever.<span class="time" data-times="6.58" data-time="118.44">[01:58.44]</span> And from this new Egyptians' site, we learned that the <span class="highlight">primary</span> production <span class="highlight">stage</span> had several steps.<span class="time" data-times="6.57" data-time="125.02">[02:05.02]</span> First they took <span class="highlight">quartz</span>, a colorless <span class="highlight">transparent</span><span class="highlight">mineral</span> and crushed it.<span class="time" data-times="4.71" data-time="131.59">[02:11.59]</span> Then they took that crushed <span class="highlight">quartz</span> and mixed it with plant ash.<span class="time" data-times="5.95" data-time="136.3">[02:16.30]</span> A plant ash is just what it sounds like, the ashes left after you burnt plant <span class="highlight">material</span>.<span class="time" data-times="9.07" data-time="142.25">[02:22.25]</span> They slowly heated this mixture at a <span class="highlight">relatively</span> low <span class="highlight">temperature</span> in small vessels, containers like jars made out of <span class="highlight">clay</span>.<span class="time" data-times="4.2" data-time="151.32">[02:31.32]</span> And that yielded a kind of glassy <span class="highlight">material</span>.<span class="time" data-times="8.47" data-time="155.52">[02:35.52]</span> They took this glassy <span class="highlight">material</span> and grounded it up into a <span class="highlight">powder</span> and then they used <span class="highlight">metallic</span><span class="highlight">dye</span> to color it.<span class="time" data-times="9.36" data-time="163.99">[02:43.99]</span> After that, they poured the colored <span class="highlight">powder</span> out into disk-shaped molds and heated it up to very high temperatures.<span class="time" data-times="1.35" data-time="173.35">[02:53.35]</span> So that it melted. <span class="time" data-times="7.68" data-time="174.7">[02:54.70]</span>After cooled, they <span class="highlight">break</span> the molds, and inside there were the glass disks.<span class="time" data-times="5.71" data-time="182.38">[03:02.38]</span> These disks were shipped out to other sites <span class="highlight">within</span> Egypt and places around the <span class="highlight">Mediterranean</span>.<span class="time" data-times="6.53" data-time="188.09">[03:08.09]</span> Then in the secondary <span class="highlight">phase</span>, the disks were reheated, and shaped into <span class="highlight">decorative</span> objects.<span class="time" data-times="1.68" data-time="194.62">[03:14.62]</span> Susan?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.07" data-time="196.3">[03:16.30]</span>Susan: So what kind of objects were people making back then?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="8.37" data-time="199.37">[03:19.37]</span>Professor: Well, the most <span class="highlight">common</span> objects we found, mostly in Egypt and <span class="highlight">Mesopotamia</span>, the most <span class="highlight">common</span> objects were beads.<span class="time" data-times="5.48" data-time="207.74">[03:27.74]</span> One thing the Egyptian were very very good at was imitating <span class="highlight">precious</span> stones.<span class="time" data-times="8.25" data-time="213.22">[03:33.22]</span> They created some beads that look so much like emeralds and pearls that was very difficult to <span class="highlight">distinguish</span> them from the real thing.<span class="time" data-times="6.63" data-time="221.47">[03:41.47]</span> Em, and......and also beautiful vessels, ah, with narrow necks.<span class="time" data-times="6.16" data-time="228.1">[03:48.10]</span> They were probably really <span class="highlight">valuable</span> so they wouldn't have been used to hold cooking oil or <span class="highlight">common</span> food items.<span class="time" data-times="3.8" data-time="234.26">[03:54.26]</span> They were most likely used for expensive liquids, like <span class="highlight">perfume</span>.<span class="time" data-times="9.16" data-time="238.06">[03:58.06]</span> Now the glass made at this factory was mostly red, to get this red color they used <span class="highlight">copper</span>, in a <span class="highlight">sophisticated</span><span class="highlight">process</span>.<span class="time" data-times="6.2" data-time="247.22">[04:07.22]</span> Of <span class="highlight">course</span>, any kind of glass was very <span class="highlight">valuable</span> so these red bottles would only have been owned by wealthy people.<span class="time" data-times="8.71" data-time="253.42">[04:13.42]</span> In fact, because it was so difficult to make, and <span class="highlight">sort</span> of <span class="highlight">mysterious</span> and <span class="highlight">complicated</span>, it was probably a product produced for the royal family.<span class="time" data-times="3.19" data-time="262.13">[04:22.13]</span> And they probably used glass to show their power.<span class="time" data-times="8.09" data-time="265.32">[04:25.32]</span> Also, beautiful expensive objects made great gifts if you are looking to <span class="highlight">establish</span> or strength the <span class="highlight">political</span> alliances.<span class="time" data-times="6.43" data-time="273.41">[04:33.41]</span> And it is quite possible that the <span class="highlight">ancient</span> Egyptians were actually exporting glass, not just making it or importing it.<span class="time" data-times="7.8" data-time="279.84">[04:39.84]</span> The <span class="highlight">trade</span> with <span class="highlight">Mesopotamia</span> was probably a friendly <span class="highlight">mutual</span><span class="highlight">trade</span> because a <span class="highlight">Mesopotamia</span> glass was usually white or yellow.<span class="time" data-times="6.67" data-time="287.64">[04:47.64]</span> So Mesopotamians might accept something like, we will give you two white disks for two red disks. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="294.31">[04:54.31]</span>There is no <span class="highlight">proof</span> of that, at <span class="highlight">least</span> not yet.</p></article><div

Option A states that the ancient Egyptians imported glass from Mesopotamia. This is correct, but it is not evidenced by the recent evidence. It was written in textbooks and was not selected; Option C says that it was necessary to prove that the glass was produced during the bronze period. In two steps, this recent evidence did not prove to require two steps and was not chosen; Option D said that ancient Egyptians could make glass materials.
