              <span class="time" data-times="3.07" data-time="196.3">[03:16.30]</span>Susan: So what kind of objects were people making back then?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.37" data-time="199.37">[03:19.37]</span>Professor: Well, the most <span class="underline">common</span> objects we found, mostly in Egypt and <span class="underline">Mesopotamia</span>, the most <span class="underline">common</span> objects were beads.<span class="time" data-times="5.48" data-time="207.74">[03:27.74]</span> One thing the Egyptian were very very good at was imitating <span class="underline">precious</span> stones.<span class="time" data-times="8.25" data-time="213.22">[03:33.22]</span> They created some beads that look so much like emeralds and pearls that was very difficult to <span class="underline">distinguish</span> them from the real thing.<span class="time" data-times="6.63" data-time="221.47">[03:41.47]</span> Em, and......and also beautiful vessels, ah, with narrow necks.<span class="time" data-times="6.16" data-time="228.1">[03:48.10]</span> They were probably really <span class="underline">valuable</span> so they wouldn't have been used to hold cooking oil or <span class="underline">common</span> food items.<span class="time" data-times="3.8" data-time="234.26">[03:54.26]</span> They were most likely used for expensive liquids, like <span class="underline">perfume</span>.<span class="time" data-times="9.16" data-time="238.06">[03:58.06]</span> Now the glass made at this factory was mostly red, to get this red color they used <span class="underline">copper</span>, in a <span class="underline">sophisticated</span> <span class="underline">process</span>.<span class="time" data-times="6.2" data-time="247.22">[04:07.22]</span> Of <span class="underline">course</span>, any kind of glass was very <span class="underline">valuable</span> so these red bottles would only have been owned by wealthy people.<span class="time" data-times="8.71" data-time="253.42">[04:13.42]</span> In fact, because it was so difficult to make, and <span class="underline">sort</span> of <span class="underline">mysterious</span> and <span class="underline">complicated</span>, it was probably a product produced for the royal family.<span class="time" data-times="3.19" data-time="262.13">[04:22.13]</span> And they probably used glass to show their power.<span class="time" data-times="8.09" data-time="265.32">[04:25.32]</span> Also, beautiful expensive objects made great gifts if you are looking to <span class="underline">establish</span> or strength the <span class="underline">political</span> alliances.<span class="time" data-times="6.43" data-time="273.41">[04:33.41]</span> And it is quite possible that the <span class="underline">ancient</span> Egyptians were actually exporting glass, not just making it or importing it.<span class="time" data-times="7.8" data-time="279.84">[04:39.84]</span> The <span class="underline">trade</span> with <span class="underline">Mesopotamia</span> was probably a friendly <span class="underline">mutual</span> <span class="underline">trade</span> because a <span class="underline">Mesopotamia</span> glass was usually white or yellow.<span class="time" data-times="6.67" data-time="287.64">[04:47.64]</span> So Mesopotamians might accept something like, we will give you two white disks for two red disks. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="294.31">[04:54.31]</span>There is no <span class="underline">proof</span> of that, at <span class="underline">least</span> not yet.</p>
