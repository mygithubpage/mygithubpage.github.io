          <p>Listening to a conversation between a student and his academic adviser.</p>
          <p>Woman: So how's the semester going so far.</p>
          <p>Man: Well I'm having some trouble I need some advice.</p>
          <p>Woman: Okay.</p>
          <p>Man: Well I'm taking advanced chemistry and it's turning out to be a lot more work than I expected especially because we have to put in so much time in the laboratory.</p>
          <p>Woman: Okay.</p>
          <p>Man: Yeah I really like it but my schedule is just too full because you know I'm also writing a weekly editorial for the campus newspaper and now with advanced chemistry it's too much.</p>
          <p>Woman: That's right yes I enjoy reading your editorials. Well How about instead of writing an editorial every week. You only write one every two weeks then next semester you go back to writing it every week.</p>
          <p>Man: It is hard to keep up with those weekly deadlines and that would give me the extra time I need for advanced chemistry. But my editorial has so many readers it's the first thing a lot of people read it and I hate to disappoint them.</p>
          <p>Woman: Okay. Well there's another possibility. You're required to take a science course. But you don't have to take an advanced course. So you could switch to a less challenging course. Basic chemistry.</p>
          <p>Man: I guess the basic course would take up less time.</p>
          <p>Woman: Definitely. For one thing you'd spend much less time in the laboratory.</p>
          <p>Man: That's an interesting idea. But I love the challenge of the advanced course I feel like I'm learning so much.</p>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>In the conversation, the student is facing a problem that he is taking advanced chemistry course this semester but it takes him so much time that he doesn't have any time left for his weekly editorial on school newspaper. There are two solutions. He could choose either to change the frequency into one editorial every two weeks or to take a less challenging course - basic chemistry. As far as I'm concerned, the former is a better choice since as a student it is much more important to put one's focus on academic performance. Not writing editorials on school newspaper or writing less wouldn't hurt him a lot. Instead, if he gets a low score on his course, he may not get a promising career after graduation and what's worse he may not even graduate from his university, Therefore, because of this reason I suppose that the first solution is better.</p>
