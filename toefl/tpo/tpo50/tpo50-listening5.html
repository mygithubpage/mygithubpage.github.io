in the United States' <span class="highlight">Literature</span> class.<span class="time" data-times="3.61" data-time="7.55">[00:07.55]</span> The professor is discussing <span class="highlight">Realism</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="1.34" data-time="11.16">[00:11.16]</span>Professor: Ok, everyone.<span class="time" data-times="3.8" data-time="12.5">[00:12.50]</span> In our last class, we finished up Romanticism, right?<span class="time" data-times="2.7" data-time="16.3">[00:16.30]</span> So now let's look at something completely different.<span class="time" data-times="7.5" data-time="19">[00:19.00]</span><span class="highlight">Realism</span> as a <span class="highlight">literary</span> technic was most <span class="highlight">popular</span> in U.S. <span class="highlight">literature</span> from around 1860 till 1890.<span class="time" data-times="4.49" data-time="26.5">[00:26.50]</span> So it started <span class="highlight">pretty</span> much around the time of the <span class="highlight">civil</span> war.<span class="time" data-times="5.73" data-time="30.99">[00:30.99]</span> And I think you'll see right away how it is different from Romanticism or any other kind of <span class="highlight">literature</span>.<span class="time" data-times="3.11" data-time="36.72">[00:36.72]</span> There is a very <span class="highlight">specific</span> point that makes it <span class="highlight">unique</span>.<span class="time" data-times="7.95" data-time="39.83">[00:39.83]</span> And that is that it shows people as they are and get you to look at them and also you know the things that need to be changed in the society.<span class="time" data-times="8.38" data-time="47.78">[00:47.78]</span> And it doesn't without being <span class="highlight">sentimental</span>, not in that <span class="highlight">sort</span> of over-emotional way, the way that <span class="highlight">romantic</span><span class="highlight">literature</span> can.<span class="time" data-times="2.71" data-time="56.16">[00:56.16]</span><span class="highlight">Realism</span> tells it like it is.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="1.9" data-time="58.87">[00:58.87]</span>Let's look society as a whole.<span class="time" data-times="12.5" data-time="60.77">[01:00.77]</span> In the late 1800s, people were interested in the <span class="highlight">scientific</span><span class="highlight">method</span> as well as <span class="highlight">rational</span><span class="highlight">philosophy</span>, which says that people can discover the truth by using <span class="highlight">reason</span> and <span class="highlight">factual</span><span class="highlight">analysis</span>.<span class="time" data-times="3" data-time="73.27">[01:13.27]</span> So <span class="highlight">reason</span> and facts, ok.<span class="time" data-times="8.14" data-time="76.27">[01:16.27]</span> And at the same time that <span class="highlight">realism</span> was becoming <span class="highlight">popular</span>, there were a lot of <span class="highlight">political</span> and socioeconomic changes happening in the country.<span class="time" data-times="13.69" data-time="84.41">[01:24.41]</span> There was increased <span class="highlight">literacy</span>, plus the growth of <span class="highlight">industrialism</span> and <span class="highlight">urbanization</span>, growth in <span class="highlight">population</span> from immigration, and a rise in middle class affluence.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="13.52" data-time="98.1">[01:38.10]</span>All these factors combined with the importance of <span class="highlight">reason</span> and facts, meant readers were interested in really having a good understanding of all these changes, the changes going on in society.<span class="time" data-times="11.14" data-time="111.62">[01:51.62]</span> A scourer named Amy Chaplin says, and I'm just paraphrasing here, that <span class="highlight">Realism</span> is a way to understand and <span class="highlight">deal</span> with social change, which makes a lot of <span class="highlight">sense</span> I think.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.09" data-time="122.76">[02:02.76]</span>So then, let's take a closer look at the trips of the <span class="highlight">trend</span>, and how realist writers did their work.<span class="time" data-times="7.11" data-time="129.85">[02:09.85]</span> For one thing as we said, they <span class="highlight">focus</span> on, express reality, and in great <span class="highlight">detail</span>.<span class="time" data-times="2.14" data-time="136.96">[02:16.96]</span>They inferred verisimilitude.<span class="time" data-times="1.56" data-time="139.1">[02:19.10]</span> Shall I write down on <span class="highlight">board</span>?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="1.01" data-time="140.66">[02:20.66]</span>Students: Um-hum.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="1.78" data-time="141.67">[02:21.67]</span>Professor: Ok.<span class="time" data-times="8.69" data-time="143.45">[02:23.45]</span> Verisimilitude means basically the same true or real, like say, a <span class="highlight">photograph</span> rather than a painting in a way.<span class="time" data-times="2.4" data-time="152.14">[02:32.14]</span> In fact, that's a good <span class="highlight">analogy</span>.<span class="time" data-times="8.54" data-time="154.54">[02:34.54]</span> You see writers try to <span class="highlight">capture</span> a moment in time and all its <span class="highlight">basic</span> facts but without exaggeration, just like a camera does.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.91" data-time="163.08">[02:43.08]</span>Anyway, the events, the things that happen in <span class="highlight">realistic</span><span class="highlight">literature</span> are usually <span class="highlight">pretty</span> much <span class="highlight">plausible</span>.<span class="time" data-times="3.22" data-time="169.99">[02:49.99]</span> I mean, you <span class="highlight">figure</span> that they can probably happen to anyone.<span class="time" data-times="2.83" data-time="173.21">[02:53.21]</span> And the characters are believable, too.<span class="time" data-times="3.5" data-time="176.04">[02:56.04]</span> And actually, they are usually <span class="highlight">even</span> more important than the <span class="highlight">plot</span>.<span class="time" data-times="11.52" data-time="179.54">[02:59.54]</span> There're also......they talked the way the real people talk, <span class="highlight">authentic</span> speaking styles from different regions, different parts of the country were captured in the text.<span class="time" data-times="0.96" data-time="191.06">[03:11.06]</span> Does that make <span class="highlight">sense</span>?<span class="time" data-times="1.68" data-time="192.02">[03:12.02]</span> Ok.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.71" data-time="193.7">[03:13.70]</span>So, <span class="highlight">besides</span> verisimilitude, another important <span class="highlight">characteristic</span> of <span class="highlight">realism</span> is the <span class="highlight">narrator</span>'s objectivity.<span class="time" data-times="7.39" data-time="201.41">[03:21.41]</span> Characters in the events were described without the <span class="highlight">narrator</span> passing much judgment on them or anything or being too <span class="highlight">dramatic</span>.<span class="time" data-times="4.32" data-time="208.8">[03:28.80]</span> Basically, you are reading a story without too much <span class="highlight">extra</span><span class="highlight">comment</span> from the <span class="highlight">narrator</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.61" data-time="213.12">[03:33.12]</span>Ok, now we have an idea of what <span class="highlight">realism</span> was. <span class="time" data-times="2.49" data-time="217.73">[03:37.73]</span>So, who were the players?<span class="time" data-times="5.86" data-time="220.22">[03:40.22]</span> Well, two important realist novelists were Rebecca Harding Davis and Mark Twain.<span class="time" data-times="4.08" data-time="226.08">[03:46.08]</span> We'll talk more about other realists tomorrow.<span class="time" data-times="3.55" data-time="230.16">[03:50.16]</span> But for today, let's just start by looking <span class="highlight">briefly</span> at these two.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="8.74" data-time="233.71">[03:53.71]</span>Rebecca Harding Davis was an author and <span class="highlight">journalist</span> who, like other realists, was concerned about all those social changes going on.<span class="time" data-times="7.2" data-time="242.45">[04:02.45]</span> She wrote mainly about some marginalized groups of the time, like women, native Americans, ah, immigrants.<span class="time" data-times="5.04" data-time="249.65">[04:09.65]</span> Now her best known book is a novella called The Life in the Iron Mills.<span class="time" data-times="4.85" data-time="254.69">[04:14.69]</span> It's really a key text, because it's one of the <span class="highlight">original</span> realist works.<span class="time" data-times="4.08" data-time="259.54">[04:19.54]</span> Her works <span class="highlight">overall</span> have been <span class="highlight">pretty</span> much ignored for a long time.<span class="time" data-times="5.04" data-time="263.62">[04:23.62]</span> But some critics and scourers are starting to revisit them and study them more seriously.<span class="time" data-times="6.02" data-time="268.66">[04:28.66]</span> Probably more from the historical aspects of the works and......but I think that's great.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="9.96" data-time="274.68">[04:34.68]</span>But if we are talking about great <span class="highlight">literature</span>, <span class="highlight">literature</span> that's read and enjoyed today as something more than just a way of looking at that <span class="highlight">era</span>, the <span class="highlight">era</span> when that was written.<span class="time" data-times="3.26" data-time="284.64">[04:44.64]</span> Well, a favorite of <span class="highlight">mine</span> is Mark Twain. <span class="time" data-times="5.52" data-time="287.9">[04:47.90]</span>I'm sure you have read or heard of his most famous book, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.<span class="time" data-times="9.08" data-time="293.42">[04:53.42]</span> And Twain's style, he goes back to what I said earlier, verisimilitude, the <span class="highlight">realistic</span> way characters act and talk.<span class="time" data-times="11.13" data-time="302.5">[05:02.50]</span> You should realize too that this was quite a <span class="highlight">contrast</span> to earlier writers in the U.S., who try to <span class="highlight">emulate</span> the British writers, try to be very <span class="highlight">elegant</span>, at the expense of <span class="highlight">Realism</span>.<span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="313.63">[05:13.63]</span> You know, a lot of critics will tell you that American <span class="highlight">literature</span> began with that book, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the main purpose of the lecture?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.
