          <p>The famous person I admire most is George Washington who is the father of the United States. First, he is a great military genius. It's him that led the American army defeated the British colonists. Without his military talents, the USA would take probably more than 8 years to get rid of British colonial rule. In addition, he showed great virtue in his refusing to become an emperor. Besides, he is also a very considerate leader. During the war of independence, he spent lots of time in visiting and comforting the wounded soldiers which hugely enhanced morale in the army.</p>
