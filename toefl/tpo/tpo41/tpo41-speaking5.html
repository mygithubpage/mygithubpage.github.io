Kate. How is it going?</p><p>Woman:Pretty good. I just found out I'm going to be staying on campus during the semester break. Professor Clark asked me to help him with some research.</p><p>Man:That's a pretty big deal.</p><p>Woman:Yeah. I guess it is, but the problem is: the dorm is always closed. So I need to find housing for about two weeks.</p><p>Man:Oh, that's rough. But didn't you mention that you had a couple of friends that live in an apartment not too far from campus? Are they gonna be around?</p><p>Woman:Yeah. Mary and Alan. They say they are gonna stick around here during the break.</p><p>Man:Well, so why don't you just stay with them?</p><p>Woman:I've been thinking about asking them.</p><p>Man:And they probably wouldn't charge you anything, right? Just for a couple of weeks.</p><p>Woman:Yeah. Probably not. I'm sure they'd be fine with it. But since it's between classes and they won't have classes and stuff, I'm worried that...</p><p>Man:You're afraid that they might want to party too much?</p><p>Woman:Right. They'll be on vacation, but I'll have to get up early in the morning to work all day, so we'll be on completely different schedules.</p><p>Man:Hmm...well, another possibility is that sometimes you can get special permission to stay at the dorm.</p><p>Woman:Really? You mean they'd let me stay in my own dorm room? I wouldn't have to move?</p><p>Man:Well, you would, actually, because they usually only keep one of the dorms open and it's not the one you're in.</p><p>Woman:Hmm... I wonder how much they charge.</p><p>Man:Well, it's not as cheap as staying with friends, but...</p><p>Woman:But it would be quieter...</p><p>Man:True.</p></article><section id="question"><h4>Question</h4><p>The speakers discuss two possible solutions to the woman's problem. Briefly summarize the problem. Then state which solution you recommend and explain why. </p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>In this conversation, the woman is having a hard time dealing with the problem that staying on campus during the semester break, and the dorm is always closed, so she needs to find a place to stay for two weeks. And the man offers her two possible solutions. One is staying with her friends who live in an apartment not too far from campus. The other is the woman can get special permission to stay at the dorm. And if it were my choice, I would choose the latter one, because her friends will be on vacation and they may party too much and the woman will have to get up early in the morning and work all day, so she needs a quiet environment to sleep well. Although staying at the dorm will not as cheap as staying with her friends, at least it'll guarantee her a good environment that suits her situation.</p></article></div></main></body></html>
