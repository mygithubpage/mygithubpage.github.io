Students must work with an assigned partner to select a topic and complete all related research for the project. The partners will orally present their research to the class during the last two weeks of classes. This project will provide students with the opportunity to discover the rewards and challenges of working with another individual, an experience that will help them in future endeavors. Furthermore, these presentations will benefit the entire class: when students share their discoveries with the class, they enable other students to learn from their work.</p></article><div><audio src="tpo41-speaking3.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></div><article id="listening-passage" class="passage"><h3>Listening Text</h3><p>Now listen to two students discussing the assignment.</p><p>Woman:I don't know about this.</p><p>Man:Why not? Sounds okay to me.</p><p>Woman:Thing is: depending on someone else makes me nervous. My roommate had to do a project like this and the other girl didn't show up to meetings, didn't do any research. My roommate had to do everything herself.</p><p>Man:That's a drag. I guess if your partner is irresponsible, you are out of luck.</p><p>Woman:Exactly. It hurt her grade. I don't want the same thing to happen to me. Right now I'm more concerned with getting a good grade even though I know that's not the lesson the professor has in mind.</p><p>Man:Still, it'll be good to listen to everyone's stuff.</p><p>Woman:Well, I don't know. I mean, at the end of the semester, people are focused on studying for exams.</p><p>Man:Yeah.</p><p>Woman:Who has time to put something like this together when they're busy studying?</p><p>Man:True.</p><p>Woman:I can't imagine anyone will be able to really do a good job with it. And everyone will be so preoccupied by then that they probably won't listen anyway. I think the professor's gonna be disappointed. And students...well...we'll all just be frustrated by the whole thing.</p></article><section id="question"><h4>Question</h4><p>The woman expresses her opinion about the assignment. State her opinion and explain the reasons she gives for holding that opinion. </p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>The final project of the woman's course will be an oral presentation which is presented by the students and an assigned partner. And the woman holds a negative view towards the announcement. The first reasons she gives is that depending on someone else is not that reliable and she may get a low grade. And the tragedy happened to her roommate whose partner didn't show up or do any research. And the second one is based on the fact that by the end of semester, everyone will be busy with their exams, they don't have enough energy to do a good job with it and the others won't listen anyway, and it may disappoint the professor. Therefore, she disagrees with that opinion.</p></article></div></main></body></html>
