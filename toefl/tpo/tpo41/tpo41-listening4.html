            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.8" data-time="1.51">[00:01.51]</span>Student:Yes, I'd like to get help with the, you know, payment for my classes, some <span class="underline">sort</span> of <span class="underline">financial</span> aid. <span class="time" data-times="5.06" data-time="8.31">[00:08.31]</span>The problem is I don't know much about it, so I don't really know where to begin. <span class="time" data-times="2.88" data-time="13.37">[00:13.37]</span>I saw this <span class="underline">poster</span> about work-study programs. <span class="time" data-times="1.77" data-time="16.25">[00:16.25]</span>Can you tell me something about that?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.99" data-time="18.02">[00:18.02]</span>Employee:Well, I think you're talking about the <span class="underline">government</span> <span class="underline">sponsored</span> work-study program. <span class="time" data-times="5.65" data-time="23.01">[00:23.01]</span>It works like this: you work on <span class="underline">campus</span> and get paid an hourly wage just like a <span class="underline">regular</span> job. <span class="time" data-times="11.62" data-time="28.66">[00:28.66]</span>However, <span class="underline">instead</span> of getting a paycheck, the money goes directly to your <span class="underline">bill</span> for your courses, but almost all work-study jobs <span class="underline">pay</span> <span class="underline">minimum</span> wage, which is usually <span class="underline">pretty</span> low. <span class="time" data-times="9.51" data-time="40.28">[00:40.28]</span>The truth is: you might do better getting a job off <span class="underline">campus</span> since you can do whatever you want with the money, like paying your rent or...or buying textbooks.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.09" data-time="49.79">[00:49.79]</span>Student:Thanks! That's very useful. <span class="time" data-times="2.66" data-time="51.88">[00:51.88]</span>So how do I find out what's out there?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="11.63" data-time="54.54">[00:54.54]</span>Employee:Let me show you our <span class="underline">catalogue</span> of various programs as well as scholarships offered here. [01.00.24]That's your best <span class="underline">bet</span>1 really, if you can find a good <span class="underline">scholarship</span>, because you don't have to <span class="underline">pay</span> the money back. <span class="time" data-times="4.31" data-time="66.17">[01:06.17]</span>You might <span class="underline">qualify</span> if your grades are good enough or if you have the right background.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.54" data-time="70.48">[01:10.48]</span>Student:Yeah, that sounds like something I should try for.</p>

              <span class="time" data-times="6.04" data-time="73.02">[01:13.02]</span>Employee:Now, this is my desk-copy of the <span class="underline">catalogue</span>, but I can give you your own copy if you want. <span class="time" data-times="3.96" data-time="79.06">[01:19.06]</span>Oh yeah, be sure to visit the university library, too. <span class="time" data-times="4.8" data-time="83.02">[01:23.02]</span>There's a whole <span class="underline">section</span> on <span class="underline">financial</span> aid including <span class="underline">application</span> forms.</p>

              <span class="time" data-times="4.54" data-time="87.82">[01:27.82]</span>Student:Why isn't all the information listed in the <span class="underline">catalogue</span>? It'd be so much easier.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.4" data-time="92.36">[01:32.36]</span>Employee:Oh, if we did that, the <span class="underline">catalogue</span> would be too heavy to pick up. <span class="time" data-times="13.97" data-time="96.76">[01:36.76]</span>City clubs, foundations, organizations from all over the country <span class="underline">offer</span> scholarships or other <span class="underline">financial</span> <span class="underline">assistance</span> to college students and all kinds of companies have programs to help their employees' children go to college. <span class="time" data-times="7.16" data-time="110.73">[01:50.73]</span>If either of your parents works for a large corporation, have them <span class="underline">check</span> to see if their companies do that.</p>

              <span class="time" data-times="2.06" data-time="117.89">[01:57.89]</span>Student:Okay. Good idea. <span class="time" data-times="5.82" data-time="119.95">[01:59.95]</span>Hey, my dad works for a big <span class="underline">accounting</span> <span class="underline">firm</span> and he's a member of a <span class="underline">professional</span> <span class="underline">accounting</span> <span class="underline">organization</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.11" data-time="125.77">[02:05.77]</span>Do you think they'd <span class="underline">offer</span> <span class="underline">financial</span> aid?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.93" data-time="127.88">[02:07.88]</span>Employee:Yes, that's <span class="underline">fairly</span> <span class="underline">common</span>, especially if you are planning to go into <span class="underline">accounting</span>. <span class="time" data-times="1.79" data-time="132.81">[02:12.81]</span>What are you studying?<span class="time" data-times="2.46" data-time="134.6">[02:14.60]</span>What do you plan to do after you graduate?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.46" data-time="137.06">[02:17.06]</span>Student:I want to become a <span class="underline">dentist</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.63" data-time="138.52">[02:18.52]</span>I'm enrolled in a pre-med program for dentistry.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.36" data-time="141.15">[02:21.15]</span>Employee:Okay. So I'd suggest looking in the library for information on organizations that have to do with dentistry. <span class="time" data-times="4.59" data-time="148.51">[02:28.51]</span>Any number of them might <span class="underline">offer</span> scholarships to students planning to join their <span class="underline">profession</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.41" data-time="153.1">[02:33.10]</span>Student:I'll <span class="underline">definitely</span> <span class="underline">investigate</span> that one.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.92" data-time="155.51">[02:35.51]</span>Employee:Great! But be sure to talk to one of our librarians, too. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="159.43">[02:39.43]</span>They get the same questions over and over, so they can <span class="underline">save</span> you a great <span class="underline">deal</span> of time.</p>
