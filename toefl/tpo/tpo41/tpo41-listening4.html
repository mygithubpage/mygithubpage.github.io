            <span class="time" data-times="4.4" data-time="92.36">[01:32.36]</span>Employee:Oh, if we did that, the <span class="highlight">catalogue</span> would be too heavy to pick up. <span class="time" data-times="13.97" data-time="96.76">[01:36.76]</span>City clubs, foundations, organizations from all over the country <span class="highlight">offer</span> scholarships or other <span class="highlight">financial</span> <span class="highlight">assistance</span> to college students and all kinds of companies have programs to help their employees' children go to college. <span class="time" data-times="7.16" data-time="110.73">[01:50.73]</span>If either of your parents works for a large corporation, have them <span class="highlight">check</span> to see if their companies do that.</p>

            <span class="time" data-times="4.93" data-time="127.88">[02:07.88]</span>Employee:Yes, that's <span class="highlight">fairly</span> <span class="highlight">common</span>, especially if you are planning to go into <span class="highlight">accounting</span>. <span class="time" data-times="1.79" data-time="132.81">[02:12.81]</span>What are you studying?<span class="time" data-times="2.46" data-time="134.6">[02:14.60]</span>What do you plan to do after you graduate?</p>

              <span>A. It does not provide as much financial flexibility as a regular job does.</span>

            <div class="explanation">
              <p>From the professor's answer, we can see that the work on the campus will not pay the student's cheque. The tuition fee is directly charged to the course's bill. It is inflexible and the salary is low, so the A option is correct.</p>
