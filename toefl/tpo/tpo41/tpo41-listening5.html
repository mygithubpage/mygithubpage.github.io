As art historians, one of our <span class="highlight">fundamental</span> tasks is to <span class="highlight">assign</span> authorship to works of art, right? <span class="time" data-times="4.02" data-time="7.63">[00:07.63]</span>We're presented with a work of art, and we have to <span class="highlight">figure</span> out who made it. <span class="time" data-times="8.7" data-time="11.65">[00:11.65]</span>But this task becomes particularly difficult when we're dealing with works produced in Italy during the Renaissance, the 16th, 17th centuries.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.19" data-time="20.35">[00:20.35]</span>Now, why is this the case? <span class="time" data-times="3.08" data-time="22.54">[00:22.54]</span>Anyone? Emily.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.98" data-time="25.62">[00:25.62]</span>Student:Urn...is it 'cause artists didn't sign their work? <span class="time" data-times="4.01" data-time="28.6">[00:28.60]</span>I mean, didn't the whole <span class="highlight">concept</span> of the artist as an <span class="highlight">individual</span> developed later? <span class="time" data-times="1.92" data-time="32.61">[00:32.61]</span>In like the 19th <span class="highlight">century</span>?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.83" data-time="34.53">[00:34.53]</span>Professor:Well, you are <span class="highlight">sort</span> of on the right <span class="highlight">track</span>. <span class="time" data-times="15.85" data-time="37.36">[00:37.36]</span>The <span class="highlight">concept</span> of the <span class="highlight">individual</span> artist, especially the <span class="highlight">concept</span> of the artist as an <span class="highlight">artistic</span><span class="highlight">genius</span> struggling alone with a <span class="highlight">vision</span> as <span class="highlight">opposed</span> to...say...a <span class="highlight">mere</span><span class="highlight">artisan</span>...well, the idea of the artist as a lone <span class="highlight">genius</span> didn't develop until later.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.12" data-time="53.21">[00:53.21]</span>But artists, <span class="highlight">individual</span> artists, did sign their work during the Renaissance. <span class="time" data-times="2.95" data-time="58.33">[00:58.33]</span>In fact, you could say that's part of the problem. <span class="time" data-times="6.7" data-time="61.28">[01:01.28]</span>Paintings were signed by the artist and that used to be understood to be a mark of Renaissance's <span class="highlight">individualism</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.05" data-time="67.98">[01:07.98]</span>If a piece had Raphael's signature on it, we <span class="highlight">assume</span> it was done by the great artist himself. <span class="time" data-times="2.99" data-time="73.03">[01:13.03]</span>Raphael, in the singular.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.19" data-time="76.02">[01:16.02]</span>But you see, art in Renaissance Italy was very much a collaborative business. <span class="time" data-times="3.45" data-time="81.21">[01:21.21]</span>Painters and sculptors worked in a workshop. <span class="time" data-times="4.98" data-time="84.66">[01:24.66]</span>It was almost like a small business run by a master artist.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="13.86" data-time="89.64">[01:29.64]</span>You see, to <span class="highlight">deal</span> with a wide <span class="highlight">variety</span> of commissions they received, orders basically, for <span class="highlight">specific</span> types of art, <span class="highlight">specific</span> projects, to <span class="highlight">handle</span> these, master artists often employed assistants as apprentices. <span class="time" data-times="10.12" data-time="103.5">[01:43.50]</span>And this was especially so if they worked on a large <span class="highlight">scale</span>, huge paintings or sculptures, or if they were much in demand, like Raphael, for <span class="highlight">instance</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="1.84" data-time="113.62">[01:53.62]</span>He worked on some large paintings. <span class="time" data-times="2.92" data-time="115.46">[01:55.46]</span>He painted frescos for the Vatican1. <span class="time" data-times="2.75" data-time="118.38">[01:58.38]</span>He also received a great many commissions. <span class="time" data-times="5.3" data-time="121.13">[02:01.13]</span>There's no way he could have completed every part of every <span class="highlight">project</span> all by himself.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.5" data-time="126.43">[02:06.43]</span>Now, these assistants might work for the master artist on a <span class="highlight">temporary</span> or a <span class="highlight">permanent</span> basis. <span class="time" data-times="2.2" data-time="131.93">[02:11.93]</span>And they might also <span class="highlight">specialize</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.42" data-time="134.13">[02:14.13]</span>For example, in Raphael's workshop, which might be called Raphael incorporated, one of the assistants <span class="highlight">specialized</span> in animals. <span class="time" data-times="4.36" data-time="142.55">[02:22.55]</span>He actually painted a good number of the animals in Raphael's art. <span class="time" data-times="7.19" data-time="146.91">[02:26.91]</span>It maybe that a master signing a work was <span class="highlight">simply</span> making a <span class="highlight">declaration</span> that the work met the standards of the shop.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.5" data-time="154.1">[02:34.10]</span>And it wasn't just painters. <span class="time" data-times="2.15" data-time="156.6">[02:36.60]</span>Sculptors also worked together. <span class="time" data-times="6.62" data-time="158.75">[02:38.75]</span>In fact, assistants were <span class="highlight">even</span> more necessary if you were a master <span class="highlight">sculptor</span> because statues take longer to make than paintings. <span class="time" data-times="4.33" data-time="165.37">[02:45.37]</span>And the master had to <span class="highlight">arrange</span> for <span class="highlight">marble</span> to be quarried, things like that.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.65" data-time="169.7">[02:49.70]</span>Perhaps the most collaborative of all was <span class="highlight">architecture</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.73" data-time="174.35">[02:54.35]</span>There we see a real <span class="highlight">division</span> of labor, but with carpenters, masons, unskilled labor just to carry materials to and fro, and so on. <span class="time" data-times="6.01" data-time="183.08">[03:03.08]</span>Plus, of <span class="highlight">course</span>, your skilled artisans who carried out the master <span class="highlight">architect</span>'s design. <span class="time" data-times="3.34" data-time="189.09">[03:09.09]</span>Think of it, like, um, a ballet, you know. <span class="time" data-times="2.13" data-time="192.43">[03:12.43]</span>All the dancers work together. <span class="time" data-times="1.54" data-time="194.56">[03:14.56]</span>There's a <span class="highlight">division</span> of labor. <span class="time" data-times="1.38" data-time="196.1">[03:16.10]</span>People have different roles. <span class="time" data-times="8.29" data-time="197.48">[03:17.48]</span>And in order for the thing to come together, everyone needs to be <span class="highlight">aware</span> of what others are doing and <span class="highlight">coordinate</span> their work and have good timing.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.27" data-time="205.77">[03:25.77]</span>So for <span class="highlight">architecture</span>, it's almost impossible to know who was <span class="highlight">responsible</span> for any <span class="highlight">given</span><span class="highlight">detail</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.13" data-time="213.04">[03:33.04]</span>Was it the master <span class="highlight">architect</span>? <span class="time" data-times="0.99000000000001" data-time="215.17">[03:35.17]</span>The <span class="highlight">mason</span>? <span class="time" data-times="1.32" data-time="216.16">[03:36.16]</span>An <span class="highlight">assistant</span><span class="highlight">mason</span>? <span class="time" data-times="4.05" data-time="217.48">[03:37.48]</span>Maybe it was <span class="highlight">even</span> the <span class="highlight">patron</span>, the <span class="highlight">client</span> who was paying for the art.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.29" data-time="221.53">[03:41.53]</span>Remember, it wasn't yet customary for architects to give their assistants measured drawings to work from. <span class="time" data-times="3.43" data-time="227.82">[03:47.82]</span>Instructions were <span class="highlight">given</span> orally, not in writing. <span class="time" data-times="5.83" data-time="231.25">[03:51.25]</span>So we don't have those documents to tell us what exactly the master <span class="highlight">architect</span>'s plans were. <span class="time" data-times="4.64" data-time="237.08">[03:57.08]</span>The only time we have written records is when the <span class="highlight">architect</span> wasn't actually there. <span class="time" data-times="5.78" data-time="241.72">[04:01.72]</span>Perhaps the <span class="highlight">architect</span> was away on business and had to write out instructions and send them to the shop.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.08" data-time="247.5">[04:07.50]</span>And another thing to think about: What effect do you <span class="highlight">suppose</span> this <span class="highlight">approach</span> would have had on <span class="highlight">innovation</span>?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="8.92" data-time="254.58">[04:14.58]</span>I mean, since the hired artisans had been trained by other artisans, they tended to be trained to use <span class="highlight">traditional</span> styles and techniques. <span class="time" data-times="4.96" data-time="263.5">[04:23.50]</span>So if you're a master <span class="highlight">architect</span>, uh, you've developed your own style. <span class="time" data-times="3.76" data-time="268.46">[04:28.46]</span>Say you're calling for certain <span class="highlight">detail</span> in the building you're designing, right? <span class="time" data-times="6.82" data-time="272.22">[04:32.22]</span>And say this <span class="highlight">detail</span> is different, purposely different, from the established tradition, the established style.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="10.84" data-time="279.04">[04:39.04]</span>Well, most likely when the hired artisans would <span class="highlight">execute</span> the design, rather than follow the intended design, they would <span class="highlight">stick</span> with the more <span class="highlight">traditional</span> style that they were <span class="highlight">familiar</span> with. <span class="time" data-times="4.59" data-time="289.88">[04:49.88]</span>Workers would have to be supervised very closely to prevent this from happening. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="294.47">[04:54.47]</span><span class="highlight">Otherwise</span>, as it often happened, there goes the designer's style and <span class="highlight">creativity</span>.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the
