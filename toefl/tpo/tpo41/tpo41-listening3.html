            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.03" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Professor:It's interesting how much we can learn about <span class="underline">culture</span> in the United States by looking at how Christopher Columbus has been portrayed <span class="underline">throughout</span> United States' <span class="underline">history</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.2" data-time="10.03">[00:10.03]</span>So let's start at the beginning. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.86" data-time="12.23">[00:12.23]</span>Columbus' ships first landed in a...landed in the Caribbean. <span class="time" data-times="2.27" data-time="17.09">[00:17.09]</span>There's some <span class="underline">debate</span> about which island. <span class="time" data-times="10.34" data-time="19.36">[00:19.36]</span>He landed in 1492, but it wasn't until 300 years later in 1792 that his <span class="underline">landing</span> was first commemorated. <span class="time" data-times="3.99" data-time="29.7">[00:29.70]</span>And this was the brainchild of John Pintard. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.19" data-time="33.69">[00:33.69]</span>Pintard was a wealthy New Yorker, the founder of the New YorkHistorical Society. <span class="time" data-times="7.66" data-time="39.88">[00:39.88]</span>And he decided to use his influence and wealth to find a great hero, a <span class="underline">patron</span> for the young country. <span class="time" data-times="2.14" data-time="47.54">[00:47.54]</span>And he chose Columbus. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.16" data-time="49.68">[00:49.68]</span>And in New York, in 1792, the <span class="underline">anniversary</span> of Columbus's <span class="underline">landing</span> was commemorated for the first time. <span class="time" data-times="5.64" data-time="57.84">[00:57.84]</span>Now, other cities, uh,<span class="underline">Philadelphia</span> and Baltimore followed. And... </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.62" data-time="63.48">[01:03.48]</span>Student:But why Columbus? <span class="time" data-times="1.12" data-time="65.1">[01:05.10]</span>And why there? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.85" data-time="66.22">[01:06.22]</span>Professor:Well, to Pintard it was a way to build patriotism in the young,politically fractured country. <span class="time" data-times="9.78" data-time="73.07">[01:13.07]</span>Remember, the United States had only declared its independence from Britain 16 years earlier, and had yet to form a national <span class="underline">identity</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.31" data-time="82.85">[01:22.85]</span>Pintard also had a hand in helping to create Independence Day, you know, July 4th, as a national holiday. <span class="time" data-times="7.67" data-time="90.16">[01:30.16]</span>So you see that he was very involved in creating <span class="underline">sort</span> of a national story for Americans. <span class="time" data-times="13.32" data-time="97.83">[01:37.83]</span>And Columbus, he felt Columbus could become a story that Americans could tell each other about their national origins that was outside of the British <span class="underline">colonial</span> <span class="underline">context</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.34" data-time="111.15">[01:51.15]</span>The United States was in search of a national <span class="underline">identity</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.16" data-time="115.49">[01:55.49]</span>And its people <span class="underline">wanted</span> heroes. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.87" data-time="118.65">[01:58.65]</span>Student:But why not some of the leaders of the <span class="underline">revolution</span>? <span class="time" data-times="1.62" data-time="121.52">[02:01.52]</span>You know, like George Washington. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.88" data-time="123.14">[02:03.14]</span>Professor:The leaders of the <span class="underline">revolution</span> were the natural candidates to beheroes, but many were still alive and didn't want the job. <span class="time" data-times="4.72" data-time="131.02">[02:11.02]</span>To them, being raised to hero <span class="underline">status</span> was undemocratic. <span class="time" data-times="1.87" data-time="135.74">[02:15.74]</span>So Columbus became the hero. <span class="time" data-times="4.81" data-time="137.61">[02:17.61]</span>And the link between Columbus and the United States took hold. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.24" data-time="142.42">[02:22.42]</span>Student:And so what was that link? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="13.56" data-time="145.66">[02:25.66]</span>Professor:Well, Columbus was portrayed as <span class="underline">entrepreneurial</span>, someone who took chances, who took risks, and he was <span class="underline">cast</span> as somebody who was <span class="underline">opposed</span> to the rule of kings and queens. <span class="time" data-times="13.37" data-time="159.22">[02:39.22]</span>Perhaps most of all, Columbus was portrayed as someone who was <span class="underline">destined</span> to <span class="underline">accomplish</span> things, just as America in those early years was coming to see itself as having a great destiny. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.87" data-time="172.59">[02:52.59]</span>Student:But Columbus was supported by the king and queen of Spain. <span class="time" data-times="1.33" data-time="176.46">[02:56.46]</span>He wasn't against them. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.07" data-time="177.79">[02:57.79]</span>Professor:True. To be historically <span class="underline">accurate</span>, the way Pintard thought about Columbus doesn't <span class="underline">match</span> up with the facts of his life at all. <span class="time" data-times="16.1" data-time="185.86">[03:05.86]</span>And I really have to <span class="underline">stress</span> this: the fact that Columbus became the hero of a young country had little to do with Columbus, anything he did, and a lot to do with what was happening in the United States 300 years later. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="11.15" data-time="201.96">[03:21.96]</span>Columbus was extraordinarily <span class="underline">adaptable</span> to the purposes of America's nation builders, people like John Pintard in the early part of the 19th <span class="underline">century</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9.66" data-time="213.11">[03:33.11]</span>And since not a lot of facts were known about Columbus, because writings weren't <span class="underline">available</span> in North America until...until 1816. <span class="time" data-times="6.22" data-time="222.77">[03:42.77]</span>That might have actually helped the <span class="underline">process</span> of adapting him to American purposes. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.04" data-time="228.99">[03:48.99]</span>Student:Since no one knew much about the real Columbus, it was easy to invent a <span class="underline">mythical</span> one? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.96" data-time="234.03">[03:54.03]</span>Professor:Exactly. And this <span class="underline">mythical</span> Columbus, it became a <span class="underline">reflection</span> of the society which chose him. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.37" data-time="242.99">[04:02.99]</span>So in the early <span class="underline">history</span> of the United States, Columbus represented an <span class="underline">escape</span> from the <span class="underline">political</span> institutions of Europe. <span class="time" data-times="5.08" data-time="251.36">[04:11.36]</span>He was the <span class="underline">solitary</span> <span class="underline">individual</span> who challenged the unknown. <span class="time" data-times="7.25" data-time="256.44">[04:16.44]</span>And now there was this new <span class="underline">democracy</span>, this new country in a world without Kings. <span class="time" data-times="4.88" data-time="263.69">[04:23.69]</span>Columbus became <span class="underline">sort</span> of the <span class="underline">mythical</span> founder of the country. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.83" data-time="268.57">[04:28.57]</span>So as historians, we wouldn't want to study these myths about Columbus and mistake them for facts about Columbus. <span class="time" data-times="10.14" data-time="276.4">[04:36.40]</span>But if we are trying to understand American <span class="underline">culture</span>, then we can learn much by studying how America adapts Columbus for its own purposes. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.05" data-time="286.54">[04:46.54]</span>Evaluations of Columbus then will <span class="underline">reflect</span> what Americans think of themselves. <span class="time" data-times="8.58" data-time="292.59">[04:52.59]</span>Oh, there is a <span class="underline">quote</span>, something like, "societies reconstruct their past rather than faithfully <span class="underline">record</span> it." <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="301.17">[05:01.17]</span>And how that <span class="underline">reconstruction</span> takes place and what it tells us, that's something we are going to be paying a lot of <span class="underline">attention</span> to. </p>
