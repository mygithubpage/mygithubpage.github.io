To be historically <span class="highlight">accurate</span>, the way Pintard thought about Columbus doesn't <span class="highlight">match</span> up with the facts of his life at all. <span class="time" data-times="16.1" data-time="185.86">[03:05.86]</span>And I really have to <span class="highlight">stress</span> this: the fact that Columbus became the hero of a young country had little to do with Columbus, anything he did, and a lot to do with what was happening in the United States 300 years later. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="11.15" data-time="201.96">[03:21.96]</span>Columbus was extraordinarily <span class="highlight">adaptable</span> to the purposes of America's nation builders, people like John Pintard in the early part of the 19th <span class="highlight">century</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9.66" data-time="213.11">[03:33.11]</span>And since not a lot of facts were known about Columbus, because writings weren't <span class="highlight">available</span> in North America until...until 1816. <span class="time" data-times="6.22" data-time="222.77">[03:42.77]</span>That might have actually helped the <span class="highlight">process</span> of adapting him to American purposes. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.04" data-time="228.99">[03:48.99]</span>Student:Since no one knew much about the real Columbus, it was easy to invent a <span class="highlight">mythical</span> one? </p><p><span class="time" data-times="8.96" data-time="234.03">[03:54.03]</span>Professor:Exactly. And this <span class="highlight">mythical</span> Columbus, it became a <span class="highlight">reflection</span> of the society which chose him. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="8.37" data-time="242.99">[04:02.99]</span>So in the early <span class="highlight">history</span> of the United States, Columbus represented an <span class="highlight">escape</span> from the <span class="highlight">political</span> institutions of Europe. <span class="time" data-times="5.08" data-time="251.36">[04:11.36]</span>He was the <span class="highlight">solitary</span><span class="highlight">individual</span> who challenged the unknown. <span class="time" data-times="7.25" data-time="256.44">[04:16.44]</span>And now there was this new <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, this new country in a world without Kings. <span class="time" data-times="4.88" data-time="263.69">[04:23.69]</span>Columbus became <span class="highlight">sort</span> of the <span class="highlight">mythical</span> founder of the country. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.83" data-time="268.57">[04:28.57]</span>So as historians, we wouldn't want to study these myths about Columbus and mistake them for facts about Columbus. <span class="time" data-times="10.14" data-time="276.4">[04:36.40]</span>But if we are trying to understand American <span class="highlight">culture</span>, then we can learn much by studying how America adapts Columbus for its own purposes. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.05" data-time="286.54">[04:46.54]</span>Evaluations of Columbus then will <span class="highlight">reflect</span> what Americans think of themselves. <span class="time" data-times="8.58" data-time="292.59">[04:52.59]</span>Oh, there is a <span class="highlight">quote</span>, something like, "societies reconstruct their past rather than faithfully <span class="highlight">record</span> it." <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="301.17">[05:01.17]</span>And how that <span class="highlight">reconstruction</span> takes place and what it tells us, that's something we are going to be paying a lot of <span class="highlight">attention</span> to. </p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the lecture mainly about?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.
