            <b>Navajo Art</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>The Navajo, a Native American people living in the southwestern United States, live in small <span class="underline">scattered</span> settlements. In many respects, such as education, occupation, and <span class="underline">leisure</span> activities, their life is like that of other groups that <span class="underline">contribute</span> to the <span class="underline">diverse</span> social <span class="underline">fabric</span> of North American <span class="underline">culture</span> in the twenty-first <span class="underline">century</span>. At the same time, they have retained some <span class="underline">traditional</span> cultural practices that are <span class="underline">associated</span> with <span class="underline">particular</span> art forms. For example, the most important <span class="underline">traditional</span> Navajo rituals include the production of large floor paintings. These are actually made by pouring thin, finely controlled streams of colored sands or pulverized vegetable and <span class="underline">mineral</span> substances, <span class="underline">pollen</span>, and flowers in <span class="light"><span class="underline">precise</span></span> patterns on the ground. The largest of these paintings may be up to 5.5 meters in <span class="underline">diameter</span> and cover the entire floor of a room. Working from the inside of the design outward, the Navajo artist and his assistants will sift the black, white, bluish-gray, orange, and red materials <span class="underline">through</span> their fingers to create the finely detailed imagery. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> The paintings and chants used in the ceremonies are directed by well-trained artists and singers who <span class="underline">enlist</span> the aid of spirits who are impersonated by masked performers. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> The twenty-four known Navajo chants can be represented by up to 500 sand paintings. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>These <span class="underline">complex</span> paintings serve as memory aids to guide the singers during the performance of the <span class="underline">ritual</span> songs, which can last up to nine days. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p>
          <p>The purpose and meaning of the sand paintings can be explained by examining one of the most <span class="underline">basic</span> ideals of Navajo society, embodied in their word hozho (beauty or <span class="underline">harmony</span>, goodness, and happiness). It coexists with hochxo ("ugliness," or "evil," and "disorder") in a world where opposing forces of <span class="underline">dynamism</span> and <span class="underline">stability</span> create <span class="underline">constant</span> change. When the world, which was created in beauty, becomes ugly and disorderly, the Navajo gather to <span class="underline">perform</span> rituals with songs and make sand paintings to <span class="underline">restore</span> beauty and <span class="underline">harmony</span> to the world. Some illness is itself regarded as a type of disharmony. Thus, the <span class="underline">restoration</span> of <span class="underline">harmony</span> <span class="underline">through</span> a <span class="underline">ceremony</span> can be part of a curing <span class="underline">process</span>.</p>
          <p>Men make sand paintings that are <span class="underline">accurate</span> copies of paintings from the past. The songs sung over the paintings are also faithful renditions of songs from the past. By recreating these arts, which <span class="underline">reflect</span> the <span class="underline">original</span> beauty of creation, the Navajo bring beauty to the present world. As <span class="underline">relative</span> newcomers to the Southwest, a place where their <span class="underline">climate</span>, neighbors, and rulers could be equally <span class="underline">inhospitable</span>, the Navajo created these art forms to <span class="underline">affect</span> the world around them, not just <span class="underline">through</span> the recounting of the actions symbolized, but <span class="underline">through</span> the beauty and <span class="underline">harmony</span> of the artworks themselves. The paintings generally <span class="underline">illustrate</span> ideas and events from the life of a <span class="underline">mythical</span> hero, who, after being healed by the gods, gave gifts of songs and paintings. Working from memory, the artists re-create the <span class="underline">traditional</span> form of the <span class="underline">image</span> as accurately as possible.</p>
          <p>The Navajo are also world-famous for the designs on their woven blankets. Navajo women own the family flocks, control the shearing of the sheep, the carding, the <span class="underline">spinning</span>, and dying of the <span class="underline">thread</span>, and the weaving of the fabrics. While the men who make faithful copies of sand paintings from the past <span class="underline">represent</span> the <span class="underline">principle</span> of <span class="underline">stability</span> in Navajo thought, women <span class="underline">embody</span> <span class="underline">dynamism</span> and create new designs for every weaving they make. Weaving is a paradigm of the <span class="underline">creativity</span> of a mythic <span class="underline">ancestor</span> named <span class="underline">Spider</span> woman who wove the <span class="underline">universe</span> as a <span class="underline">cosmic</span> web that united earth and sky. It was she who, according to <span class="underline">legend</span>, taught Navajo women how to <span class="underline">weave</span>. As they <span class="underline">prepare</span> their materials and <span class="underline">weave</span>, Navajo women <span class="underline">imitate</span> the transformations that originally created the world.</p>
          <p>Working on their looms, Navajo weavers create images <span class="underline">through</span> which they experience <span class="underline">harmony</span> with nature. It is their means of creating beauty and <span class="underline">thereby</span> contributing to the beauty, <span class="underline">harmony</span>, and <span class="underline">healing</span> of the world. Thus, weaving is a way of seeing the world and being part of it.</p>
