          <h4 class="w3-center">Navajo Art</h4>
          <p>The Navajo, a Native American people living in the southwestern United States, live in small <span class="highlight">scattered</span> settlements. In many respects, such as education, occupation, and <span class="highlight">leisure</span> activities, their life is like that of other groups that <span class="highlight">contribute</span> to the <span class="highlight">diverse</span> social <span class="highlight">fabric</span> of North American <span class="highlight">culture</span> in the twenty-first <span class="highlight">century</span>. At the same time, they have retained some <span class="highlight">traditional</span> cultural practices that are <span class="highlight">associated</span> with <span class="highlight">particular</span> art forms. For example, the most important <span class="highlight">traditional</span> Navajo rituals include the production of large floor paintings. These are actually made by pouring thin, finely controlled streams of colored sands or pulverized vegetable and <span class="highlight">mineral</span> substances, <span class="highlight">pollen</span>, and flowers in <span class="highlight question1">precise</span> patterns on the ground. The largest of these paintings may be up to 5.5 meters in <span class="highlight">diameter</span> and cover the entire floor of a room. Working from the inside of the design outward, the Navajo artist and his assistants will sift the black, white, bluish-gray, orange, and red materials <span class="highlight">through</span> their fingers to create the finely detailed imagery. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> The paintings and chants used in the ceremonies are directed by well-trained artists and singers who <span class="highlight"><span class="question2">enlist</span></span> the aid of spirits who are impersonated by masked performers. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> The twenty-four known Navajo chants can be represented by up to 500 sand paintings. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>These <span class="highlight">complex</span> paintings serve as memory aids to guide the singers during the performance of the <span class="highlight">ritual</span> songs, which can last up to nine days. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p>
          <p>The purpose and meaning of the sand paintings can be explained by examining one of the most <span class="highlight">basic</span> ideals of Navajo society, embodied in their word hozho (beauty or <span class="highlight">harmony</span>, goodness, and happiness). It coexists with hochxo ("ugliness," or "evil," and "disorder") in a world where opposing forces of <span class="highlight">dynamism</span> and <span class="highlight">stability</span> create <span class="highlight">constant</span> change. When the world, which was created in beauty, becomes ugly and disorderly, the Navajo gather to <span class="highlight">perform</span> rituals with songs and make sand paintings to <span class="highlight">restore</span> beauty and <span class="highlight">harmony</span> to the world. Some illness is itself regarded as a type of disharmony. Thus, the <span class="highlight">restoration</span> of <span class="highlight">harmony</span> <span class="highlight">through</span> a <span class="highlight">ceremony</span> can be part of a curing <span class="highlight">process</span>.</p>
          <p>Men make sand paintings that are <span class="highlight">accurate</span> copies of paintings from the past. The songs sung over the paintings are also <span class="question6">faithful</span> renditions of songs from the past. By recreating these arts, which <span class="highlight">reflect</span> the <span class="highlight">original</span> beauty of creation, the Navajo bring beauty to the present world. <span class="question7">As <span class="highlight">relative</span> newcomers to the Southwest, a place where their <span class="highlight">climate</span>, neighbors, and rulers could be equally <span class="highlight">inhospitable</span>, the Navajo created these art forms to <span class="highlight">affect</span> the world around them, not just <span class="highlight">through</span> the recounting of the actions symbolized, but <span class="highlight">through</span> the beauty and <span class="highlight">harmony</span> of the artworks themselves.</span> The paintings generally <span class="highlight">illustrate</span> ideas and events from the life of a <span class="highlight">mythical</span> hero, who, after being healed by the gods, gave gifts of songs and paintings. Working from memory, the artists re-create the <span class="highlight">traditional</span> form of the <span class="highlight">image</span> as accurately as possible.</p>
          <p>The Navajo are also world-famous for the designs on their woven blankets. Navajo women own the family flocks, control the shearing of the sheep, the carding, the <span class="highlight">spinning</span>, and dying of the <span class="highlight">thread</span>, and the weaving of the fabrics. While the men who make faithful copies of sand paintings from the past <span class="highlight">represent</span> the <span class="highlight">principle</span> of <span class="highlight">stability</span> in Navajo thought, women <span class="highlight">embody</span> <span class="highlight">dynamism</span> and create new designs for every weaving they make. Weaving is a paradigm of the <span class="highlight">creativity</span> of a mythic <span class="highlight"><span class="question10">ancestor</span></span> named <span class="highlight">Spider</span> woman who wove the <span class="highlight">universe</span> as a <span class="highlight">cosmic</span> web that united earth and sky. It was she who, according to <span class="highlight">legend</span>, taught Navajo women how to <span class="highlight">weave</span>. As they <span class="highlight">prepare</span> their materials and <span class="highlight">weave</span>, Navajo women <span class="highlight">imitate</span> the transformations that originally created the world.</p>
          <p>Working on their looms, Navajo weavers create images <span class="highlight">through</span> which they experience <span class="highlight">harmony</span> with nature. It is their means of creating beauty and <span class="highlight">thereby</span> contributing to the beauty, <span class="highlight">harmony</span>, and <span class="highlight">healing</span> of the world. Thus, weaving is a way of seeing the world and being part of it.</p>

              <p>According to the original "The twenty-four known Navajo chants can be represented by up to 500 sand paintings." It can be seen that there are only 24 Navajo chants and the number is not very large, so the A option is wrong. The original said that the 24 chants could be represented by up to 500 sand paintings, but did not say that each chant corresponds to a sand painting, and therefore the B option is wrong. The last sentence of the first paragraph says "which can last up to nine days." It can be seen that the entire performance time will be as long as nine days, and the D option says the performance time is not long, so the D option is wrong. So the C option is correct.</p>

              <p>According to the original "The paintings of aspiring ideas and events from the life of a mythical hero, who, after being healed by the gods, gave gifts of songs and paintings.", the theme in the sand painting is the life of a mythological hero. The life of a mythical hero corresponds to The lives of heroes in D. So the D option is correct.</p>

              <p>The entire fourth paragraph describes the history and process of Navajo weaving, so the A option is correct. The "emerged from different sheep" of the B option was not mentioned.

            <div class="explanation">
              <p>This question is a vocabulary question. However, it is not possible to choose the answer from the literal meaning alone, but to combine the meaning of the vocabulary in the text. "Ancestor" in the text refers to a mythical figure called Spider who weaves the universe into a net, connects the earth and the sky, and teaches women how to weave. If Spider is a character in reality, then she would not be able to woven a net to connect the earth with the sky. Therefore, A: The previous relatives, though seemingly correct, are wrong in this question because they are mythological and they have no kinship. B: People who have established special traditions in society are mistaken because there is no special tradition established. C: hero, not only has the meaning of a hero, but in fact it also has the meaning of "(the ancient mythology) God Man", so it most corresponds to the image of a mythical character, so the C option is correct. D: People who have made important contributions to society and culture are wrong. Because Spider is a mythical figure, it does not really contribute to society. Therefore, the C option is correct.</p>
