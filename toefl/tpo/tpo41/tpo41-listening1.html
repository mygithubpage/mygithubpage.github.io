              <span class="time" data-times="5.35" data-time="117.45">[01:57.45]</span>Student:I guess that would result in not enough <span class="highlight">tidal</span> water flowing into the marshes to <span class="highlight">maintain</span> the natural <span class="highlight">vegetation</span>, right?</p>

              <span class="time" data-times="3.97" data-time="122.8">[02:02.80]</span>Professor:Exactly, and he'll be looking at how to <span class="highlight">determine</span> the right size. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="126.77">[02:06.77]</span>So I was thinking he might be a good choice for a summer roommate for you.</p>
