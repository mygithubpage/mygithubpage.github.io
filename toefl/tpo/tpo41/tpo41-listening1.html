Reasons the man should work at the field station next summer instead of working independently</p><p>B. Reasons the man should change the focus of his independent study project</p><p>C. Projects that the man has permission to work on next summer</p><p>D. Whether the man would be willing to cooperate on a project with another student</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The professor said that if a student enrolled in the next summer semester program cannot attend, he will be assigned a quota and the student can participate, so the C option is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does Professor Garfield suggest the student do during the spring term?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Take a particular class</p><p>B. Modify his research topic</p><p>C. Pay the field-station program fee</p><p>D. Begin collecting data</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The professor said Professor Garfield suggested that students attend one of his special courses, so the A option is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>What do the student and John Arnold have in common? Click on 2 answers.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They were both on the waiting list for the summer field program.</p><p>B. They will both be doing research involving salt marshes.</p><p>C. They often volunteer to help restore salt marshes.</p><p>D. They live in the same university dormitory.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="BD"><p>Students said they didn't know about John Arnold, but they lived in a dormitory, so the D option was correct.</p><p>The professor said that John Arnold's research topic is similar to that of students, so it can be inferred that it is related to salt marsh, so the B option is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor say is the main topic of John Arnold's research?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Establishing size recommendations for salt marsh habitats</p><p>B. The relationship between bridge size and the flow of tidal waters</p><p>C. How the vegetation of coastal habitats is affected by the restoration of salt marshes</p><p>D. Ways of assessing levels of stress on salt-marsh habitats</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The professor said that the subject of John Arnold's research was the relationship between bridge size and tidal water flow rate, so the B option was correct.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What can be inferred about the student when he says this:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. He cannot participate at the field station because of a prior commitment.</p><p>B. He is unsure if he will earn enough course credits before the summer.</p><p>C. He prefers to do the independent study instead of working at the field station</p><p>D. He thinks he may not have enough time to complete the required work over the summer.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>Students say that the summer semester will be shorter than the normal semester for a few weeks. The implication is that there may not be enough time to complete the research project, so the D option is correct.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
