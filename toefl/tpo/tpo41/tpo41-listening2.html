            <span class="time" data-times="9.86" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Professor: Many organisms have developed the <span class="highlight">ability</span> to <span class="highlight">survive</span> in <span class="highlight">harsh</span> <span class="highlight">environmental</span> conditions: <span class="highlight">extreme</span> heat or cold, or very dry conditions. <span class="time" data-times="2.21" data-time="9.86">[00:09.86]</span>Like plants in the <span class="highlight">desert</span>. <span class="time" data-times="10.55" data-time="12.07">[00:12.07]</span>Your textbook doesn't have much about the specifics on <span class="highlight">desert</span> plants, but I think that <span class="highlight">desert</span> plants are great examples of <span class="highlight">specialized</span> adaptations to <span class="highlight">extreme</span> <span class="highlight">environmental</span> conditions.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.17" data-time="22.62">[00:22.62]</span>So, with <span class="highlight">desert</span> plants, there are basically three different <span class="highlight">adaptive</span> strategies. <span class="time" data-times="5.07" data-time="27.79">[00:27.79]</span>And I should point out that these strategies are not <span class="highlight">specific</span> to any <span class="highlight">particular</span> <span class="highlight">species</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.61" data-time="32.86">[00:32.86]</span>Many different <span class="highlight">species</span> have developed each of the adaptations.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.53" data-time="36.47">[00:36.47]</span>So, first of all, there are succulent plants.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="7.44" data-time="40">[00:40.00]</span>There are many different <span class="highlight">species</span> of succulent plants, but they all can <span class="highlight">absorb</span> and store a lot of water. <span class="time" data-times="5.01" data-time="47.44">[00:47.44]</span> <span class="highlight">Obviously</span>, opportunities to get water in the <span class="highlight">desert</span> are few and far-between. <span class="time" data-times="2.62" data-time="52.45">[00:52.45]</span>Generally rains are light and short. <span class="time" data-times="2.97" data-time="55.07">[00:55.07]</span>So the rain doesn't <span class="highlight">seep</span> too far down into the soil. <span class="time" data-times="5.44" data-time="58.04">[00:58.04]</span>And there's a limited window of time for any plant to get the water before it evaporates.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="14.34" data-time="63.48">[01:03.48]</span>But succulent plants have a spread-out and <span class="highlight">shallow</span> <span class="highlight">root</span> system that can quickly pull in water from the top inches of soil, though the soil has to be saturated since succulents aren't good at absorbing water from soil that's only a little <span class="highlight">moist</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="7.35" data-time="77.82">[01:17.82]</span>Succulent plants also are well suited to retaining water, important in an environment where rainy days are <span class="highlight">rare</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.45" data-time="85.17">[01:25.17]</span>Succulent plants can store water in their leaves, in their stems, or in their roots.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="10.5" data-time="90.62">[01:30.62]</span>And to keep that <span class="highlight">moisture</span> from evaporating in the hot, <span class="highlight">desert</span> Sun, most succulent plants have a <span class="highlight">waxy</span> outer <span class="highlight">layer</span> that makes them almost waterproof when their stomates are closed.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.05" data-time="101.12">[01:41.12]</span>They also <span class="highlight">preserve</span> water by minimizing their surface area. <span class="time" data-times="5.07" data-time="105.17">[01:45.17]</span>The more of the plant that's out in the Sun, the more <span class="highlight">potential</span> there is to lose stored-up water. <span class="time" data-times="4.57" data-time="110.24">[01:50.24]</span>And that means that most succulent plants have few, if any, leaves.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.37" data-time="114.81">[01:54.81]</span>Now, <span class="highlight">besides</span> succulent plants, there're also drought-tolerant plants. <span class="time" data-times="3.38" data-time="121.18">[02:01.18]</span>Drought-tolerant plants are like bears in a way. <span class="time" data-times="2.53" data-time="124.56">[02:04.56]</span>You know how bears mostly sleep <span class="highlight">through</span> the winter. <span class="time" data-times="3.77" data-time="127.09">[02:07.09]</span>They can <span class="highlight">survive</span> without eating because their <span class="highlight">metabolism</span> slows down. <span class="time" data-times="7.51" data-time="130.86">[02:10.86]</span>Well, drought-tolerant plants also go into a <span class="highlight">dormant</span> <span class="highlight">state</span> when resources, in their case, water, run short. <span class="time" data-times="4.07" data-time="138.37">[02:18.37]</span>A drought-tolerant plant can actually dry out without dying.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.13" data-time="142.44">[02:22.44]</span>I said before that most <span class="highlight">desert</span> rains are light and <span class="highlight">brief</span>, but occasionally there is a heavy one. <span class="time" data-times="4.59" data-time="148.57">[02:28.57]</span>Drought-tolerant plants <span class="highlight">revive</span> after one of these <span class="highlight">significant</span> rainfalls. <span class="time" data-times="4.44" data-time="153.16">[02:33.16]</span>And they are able to <span class="highlight">absorb</span> a good bit of the <span class="highlight">rainfall</span> <span class="highlight">due</span> to their deep roots. <span class="time" data-times="7.39" data-time="157.6">[02:37.60]</span>Actually the <span class="highlight">root</span> system for drought-tolerant plants is more <span class="highlight">extensive</span> than the <span class="highlight">root</span> systems of many plants that live in wetter climates. <span class="time" data-times="8.5" data-time="164.99">[02:44.99]</span>Drought- <span class="highlight">tolerant</span> plants can <span class="highlight">even</span> <span class="highlight">absorb</span> water from <span class="highlight">relatively</span> dry soil because of their deep roots in <span class="highlight">contrast</span> to succulent plants.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.69" data-time="173.49">[02:53.49]</span>The third <span class="highlight">adaptive</span> <span class="highlight">strategy</span> is to <span class="highlight">avoid</span> the <span class="highlight">drought</span> conditions <span class="highlight">altogether</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.89" data-time="179.18">[02:59.18]</span>Yes! There ARE plants that do this: <span class="highlight">Annual</span> plants!</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="7.06" data-time="184.07">[03:04.07]</span>An <span class="highlight">annual</span> plant will <span class="highlight">mature</span> and produce seeds in a single <span class="highlight">season</span> that will become the next <span class="highlight">generation</span> of <span class="highlight">annual</span> plants. <span class="time" data-times="7.13" data-time="191.13">[03:11.13]</span>In <span class="highlight">desert</span> conditions, <span class="highlight">annual</span> plants grow in the fall or <span class="highlight">spring</span> to <span class="highlight">avoid</span> the heat of summer and the cold of winter. <span class="time" data-times="6.63" data-time="198.26">[03:18.26]</span>Of <span class="highlight">course</span>, these plants could face a serious problem if a <span class="highlight">particular</span> fall or <span class="highlight">spring</span> happened to be very dry. <span class="time" data-times="4.09" data-time="204.89">[03:24.89]</span>They would have difficulty growing and could die before producing seeds.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.8" data-time="208.98">[03:28.98]</span>But they have a <span class="highlight">mechanism</span> to prevent one year of low <span class="highlight">rainfall</span> from wiping them out. <span class="time" data-times="4.11" data-time="213.78">[03:33.78]</span>Not all seeds an <span class="highlight">annual</span> plant puts out will grow the following year. <span class="time" data-times="4.69" data-time="217.89">[03:37.89]</span>Some seeds <span class="highlight">remain</span> <span class="highlight">dormant</span> in the ground for several years. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="222.58">[03:42.58]</span>It's a type of <span class="highlight">insurance</span> that protects the <span class="highlight">annual</span> plants from a <span class="highlight">season</span> of poor growing conditions, of <span class="highlight">unfavorable</span> weather.</p>
