              <span class="time" data-times="7.97" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Professor:OK. We've been discussing the planets in our <span class="underline">solar</span> system and how some of the ones farthest from the sun were discovered. <span class="time" data-times="5.55" data-time="7.97">[00:07.97]</span>Well, today I'd like to turn to what are called exoplanets and how researchers <span class="underline">detect</span> them. <span class="time" data-times="1.85" data-time="13.52">[00:13.52]</span>Maria?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.99" data-time="15.37">[00:15.37]</span>Student:Exoplanets are planets that <span class="underline">orbit</span> around a star other than our Sun, right? <span class="time" data-times="1.77" data-time="20.36">[00:20.36]</span>They are not in our <span class="underline">solar</span> system.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.57" data-time="22.13">[00:22.13]</span>Professor:Right. <span class="time" data-times="2.19" data-time="23.7">[00:23.70]</span>They have different...what are called "<span class="underline">host</span> stars". <span class="time" data-times="3.24" data-time="25.89">[00:25.89]</span>And the study of exoplanets has been getting more and more <span class="underline">exciting</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.56" data-time="29.13">[00:29.13]</span>Hundreds of them have been discovered so far. <span class="time" data-times="7.54" data-time="31.69">[00:31.69]</span>This is quite <span class="underline">remarkable</span> in view of the fact that the discovery of the first exoplanets was confirmed only in the mid-1990s. <span class="time" data-times="2.94" data-time="39.23">[00:39.23]</span>Now we're finding new ones every few weeks or so.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.54" data-time="42.17">[00:42.17]</span>Student:So, uh, exactly why are we interested in these exoplanets anyway? <span class="time" data-times="2.29" data-time="47.71">[00:47.71]</span>Is it to see if there's life on them? <span class="time" data-times="9.03" data-time="50">[00:50.00]</span>Cuz it <span class="underline">seem</span> to me like the only exoplanets we ever hear about are gas giants like <span class="underline">Jupiter</span> and <span class="underline">Saturn</span> that couldn't possibly support carbon-based life.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2" data-time="59.03">[00:59.03]</span>Professor:OK. Well, let's talk about that.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.24" data-time="61.03">[01:01.03]</span>First, as for discovering life. <span class="time" data-times="5.81" data-time="63.27">[01:03.27]</span>Well, I think that <span class="underline">sort</span> of discovery is <span class="underline">pretty</span> far in the future, but it is an eventual goal.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="14.62" data-time="69.08">[01:09.08]</span>For now, the <span class="underline">focus</span> is on locating planets <span class="underline">within</span> a <span class="underline">host</span> star's so called "habitable zone", a <span class="underline">zone</span> that's a certain distance from its star because only planets <span class="underline">within</span> this <span class="underline">zone</span> could <span class="underline">conceivably</span> support carbon-based life.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.41" data-time="83.7">[01:23.70]</span>So, what would such a <span class="underline">planet</span> need?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="0.61" data-time="86.11">[01:26.11]</span>Student:Water?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.29" data-time="86.72">[01:26.72]</span>Professor:Yes, it need to be the right <span class="underline">temperature</span> to <span class="underline">sustain</span> <span class="underline">liquid</span> water.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.9" data-time="91.01">[01:31.01]</span>Student:And it would need to be a <span class="underline">rocky</span> <span class="underline">planet</span>, I mean, as <span class="underline">opposed</span> to a gas <span class="underline">giant</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.93" data-time="96.91">[01:36.91]</span>Professor:OK, good. An Earth-like <span class="underline">planet</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.61" data-time="99.84">[01:39.84]</span>Now, as to that, there are some recently detected exoplanets that might actually be Earth-like.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.14" data-time="106.45">[01:46.45]</span>For example, there's a red <span class="underline"><span class="underline">dwarf</span></span> star, that's what most stars are,urn...that's called Gliese 581.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.62" data-time="114.59">[01:54.59]</span>Gliese 581 is...well, it's a lot more interesting than that name makes it <span class="underline">seem</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.79" data-time="121.21">[02:01.21]</span>This <span class="underline">host</span> star is considered a near neighbor of our <span class="underline">solar</span> system because it's only about 20 light years away. <span class="time" data-times="3.03" data-time="128">[02:08.00]</span>It's <span class="underline">pretty</span> close by <span class="underline">astronomical</span> standards. <span class="time" data-times="6.03" data-time="131.03">[02:11.03]</span>And being a red <span class="underline"><span class="underline">dwarf</span></span> star, it's small and <span class="underline">relatively</span> cool, at <span class="underline">least</span> compared with the Sun.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.94" data-time="137.06">[02:17.06]</span>And researchers have discovered planets orbiting Gliese 581. <span class="time" data-times="3.19" data-time="142">[02:22.00]</span>These exoplanets have been named, ready? <span class="time" data-times="8.29" data-time="145.19">[02:25.19]</span>Gliese 581 b, c, d, e, in alphabetical order of their discovery.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.95" data-time="153.48">[02:33.48]</span>Gliese 581 d and e are the planets I <span class="underline">wanna</span> <span class="underline">focus</span> on now. <span class="time" data-times="4.4" data-time="158.43">[02:38.43]</span>See, in 2009, a group of researchers made an <span class="underline">announcement</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.74" data-time="162.83">[02:42.83]</span>These two exoplanets: Gliese 581 d and e do have some Earth-like qualities. <span class="time" data-times="4.73" data-time="169.57">[02:49.57]</span>Gliese 581 d had actually been discovered a <span class="underline">couple</span> of years earlier. <span class="time" data-times="9.55" data-time="174.3">[02:54.30]</span>And when its <span class="underline">orbit</span> was originally calculated it was thought to be too far away from its <span class="underline">host</span> star to be warm enough to support a <span class="underline">liquid</span> ocean, let alone carbon-based life. <span class="time" data-times="7.93" data-time="183.85">[03:03.85]</span>But then its <span class="underline">orbit</span> was recalculated and now we see that Gliese 581 d is <span class="underline">within</span> its <span class="underline">host</span>'s habitable <span class="underline">zone</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.14" data-time="191.78">[03:11.78]</span>Student:So it might have an ocean?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.6" data-time="193.92">[03:13.92]</span>Professor:Well, <span class="underline">conceivably</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.23" data-time="195.52">[03:15.52]</span>See, Gliese 581 d weighs 7 times what Earth weighs and it's <span class="underline">unlikely</span> that it's made <span class="underline">entirely</span> of rocks because it's so <span class="underline">massive</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.48" data-time="204.75">[03:24.75]</span>The researchers studying it said that it could have a <span class="underline">rocky</span> <span class="underline">core</span>, an ice <span class="underline">layer</span>, a large deep ocean and an <span class="underline">atmosphere</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6" data-time="213.23">[03:33.23]</span>OK, and there was another <span class="underline">announcement</span> <span class="underline">along</span> with the recalculated <span class="underline">orbit</span> of Gliese 581 d. <span class="time" data-times="6.02" data-time="219.23">[03:39.23]</span>That was the discovery of another <span class="underline">planet</span> in the system, Gliese 581 e. <span class="time" data-times="4.71" data-time="225.25">[03:45.25]</span>Compared with other exoplanets, its <span class="underline">mass</span> is quite small, only about twice that of Earth.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.35" data-time="229.96">[03:49.96]</span>Student:So, is Gliese 581 e a more Earth-like <span class="underline">planet</span>?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.78" data-time="234.31">[03:54.31]</span>Professor:Well, we have to <span class="underline">consider</span> its <span class="underline">orbit</span>. <span class="time" data-times="11.65" data-time="237.09">[03:57.09]</span>Gliese 581 e orbits its <span class="underline">host</span> star in a much shorter period of time than the other planets in the system, meaning it's very close to the star, and <span class="underline">therefore</span> too hot for water, for an ocean.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.84" data-time="248.74">[04:08.74]</span>However, the fact that it's <span class="underline">relatively</span> close to the size of Earth, small, in <span class="underline">astronomical</span> terms, that was <span class="underline">pretty</span> <span class="underline">exciting</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.17" data-time="255.58">[04:15.58]</span>It's <span class="underline">impressive</span> that we have the technology to <span class="underline">detect</span> it and it bodes well for future research. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="260.75">[04:20.75]</span>Who knows what we'll find the more we search.</p>
