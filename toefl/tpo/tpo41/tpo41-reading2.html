            <b>Climate Of Venus</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>Earth has <span class="underline">abundant</span> water in its oceans but very little <span class="underline">carbon</span> <span class="underline">dioxide</span> in its <span class="underline">relatively</span> thin <span class="underline">atmosphere</span>. By <span class="underline">contrast</span>, <span class="underline">Venus</span> is very dry and its thick <span class="underline">atmosphere</span> is mostly <span class="underline">carbon</span> <span class="underline">dioxide</span>. The <span class="underline">original</span> atmospheres of both <span class="underline">Venus</span> and Earth were derived at <span class="underline">least</span> in part from gases spewed forth, or outgassed, by volcanoes. The gases that <span class="underline">emanate</span> from present-day volcanoes on Earth, such as <span class="underline">Mount</span> Saint Helens, are <span class="underline">predominantly</span> water <span class="underline">vapor</span>, <span class="underline">carbon</span> <span class="underline">dioxide</span>, and <span class="underline">sulfur</span> <span class="underline">dioxide</span>. These gases should <span class="underline">therefore</span> have been important parts of the <span class="underline">original</span> atmospheres of both <span class="underline">Venus</span> and Earth. Much of the water on both planets is also thought to have come from impacts from comets, icy bodies formed in the outer <span class="underline">solar</span> system.</p>
          <p>In fact, water probably once dominated the Venusian <span class="underline">atmosphere</span>. <span class="underline">Venus</span> and Earth are <span class="underline">similar</span> in size and <span class="underline">mass</span>, so Venusian volcanoes may well have outgassed as much water <span class="underline">vapor</span> as on Earth, and both planets would have had about the same number of comets <span class="underline">strike</span> their surfaces. Studies of how stars <span class="underline">evolve</span> suggest that the early Sun was only about 70 percent as <span class="underline">luminous</span> as it is now, so the <span class="underline">temperature</span> in <span class="underline">Venus</span>' early <span class="underline">atmosphere</span> must have been quite a bit <span class="underline">lower</span>. Thus water <span class="underline">vapor</span> would have been able to liquefy and form oceans on <span class="underline">Venus</span>. But if water <span class="underline">vapor</span> and <span class="underline">carbon</span> <span class="underline">dioxide</span> were once so <span class="underline">common</span> in the atmospheres of both Earth and <span class="underline">Venus</span>, what became of Earth's <span class="underline">carbon</span> <span class="underline">dioxide</span>? And what happened to the water on <span class="underline">Venus</span>?</p>
          <p>The answer to the first question is that <span class="underline">carbon</span> <span class="underline">dioxide</span> is still found in <span class="underline">abundance</span> on Earth, but now, <span class="underline">instead</span> of being in the form of <span class="underline">atmospheric</span> <span class="underline">carbon</span> <span class="underline">dioxide</span>, it is either dissolved in the oceans or chemically <span class="underline">bound</span> into <span class="underline">carbonate</span> rocks, such as the <span class="underline">limestone</span> and <span class="underline">marble</span> that formed in the oceans. If Earth became as hot as <span class="underline">Venus</span>, much of its <span class="underline">carbon</span> <span class="underline">dioxide</span> would be boiled out of the oceans and baked out of the <span class="underline">crust</span>. Our <span class="underline">planet</span> would soon develop a thick, oppressive <span class="underline">carbon</span> <span class="underline">dioxide</span> <span class="underline">atmosphere</span> much like that of <span class="underline">Venus</span>.</p>
          <p>To answer the question about <span class="underline">Venus</span>' <span class="underline">lack</span> of water, we must return to the early <span class="underline">history</span> of the <span class="underline">planet</span>. Just as on present-day Earth, the oceans of <span class="underline">Venus</span> limited the <span class="underline">amount</span> of <span class="underline">atmospheric</span> <span class="underline">carbon</span> <span class="underline">dioxide</span> by dissolving it in the oceans and binding it up in <span class="underline">carbonate</span> rocks. But being closer to the Sun than Earth is, enough of the <span class="underline">liquid</span> water on <span class="underline">Venus</span> would have vaporized to create a thick cover of water <span class="underline">vapor</span> clouds. Since water <span class="underline">vapor</span> is a greenhouse gas, this <span class="underline">humid</span> <span class="underline">atmosphere</span>-perhaps denser than Earth's present-day <span class="underline">atmosphere</span>, but far less <span class="underline"><span class="underline">dense</span></span> than the <span class="underline">atmosphere</span> that envelops <span class="underline">Venus</span> today-would have efficiently trapped heat from the Sun. At first, this would have had little effect on the oceans of <span class="underline">Venus</span>. Although the <span class="underline">temperature</span> would have climbed above 100° C, the boiling point of water at sea <span class="underline">level</span> on Earth, the added <span class="underline">atmospheric</span> <span class="underline">pressure</span> from water <span class="underline">vapor</span> would have kept the water in <span class="underline">Venus</span>' oceans in the <span class="underline">liquid</span> <span class="underline">state</span>.</p>
          <p>This hot and <span class="underline">humid</span> <span class="underline">state</span> of affairs may have persisted for several hundred million years. But as the Sun's energy <span class="underline">output</span> slowly increased over time, the <span class="underline">temperature</span> at the surface would <span class="underline">eventually</span> have risen above 374°C. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>Above this <span class="underline">temperature</span>, no matter what the <span class="underline">atmospheric</span> <span class="underline">pressure</span>, <span class="underline">Venus</span>' oceans would have begun to <span class="underline">evaporate</span>, and the added water <span class="underline">vapor</span> in the <span class="underline">atmosphere</span> would have increased the greenhouse effect. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>This would have made the <span class="underline">temperature</span> <span class="underline">even</span> higher and caused the oceans to <span class="underline">evaporate</span> faster, producing more water <span class="underline">vapor</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>That, in turn, would have further intensified the greenhouse effect and made the <span class="underline">temperature</span> climb higher still. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p>
          <p>Once <span class="underline">Venus</span>' oceans disappeared, so did the <span class="underline">mechanism</span> for removing <span class="underline">carbon</span> <span class="underline">dioxide</span> from the <span class="underline">atmosphere</span>. With no oceans to <span class="underline">dissolve</span> it, outgassed <span class="underline">carbon</span> <span class="underline">dioxide</span> began to <span class="underline">accumulate</span> in the <span class="underline">atmosphere</span>, intensifying the greenhouse effect <span class="underline">even</span> more. Temperatures <span class="underline">eventually</span> became high enough to "<span class="underline">bake</span> out" any <span class="underline">carbon</span> <span class="underline">dioxide</span> that was trapped in <span class="underline">carbonate</span> rocks. This liberated <span class="underline">carbon</span> <span class="underline">dioxide</span> formed the thick <span class="underline">atmosphere</span> of present-day <span class="underline">Venus</span>. Over time, the rising temperatures would have leveled off, <span class="underline">solar</span> <span class="underline">ultraviolet</span> <span class="underline">radiation</span> having broken down <span class="underline">atmospheric</span> water <span class="underline">vapor</span> molecules into <span class="underline">hydrogen</span> and <span class="underline">oxygen</span>. With all the water <span class="underline">vapor</span> gone, the greenhouse effect would no longer have <span class="underline">accelerated</span>.</p>
