By <span class="highlight">contrast</span>, <span class="highlight">Venus</span> is very dry and its thick <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span> is mostly <span class="highlight">carbon</span><span class="highlight">dioxide</span>. The <span class="highlight">original</span> atmospheres of both <span class="highlight">Venus</span> and Earth were derived at <span class="highlight">least</span> in part from gases spewed forth, or outgassed, by volcanoes. The gases that <span class="highlight">emanate</span> from <span class="question2">present-day volcanoes on Earth</span>, such as <span class="highlight">Mount</span> Saint Helens, are <span class="highlight">predominantly</span> water <span class="highlight">vapor</span>, <span class="highlight">carbon</span><span class="highlight">dioxide</span>, and <span class="highlight">sulfur</span><span class="highlight">dioxide</span>. These gases should <span class="highlight">therefore</span> have been important parts of the <span class="highlight">original</span> atmospheres of both <span class="highlight">Venus</span> and Earth. Much of the water on both planets is also thought to have come from impacts from comets, icy bodies formed in the outer <span class="highlight">solar</span> system.</p><p>In fact, water probably once dominated the Venusian <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span>. <span class="highlight">Venus</span> and Earth are <span class="highlight">similar</span> in size and <span class="highlight">mass</span>, so Venusian volcanoes may well have outgassed as much water <span class="highlight">vapor</span> as on Earth, and both planets would have had about the same number of comets <span class="highlight">strike</span> their surfaces. Studies of how stars <span class="highlight">evolve</span> suggest that the early Sun was only about 70 percent as <span class="highlight"><span class="question4">luminous</span></span> as it is now, so the <span class="highlight">temperature</span> in <span class="highlight">Venus</span>' early <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span> must have been quite a bit <span class="highlight">lower</span>. Thus water <span class="highlight">vapor</span> would have been able to liquefy and form oceans on <span class="highlight">Venus</span>. But if water <span class="highlight">vapor</span> and <span class="highlight">carbon</span><span class="highlight">dioxide</span> were once so <span class="highlight">common</span> in the atmospheres of both Earth and <span class="highlight">Venus</span>, what became of Earth's <span class="highlight">carbon</span><span class="highlight">dioxide</span>? And what happened to the water on <span class="highlight">Venus</span>?</p><p><span class="question5">The answer to the first question is that <span class="highlight">carbon</span><span class="highlight">dioxide</span> is still found in <span class="highlight">abundance</span> on Earth, but now, <span class="highlight">instead</span> of being in the form of <span class="highlight">atmospheric</span><span class="highlight">carbon</span><span class="highlight">dioxide</span>, it is either dissolved in the oceans or chemically <span class="highlight">bound</span> into <span class="highlight">carbonate</span> rocks, such as the <span class="highlight">limestone</span> and <span class="highlight">marble</span> that formed in the oceans.</span> If Earth became as hot as <span class="highlight">Venus</span>, much of its <span class="highlight">carbon</span><span class="highlight">dioxide</span> would be boiled out of the oceans and baked out of the <span class="highlight">crust</span>. Our <span class="highlight">planet</span> would soon develop a thick, oppressive <span class="highlight">carbon</span><span class="highlight">dioxide</span><span class="highlight">atmosphere</span> much like that of <span class="highlight">Venus</span>.</p><p>To answer the question about <span class="highlight">Venus</span>' <span class="highlight">lack</span> of water, we must return to the early <span class="highlight">history</span> of the <span class="highlight">planet</span>. Just as on present-day Earth, the oceans of <span class="highlight">Venus</span> limited the <span class="highlight">amount</span> of <span class="highlight">atmospheric</span><span class="highlight">carbon</span><span class="highlight">dioxide</span> by dissolving it in the oceans and binding it up in <span class="highlight">carbonate</span> rocks. But being closer to the Sun than Earth is, enough of the <span class="highlight">liquid</span> water on <span class="highlight">Venus</span> would have vaporized to create a thick cover of water <span class="highlight">vapor</span> clouds. Since water <span class="highlight">vapor</span> is a greenhouse gas, this <span class="highlight">humid</span><span class="highlight">atmosphere</span>-perhaps denser than Earth's present-day <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span>, but far less <span class="highlight"><span class="highlight">dense</span></span> than the <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span> that envelops <span class="highlight">Venus</span> today-would have efficiently trapped heat from the Sun. At first, this would have had little effect on the oceans of <span class="highlight">Venus</span>. Although the <span class="highlight">temperature</span> would have climbed above 100ï¿½ C, the boiling point of water at sea <span class="highlight">level</span> on Earth, the added <span class="highlight">atmospheric</span><span class="highlight">pressure</span> from water <span class="highlight">vapor</span> would have kept the water in <span class="highlight">Venus</span>' oceans in the <span class="highlight">liquid</span><span class="highlight">state</span>.</p><p>This hot and <span class="highlight">humid</span><span class="highlight">state</span> of affairs may have <span class="question8">persisted</span> for several hundred million years. But as the Sun's energy <span class="highlight">output</span> slowly increased over time, the <span class="highlight">temperature</span> at the surface would <span class="highlight">eventually</span> have risen above 374ï¿½C. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>Above this <span class="highlight">temperature</span>, no matter what the <span class="highlight">atmospheric</span><span class="highlight">pressure</span>, <span class="highlight">Venus</span>' oceans would have begun to <span class="highlight">evaporate</span>, and the added water <span class="highlight">vapor</span> in the <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span> would have increased the greenhouse effect. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>This would have made the <span class="highlight">temperature</span><span class="highlight">even</span> higher and caused the oceans to <span class="highlight">evaporate</span> faster, producing more water <span class="highlight">vapor</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>That, in turn, would have further intensified the greenhouse effect and made the <span class="highlight">temperature</span> climb higher still. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p><p>Once <span class="highlight">Venus</span>' oceans disappeared, so did the <span class="question7"><span class="highlight">mechanism</span> for</span> removing <span class="highlight">carbon</span><span class="highlight">dioxide</span> from the <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span>. With no oceans to <span class="highlight">dissolve</span> it, outgassed <span class="highlight">carbon</span><span class="highlight">dioxide</span> began to <span class="highlight">accumulate</span> in the <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span>, intensifying the greenhouse effect <span class="highlight">even</span> more. Temperatures <span class="highlight">eventually</span> became high enough to "<span class="highlight">bake</span> out" any <span class="highlight">carbon</span><span class="highlight">dioxide</span> that was trapped in <span class="highlight">carbonate</span> rocks. This liberated <span class="highlight">carbon</span><span class="highlight">dioxide</span> formed the thick <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span> of present-day <span class="highlight">Venus</span>. Over time, the rising temperatures would have leveled off, <span class="highlight">solar</span><span class="highlight">ultraviolet</span><span class="highlight">radiation</span> having broken down <span class="highlight">atmospheric</span> water <span class="highlight">vapor</span> molecules into <span class="highlight">hydrogen</span> and <span class="highlight">oxygen</span>. With all the water <span class="highlight">vapor</span> gone, the greenhouse effect would no longer have <span class="highlight">accelerated</span>.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 1, in what major respect are Venus and Earth different from each other?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

To indicate one source of information about the likely composition of the original atmospheres of Venus and Earth</p><p>D. To account for the fact that Earth's water supply no longer comes primarily from impacting comets</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" C"><p>According to the original "These gases should therefore have been important parts of the original atmospheres of both Venus and Earth." the author refers to "<span class="question2">present-day volcanoes on Earth</span>" to explain that the sources in the original atmospheric composition of Venus and the Earth are the foregoing. The "water vapor, carbon dioxide, and sulfur dioxide.", so the C option is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 2, what is one reason for thinking that at one time, there were significant amounts of water on Venus?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Because of Venus' size and mass, its volcanoes probably produced much more water vapor than volcanoes on Earth did.</p><p>B. The low temperature of Venus' early atmosphere can be explained only by the presence of water.</p><p>C. The presence of carbon dioxide in a planet's atmosphere is an indicator of water on that planet.</p><p>D. Venus probably was struck by roughly as many comets as Earth was.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>According to the original "and both planets would have had about the same number of comets strike their surfaces." It can be seen that both Venus and Earth were hit by the same number of comets, the D option was Consensus Conversion, where the same number of comets corresponded. The D option of as many comets as Earth, so the D option is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question4">luminous</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. dense</p><p>B. bright</p><p>C. large</p><p>D. active</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>Luminous, meaning shiny, bright.</p><p>Dense, dense, thick.

Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The first question to be answered is how Earth's atmospheric carbon dioxide either got dissolved in the oceans or got chemically bound into carbonate rocks.</p><p>B. The fact that Earth's abundant carbon dioxide is more often found in carbonate rock than dissolved in the oceans is the answer to the first question.</p><p>C. Earth still has abundant carbon dioxide, but instead of being in the atmosphere it is now dissolved in the oceans or chemically bound into ocean rocks.</p><p>D. The formation of limestone and marble used up the carbon dioxide that was dissolved in Earth's oceans so that only carbon dioxide in atmospheric form remained.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Part of Highlighted means that there is still abundant carbon dioxide on Earth, but now they are no longer in the atmosphere, but are either decomposed in the ocean or entered into carbonate rocks in chemical form. Only the C option complies with the sentence meaning, so the C option is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, what is one factor that kept the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of early Venus relatively low?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The presence of water vapor clouds</p><p>B. The presence of oceans</p><p>C. Rapidly increasing temperatures at ground level</p><p>D. Low atmospheric pressures</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>According to the original "the oceans of Venus limited the amount of carbon dioxide dioxide by dissolving it in the oceans and binding it up in carbonate rocks.", it can be seen that ocean caused lower carbon dioxide content. So the B option is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The phrase "<span class="highlight">mechanism for</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. means of</p><p>B. importance of</p><p>C. need for</p><p>D. benefits of</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="mechanism for A"><p>Mechanism for, means ... way.</p><p>Means of, means ... method.
