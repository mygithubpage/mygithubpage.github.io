Others believe that university money should only be used for academic purposes. Which view do you agree with? Explain why.</p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>In my opinion, the money should be used in entertainment rather than academic purpose. The reasons are as below. To start, college life can be really stressful, students have so many classes and assignments each day, so a little movies or concerts can do a lot good to them. Help them easy up and remain a better mood. So it's a good way to balance their study and life. Furthermore, it'll be healthier to spend their leisure time doing such entertaining things, otherwise, they may stay at their dorm or hang out in the library, which is a little boring, and if the university can hold some interesting events, it'll be a good way to kill time.</p></article></div></main></body></html>
