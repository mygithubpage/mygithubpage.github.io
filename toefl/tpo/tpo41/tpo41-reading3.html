            </span>Bartering was a <span class="highlight">basic</span> <span class="highlight">trade</span> <span class="highlight">mechanism</span> for many thousands of years; often <span class="highlight">sporadic</span> and usually based on <span class="question1">notions</span> of <span class="highlight">reciprocity</span>, it involved the <span class="highlight">mutual</span> <span class="highlight">exchange</span> of commodities or objects between individuals or groups. Redistribution of these goods <span class="highlight">through</span> society <span class="highlight">lay</span> in the hands of chiefs, <span class="highlight">religious</span> leaders, or kin groups. Such redistribution was a <span class="highlight">basic</span> <span class="highlight">element</span> in chiefdoms. The change from redistribution to <span class="highlight">formal</span> <span class="highlight">trade</span>-often based on regulated <span class="highlight">commerce</span> that perhaps involved fixed prices and <span class="highlight">even</span> <span class="highlight">currency</span>-was closely tied to growing <span class="highlight">political</span> and social <span class="highlight">complexity</span> and hence to the <span class="highlight">development</span> of the <span class="highlight">state</span> in the <span class="highlight">ancient</span> world.</p>
          <p>In the 1970s, a number of archaeologists gave <span class="highlight">trade</span> a <span class="highlight">primary</span> role in the rise of <span class="highlight">ancient</span> states. British archaeologist Colin Renfrew attributed the <span class="highlight">dramatic</span> flowering of the Minoan <span class="highlight">civilization</span> on Crete and <span class="highlight">through</span> the <span class="highlight">Aegean</span> to intensified trading contacts and to the <span class="highlight">impact</span> of <span class="highlight">olive</span> and <span class="highlight">vine</span> <span class="highlight">cultivation</span> on <span class="highlight">local</span> communities. As agricultural economies became more <span class="question3">diversified </span>and <span class="highlight">local</span> food supplies could be purchased both <span class="highlight">locally</span> and over longer distances, a far-reaching <span class="highlight">economic</span> <span class="highlight">interdependence</span> resulted. Eventually, this led to redistribution systems for luxuries and <span class="highlight">basic</span> commodities, systems that were organized and controlled by Minoan rulers from their palaces. As time went on, the self-sufficiency of communities was replaced by <span class="highlight">mutual</span> dependence. <span class="highlight">Interest</span> in long-distance <span class="highlight">trade</span> brought about some cultural <span class="highlight">homogeneity</span> from <span class="highlight">trade</span> and gift <span class="highlight">exchange</span>, and perhaps <span class="highlight">even</span> led to <span class="highlight">piracy</span>. Thus, intensified <span class="highlight">trade</span> and <span class="highlight">interaction</span>, and the flowering of specialist crafts, in a <span class="highlight">complex</span> <span class="highlight">process</span> of <span class="highlight">positive</span> <span class="highlight">feedback</span>, led to much more <span class="highlight">complex</span> societies based on palaces, which were the <span class="highlight">economic</span> hubs of a new Minoan <span class="highlight">civilization</span>.</p>
          <p>Renfrew's model made some assumptions that are now discounted. For example, he argued that the <span class="highlight">introduction</span> of <span class="highlight">domesticated</span> vines and olives allowed a <span class="highlight">substantial</span> <span class="highlight">expansion</span> of land under <span class="highlight">cultivation</span> and helped to power the <span class="highlight">emergence</span> of <span class="highlight">complex</span> society. Many archaeologists and paleobotanists now question this view, pointing out that the <span class="highlight">available</span> <span class="highlight">evidence</span> for <span class="highlight">cultivated</span> vines and olives suggests that they were present only in the later Bronze Age. <span class="highlight">Trade</span>, <span class="highlight">nevertheless</span>, was probably one of many variables that led to the <span class="highlight">emergence</span> of palace economies in Minoan Crete.</p>
          <p>American archaeologist William Rathje developed a <span class="highlight">hypothesis</span> that considered an <span class="highlight">explosion</span> in long-distance <span class="highlight">exchange</span> a <span class="highlight">fundamental</span> cause of Mayan <span class="highlight">civilization</span> in Mesoamerica. He suggested that the <span class="highlight">lowland</span> Mayan environment was <span class="highlight">deficient</span> in many <span class="highlight">vital</span> resources, among them <span class="highlight">obsidian</span>, salt, stone for grinding <span class="highlight">maize</span>, and many <span class="highlight">luxury</span> materials. All these could be obtained from the nearby highlands, from the <span class="highlight">Valley</span> of Mexico, and from other regions, if the necessary trading networks came into being. Such connections, and the trading expeditions to <span class="highlight">maintain</span> them, could not be organized by <span class="highlight">individual</span> villages. The Maya lived in a <span class="highlight">relatively</span> <span class="highlight">uniform</span> environment, where every <span class="highlight">community</span> suffered from the same <span class="highlight">resource</span> deficiencies. Thus, argued Rathje, long-distance <span class="highlight">trade</span> networks were organized <span class="highlight">through</span> <span class="highlight">local</span> <span class="highlight">ceremonial</span> centers and their leaders. In time, this <span class="highlight">organization</span> became a <span class="highlight">state</span>, and knowledge of its functioning was exportable, as were <span class="highlight">pottery</span>, <span class="highlight">tropical</span> bird feathers, <span class="highlight">specialized</span> stone materials, and other <span class="highlight">local</span> commodities.</p>
          <p>Rathje's <span class="highlight">hypothesis</span> probably explains part of the <span class="highlight">complex</span> <span class="highlight">process</span> of Mayan <span class="highlight">state</span> <span class="highlight">formation</span>, but it suffers from the <span class="highlight">objection</span> that <span class="highlight">suitable</span> <span class="highlight">alternative</span> <span class="highlight">raw</span> materials can be found in the lowlands. It could be, too, that <span class="highlight">warfare</span> became a <span class="highlight">competitive</span> <span class="highlight">response</span> to <span class="highlight">population</span> growth and to the increasing <span class="highlight">scarcity</span> of <span class="highlight"><span class="question9">prime</span> </span>agricultural land, and that it played an important role in the <span class="highlight">emergence</span> of the Mayan states.</p>
          <p><span class="question11">Now that we know much more about <span class="highlight">ancient</span> <span class="highlight">exchange</span> and <span class="highlight">commerce</span>, we know that, because no one <span class="highlight">aspect</span> of <span class="highlight">trade</span> was an <span class="highlight">overriding</span> cause of cultural change or <span class="highlight">evolution</span> in <span class="highlight">commercial</span> practices, <span class="highlight">trade</span> can never be looked on as a unifying <span class="highlight">factor</span> or as a <span class="highlight">primary</span> agent of <span class="highlight">ancient</span> <span class="highlight">civilization</span>. </span><span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>Many ever-changing variables affected <span class="highlight">ancient</span> <span class="highlight">trade</span>, among them the demand for goods. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>There were also the logistics of <span class="highlight">transportation</span>, the <span class="highlight">extent</span> of the trading network, and the social and <span class="highlight">political</span> environment. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>Intricate <span class="highlight">market</span> networks channeled supplies <span class="highlight">along</span> well-defined routes. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>Authorities at both ends might <span class="highlight">regulate</span> the profits fed back to the <span class="highlight">source</span>, providing the <span class="highlight">incentive</span> for further transactions. There may or may not have been a <span class="highlight">market</span> <span class="highlight">organization</span>. Extensive long-distance <span class="highlight">trade</span> was a <span class="highlight">consequence</span> rather than a cause of <span class="highlight">complex</span> societies.</p>
