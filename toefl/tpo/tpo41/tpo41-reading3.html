Redistribution of these goods <span class="highlight">through</span> society <span class="highlight">lay</span> in the hands of chiefs, <span class="highlight">religious</span> leaders, or kin groups. Such redistribution was a <span class="highlight">basic</span><span class="highlight">element</span> in chiefdoms. The change from redistribution to <span class="highlight">formal</span><span class="highlight">trade</span>-often based on regulated <span class="highlight">commerce</span> that perhaps involved fixed prices and <span class="highlight">even</span><span class="highlight">currency</span>-was closely tied to growing <span class="highlight">political</span> and social <span class="highlight">complexity</span> and hence to the <span class="highlight">development</span> of the <span class="highlight">state</span> in the <span class="highlight">ancient</span> world.</p><p>In the 1970s, a number of archaeologists gave <span class="highlight">trade</span> a <span class="highlight">primary</span> role in the rise of <span class="highlight">ancient</span> states. British archaeologist Colin Renfrew attributed the <span class="highlight">dramatic</span> flowering of the Minoan <span class="highlight">civilization</span> on Crete and <span class="highlight">through</span> the <span class="highlight">Aegean</span> to intensified trading contacts and to the <span class="highlight">impact</span> of <span class="highlight">olive</span> and <span class="highlight">vine</span><span class="highlight">cultivation</span> on <span class="highlight">local</span> communities. As agricultural economies became more <span class="question3">diversified</span> and <span class="highlight">local</span> food supplies could be purchased both <span class="highlight">locally</span> and over longer distances, a far-reaching <span class="highlight">economic</span><span class="highlight">interdependence</span> resulted. Eventually, this led to redistribution systems for luxuries and <span class="highlight">basic</span> commodities, systems that were organized and controlled by Minoan rulers from their palaces. As time went on, the self-sufficiency of communities was replaced by <span class="highlight">mutual</span> dependence. <span class="highlight">Interest</span> in long-distance <span class="highlight">trade</span> brought about some cultural <span class="highlight">homogeneity</span> from <span class="highlight">trade</span> and gift <span class="highlight">exchange</span>, and perhaps <span class="highlight">even</span> led to <span class="highlight">piracy</span>. Thus, intensified <span class="highlight">trade</span> and <span class="highlight">interaction</span>, and the flowering of specialist crafts, in a <span class="highlight">complex</span><span class="highlight">process</span> of <span class="highlight">positive</span><span class="highlight">feedback</span>, led to much more <span class="highlight">complex</span> societies based on palaces, which were the <span class="highlight">economic</span> hubs of a new Minoan <span class="highlight">civilization</span>.</p><p>Renfrew's model made some assumptions that are now discounted. For example, he argued that the <span class="highlight">introduction</span> of <span class="highlight">domesticated</span> vines and olives allowed a <span class="highlight">substantial</span><span class="highlight">expansion</span> of land under <span class="highlight">cultivation</span> and helped to power the <span class="highlight">emergence</span> of <span class="highlight">complex</span> society. Many archaeologists and paleobotanists now question this view, pointing out that the <span class="highlight">available</span><span class="highlight">evidence</span> for <span class="highlight">cultivated</span> vines and olives suggests that they were present only in the later Bronze Age. <span class="highlight">Trade</span>, <span class="highlight">nevertheless</span>, was probably one of many variables that led to the <span class="highlight">emergence</span> of palace economies in Minoan Crete.</p><p>American archaeologist William Rathje developed a <span class="highlight">hypothesis</span> that considered an <span class="highlight">explosion</span> in long-distance <span class="highlight">exchange</span> a <span class="highlight">fundamental</span> cause of Mayan <span class="highlight">civilization</span> in Mesoamerica. He suggested that the <span class="highlight">lowland</span> Mayan environment was <span class="highlight">deficient</span> in many <span class="highlight">vital</span> resources, among them <span class="highlight">obsidian</span>, salt, stone for grinding <span class="highlight">maize</span>, and many <span class="highlight">luxury</span> materials. All these could be obtained from the nearby highlands, from the <span class="highlight">Valley</span> of Mexico, and from other regions, if the necessary trading networks came into being. Such connections, and the trading expeditions to <span class="highlight">maintain</span> them, could not be organized by <span class="highlight">individual</span> villages. The Maya lived in a <span class="question8"><span class="highlight">relatively</span><span class="highlight">uniform</span> environment</span>, where every <span class="highlight">community</span> suffered from the same <span class="highlight">resource</span> deficiencies. Thus, argued Rathje, long-distance <span class="highlight">trade</span> networks were organized <span class="highlight">through</span><span class="highlight">local</span><span class="highlight">ceremonial</span> centers and their leaders. In time, this <span class="highlight">organization</span> became a <span class="highlight">state</span>, and knowledge of its functioning was exportable, as were <span class="highlight">pottery</span>, <span class="highlight">tropical</span> bird feathers, <span class="highlight">specialized</span> stone materials, and other <span class="highlight">local</span> commodities.</p><p>Rathje's <span class="highlight">hypothesis</span> probably explains part of the <span class="highlight">complex</span><span class="highlight">process</span> of Mayan <span class="highlight">state</span><span class="highlight">formation</span>, but it suffers from the <span class="highlight">objection</span> that <span class="highlight">suitable</span><span class="highlight">alternative</span><span class="highlight">raw</span> materials can be found in the lowlands. It could be, too, that <span class="highlight">warfare</span> became a <span class="highlight">competitive</span><span class="highlight">response</span> to <span class="highlight">population</span> growth and to the increasing <span class="highlight">scarcity</span> of <span class="highlight"><span class="question9">prime</span></span> agricultural land, and that it played an important role in the <span class="highlight">emergence</span> of the Mayan states.</p><p><span class="question11">Now that we know much more about <span class="highlight">ancient</span><span class="highlight">exchange</span> and <span class="highlight">commerce</span>, we know that, because no one <span class="highlight">aspect</span> of <span class="highlight">trade</span> was an <span class="highlight">overriding</span> cause of cultural change or <span class="highlight">evolution</span> in <span class="highlight">commercial</span> practices, <span class="highlight">trade</span> can never be looked on as a unifying <span class="highlight">factor</span> or as a <span class="highlight">primary</span> agent of <span class="highlight">ancient</span><span class="highlight">civilization</span>.</span><span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>Many ever-changing variables affected <span class="highlight">ancient</span><span class="highlight">trade</span>, among them the demand for goods. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>There were also the logistics of <span class="highlight">transportation</span>, the <span class="highlight">extent</span> of the trading network, and the social and <span class="highlight">political</span> environment. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>Intricate <span class="highlight">market</span> networks channeled supplies <span class="highlight">along</span> well-defined routes. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>Authorities at both ends might <span class="highlight">regulate</span> the profits fed back to the <span class="highlight">source</span>, providing the <span class="highlight">incentive</span> for further transactions. There may or may not have been a <span class="highlight">market</span><span class="highlight">organization</span>. Extensive long-distance <span class="highlight">trade</span> was a <span class="highlight">consequence</span> rather than a cause of <span class="highlight">complex</span> societies.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">notions</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. ideas</p><p>B. rules</p><p>C. degrees</p><p>D. traditions</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>Notions, concepts, insights, plans.</p><p>Ideas, concept, idea.

The prices of most commodities rose.</p><p>B. Formal trade emerged.</p><p>C. Chiefs became more powerful</p><p>D. Bartering became the preferred means of trade.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>According to the "political and social complexity" in the title, the last sentence is located. According to the original "The change from redistribution to formal trade", the B option is synonymous and the official trade appears, so option B is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question3">diversified</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. organized</p><p>B. selective</p><p>C. varied</p><p>D. efficient</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" C"><p>Diversified, diverse, various.</p><p>Organized, organized, arranged in an orderly manner.

Local community leaders</p><p>B. Olive growers</p><p>C. Minoan rulers</p><p>D. Long-distance traders</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>According to the original sentence "Eventually, this led to redistribution systems for luxuries and basic commodities, systems that were organized and controlled by Minoan rulers from their palaces." We can see that this system is controlled by the Minoan rulers, so the C option is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 2, Renfrew believed that one effect of long-distance trade in the Aegean was</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. a greater effort to control piracy</p><p>B. greater cultural similarity throughout the region</p><p>C. a decline in local olive production</p><p>D. a decline in the use of luxuries for gift exchanges</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>According to the sixth sentence of the original text "Interest in longï¿½-distance trade brought about some cultural homogeneity from trade and gift exchange", where the cultural homogeneity means cultural convergence, and the cultural similarity in the B option agrees with each other, so the B option is correct. .</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 3, what was a major problem with Renfrew's model?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. He overlooked the fact that only the Minoan palaces had access to domesticated vines and olives.</p><p>B. He wrongly assumed that the introduction of domesticated vines and olives led to the cultivation of more land.</p><p>C. Trade in domesticated plants was much more important to the emergence of Minoan palace economies than he thought.</p><p>D. Domesticated vines and olives do not appear to have been available as early as he thought</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>According to the third sentence "pointing out that the available evidence for cultivated vines and olives suggest that they were present only in the later Bronze Age." We can see that the D option is consent to replace. The domestic vines and olives are not what Renfrew envisioned. early. Where they were present only in the later Bronze Age do not appear to have been available as early as he thought. Therefore, the D option is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, which of the following was true about ancient Mayan communities?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They each created their own separate trading networks with communities in the nearby highlands.</p><p>B. They all had many luxury materials that they were able to trade for resources that they lacked.</p><p>C. They all needed to obtain a number of important materials through trade with other regions.</p><p>D. They all gradually reduced their trading activities with communities in the Valley of Mexico and developed trading networks with other regions.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>According to the third sentence of the original "All these could be obtained from the nearby highlands, from the Valley of Mexico, and from other regions," it can be clearly seen that Option C is the agreed replacement, where from other regions corresponds to the other in the C option. Regions. Therefore, Option C is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What can be inferred from the fact that the Maya lived in a "<span class="highlight">relatively uniform environment</span>"?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The communities could not obtain resources they lacked by trading with each other.</p><p>B. The communities' ceremonial centers were all organized in much the same way.</p><p>C. Increased competition between the communities to export their local commodities expanded commercial networks beyond the nearby highlands.</p><p>D. Different communities tended to specialize in the production of different commodities.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="relatively uniform environment A"><p>Because Mayans all live in a relatively unified environment, they certainly cannot trade with each other to obtain the necessary resources, so the A option is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question9">prime</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. low-lying</p><p>B. easily accessible</p><p>C. unused</p><p>D. high-quality</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" D"><p>Prime, the main, the best.</p><p>Low-lying, low-lying.

It restates the hypothesis presented in paragraph 4 and reinforces it with further evidence.</p><p>B. It presents evidence that the hypothesis discussed in paragraph 4 confuses cause and effect.</p><p>C. It presents a critical assessment of the hypothesis presented in paragraph 4.</p><p>D. It explains how the hypothesis discussed in paragraph 4 was initially formulated.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>In the fifth paragraph, the author said that Rathje's hypothesis may explain part of the complex process of Mayan formation, but it also suffers from objections that can find suitable substitutes for raw materials in the lowlands. So it can be seen that the author's attitude is critical, so the C option is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. We now know that ancient trade cannot be considered a main factor in the rise of civilization, because no one aspect of it caused change in culture or commercial practices.</p><p>B. We now know that the growth of civilization was an important factor in causing cultural change and in improving commercial practices.</p><p>C. We now know much more about how ancient trade and commerce led to cultural changes and the evolution of commercial practices.</p><p>D. We now know much more about the main factors and agents that led to ancient civilization, because we know what aspects of trade affected culture and commercial practices.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The highlighted part means that now that we have learned more about ancient exchanges and trade, we know that because no single aspect of trade can be the most important reason for cultural change or evolution in business practices, trade will never be As a unified factor or an important medium for ancient civilization. So according to the sentence stem, only the A option is met.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 6, all of the following statements about trade in ancient civilizations are true EXCEPT</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The spread of trade was influenced by many variables, none of which was the main cause.</p><p>B. Political conditions were more important than demand for goods in the development of trade.</p><p>C. Some markets had clearly established trading routes.</p><p>D. The regulation of profits provided incentives for future trade.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>According to the third sentence of the original text "There were also the logistics of transportation, the extent of the trading network, and the social and political environment." It can be seen that the importance of the commercial network and the social and political environment are parallel and there is no The demand for goods is even more important. So choose the B option.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>But demand for locally unobtainable resources was clearly only a part of the story..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The sentence in option B lists the transport logistics, the extension of the business network, and the social and political environment.

And the A option is too detailed and is not the subject of the article. So the A option is wrong.</p><p>According to the positioning of the 1970s to the second paragraph of the original text, it was found that the typical long-distance trade between Minoan communities and lowland Mayan communities was not mentioned. So the B option is wrong.</p><p>The article does not say that the details in the theory of Renfrew and Rathje are wrong. So the C option is wrong.</p><p>According to the original Trade, nevertheless, was probably one of many variables that led to the emergence of palace economies in Minoan Crete. So the D option is correct.</p><p>According to the original Rathje's hypothesis probably interpreting part of the complex process of Mayan state formation, but it suffers from the objection that suitable alternative raw materials can be found in the lowlands. It could be, too, that warfare became a competitive response to population growth and To the increasing scarcity of <span class="question9">prime</span> agricultural land, and that it played an important role in the emergence of the Mayan states. Which but it suffers from the objection corresponds to the E option has been objected to. So the E option is correct.</p><p>According to the original appearance of one aspect of trade was an overriding cause of cultural change or evolution in commercial practices, trade can never be looked on as a unifying factor or as a primary agent of ancient civilization, and Extensive long-distance trade was a consequence Rather than a cause of complex societies. We know that the F option is correct.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
