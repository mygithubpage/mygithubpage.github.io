              <span class="time" data-times="5.29" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Listen to a <span class="underline">conversation</span> between a student and an employee in the student housing office.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.35" data-time="5.29">[00:05.29]</span>Student:Hi. I'm a first-year student here. <span class="time" data-times="4.31" data-time="7.64">[00:07.64]</span>I, I live in the dorms, and I, well, I like where I'm living now. <span class="time" data-times="4.11" data-time="11.95">[00:11.95]</span>It's <span class="underline">convenient</span> and quiet, but I'm starting to think about where I <span class="underline">wanna</span> live next year.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.74" data-time="16.06">[00:16.06]</span>Employee:Good idea. As a second-year, you have more freedom to choose a place that suits your needs.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.65" data-time="20.8">[00:20.80]</span>Student:Yeah! And I want to make sure that, well, that I <span class="underline">apply</span> in time to get what I want. <span class="time" data-times="6.01" data-time="25.45">[00:25.45]</span>And, um, a friend was telling me about these common-interest houses on <span class="underline">campus</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.98" data-time="31.46">[00:31.46]</span>Employee:Yes. We have a language house, a life science house, a music house...</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.37" data-time="35.44">[00:35.44]</span>Student:Yeah, the music house. <span class="time" data-times="3.35" data-time="36.81">[00:36.81]</span>That's the one I'm interested in, but, um, I'm not a music <span class="underline">major</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.86" data-time="40.16">[00:40.16]</span>I do play an <span class="underline">instrument</span>, but I'm a <span class="underline">history</span> <span class="underline">major</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.1" data-time="43.02">[00:43.02]</span>Employee:Oh, that's not an <span class="underline">issue</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.65" data-time="44.12">[00:44.12]</span>You see, that house isn't just for music majors. <span class="time" data-times="2.09" data-time="46.77">[00:46.77]</span>It's for anyone who's interested in music.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.76" data-time="48.86">[00:48.86]</span>Student:But isn't that everyone?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.59" data-time="50.62">[00:50.62]</span>Employee:Well, maybe. But the house has a performance area and practice rooms. <span class="time" data-times="8.35" data-time="56.21">[00:56.21]</span>So people who choose to live there need to be open to the possibility that there's always <span class="underline">gonna</span> be someone playing something, an <span class="underline">instrument</span>, the radio, <span class="underline">even</span> at <span class="underline">odd</span> times. <span class="time" data-times="1.99" data-time="64.56">[01:04.56]</span>You're <span class="underline">pretty</span> much always <span class="underline">gonna</span> hear music there. <span class="time" data-times="1.5" data-time="66.55">[01:06.55]</span>That might bother some people.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.6" data-time="68.05">[01:08.05]</span>Student:Doesn't bother me. And I'd love to have a place to practice my saxophone without worrying about disturbing people.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.08" data-time="73.65">[01:13.65]</span>Employee:Well, it does <span class="underline">sound</span> like it might be a good fit for you. <span class="time" data-times="2.35" data-time="76.73">[01:16.73]</span>And the house also functions as a social <span class="underline">club</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.23" data-time="79.08">[01:19.08]</span>Student:I know they do activities, but I don't know much beyond that.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.44" data-time="82.31">[01:22.31]</span>Employee:Well, for example, every month, I think it is, there's an informal <span class="underline">concert</span>. <span class="time" data-times="1.78" data-time="86.75">[01:26.75]</span>Any house <span class="underline">resident</span> can <span class="underline">perform</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.12" data-time="88.53">[01:28.53]</span>And remember that big jazz festival at University Park last month?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.01" data-time="91.65">[01:31.65]</span>Student:Of <span class="underline">course</span>. It was amazing. <span class="time" data-times="1.11" data-time="93.66">[01:33.66]</span>The music was great. <span class="time" data-times="2.91" data-time="94.77">[01:34.77]</span>Um, I, I didn't connect it to the music house.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.02" data-time="97.68">[01:37.68]</span>Employee:Not many people do. Anyway, they put on a whole <span class="underline">range</span> of other activities as well. <span class="time" data-times="2.56" data-time="102.7">[01:42.70]</span>Someone at the house could give you more information about those.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.45" data-time="105.26">[01:45.26]</span>Student:So, how do I...UITI, what's the <span class="underline">process</span> for getting a room there?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.58" data-time="109.71">[01:49.71]</span>Employee:You need to fill out an <span class="underline">application</span> form and send it to the house <span class="underline">director</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.1" data-time="113.29">[01:53.29]</span>The form's on the housing department's website. <span class="time" data-times="2.14" data-time="115.39">[01:55.39]</span>But, don't get your hopes up too high. <span class="time" data-times="3.41" data-time="117.53">[01:57.53]</span>They can only accept about 30% of students who <span class="underline">apply</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.03" data-time="120.94">[02:00.94]</span>Student:Oh, wow, I had no idea.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.7" data-time="122.97">[02:02.97]</span>Employee:So, for your <span class="underline">application</span>, it needs to include a <span class="underline">personal</span> <span class="underline">statement</span>, you know, why you're interested in living in the house, how you might <span class="underline">contribute</span> to the group. <span class="time" data-times="1.33" data-time="131.67">[02:11.67]</span>There are guidelines on the form. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="133">[02:13.00]</span>That <span class="underline">statement</span>'s really important, because it's basically how they decide who to accept into the house.</p>
