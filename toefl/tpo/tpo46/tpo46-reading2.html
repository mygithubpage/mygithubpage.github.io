            <b>The Commercial Revolution in Medieval Europe</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>Beginning in the 1160s, the opening of new silver mines in northern Europe led to the minting and <span class="underline">circulation</span> of <span class="underline">vast</span> quantities of silver coins. The <span class="underline">widespread</span> use of cash greatly increased the <span class="underline">volume</span> of international <span class="underline">trade</span>. Business procedures changed <span class="underline">radically</span>. The <span class="underline">individual</span> traveling <span class="underline">merchant</span> who alone handled <span class="underline">virtually</span> all aspects of <span class="underline">exchange</span> evolved into an operation involving three <span class="underline">separate</span> types of merchants: the <span class="underline">sedentary</span> <span class="underline">merchant</span> who ran the "home office" financing and organizing the firm's entire export-import <span class="underline">trade</span>; the carriers who transported goods by land and sea; and the <span class="underline">company</span> agents <span class="underline">resident</span> in cities <span class="underline">abroad</span> who, on the advice of the home office, looked after sales and procurements.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="underline">Commercial</span>
            <span class="underline">correspondence</span>, unnecessary when one businessperson oversaw everything and made direct bargains with buyers and sellers, multiplied. <span class="underline">Regular</span> <span class="underline">courier</span> service among <span class="underline">commercial</span> cities began. <span class="underline">Commercial</span> <span class="underline">accounting</span> became more <span class="underline">complex</span> when firms had to <span class="underline">deal</span> with shareholders, manufacturers, customers, <span class="underline">branch</span> offices, employees, and <span class="underline">competing</span> firms. Tolls on roads became high enough to <span class="underline">finance</span> what has been called a road <span class="underline">revolution</span>, involving new surfaces and bridges, new passes <span class="underline">through</span> the Alps, and new inns and hospices for travelers. The growth of <span class="underline">mutual</span> trust among merchants facilitated the growth of sales on <span class="underline">credit</span> and led to new developments in <span class="underline">finance</span>, such as the <span class="underline">bill</span> of <span class="underline">exchange</span>, a <span class="underline">device</span> that made the long, slow, and very dangerous shipment of coins unnecessary.</p>
          <p>The ventures of the German Hanseatic <span class="underline">League</span> <span class="underline">illustrate</span> these advancements. The Hanseatic <span class="underline">League</span> was a <span class="underline">mercantile</span> <span class="underline">association</span> of European towns dating from 1159. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>The <span class="underline">league</span> grew by the end of the fourteenth <span class="underline">century</span> to include about 200 cities from Holland to Poland. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> <span class="underline">Across</span> <span class="underline">regular</span>, well- defined <span class="underline">trade</span> routes <span class="underline">along</span> the Baltic and North seas, the ships of <span class="underline">league</span> cities carried furs, <span class="underline">wax</span>, <span class="underline">copper</span>, fish, <span class="underline">grain</span>, <span class="underline">timber</span>, and wine. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>These goods were exchanged for finished products, mainly cloth and salt, from western cities. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span> At cities such as Bruges and London, Hanseatic merchants secured <span class="underline">special</span> trading concessions, exempting them from all tolls and allowing them to <span class="underline">trade</span> at <span class="underline">local</span> fairs. Hanseatic merchants established foreign trading centers, the most famous of which was the London Steelyard, a walled <span class="underline">community</span> with warehouses, offices, a church, and <span class="underline">residential</span> quarters for <span class="underline">company</span> representatives. By the late thirteenth <span class="underline">century</span>, Hanseatic merchants had developed an important business <span class="underline">technique</span>, the business <span class="underline">register</span>. Merchants publicly recorded their debts and contracts and received a <span class="underline">league</span> <span class="underline">guarantee</span> for them. This <span class="underline">device</span> proved a decisive <span class="underline">factor</span> in the later <span class="underline">development</span> of <span class="underline">credit</span> and <span class="underline">commerce</span> in northern Europe.</p>
          <p>These developments added up to what one modern <span class="underline">scholar</span> has called "a <span class="underline">commercial</span> <span class="underline">revolution</span>." In the long run, the <span class="underline">commercial</span> <span class="underline">revolution</span> of the High Middle Ages (a d 1000-1300) brought about <span class="underline">radical</span> change in European society. One <span class="underline">remarkable</span> <span class="underline">aspect</span> of this change was that the <span class="underline">commercial</span> classes constituted a small part of the total <span class="underline">population</span>-never more than 10 percent. They exercised an influence far in <span class="underline">excess</span> of their numbers. The <span class="underline">commercial</span> <span class="underline">revolution</span> created a great <span class="underline">deal</span> of new wealth, which meant a higher <span class="underline">standard</span> of living. The <span class="underline">existence</span> of wealth did not <span class="underline">escape</span> the <span class="underline">attention</span> of kings and other rulers. Wealth could be taxed, and <span class="underline">through</span> <span class="underline">taxation</span>, kings could create strong and <span class="underline">centralized</span> states. In the years to come, alliances with the middle classes were to enable kings to weaken aristocratic interests and build the states that came to be called modern.</p>
          <p>The <span class="underline">commercial</span> <span class="underline">revolution</span> also provided the <span class="underline">opportunity</span> for thousands of agricultural workers to <span class="underline">improve</span> their social <span class="underline">position</span>. The slow but <span class="underline">steady</span> <span class="underline">transformation</span> of European society from almost completely <span class="underline">rural</span> and <span class="underline">isolated</span> to <span class="underline">relatively</span> more <span class="underline">urban</span> constituted the greatest effect of the <span class="underline">commercial</span> <span class="underline">revolution</span> that began in the eleventh <span class="underline">century</span>. <span class="underline">Even</span> so, merchants and business people did not run <span class="underline">medieval</span> communities, except in central and northern Italy and in the <span class="underline">county</span> of Flanders. Most towns remained small. The nobility and churchmen <span class="underline">determined</span> the <span class="underline">predominant</span> social attitudes, values, and patterns of thought and <span class="underline">behavior</span>. The <span class="underline">commercial</span> changes of the eleventh <span class="underline">through</span> fourteenth centuries did however, <span class="underline">lay</span> the <span class="underline">economic</span> <span class="underline">foundation</span> for the <span class="underline">development</span> of <span class="underline">urban</span> life and <span class="underline">culture</span>.</p>
