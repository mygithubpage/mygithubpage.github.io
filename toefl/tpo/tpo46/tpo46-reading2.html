The <span class="highlight">widespread</span> use of cash greatly increased the <span class="highlight">volume</span> of international <span class="highlight">trade</span>. Business procedures changed <span class="highlight"><span class="question2">radically</span></span>. The <span class="highlight">individual</span> traveling <span class="highlight">merchant</span> who alone handled <span class="highlight">virtually</span> all aspects of <span class="highlight">exchange</span> evolved into an operation involving three <span class="highlight">separate</span> types of merchants: the <span class="highlight">sedentary</span><span class="highlight">merchant</span> who ran the "home office" financing and organizing the firm's entire export-import <span class="highlight">trade</span>; the carriers who transported goods by land and sea; and the <span class="highlight">company</span> agents <span class="highlight">resident</span> in cities <span class="highlight">abroad</span> who, on the advice of the home office, looked after sales and procurements.</p><p><span class="highlight">Commercial</span><span class="highlight">correspondence</span>, unnecessary when one businessperson <span class="question3">oversaw</span> everything and made direct bargains with buyers and sellers, multiplied. <span class="highlight">Regular</span><span class="highlight">courier</span> service among <span class="highlight">commercial</span> cities began. <span class="highlight">Commercial</span><span class="highlight">accounting</span> became more <span class="highlight">complex</span> when firms had to <span class="highlight">deal</span> with shareholders, manufacturers, customers, <span class="highlight">branch</span> offices, employees, and <span class="highlight">competing</span> firms. Tolls on roads became high enough to <span class="highlight">finance</span> what has been called a road <span class="highlight">revolution</span>, involving new surfaces and bridges, new passes <span class="highlight">through</span> the Alps, and new inns and hospices for travelers. <span class="question5">The growth of <span class="highlight">mutual</span> trust among merchants facilitated the growth of sales on <span class="highlight">credit</span> and led to new developments in <span class="highlight">finance</span>, such as the <span class="highlight">bill</span> of <span class="highlight">exchange</span>, a <span class="highlight">device</span> that made the long, slow, and very dangerous shipment of coins unnecessary.</span></p><p>The ventures of the German Hanseatic <span class="highlight">League</span><span class="highlight">illustrate</span> these advancements. The Hanseatic <span class="highlight">League</span> was a <span class="highlight">mercantile</span><span class="highlight">association</span> of European towns dating from 1159. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>The <span class="highlight">league</span> grew by the end of the fourteenth <span class="highlight">century</span> to include about 200 cities from Holland to Poland. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span><span class="highlight">Across</span><span class="highlight">regular</span>, well- defined <span class="highlight">trade</span> routes <span class="highlight">along</span> the Baltic and North seas, the ships of <span class="highlight">league</span> cities carried furs, <span class="highlight">wax</span>, <span class="highlight">copper</span>, fish, <span class="highlight">grain</span>, <span class="highlight">timber</span>, and wine. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>These goods were exchanged for finished products, mainly cloth and salt, from western cities. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span> At cities such as Bruges and London, Hanseatic merchants secured <span class="highlight">special</span> trading concessions, exempting them from all tolls and allowing them to <span class="highlight">trade</span> at <span class="highlight">local</span> fairs. Hanseatic merchants established foreign trading centers, the most famous of which was the London Steelyard, a walled <span class="highlight">community</span> with warehouses, offices, a church, and <span class="highlight">residential</span> quarters for <span class="highlight">company</span> representatives. By the late thirteenth <span class="highlight">century</span>, Hanseatic merchants had developed an important business <span class="highlight">technique</span>, the business <span class="highlight">register</span>. Merchants publicly recorded their debts and contracts and received a <span class="highlight">league</span><span class="highlight">guarantee</span> for them. This <span class="highlight">device</span> proved a <span class="question7">decisive</span><span class="highlight">factor</span> in the later <span class="highlight">development</span> of <span class="highlight">credit</span> and <span class="highlight">commerce</span> in northern Europe.</p><p>These developments added up to what one modern <span class="highlight">scholar</span> has called "a <span class="highlight">commercial</span><span class="highlight">revolution</span>." In the long run, the <span class="highlight">commercial</span><span class="highlight">revolution</span> of the High Middle Ages (a d 1000-1300) brought about <span class="highlight">radical</span> change in European society. One <span class="highlight">remarkable</span><span class="highlight">aspect</span> of this change was that the <span class="highlight">commercial</span> classes constituted a small part of the total <span class="highlight">population</span>-never more than 10 percent. They exercised an influence far in <span class="highlight">excess</span> of their numbers. The <span class="highlight">commercial</span><span class="highlight">revolution</span> created a great <span class="highlight">deal</span> of new wealth, which meant a higher <span class="highlight">standard</span> of living. The <span class="highlight">existence</span> of wealth did not <span class="highlight">escape</span> the <span class="highlight">attention</span> of kings and other rulers. Wealth could be taxed, and <span class="highlight">through</span><span class="highlight">taxation</span>, kings could create strong and <span class="highlight">centralized</span> states. In the years to come, <span class="question10">alliances</span> with the middle classes were to enable kings to weaken aristocratic interests and build the states that came to be called modern.</p><p>The <span class="highlight">commercial</span><span class="highlight">revolution</span> also provided the <span class="highlight">opportunity</span> for thousands of agricultural workers to <span class="highlight">improve</span> their social <span class="highlight">position</span>. The slow but <span class="highlight">steady</span><span class="highlight">transformation</span> of European society from almost completely <span class="highlight">rural</span> and <span class="highlight">isolated</span> to <span class="highlight">relatively</span> more <span class="highlight">urban</span> constituted the greatest effect of the <span class="highlight">commercial</span><span class="highlight">revolution</span> that began in the eleventh <span class="highlight">century</span>. <span class="highlight">Even</span> so, merchants and business people did not run <span class="highlight">medieval</span> communities, except in central and northern Italy and in the <span class="highlight">county</span> of Flanders. Most towns remained small. The nobility and churchmen <span class="highlight">determined</span> the <span class="highlight">predominant</span> social attitudes, values, and patterns of thought and <span class="highlight">behavior</span>. The <span class="highlight">commercial</span> changes of the eleventh <span class="highlight">through</span> fourteenth centuries did however, <span class="highlight">lay</span> the <span class="highlight">economic</span><span class="highlight">foundation</span> for the <span class="highlight">development</span> of <span class="highlight">urban</span> life and <span class="highlight">culture</span>.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 1, one effect of the increased use of cash was that</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. an individual merchant no longer performed all aspects of trading operations</p><p>B. a company's home office declined in importance</p><p>C. merchants no longer had to transport their goods to distant places</p><p>D. the volume of trade declined in areas lacking silver mines</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>According to Business procedures changed <span class="question2">radically</span>.
