            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.7" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Listen to part of a lecture in a materials science class.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.12" data-time="3.7">[00:03.70]</span>Professor:So what's the first thing that comes to <span class="underline">mind</span> when we talk about uses for <span class="underline">copper</span>? Tammy?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.22" data-time="8.82">[00:08.82]</span>Student:The penny. It's made of <span class="underline">copper</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.65" data-time="10.04">[00:10.04]</span>Professor:Okay, good one. <span class="time" data-times="2.55" data-time="11.69">[00:11.69]</span>But what's a one cent coin <span class="underline">worth</span> these days? <span class="time" data-times="2.07" data-time="14.24">[00:14.24]</span>You might get back change. <span class="time" data-times="9.44" data-time="16.31">[00:16.31]</span>Like if you go to the store and give the <span class="underline">cashier</span> 5 dollars for something that costs 4 dollars 98 cents, you'll get 2 cents back, but 2 cents does not buy much. <span class="time" data-times="8.46" data-time="25.75">[00:25.75]</span>The value of the penny in terms of what it'll buy has gotten so low that there's actually a move afoot to <span class="underline">eliminate</span> the coin from US <span class="underline">currency</span>. <span class="time" data-times="1.09" data-time="34.21">[00:34.21]</span>But there's more to it.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.42" data-time="35.3">[00:35.30]</span>As Tammy implied, the penny looks like it's <span class="underline">solid</span> <span class="underline">copper</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.51" data-time="38.72">[00:38.72]</span>It is <span class="underline">reddish</span> orange with a bright <span class="underline">metallic</span> <span class="underline">luster</span> when it's new, but that's just the <span class="underline">copper</span> plating. <span class="time" data-times="2.24" data-time="44.23">[00:44.23]</span>The penny's not <span class="underline">solid</span> <span class="underline">copper</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.99" data-time="46.47">[00:46.47]</span>In actuality, it is almost 98 percent <span class="underline">zinc</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.48" data-time="49.46">[00:49.46]</span>But <span class="underline">given</span> the rising value of both these metals, each penny now costs about 1.7 cents to produce. <span class="time" data-times="3.5" data-time="58.94">[00:58.94]</span>So it generates what is called <span class="underline">negative</span> Seigniorage.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.64" data-time="62.44">[01:02.44]</span>
              <span class="underline">Negative</span> seigniorage is when the <span class="underline">cost</span> of minting a coin is more than the coin's face value. <span class="time" data-times="14.1" data-time="68.08">[01:08.08]</span> <span class="underline">Even</span> though the penny generates quite a bit of <span class="underline">negative</span> seigniorage, there is <span class="underline">concern</span> that if it's eliminated, we'll need more nickels, because more merchants might start <span class="underline">setting</span> prices in five-cent increments, 4 dollars 95 cents and so on. <span class="time" data-times="4.43" data-time="82.18">[01:22.18]</span>So we need a trusty five-cent piece that can be minted <span class="underline">economically</span>.<span class="time" data-times="7.6" data-time="86.61">[01:26.61]</span> But the <span class="underline">nickel</span>'s <span class="underline">negative</span> seigniorage is <span class="underline">even</span> worse than the pennies. Each <span class="underline">nickel</span> costs the US <span class="underline">mint</span> 10 cents to produce.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.46" data-time="94.21">[01:34.21]</span>Also, some of us are <span class="underline">pretty</span> attached to pennies for whatever <span class="underline">reason</span>, <span class="underline">nostalgia</span>, and then those collectors. <span class="time" data-times="4.9" data-time="100.67">[01:40.67]</span>And people, if they see a penny on the <span class="underline">sidewalk</span>, they'll pick it up and think: it is my lucky day!</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.68" data-time="105.57">[01:45.57]</span>Another <span class="underline">scenario</span> is that, without pennies, merchants, <span class="underline">instead</span> of charging 5.98, might round up the price to an <span class="underline">even</span> five dollars. <span class="time" data-times="1.33" data-time="114.25">[01:54.25]</span>So consumer goods would become <span class="underline">slightly</span> more expensive. <span class="time" data-times="5.91" data-time="115.58">[01:55.58]</span>But on the other hand, some cash transactions would be more <span class="underline">convenient</span> for consumers. <span class="time" data-times="3.68" data-time="121.49">[02:01.49]</span>And as I said, the <span class="underline">government</span> would <span class="underline">save</span> money if pennies were eliminated.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.71" data-time="125.17">[02:05.17]</span>Student:But wouldn't the <span class="underline">copper</span> <span class="underline">industry</span> suffer financially if the US <span class="underline">government</span> stopped buying <span class="underline">copper</span> to make pennies?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3" data-time="130.88">[02:10.88]</span>Professor:But how much <span class="underline">copper</span> do pennies actually <span class="underline">contain</span>?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.96" data-time="133.88">[02:13.88]</span>Student:How much...Oh/ got it, right.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.39" data-time="137.84">[02:17.84]</span>Professor:So what else comes to <span class="underline">mind</span> when you think about <span class="underline">copper</span>? <span class="time" data-times="2.51" data-time="141.23">[02:21.23]</span>What else is <span class="underline">copper</span> used for?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.68" data-time="143.74">[02:23.74]</span>Student:I know that <span class="underline">copper</span> can be shaped into all sorts of things:sheets, tubing, and my cousin's house has a <span class="underline">copper</span> roof.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.12" data-time="150.42">[02:30.42]</span>Professor:Yes, like gold and silver, <span class="underline">copper</span> is extremely malleable, but it's not a <span class="underline">precious</span> metal, it's far less expensive than gold or silver. <span class="time" data-times="7.21" data-time="159.54">[02:39.54]</span>It's also a superb <span class="underline">conductor</span> of <span class="underline">electricity</span> so you can <span class="underline">stretch</span> it into wires which go into appliances and <span class="underline">even</span> car motors.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.25" data-time="166.75">[02:46.75]</span>
              <span class="underline">Copper</span> also has <span class="underline">superior</span> alloying properties, it's...you know, when it's combined with other metals.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.77" data-time="173">[02:53.00]</span>For <span class="underline">instance</span>, how many of you play a <span class="underline">brass</span> <span class="underline">instrument</span>, like a trumpet or a trombone?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.65" data-time="177.77">[02:57.77]</span>Well, <span class="underline">brass</span> is an <span class="underline">alloy</span> of <span class="underline">copper</span> and <span class="underline">zinc</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.95" data-time="181.42">[03:01.42]</span>If your trombone was made of <span class="underline">pure</span> <span class="underline">copper</span> or <span class="underline">pure</span> <span class="underline">zinc</span>, it wouldn't <span class="underline">sound</span> nearly as beautiful as a <span class="underline">brass</span> trombone.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.36" data-time="187.37">[03:07.37]</span>Another <span class="underline">alloy</span>, a <span class="underline">combination</span> of <span class="underline">copper</span> and <span class="underline">nickel</span>, resists <span class="underline">corrosion</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.57" data-time="191.73">[03:11.73]</span>It does not <span class="underline">rust</span>, <span class="underline">even</span> with <span class="underline">prolonged</span> <span class="underline">exposure</span> to water.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.88" data-time="194.3">[03:14.30]</span>Student:But what about the <span class="underline">Statue</span> of <span class="underline">Liberty</span> in New York <span class="underline">Harbor</span>? <span class="time" data-times="2.77" data-time="197.18">[03:17.18]</span>It's made of <span class="underline">pure</span> <span class="underline">copper</span>, but it turned green. <span class="time" data-times="1.79" data-time="199.95">[03:19.95]</span>Isn't that a sign of <span class="underline">corrosion</span>?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.16" data-time="201.74">[03:21.74]</span>Professor:Indirectly. If <span class="underline">copper</span>'s <span class="underline">exposed</span> to <span class="underline">damp</span> <span class="underline">air</span>, its color changes from <span class="underline">reddish</span> orange to <span class="underline">reddish</span> brown.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.73" data-time="208.9">[03:28.90]</span>But in time, a green <span class="underline">film</span>, called a patina, forms and the patina actually serves to <span class="underline">halt</span> any further <span class="underline">corrosion</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.97" data-time="217.63">[03:37.63]</span>It is one <span class="underline">reason</span> that ship hulls are made of copper-nickel alloys. <span class="time" data-times="2.85" data-time="221.6">[03:41.60]</span>These alloys are also hard for the barnacles to <span class="underline">stick</span> to. <span class="time" data-times="6.22" data-time="224.45">[03:44.45]</span>If these little <span class="underline">shellfish</span> <span class="underline">adhere</span> to the <span class="underline">hull</span> of a ship, it produces <span class="underline">drag</span>, slowing the <span class="underline">vessel</span> down.</p>
