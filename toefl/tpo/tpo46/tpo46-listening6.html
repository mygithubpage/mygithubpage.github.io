Click on 2 answers. </p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Reasons for fluctuations in the price of copper</p><p>B. Some important attributes of copper</p><p>C. The production of coins from copper and zinc</p><p>D. The possible future of the United States penny</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="BD"><p>The lecture was divided into two parts. The professor first started with Penny and said that penny's manufacturing cost was relatively high, so his future was controversial and corresponded to the D option; in addition, the professor then went on to further explain some characteristics of copper, corresponding to B. Options.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>What arguments in favor of keeping the penny in circulation does the professor emphasize Click on 2 answers.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Some people are emotionally attached to pennies.</p><p>B. Pennies cost very little to produce.</p><p>C. The price of consumer goods could rise.</p><p>D. The copper industry's profits depend on the production of pennies.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="AC"><p>Professor introduced the reasons for retaining penny, one is: some of us are pretty attached to pennies for whatever reason, nostalgia, shows that many Americans are still nostalgic, corresponding to the A option; second is: consumer goods would become slightly more expensive Since there is no change, the price of many commodities may increase slightly, corresponding to the C option.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor say about the negative seigniorage of the nickel?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The United States government is looking for ways to reduce it.</p><p>B. It is significantly greater than that of the penny.</p><p>C. It is less of a problem than some people believe it to be.</p><p>D. Merchants benefit from it more than consumers do.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The professor said: the nickel's negative seigniorage is even worse than the pennies, that is, nickel is even higher than penny's negative seigniorage, so B is the correct answer.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor mention the trumpet and trombone?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To compare the sound-generating properties of copper with those of zinc</p><p>B. To exemplify the benefits of mixing copper with other metals</p><p>C. To point out that copper can be shaped into a variety of forms</p><p>D. To point out that objects containing copper can shine like gold</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The introduction of trumpets and trombones by professors showed that they were all made of copper-zinc alloys, and if they were made of pure copper or pure zinc, they would actually sound better without alloys, so the correct answer is the B option.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor imply about the green patina that sometimes appears on copper?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It is difficult to remove by conventional means.</p><p>B. It adds to the beauty of objects made of copper.</p><p>C. It serves a useful function.</p><p>D. It reduces the conductivity of copper.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The professor said that the patina thing can prevent further corrosion, so it is very useful and corresponds to the C option.</p></div></div><div class="replay" id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor say this:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. He wants the woman to realize her own mistake.</p><p>B. He wants the woman to support her point with precise numbers.</p><p>C. He realizes he neglected to mention an important detail.</p><p>D. He shares the woman's concern about the copper industry.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The student asked: If the U.S. government stops casting copper, the cast copper industry will not suffer economic losses, but the professor asked: But how much copper does penny actually contain? Apparently the meaning of the professor is very clear. I hope that the students themselves can understand her mistakes. The cast copper industry will not be affected. Corresponding to the A option.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
