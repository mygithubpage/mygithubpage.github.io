lecture in a <span class="highlight">biology</span> class.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="9.08" data-time="3.66">[00:03.66]</span>Professor:I'd like to continue our discussion of animal <span class="highlight">behavior</span>, and start off today's class by focusing on a <span class="highlight">concept</span> we haven't yet touched upon: <span class="highlight">swarm</span><span class="highlight">intelligence</span>.<span class="time" data-times="9.59" data-time="12.74">[00:12.74]</span><span class="highlight">Swarm</span><span class="highlight">intelligence</span> is a <span class="highlight">collective</span><span class="highlight">behavior</span> that emerges from a group of animals like a <span class="highlight">colony</span> of termites, a school of fish, or a <span class="highlight">flock</span> of birds. <span class="time" data-times="5.91" data-time="22.33">[00:22.33]</span>Let's first <span class="highlight">consider</span> the principles behind <span class="highlight">swarm</span><span class="highlight">intelligence</span> and we'll use the ant as our model.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.38" data-time="28.24">[00:28.24]</span>Now, an ant on its own is not that smart. <span class="time" data-times="4.04" data-time="31.62">[00:31.62]</span>When you have a group of ants, however, there you have <span class="highlight">efficiency</span> in <span class="highlight">action</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.83" data-time="35.66">[00:35.66]</span>You see, there is no leader running an ant <span class="highlight">colony</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.01" data-time="38.49">[00:38.49]</span>Each <span class="highlight">individual</span>, each <span class="highlight">individual</span> ant operates by instinctively following a simple set of rules when foraging for food.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.16" data-time="46.5">[00:46.50]</span>Rule number one: <span class="highlight">deposit</span> a chemical marker called a <span class="highlight">pheromone</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.33" data-time="50.66">[00:50.66]</span>And rule two: follow the strongest <span class="highlight">pheromone</span><span class="highlight">path</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.35" data-time="53.99">[00:53.99]</span>The strongest <span class="highlight">pheromone</span><span class="highlight">path</span> is <span class="highlight">advantageous</span> to ants seeking food.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.08" data-time="58.34">[00:58.34]</span>So for example, when ants leave the <span class="highlight">nest</span>, they <span class="highlight">deposit</span> a <span class="highlight">pheromone</span><span class="highlight">trail</span><span class="highlight">along</span> the <span class="highlight">route</span> they take. <span class="time" data-times="5.76" data-time="64.42">[01:04.42]</span>If they find food, they return to the <span class="highlight">nest</span> on the same <span class="highlight">path</span>, and the <span class="highlight">pheromone</span><span class="highlight">trail</span> gets stronger. <span class="time" data-times="1.5" data-time="70.18">[01:10.18]</span>It's doubled in strength. <span class="time" data-times="8.32" data-time="71.68">[01:11.68]</span>Because an ant that took a shorter <span class="highlight">path</span> returns first, its <span class="highlight">pheromone</span><span class="highlight">trail</span> is stronger and other ants will follow it according to rule two. <span class="time" data-times="4.61" data-time="80">[01:20.00]</span>And as more ants travel that <span class="highlight">path</span> the <span class="highlight">pheromone</span><span class="highlight">trail</span> gets <span class="highlight">even</span> stronger.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="1.79" data-time="84.61">[01:24.61]</span>So what's happening here? <span class="time" data-times="2.67" data-time="86.4">[01:26.40]</span>Each ant follows two very <span class="highlight">basic</span> rules. <span class="time" data-times="5.55" data-time="89.07">[01:29.07]</span>And each ant acts on information it finds in its <span class="highlight">immediate</span><span class="highlight">local</span> environment. <span class="time" data-times="12.78" data-time="94.62">[01:34.62]</span>And it's important to note, <span class="highlight">even</span> though none of the <span class="highlight">individual</span> ants is <span class="highlight">aware</span> of the bigger plan, they <span class="highlight">collectively</span> choose the shortest <span class="highlight">path</span> between the <span class="highlight">nest</span> and the food <span class="highlight">source</span>, because it's the most reinforced <span class="highlight">path</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.51" data-time="107.4">[01:47.40]</span>By the way, a few you have asked me about the <span class="highlight">relevance</span> of what we are studying to everyday life. <span class="time" data-times="5.81" data-time="112.91">[01:52.91]</span>And <span class="highlight">swarm</span><span class="highlight">intelligence</span> offers several good examples of how concepts in <span class="highlight">biology</span> can be applied to other fields.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.98" data-time="118.72">[01:58.72]</span>Well, businesses have been able to use this <span class="highlight">approach</span> of following simple rules when designing <span class="highlight">complex</span> systems. <span class="time" data-times="8.64" data-time="125.7">[02:05.70]</span>For <span class="highlight">instance</span>, in telephone networks, when a call is placed from one city to another, it has to connect <span class="highlight">through</span> a number of nodes <span class="highlight">along</span> the way. <span class="time" data-times="4.77" data-time="134.34">[02:14.34]</span>At each point, a decision has to be made: which direction does the call go from here?<span class="time" data-times="7.55" data-time="139.11">[02:19.11]</span>Well, a computer program was developed to answer this question based on rules that are <span class="highlight">similar</span> to the ones that ants use to find food. <span class="time" data-times="5.72" data-time="146.66">[02:26.66]</span>Remember, <span class="highlight">individual</span> ants <span class="highlight">deposit</span> pheromones and they follow the <span class="highlight">path</span> that is most reinforced.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="10.33" data-time="152.38">[02:32.38]</span>Now, in the phone network, a computer monitors the connection speed of each <span class="highlight">path</span> and identifies the paths that are currently the fastest, the <span class="highlight">least</span> crowded parts of the network. <span class="time" data-times="5.43" data-time="162.71">[02:42.71]</span>And this information, <span class="highlight">converted</span> into a numeric <span class="highlight">code</span>, is deposited at the network nodes. <span class="time" data-times="4.7" data-time="168.14">[02:48.14]</span>This reinforces the paths that are <span class="highlight">least</span> crowded at the moment. <span class="time" data-times="5.79" data-time="172.84">[02:52.84]</span>The rule the telephone network follows is to always select the <span class="highlight">path</span> that is most reinforced. <span class="time" data-times="7.17" data-time="178.63">[02:58.63]</span>So <span class="highlight">similar</span> to the ant's <span class="highlight">behavior</span>, at each <span class="highlight">intermediate</span> node, the call follows the <span class="highlight">path</span> that is most reinforced. <span class="time" data-times="5.82" data-time="185.8">[03:05.80]</span>This leads to an <span class="highlight">outcome</span> which is <span class="highlight">beneficial</span> to the network as a whole and calls get <span class="highlight">through</span> faster.<span class="time" data-times="8.04" data-time="191.62">[03:11.62]</span>But getting back to animal <span class="highlight">behavior</span>, another example of <span class="highlight">swarm</span><span class="highlight">intelligence</span> is the way flocks of birds are able to fly together so cohesively. <span class="time" data-times="3.92" data-time="199.66">[03:19.66]</span>How do they <span class="highlight">coordinate</span> their movements and know where they're supposed to be?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.09" data-time="203.58">[03:23.58]</span>Well, it basically boils down to three rules that each bird seems to follow.<span class="time" data-times="3.08" data-time="208.67">[03:28.67]</span>Rule one: stay close to nearby birds.<span class="time" data-times="4.12" data-time="211.75">[03:31.75]</span>Rule two: <span class="highlight">avoid</span><span class="highlight">collision</span> with nearby birds.<span class="time" data-times="5.7" data-time="215.87">[03:35.87]</span>And rule three: move in the <span class="highlight">average</span> speed and direction of nearby birds.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="10.47" data-time="221.57">[03:41.57]</span>Oh, and by the way, if you're wondering how this <span class="highlight">approach</span> can be of <span class="highlight">practical</span> use for humans, the movie industry's been trying create computer-generated flocks of birds in movie scenes.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.04" data-time="232.04">[03:52.04]</span>The question was: how to do it easily on a large <span class="highlight">scale</span>? <span class="time" data-times="5.62" data-time="236.08">[03:56.08]</span>A researcher used these three rules in a computer <span class="highlight">graphics</span> program, and it worked. <span class="time" data-times="6.99" data-time="241.7">[04:01.70]</span>There have also been attempts to create computer-generated crowds of people using this bird flocking model of <span class="highlight">swarm</span><span class="highlight">intelligence</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.1" data-time="248.69">[04:08.69]</span>However, I'm not surprised that more research is needed. <span class="time" data-times="7.69" data-time="252.79">[04:12.79]</span>The three rules I mentioned might be great for bird simulations, but they don't take into <span class="highlight">account</span> the <span class="highlight">complexity</span> and unpredictability of human <span class="highlight">behavior</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="260.48">[04:20.48]</span>So, if you want to create crowds of people in a <span class="highlight">realistic</span> way, that computer model might be too limited.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the lecture mainly about?</p></div><div

Ants usually take a different path when they return to their nest.</p><p>B. Ants leave chemical trails when they are outside the nest.</p><p>C. Small groups of ants search in different locations.</p><p>D. Ants leave pieces of food along the path as markers.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The professor introduced that ants follow two rules to feed on food. When ants leave the nest, they leave traces of pheromone as they go along, and they will continue to increase pheromones so that all ants pass through the shortest path. Find food and go back. Correspond to B option.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>What are two principles of swarm intelligence based on the ant example?
