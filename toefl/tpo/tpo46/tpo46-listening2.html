              <span class="time" data-times="3.66" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Listen to part of a lecture in a <span class="underline">biology</span> class.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.08" data-time="3.66">[00:03.66]</span>Professor:I'd like to continue our discussion of animal <span class="underline">behavior</span>, and start off today's class by focusing on a <span class="underline">concept</span> we haven't yet touched upon: <span class="underline">swarm</span> <span class="underline">intelligence</span>.<span class="time" data-times="9.59" data-time="12.74">[00:12.74]</span> <span class="underline">Swarm</span> <span class="underline">intelligence</span> is a <span class="underline">collective</span> <span class="underline">behavior</span> that emerges from a group of animals like a <span class="underline">colony</span> of termites, a school of fish, or a <span class="underline">flock</span> of birds. <span class="time" data-times="5.91" data-time="22.33">[00:22.33]</span>Let's first <span class="underline">consider</span> the principles behind <span class="underline">swarm</span> <span class="underline">intelligence</span> and we'll use the ant as our model.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.38" data-time="28.24">[00:28.24]</span>Now, an ant on its own is not that smart. <span class="time" data-times="4.04" data-time="31.62">[00:31.62]</span>When you have a group of ants, however, there you have <span class="underline">efficiency</span> in <span class="underline">action</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.83" data-time="35.66">[00:35.66]</span>You see, there is no leader running an ant <span class="underline">colony</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.01" data-time="38.49">[00:38.49]</span>Each <span class="underline">individual</span>, each <span class="underline">individual</span> ant operates by instinctively following a simple set of rules when foraging for food.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.16" data-time="46.5">[00:46.50]</span>Rule number one: <span class="underline">deposit</span> a chemical marker called a <span class="underline">pheromone</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.33" data-time="50.66">[00:50.66]</span>And rule two: follow the strongest <span class="underline">pheromone</span> <span class="underline">path</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.35" data-time="53.99">[00:53.99]</span>The strongest <span class="underline">pheromone</span> <span class="underline">path</span> is <span class="underline">advantageous</span> to ants seeking food.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.08" data-time="58.34">[00:58.34]</span>So for example, when ants leave the <span class="underline">nest</span>, they <span class="underline">deposit</span> a <span class="underline">pheromone</span> <span class="underline">trail</span> <span class="underline">along</span> the <span class="underline">route</span> they take. <span class="time" data-times="5.76" data-time="64.42">[01:04.42]</span>If they find food, they return to the <span class="underline">nest</span> on the same <span class="underline">path</span>, and the <span class="underline">pheromone</span> <span class="underline">trail</span> gets stronger. <span class="time" data-times="1.5" data-time="70.18">[01:10.18]</span>It's doubled in strength. <span class="time" data-times="8.32" data-time="71.68">[01:11.68]</span>Because an ant that took a shorter <span class="underline">path</span> returns first, its <span class="underline">pheromone</span> <span class="underline">trail</span> is stronger and other ants will follow it according to rule two. <span class="time" data-times="4.61" data-time="80">[01:20.00]</span>And as more ants travel that <span class="underline">path</span> the <span class="underline">pheromone</span> <span class="underline">trail</span> gets <span class="underline">even</span> stronger.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.79" data-time="84.61">[01:24.61]</span>So what's happening here? <span class="time" data-times="2.67" data-time="86.4">[01:26.40]</span>Each ant follows two very <span class="underline">basic</span> rules. <span class="time" data-times="5.55" data-time="89.07">[01:29.07]</span>And each ant acts on information it finds in its <span class="underline">immediate</span> <span class="underline">local</span> environment. <span class="time" data-times="12.78" data-time="94.62">[01:34.62]</span>And it's important to note, <span class="underline">even</span> though none of the <span class="underline">individual</span> ants is <span class="underline">aware</span> of the bigger plan, they <span class="underline">collectively</span> choose the shortest <span class="underline">path</span> between the <span class="underline">nest</span> and the food <span class="underline">source</span>, because it's the most reinforced <span class="underline">path</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.51" data-time="107.4">[01:47.40]</span>By the way, a few you have asked me about the <span class="underline">relevance</span> of what we are studying to everyday life. <span class="time" data-times="5.81" data-time="112.91">[01:52.91]</span>And <span class="underline">swarm</span> <span class="underline">intelligence</span> offers several good examples of how concepts in <span class="underline">biology</span> can be applied to other fields.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.98" data-time="118.72">[01:58.72]</span>Well, businesses have been able to use this <span class="underline">approach</span> of following simple rules when designing <span class="underline">complex</span> systems. <span class="time" data-times="8.64" data-time="125.7">[02:05.70]</span>For <span class="underline">instance</span>, in telephone networks, when a call is placed from one city to another, it has to connect <span class="underline">through</span> a number of nodes <span class="underline">along</span> the way. <span class="time" data-times="4.77" data-time="134.34">[02:14.34]</span>At each point, a decision has to be made: which direction does the call go from here?<span class="time" data-times="7.55" data-time="139.11">[02:19.11]</span>Well, a computer program was developed to answer this question based on rules that are <span class="underline">similar</span> to the ones that ants use to find food. <span class="time" data-times="5.72" data-time="146.66">[02:26.66]</span>Remember, <span class="underline">individual</span> ants <span class="underline">deposit</span> pheromones and they follow the <span class="underline">path</span> that is most reinforced.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.33" data-time="152.38">[02:32.38]</span>Now, in the phone network, a computer monitors the connection speed of each <span class="underline">path</span> and identifies the paths that are currently the fastest, the <span class="underline">least</span> crowded parts of the network. <span class="time" data-times="5.43" data-time="162.71">[02:42.71]</span>And this information, <span class="underline">converted</span> into a numeric <span class="underline">code</span>, is deposited at the network nodes. <span class="time" data-times="4.7" data-time="168.14">[02:48.14]</span>This reinforces the paths that are <span class="underline">least</span> crowded at the moment. <span class="time" data-times="5.79" data-time="172.84">[02:52.84]</span>The rule the telephone network follows is to always select the <span class="underline">path</span> that is most reinforced. <span class="time" data-times="7.17" data-time="178.63">[02:58.63]</span>So <span class="underline">similar</span> to the ant's <span class="underline">behavior</span>, at each <span class="underline">intermediate</span> node, the call follows the <span class="underline">path</span> that is most reinforced. <span class="time" data-times="5.82" data-time="185.8">[03:05.80]</span>This leads to an <span class="underline">outcome</span> which is <span class="underline">beneficial</span> to the network as a whole and calls get <span class="underline">through</span> faster.<span class="time" data-times="8.04" data-time="191.62">[03:11.62]</span>But getting back to animal <span class="underline">behavior</span>, another example of <span class="underline">swarm</span> <span class="underline">intelligence</span> is the way flocks of birds are able to fly together so cohesively. <span class="time" data-times="3.92" data-time="199.66">[03:19.66]</span>How do they <span class="underline">coordinate</span> their movements and know where they're supposed to be?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.09" data-time="203.58">[03:23.58]</span>Well, it basically boils down to three rules that each bird seems to follow.<span class="time" data-times="3.08" data-time="208.67">[03:28.67]</span>Rule one: stay close to nearby birds.<span class="time" data-times="4.12" data-time="211.75">[03:31.75]</span>Rule two: <span class="underline">avoid</span> <span class="underline">collision</span> with nearby birds.<span class="time" data-times="5.7" data-time="215.87">[03:35.87]</span>And rule three: move in the <span class="underline">average</span> speed and direction of nearby birds.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.47" data-time="221.57">[03:41.57]</span>Oh, and by the way, if you're wondering how this <span class="underline">approach</span> can be of <span class="underline">practical</span> use for humans, the movie industry's been trying create computer-generated flocks of birds in movie scenes.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.04" data-time="232.04">[03:52.04]</span>The question was: how to do it easily on a large <span class="underline">scale</span>? <span class="time" data-times="5.62" data-time="236.08">[03:56.08]</span>A researcher used these three rules in a computer <span class="underline">graphics</span> program, and it worked. <span class="time" data-times="6.99" data-time="241.7">[04:01.70]</span>There have also been attempts to create computer-generated crowds of people using this bird flocking model of <span class="underline">swarm</span> <span class="underline">intelligence</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.1" data-time="248.69">[04:08.69]</span>However, I'm not surprised that more research is needed. <span class="time" data-times="7.69" data-time="252.79">[04:12.79]</span>The three rules I mentioned might be great for bird simulations, but they don't take into <span class="underline">account</span> the <span class="underline">complexity</span> and unpredictability of human <span class="underline">behavior</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="260.48">[04:20.48]</span>So, if you want to create crowds of people in a <span class="underline">realistic</span> way, that computer model might be too limited.</p>
