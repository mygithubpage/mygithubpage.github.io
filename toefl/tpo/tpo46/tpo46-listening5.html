              <span class="time" data-times="3.62" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Listen to part of the lecture in an art <span class="underline">history</span> class.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.84" data-time="3.62">[00:03.62]</span>Professor:Okay. So, when we were discussing Gainsborough's painting, the Blue Boy, which he painted in 1770,I mentioned the story that the painting might have been an experiment. <span class="time" data-times="1.5" data-time="14.46">[00:14.46]</span>The result of a <span class="underline">challenge</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.24" data-time="15.96">[00:15.96]</span>It was believed that blue couldn't be an important color in a painting because...well...it tends to <span class="underline">recede</span> into the background. <span class="time" data-times="2.41" data-time="23.2">[00:23.20]</span>Not good for your main <span class="underline">subject</span>, right?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.68" data-time="25.61">[00:25.61]</span>So to show <span class="underline">otherwise</span>, Gainsborough created the Blue Boy, with the boy featured large in his famous blue clothes...and...well...l guess he proved his point.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.64" data-time="35.29">[00:35.29]</span>But there was another <span class="underline">challenge</span> to blue. <span class="time" data-times="2.66" data-time="37.93">[00:37.93]</span>It was very very expensive back then. <span class="time" data-times="5.96" data-time="40.59">[00:40.59]</span>Now of <span class="underline">course</span>, because of modern chemistry, any color is <span class="underline">available</span> in tubes at any art <span class="underline">supply</span> store. <span class="time" data-times="3.8" data-time="46.55">[00:46.55]</span>But in the 18th <span class="underline">century</span> and before, it wasn't so easy.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="11.61" data-time="50.35">[00:50.35]</span>And blue...well...the color ultramarine, the most desired <span class="underline">shade</span> of blue, was made from the <span class="underline">precious</span> stone, Lapis Lazuli, which had to be imported all the way from Afghanistan.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.61" data-time="61.96">[01:01.96]</span>And the <span class="underline">second</span> most favorite <span class="underline">shade</span> of blue, after ultramarine made from Lapis Lazuli, was a <span class="underline">shade</span> a blue that came from another <span class="underline">precious</span> stone, Azurite.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.65" data-time="71.57">[01:11.57]</span>But Azurite was...well...harder to work with. <span class="time" data-times="3.83" data-time="75.22">[01:15.22]</span>There's <span class="underline">evidence</span> that artists would try to get around these difficulties. <span class="time" data-times="9.48" data-time="79.05">[01:19.05]</span>For example, use <span class="underline">pigment</span> from lapis lazuli or azurite very sparingly, and also use something cheaper, like smalt, which was made of ground glass. <span class="time" data-times="3.37" data-time="88.53">[01:28.53]</span>Thing is, smalt became discolored over time. <span class="time" data-times="7" data-time="91.9">[01:31.90]</span>So many artists probably avoided <span class="underline">blues</span> <span class="underline">altogether</span> rather than use something cheap and impermanent.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.9" data-time="98.9">[01:38.90]</span>So, blue, and especially ultramarine <span class="underline">pigment</span>, was a <span class="underline">luxury</span>, a <span class="underline">status</span> <span class="underline">symbol</span>, <span class="underline">worth</span> <span class="underline">even</span> more than gold at times. <span class="time" data-times="9.78" data-time="106.8">[01:46.80]</span>And you <span class="underline">even</span> have the wealthy ordering paintings with ultramarine to show others that they could <span class="underline">afford</span> something made from this <span class="underline">precious</span> <span class="underline">pigment</span>, much in the same way they would order gold leaf.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.64" data-time="116.58">[01:56.58]</span>Actually, the <span class="underline">ancient</span> Egyptians did <span class="underline">manage</span> to make an <span class="underline">artificial</span> blue, the first <span class="underline">synthetic</span> <span class="underline">pigment</span> in fact, if you can believe that. <span class="time" data-times="4.51" data-time="125.22">[02:05.22]</span>They passed the formula on to the Greeks and Romans, but then it was lost.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.96" data-time="129.73">[02:09.73]</span>Anyway, not only was lapis lazuli hard to get, it was also hard to <span class="underline">process</span>. <span class="time" data-times="1.85" data-time="134.69">[02:14.69]</span>The <span class="underline">recipe</span> was difficult. <span class="time" data-times="10.83" data-time="136.54">[02:16.54]</span>The stone had to be ground finely, not easy to do with a rock, then mixed with melted <span class="underline">wax</span>, resins and oils, wrapped in a cloth and <span class="underline">knitted</span> like bread dough. <span class="time" data-times="3.88" data-time="147.37">[02:27.37]</span>The fine particles of ultramarine were then separated from the rest. <span class="time" data-times="8.67" data-time="151.25">[02:31.25]</span>The <span class="underline">process</span> was time-consuming, which also contributed to the high <span class="underline">cost</span> of producing ultramarine, and it didn't <span class="underline">even</span> <span class="underline">yield</span> much usable <span class="underline">pigment</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.83" data-time="159.92">[02:39.92]</span>As a result, the French <span class="underline">government</span> <span class="underline">sponsored</span> a competition in 1824 to find a cheaper way to make ultramarine <span class="underline">pigment</span>. <span class="time" data-times="13.23" data-time="167.75">[02:47.75]</span>And soon after a <span class="underline">process</span> was demonstrated where a <span class="underline">combination</span> of <span class="underline">coal</span>, <span class="underline">sulfur</span> and other cheap, <span class="underline">commonplace</span> substances were heated, creating a <span class="underline">suitable</span> <span class="underline">synthetic</span> <span class="underline">substitute</span> for lapis lazuli. <span class="time" data-times="7.95" data-time="180.98">[03:00.98]</span>So there's no <span class="underline">doubt</span> that 19th-century artists, after good <span class="underline">synthetic</span> versions were <span class="underline">available</span>, used more ultramarine. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="188.93">[03:08.93]</span>Think of the impressionists, for example,they had a lot more choices or at <span class="underline">least</span>, less expensive choices, than painters not that long before them.</p>
