So, when we were discussing Gainsborough's painting, the Blue Boy, which he painted in 1770,I mentioned the story that the painting might have been an experiment. <span class="time" data-times="1.5" data-time="14.46">[00:14.46]</span>The result of a <span class="highlight">challenge</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.24" data-time="15.96">[00:15.96]</span>It was believed that blue couldn't be an important color in a painting because...well...it tends to <span class="highlight">recede</span> into the background. <span class="time" data-times="2.41" data-time="23.2">[00:23.20]</span>Not good for your main <span class="highlight">subject</span>, right?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="9.68" data-time="25.61">[00:25.61]</span>So to show <span class="highlight">otherwise</span>, Gainsborough created the Blue Boy, with the boy featured large in his famous blue clothes...and...well...l guess he proved his point.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.64" data-time="35.29">[00:35.29]</span>But there was another <span class="highlight">challenge</span> to blue. <span class="time" data-times="2.66" data-time="37.93">[00:37.93]</span>It was very very expensive back then. <span class="time" data-times="5.96" data-time="40.59">[00:40.59]</span>Now of <span class="highlight">course</span>, because of modern chemistry, any color is <span class="highlight">available</span> in tubes at any art <span class="highlight">supply</span> store. <span class="time" data-times="3.8" data-time="46.55">[00:46.55]</span>But in the 18th <span class="highlight">century</span> and before, it wasn't so easy.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="11.61" data-time="50.35">[00:50.35]</span>And blue...well...the color ultramarine, the most desired <span class="highlight">shade</span> of blue, was made from the <span class="highlight">precious</span> stone, Lapis Lazuli, which had to be imported all the way from Afghanistan.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="9.61" data-time="61.96">[01:01.96]</span>And the <span class="highlight">second</span> most favorite <span class="highlight">shade</span> of blue, after ultramarine made from Lapis Lazuli, was a <span class="highlight">shade</span> a blue that came from another <span class="highlight">precious</span> stone, Azurite.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.65" data-time="71.57">[01:11.57]</span>But Azurite was...well...harder to work with. <span class="time" data-times="3.83" data-time="75.22">[01:15.22]</span>There's <span class="highlight">evidence</span> that artists would try to get around these difficulties. <span class="time" data-times="9.48" data-time="79.05">[01:19.05]</span>For example, use <span class="highlight">pigment</span> from lapis lazuli or azurite very sparingly, and also use something cheaper, like smalt, which was made of ground glass. <span class="time" data-times="3.37" data-time="88.53">[01:28.53]</span>Thing is, smalt became discolored over time. <span class="time" data-times="7" data-time="91.9">[01:31.90]</span>So many artists probably avoided <span class="highlight">blues</span><span class="highlight">altogether</span> rather than use something cheap and impermanent.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.9" data-time="98.9">[01:38.90]</span>So, blue, and especially ultramarine <span class="highlight">pigment</span>, was a <span class="highlight">luxury</span>, a <span class="highlight">status</span><span class="highlight">symbol</span>, <span class="highlight">worth</span><span class="highlight">even</span> more than gold at times. <span class="time" data-times="9.78" data-time="106.8">[01:46.80]</span>And you <span class="highlight">even</span> have the wealthy ordering paintings with ultramarine to show others that they could <span class="highlight">afford</span> something made from this <span class="highlight">precious</span><span class="highlight">pigment</span>, much in the same way they would order gold leaf.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="8.64" data-time="116.58">[01:56.58]</span>Actually, the <span class="highlight">ancient</span> Egyptians did <span class="highlight">manage</span> to make an <span class="highlight">artificial</span> blue, the first <span class="highlight">synthetic</span><span class="highlight">pigment</span> in fact, if you can believe that. <span class="time" data-times="4.51" data-time="125.22">[02:05.22]</span>They passed the formula on to the Greeks and Romans, but then it was lost.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.96" data-time="129.73">[02:09.73]</span>Anyway, not only was lapis lazuli hard to get, it was also hard to <span class="highlight">process</span>. <span class="time" data-times="1.85" data-time="134.69">[02:14.69]</span>The <span class="highlight">recipe</span> was difficult. <span class="time" data-times="10.83" data-time="136.54">[02:16.54]</span>The stone had to be ground finely, not easy to do with a rock, then mixed with melted <span class="highlight">wax</span>, resins and oils, wrapped in a cloth and <span class="highlight">knitted</span> like bread dough. <span class="time" data-times="3.88" data-time="147.37">[02:27.37]</span>The fine particles of ultramarine were then separated from the rest. <span class="time" data-times="8.67" data-time="151.25">[02:31.25]</span>The <span class="highlight">process</span> was time-consuming, which also contributed to the high <span class="highlight">cost</span> of producing ultramarine, and it didn't <span class="highlight">even</span><span class="highlight">yield</span> much usable <span class="highlight">pigment</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.83" data-time="159.92">[02:39.92]</span>As a result, the French <span class="highlight">government</span><span class="highlight">sponsored</span> a competition in 1824 to find a cheaper way to make ultramarine <span class="highlight">pigment</span>. <span class="time" data-times="13.23" data-time="167.75">[02:47.75]</span>And soon after a <span class="highlight">process</span> was demonstrated where a <span class="highlight">combination</span> of <span class="highlight">coal</span>, <span class="highlight">sulfur</span> and other cheap, <span class="highlight">commonplace</span> substances were heated, creating a <span class="highlight">suitable</span><span class="highlight">synthetic</span><span class="highlight">substitute</span> for lapis lazuli. <span class="time" data-times="7.95" data-time="180.98">[03:00.98]</span>So there's no <span class="highlight">doubt</span> that 19th-century artists, after good <span class="highlight">synthetic</span> versions were <span class="highlight">available</span>, used more ultramarine. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="188.93">[03:08.93]</span>Think of the impressionists, for example,they had a lot more choices or at <span class="highlight">least</span>, less expensive choices, than painters not that long before them.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the lecture mainly about?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The economic factors that made lapis lazuli expensive</p><p>B. The types of paintings in which the color blue is popular</p><p>C. Early processes for making blue pigments from stones</p><p>D. Difficulties using the color blue in early paintings</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The professor opened with the work of an artist and expressed the artist's inconvenience because he used a lot of blue pigments and then led to blue pigments that were very scarce at the time. Then he went on to explain further that people started Find out how to synthesize this pigment. Corresponds to the D option.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What was Gainsborough's goal when he painted The Blue Boy?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To find an acceptable alternative to ultramarine pigment</p><p>B. To demonstrate that blue should be used only in certain paintings</p><p>C. To contradict a common belief about the use of blue in a painting</p><p>D. To protest the high costs of painting with most blue pigments</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The purpose of Gainsborough's creation of this blue boy was because society at that time felt that blue was not an important color in painting, so it was not commonly used, but he hoped that this view could be broken, so he drew this picture. Correspond to C option.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor imply about smalt as a substitute for lapis lazuli?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It eventually became as expensive as lapis lazuli.</p><p>B. It was used frequently throughout the nineteenth century.</p><p>C. It was not of an acceptable quality for many artists.</p><p>D. It was seen as a better substitute for lapis lazuli than azurite was.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The professor said that smalt is also a kind of dark blue pigment that can replace celestine, but the biggest problem is: Thing is, smalt became discolored over time. Obviously smalt's problem is that with time, it will slowly fade, quality is Obvious problem, so the correct answer is C.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>What two points does the professor make about the process of turning lapis lazuli into ultramarine? Click on 2 answers</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It took a lot of time.</p><p>B. It required expensive tools.</p><p>C. It did not produce much pigment.</p><p>D. It was perfected by the French.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="AC"><p>A option of a lot of time for a text's time-consuming. C option corresponds to the original's didn't even yield much usable pigment. Produce corresponds to yield.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor mention the French government?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To indicate who sponsored the digging of additional lapis lazuli mines</p><p>B. To emphasize the importance of developing an affordable blue pigment</p><p>C. To point out that artists were not permitted to use certain stones to make pigments</p><p>D. To question the government's use of public funds to support the arts</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The professor finally mentioned that the French government has sponsored the competition to search for relatively inexpensive dark blue pigments, apparently to emphasize the importance of finding cheaper pigments, corresponding to the B option.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor imply when he says this:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. He is not convinced the Egyptians made the first synthetic pigment</p><p>B. He is impressed by the Egyptians' accomplishment.</p><p>C. The process the Egyptians used is now widely known.</p><p>D. The Egyptian pigment was of lower quality than today's pigments.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The professor here expressed that the ancient Egyptians had already invented synthetic blue pigments very early. This is very surprising, so the correct answer is the B option.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
