            <b>The Origins of Writing</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>It was in Egypt and <span class="underline">Mesopotamia</span> (modern-day Iraq) that <span class="underline">civilization</span> arose, and it is there that we find the earliest examples of that <span class="light">key</span> feature of <span class="underline">civilization</span>, writing. These examples, in the form of inscribed <span class="underline">clay</span> tablets that <span class="underline">date</span> to <span class="underline">shortly</span> before 3000 B.C.E., have been discovered among the <span class="underline">archaeological</span> remains of the Sumerians, a gifted people settled in southern <span class="underline">Mesopotamia</span>.</p>
          <p>The Egyptians were not far behind in developing writing, but we cannot follow the <span class="underline">history</span> of their writing in <span class="underline">detail</span> because they used a <span class="underline">perishable</span> writing <span class="underline">material</span>. In <span class="underline">ancient</span> times the banks of the Nile were lined with <span class="underline">papyrus</span> plants, and from the <span class="underline">papyrus</span> reeds the Egyptians made a form of paper; it was excellent in <span class="underline">quality</span> but, like any paper, <span class="underline">fragile</span>. <span class="underline">Mesopotamia</span>'s rivers boasted no such useful reeds, but its land did provide good <span class="underline">clay</span>, and as a <span class="underline">consequence</span> the <span class="underline">clay</span> tablet became the <span class="underline">standard</span> <span class="underline">material</span>. Though <span class="underline">clumsy</span> and <span class="underline">bulky</span> it has a <span class="underline">virtue</span> dear to archaeologists: it is <span class="underline">durable</span>. Fire, for example, which is death to <span class="underline">papyrus</span> paper or other writing materials such as <span class="underline">leather</span> and wood, <span class="underline">simply</span> bakes it hard, <span class="underline">thereby</span> making it <span class="underline">even</span> more <span class="underline">durable</span>. So when a conqueror set a Mesopotamian palace <span class="underline">ablaze</span>, he helped ensure the <span class="underline">survival</span> of any <span class="underline">clay</span> tablets in it. <span class="underline">Clay</span>, moreover, is cheap, and forming it into tablets is easy, factors that helped the <span class="underline">clay</span> tablet become the preferred writing <span class="underline">material</span> not only <span class="underline">throughout</span> <span class="underline">Mesopotamia</span> but far outside it as well, in Syria, Asia <span class="underline">Minor</span>, <span class="underline">Persia</span>, and <span class="underline">even</span> for a while in Crete and Greece. Excavators have unearthed <span class="underline">clay</span> tablets in all these lands. In the Near East they remained in use for more than two and a half <span class="underline">millennia</span>, and in certain areas they lasted down to the beginning of the <span class="underline">common</span> <span class="underline">era</span> until finally yielding, once and for all, to more <span class="underline">convenient</span> alternatives.</p>
          <p>The Sumerians perfected a style of writing suited to <span class="underline">clay</span>. This <span class="underline">script</span> consists of simple shapes, basically just <span class="underline">wedge</span> shapes and lines that could easily be incised in <span class="underline">soft</span> <span class="underline">clay</span> with a reed or wooden <span class="underline">stylus</span>; scholars have dubbed it <span class="underline">cuneiform</span> from the <span class="underline">wedge-shaped</span> marks (cunei in <span class="underline">Latin</span>) that are its hallmark. Although the ingredients are merely wedges and lines, there are hundreds of combinations of these <span class="underline">basic</span> forms that stand for different sounds or words. Learning these <span class="underline">complex</span> signs required long training and much practice; <span class="underline">inevitably</span>, <span class="underline">literacy</span> was largely limited to a small <span class="underline">professional</span> class, the scribes.</p>
          <p>The Akkadians conquered the Sumerians around the middle of the third <span class="underline">millennium</span> B.C.E., and they took over the various <span class="underline">cuneiform</span> signs used for writing <span class="underline">Sumerian</span> and gave them <span class="underline">sound</span> and word values that fit their own language. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>The Babylonians and Assyrians did the same, and so did peoples in Syria and Asia <span class="underline">Minor</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>The <span class="underline">literature</span> of the Sumerians was treasured <span class="underline">throughout</span> the Near East, and long after <span class="underline">Sumerian</span> ceased to be spoken, the Babylonians and Assyrians and others kept it alive as a <span class="underline">literary</span> language, the way Europeans kept <span class="underline">Latin</span> alive after the fall of Rome. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>For the scribes of these non-Sumerian languages, training was doubly <span class="underline">demanding</span> since they had to know the values of the various <span class="underline">cuneiform</span> signs for <span class="underline">Sumerian</span> as well as for their own language. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p>
          <p>The contents of the earliest <span class="underline">clay</span> tablets are simple notations of numbers of commodities-animals, jars, baskets, etc. Writing, it would <span class="underline">appear</span>, started as a <span class="underline">primitive</span> form of bookkeeping. Its use soon widened to document the <span class="underline">multitudinous</span> things and acts that are involved in daily life, from simple inventories of commodities to <span class="underline">complicated</span> governmental rules and regulations.</p>
          <p>Archaeologists frequently find <span class="underline">clay</span> tablets in batches. The batches, some of which <span class="underline">contain</span> thousands of tablets, <span class="underline">consist</span> for the most part of documents of the types just mentioned: bills, deliveries, receipts, inventories, loans, marriage contracts, divorce settlements, <span class="underline">court</span> judgments, and so on. These records of <span class="underline">factual</span> matters were kept in <span class="underline">storage</span> to be <span class="underline">available</span> for reference-they were, in effect, files, or, to use the <span class="underline">term</span> preferred by specialists in the <span class="underline">ancient</span> Near East, archives. Now and then these files include pieces of writing that are of a distinctly different order, writings that do not merely <span class="underline">record</span> some matter of fact but <span class="underline">involve</span> <span class="underline">creative</span> <span class="underline">intellectual</span> <span class="underline">activity</span>. They <span class="underline">range</span> from simple textbook <span class="underline">material</span> to literature-and they make an <span class="underline">appearance</span> very early, <span class="underline">even</span> from the third <span class="underline">millennium</span> B C E.</p>
