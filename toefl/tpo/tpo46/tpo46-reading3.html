            <b>Ecosystem Diversity and Stability</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>
            <span class="underline">Conservation</span> biologists have long been concerned that <span class="underline">species</span> <span class="underline">extinction</span> could have <span class="light"><span class="underline">significant</span></span> consequences for the <span class="underline">stability</span> of entire ecosystems-groups of interacting organisms and the <span class="underline">physical</span> environment that they <span class="underline">inhabit</span>. An <span class="underline">ecosystem</span> could <span class="underline">survive</span> the loss of some <span class="underline">species</span>, but if enough <span class="underline">species</span> were lost, the <span class="underline">ecosystem</span> would be <span class="underline">severely</span> degraded. In fact, it is possible that the loss of a single important <span class="underline">species</span> could start a <span class="underline">cascade</span> of extinctions that might <span class="underline">dramatically</span> change an entire <span class="underline">ecosystem</span>. A good <span class="underline">illustration</span> of this occurred after sea otters were eliminated from some <span class="underline">Pacific</span> kelp (seaweed) bed ecosystems: the kelp beds were <span class="underline">practically</span> obliterated too because in the <span class="underline">absence</span> of sea <span class="underline">otter</span> <span class="underline">predation</span>, sea <span class="underline">urchin</span> populations exploded and consumed most of the kelp and other macroalgae.</p>
          <p>It is usually claimed that species-rich ecosystems <span class="underline">tend</span> to be more <span class="underline">stable</span> than species-poor ecosystems. Three mechanisms by which higher <span class="underline">diversity</span> increases <span class="underline">ecosystem</span> <span class="underline">stability</span> have been proposed. First, if there are more <span class="underline">species</span> in an <span class="underline">ecosystem</span>, then its food web will be more <span class="underline">complex</span>, with greater redundancy among <span class="underline">species</span> in terms of their nutritional roles. In other words, in a rich system if a <span class="underline">species</span> is lost, there is a good <span class="underline">chance</span> that other <span class="underline">species</span> will take over its <span class="underline">function</span> as <span class="underline">prey</span>, <span class="underline">predator</span>, producer, decomposer, or whatever role it played. <span class="underline">Second</span>, <span class="underline">diverse</span> ecosystems may be less likely to be invaded by new <span class="underline">species</span>, <span class="underline">notably</span> exotics (foreign <span class="underline">species</span> living outside their native <span class="underline">range</span>), that would <span class="underline">disrupt</span> the <span class="underline">ecosystem</span>'s structure and <span class="underline">function</span>. Third, in a species-rich <span class="underline">ecosystem</span>, diseases may <span class="underline">spread</span> more slowly because most <span class="underline">species</span> will be <span class="underline">relatively</span> less <span class="underline">abundant</span>, thus increasing the <span class="underline">average</span> distance between individuals of the same <span class="underline">species</span> and hampering <span class="underline">disease</span> transmission among individuals.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="underline">Scientific</span>
            <span class="underline">evidence</span> to <span class="underline">illuminate</span> these ideas has been slow in coming, and many shadows <span class="underline">remain</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>One of the first studies to provide <span class="underline">data</span> supporting a relationship between <span class="underline">diversity</span> and <span class="underline">stability</span> examined how grassland plants responded to a <span class="underline">drought</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>Researchers D. Tilman and J A. Downing used the <span class="underline">ratio</span> of above-ground biomass in 1988 (after two years of <span class="underline">drought</span>) to that in 1986 (predrought) in 207 plots in a grassland <span class="underline">field</span> in the Cedar Creek Natural <span class="underline">History</span> Area in Minnesota as an index of <span class="underline">ecosystem</span> <span class="underline">response</span> to disruption by <span class="underline">drought</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>In an experiment that began in 1982, they compared these values with the number of plant <span class="underline">species</span> in each <span class="underline">plot</span> and discovered that the plots with a greater number of plant <span class="underline">species</span> experienced a less <span class="underline">dramatic</span> <span class="underline">reduction</span> in biomass. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>Plots with more than ten <span class="underline">species</span> had about half as much biomass in 1988 as in 1986, whereas those with fewer than five <span class="underline">species</span> only produced <span class="underline">roughly</span> one-eighth as much biomass after the two-year <span class="underline">drought</span>. Apparently, species-rich plots were likely to <span class="underline">contain</span> some drought-resistant plant <span class="underline">species</span> that grew better in <span class="underline">drought</span> years, compensating for the poor growth of less-tolerant <span class="underline">species</span>.</p>
          <p>To put this result in more general terms, a species-rich <span class="underline">ecosystem</span> may be more <span class="underline">stable</span> because it is more likely to have <span class="underline">species</span> with a wide <span class="underline">array</span> of responses to <span class="underline">variable</span> conditions such as droughts. Furthermore, a species-rich <span class="underline">ecosystem</span> is more likely to have <span class="underline">species</span> with <span class="underline">similar</span> <span class="underline">ecological</span> functions, so that if a <span class="underline">species</span> is lost from an <span class="underline">ecosystem</span>, another <span class="underline">species</span>, probably a competitor, is likely to <span class="underline">flourish</span> and <span class="underline">occupy</span> its <span class="underline">functional</span> role. Both of these, <span class="underline">variability</span> in responses and <span class="underline">functional</span> redundancy, could be thought of as <span class="underline">insurance</span> against disturbances.</p>
          <p>The Minnesota grassland research has been widely accepted as strong <span class="underline">evidence</span> for the diversity- <span class="underline">stability</span> <span class="underline">theory</span>; however, its findings have been questioned, and <span class="underline">similar</span> studies on other ecosystems have not always found a <span class="underline">positive</span> relationship between <span class="underline">diversity</span> and <span class="underline">stability</span>. Clearly, this is a <span class="underline">complex</span> <span class="underline">issue</span> that requires further <span class="underline">field</span> research with a <span class="underline">broad</span> <span class="underline">spectrum</span> of ecosystems and species: grassland plants and computer models will only take us so far. In the end, despite insightful attempts to <span class="underline">detect</span> some general patterns, we may find it very difficult to reduce this topic to a simple, universal truth.</p>
