An <span class="highlight">ecosystem</span> could <span class="highlight">survive</span> the loss of some <span class="highlight">species</span>, but if enough <span class="highlight">species</span> were lost, the <span class="highlight">ecosystem</span> would be <span class="highlight">severely</span> degraded. In fact, it is possible that the loss of a single important <span class="highlight">species</span> could start a <span class="highlight">cascade</span> of extinctions that might <span class="highlight">dramatically</span> change an entire <span class="highlight">ecosystem</span>. A good <span class="highlight">illustration</span> of this occurred after sea otters were eliminated from some <span class="highlight">Pacific</span> kelp (seaweed) bed ecosystems: the kelp beds were <span class="highlight">practically</span> obliterated too because in the <span class="highlight">absence</span> of sea <span class="highlight">otter</span><span class="highlight">predation</span>, sea <span class="highlight">urchin</span> populations exploded and consumed most of the kelp and other macroalgae.</p><p>It is usually claimed that species-rich ecosystems <span class="highlight">tend</span> to be more <span class="highlight">stable</span> than species-poor ecosystems. Three mechanisms by which higher <span class="highlight">diversity</span> increases <span class="highlight">ecosystem</span><span class="highlight">stability</span> have been proposed. First, if there are more <span class="highlight">species</span> in an <span class="highlight">ecosystem</span>, then its food web will be more <span class="highlight">complex</span>, with greater <span class="question4">redundancy</span> among <span class="highlight">species</span> in terms of their nutritional roles. In other words, in a rich system if a <span class="highlight">species</span> is lost, there is a good <span class="highlight">chance</span> that other <span class="highlight">species</span> will take over its <span class="highlight">function</span> as <span class="highlight">prey</span>, <span class="highlight">predator</span>, producer, decomposer, or whatever role it played. <span class="highlight">Second</span>, <span class="highlight">diverse</span> ecosystems may be less likely to be invaded by new <span class="highlight">species</span>, <span class="highlight">notably</span> exotics (foreign <span class="highlight">species</span> living outside their native <span class="highlight">range</span>), that would <span class="highlight">disrupt</span> the <span class="highlight">ecosystem</span>'s structure and <span class="highlight">function</span>. <span class="question7">Third, in a species-rich <span class="highlight">ecosystem</span>, diseases may <span class="highlight">spread</span> more slowly because most <span class="highlight">species</span> will be <span class="highlight">relatively</span> less <span class="highlight">abundant</span>, thus increasing the <span class="highlight">average</span> distance between individuals of the same <span class="highlight">species</span> and hampering <span class="highlight">disease</span> transmission among individuals.</span></p><p><span class="highlight">Scientific</span><span class="highlight">evidence</span> to <span class="highlight">illuminate</span> these ideas has been slow in coming, and many shadows <span class="highlight">remain</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>One of the first studies to provide <span class="highlight">data</span> supporting a relationship between <span class="highlight">diversity</span> and <span class="highlight">stability</span> examined how grassland plants responded to a <span class="highlight">drought</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>Researchers D. Tilman and J A. Downing used the <span class="highlight">ratio</span> of above-ground biomass in 1988 (after two years of <span class="highlight">drought</span>) to that in 1986 (predrought) in 207 plots in a grassland <span class="highlight">field</span> in the Cedar Creek Natural <span class="highlight">History</span> Area in Minnesota as an index of <span class="highlight">ecosystem</span><span class="highlight">response</span> to disruption by <span class="highlight">drought</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>In an experiment that began in 1982, they compared these values with the number of plant <span class="highlight">species</span> in each <span class="highlight">plot</span> and discovered that the plots with a greater number of plant <span class="highlight">species</span> experienced a less <span class="highlight">dramatic</span><span class="highlight">reduction</span> in biomass. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>Plots with more than ten <span class="highlight">species</span> had about half as much biomass in 1988 as in 1986, whereas those with fewer than five <span class="highlight">species</span> only produced <span class="highlight">roughly</span> one-eighth as much biomass after the two-year <span class="highlight">drought</span>. Apparently, species-rich plots were likely to <span class="highlight">contain</span> some drought-resistant plant <span class="highlight">species</span> that grew better in <span class="highlight">drought</span> years, <span class="question8">compensating for</span> the poor growth of less-tolerant <span class="highlight">species</span>.</p><p>To put this result in more general terms, a species-rich <span class="highlight">ecosystem</span> may be more <span class="highlight">stable</span> because it is more likely to have <span class="highlight">species</span> with a wide <span class="highlight">array</span> of responses to <span class="highlight">variable</span> conditions such as droughts. Furthermore, a species-rich <span class="highlight">ecosystem</span> is more likely to have <span class="highlight">species</span> with <span class="highlight">similar</span><span class="highlight">ecological</span> functions, so that if a <span class="highlight">species</span> is lost from an <span class="highlight">ecosystem</span>, another <span class="highlight">species</span>, probably a competitor, is likely to <span class="highlight">flourish</span> and <span class="highlight">occupy</span> its <span class="highlight">functional</span> role. Both of these, <span class="highlight">variability</span> in responses and <span class="highlight">functional</span> redundancy, could be thought of as <span class="highlight">insurance</span> against disturbances.</p><p>The Minnesota grassland research has been widely accepted as strong <span class="highlight">evidence</span> for the diversity- <span class="highlight">stability</span><span class="highlight">theory</span>; however, its findings have been questioned, and <span class="highlight">similar</span> studies on other ecosystems have not always found a <span class="highlight">positive</span> relationship between <span class="highlight">diversity</span> and <span class="highlight">stability</span>. Clearly, this is a <span class="highlight">complex</span><span class="highlight">issue</span> that requires further <span class="highlight">field</span> research with a <span class="highlight">broad</span><span class="highlight">spectrum</span> of ecosystems and species: grassland plants and computer models will only take us so far. In the end, despite insightful attempts to <span class="highlight"><span class="question11">detect</span></span> some general patterns, we may find it very difficult to reduce this topic to a simple, universal truth.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">significant</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. direct</p><p>B. important</p><p>C. long-term</p><p>D. surprising</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The context of significant means "important."

When ecosystems lose just one species, they undergo permanent change.</p><p>B. The extinction of a particular predator species could cause an overpopulation of certain prey species.</p><p>C. The loss of one or more species could cause the decline of a whole ecosystem.</p><p>D. The extinction of a single species is evidence that plant-food sources are in danger of disappearing.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>According to the original An ecosystem could survive the loss of some species, but if... would be severely damaged....</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 1, what was the result of the removal of Pacific sea otters?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The kelp and sea urchins were destroyed by new predators.</p><p>B. The uncontrolled population of sea urchins ate most of the kelp plants.</p><p>C. Without sea otters, the kelp beds soon became overgrown.</p><p>D. Macroalgae remained as the primary population in the ecosystem.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>According to the original information, the kelp beds were practically obliterated too because of the absence of sea otter predation, sea urchin populations exploded and consumed most of the kelp and other macro algae. The stem of the remove corresponds to the absence here. Uncontrolled in the options corresponds to the exploded. Ate corresponds to the consumed.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">redundancy</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. duplication</p><p>B. variety</p><p>C. requirements</p><p>D. flexibility</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The context of redundancy is "replication."

Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. In any ecosystem, as the number of individuals in the same species increases, the rate of disease transmission slows down.</p><p>B. Ecosystems that have a small number of different species tend to be disease-free, because the species' habitats are at a safe distance from each other.</p><p>C. In ecosystems with many species, diseases spread more slowly because there are fewer individuals in a species and, as a result, the individuals are more widely scattered.</p><p>D. The average distance between individuals in a species-rich ecosystem increases, so diseases are prevented from being communicated between species.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The logic of the original sentence is causal logic because the core of the sentence appears. The core of the sentence is: diseases may spread more slowly, thus increasing distance and hampering disease transmission. The core of the C option is consistent with the original sentence, and the logical relationship is the same.

Species within a species-rich ecosystem are more likely to have competitors.</p><p>C. An ecosystem is more likely to develop diverse and stable species when it is exposed to extreme conditions.</p><p>D. Species with similar ecological functions will perform the function of a lost species.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="AD"><p>According to the original a species-rich ecosystem may be more stable because it is more likely to have species with a wide array of responses to variable conditions such as droughts.</p><p>According to the article Furthermore, a species-rich ecosystem is more likely to have species with similar ecological functions,so that if a species is lost from an ecosystem, another species, probably a competitor, is likely to flourish and occupy its functional role, The D option is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question11">detect</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. repeat</p><p>B. alter</p><p>C. find</p><p>D. emphasize</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" C"><p>The meaning of <span class="question11">detect</span> is "probing and discovering." The meaning of the C option is "discovery." This matches the context and is therefore the correct answer.</p><p>Repeat repeat. Alter changes.

General patterns of diversity and stability have been established as a result of the findings.</p><p>B. Questions about the findings have been refuted by computer models.</p><p>C. The findings have been tested in a broad spectrum of ecosystems with similar results.</p><p>D. The findings are not sufficient to prove a definite link between diversity and stability in ecosystems.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>According to the original However, its findings have been questioned...have not always fund a positive relationship between diversity and stability.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>It seems clear that there is room for a great deal more research, although some work has been done..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The meaning of the sentence is: Although some work has been completed, there seems to be room for more research. The inserted sentence has been described before the related work. After inserting the sentence, it talks to more research. The preceding sentence at the insertion point A indicates that there is already some scientific evidence, that is, some work has already been done. One of the first studies in the sentence following the insertion point A was researched, so inserting A is appropriate.
