            <span class="time" data-times="5.17" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Listen to part of a <span class="highlight">conversation</span> between a student and her <span class="highlight">history</span> professor. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.59" data-time="5.17">[00:05.17]</span>Student:So I <span class="highlight">definitely</span> want to write my <span class="highlight">term</span> paper on American ournalism in the eighteenth <span class="highlight">century</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.79" data-time="10.76">[00:10.76]</span>That old copy of the New York Daily Gazette you showed us, the one printed from the library's microfilm. <span class="time" data-times="5.22" data-time="16.55">[00:16.55]</span>Just seeing a newspaper that was published in 1789...that was really cool! </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.71" data-time="21.77">[00:21.77]</span>Professor:Yes, reading old newspapers can be a powerful experience, specially to a budding historian like yourself. <span class="time" data-times="9.85" data-time="28.48">[00:28.48]</span>As a <span class="highlight">resource</span> for scholars and researchers, I don't think any form of <span class="highlight">publication</span> really captures the day-to-day life of a <span class="highlight">community</span> better than a <span class="highlight">local</span> newspaper. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.67" data-time="38.33">[00:38.33]</span>Student:Yeah, I mean, I knew that the number of newspapers exploded in the 18th <span class="highlight">century</span>, <span class="time" data-times="6.57" data-time="43">[00:43.00]</span>but I figured they all deteriorated before the technology was invented to <span class="highlight">preserve</span> them, or you know, make copies. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="7.21" data-time="49.57">[00:49.57]</span>Professor:Well, actually, before the mid-1800s, newspapers were printed on <span class="highlight">fairly</span> <span class="highlight">sturdy</span> paper made from cotton fibers. <span class="time" data-times="3.16" data-time="56.78">[00:56.78]</span>Those that survived are in surprisingly good <span class="highlight">shape</span>. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.21" data-time="59.94">[00:59.94]</span>Student:Are there many more copies of the Gazette on microfilm? </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="7.05" data-time="63.15">[01:03.15]</span>Professor:Yeah, we've got a great microfilm library on <span class="highlight">campus</span>. You'll find it invaluable, I'm sure, as you research your paper. <span class="time" data-times="7.15" data-time="70.2">[01:10.20]</span>Um, but also talk to the librarians because they are creating an online archive of their microfilm collection. <span class="time" data-times="5.2" data-time="77.35">[01:17.35]</span>I'm not sure of the project's <span class="highlight">status</span>, but if it's done, it'll probably <span class="highlight">save</span> you time. <span class="time" data-times="7.08" data-time="82.55">[01:22.55]</span>So, um, 18th-century <span class="highlight">journalism</span>, you must realize that that topic is too <span class="highlight">broad</span> for this <span class="highlight">assignment</span>. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="9.99" data-time="89.63">[01:29.63]</span>Student:I do. So one idea I had was like looking at an important world <span class="highlight">vent</span> like maybe the French <span class="highlight">revolution</span> of 1789, since we just finished a unit on it. <span class="time" data-times="7.1" data-time="99.62">[01:39.62]</span>The readings you've <span class="highlight">given</span> us were incredibly <span class="highlight">vivid</span>. I loved them, but they were translations of French writers, historians. <span class="time" data-times="7.13" data-time="106.72">[01:46.72]</span>So I thought it'd be interesting to pick the Gazette and one other American newspaper to see how each covered the <span class="highlight">revolution</span>, <span class="time" data-times="3.34" data-time="113.85">[01:53.85]</span>how the journalists reported it from America's <span class="highlight">perspective</span>. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.91" data-time="117.19">[01:57.19]</span>Professor:Hmm, interesting <span class="highlight">approach</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.39" data-time="119.1">[01:59.10]</span>But remember, I'll be <span class="highlight">grading</span> your aper based on the details you include. <span class="time" data-times="7.59" data-time="123.49">[02:03.49]</span>And at some point in your paper, you'll want to <span class="highlight">focus</span> on a <span class="highlight">particular</span> event of the <span class="highlight">revolution</span> like maybe the storming of the Bastille prison. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.92" data-time="131.08">[02:11.08]</span>Student:How about the <span class="highlight">formation</span> of the French national <span class="highlight">constituent</span> <span class="highlight">assembly</span>? </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.32" data-time="135">[02:15.00]</span>Professor:Sure! That would work. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="9.8" data-time="136.32">[02:16.32]</span>Student:And since I'm <span class="highlight">gonna</span> look at newspapers from two cities, I could read the editorials, the opinion pieces, to find out what each <span class="highlight">community</span> thought about the national <span class="highlight">assembly</span>. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="8.87" data-time="146.12">[02:26.12]</span>Professor:Ok, but, you know, I once attended a <span class="highlight">history</span> <span class="highlight">conference</span> where a professor presented a paper on the American <span class="highlight">press</span> in the French <span class="highlight">Revolution</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.87" data-time="154.99">[02:34.99]</span>She was discussing the <span class="highlight">development</span> of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> deals here and in France at that time. <span class="time" data-times="15.24" data-time="160.86">[02:40.86]</span>But she also <span class="highlight">pointed</span> out that using old newspapers as <span class="highlight">primary</span> sources...to be <span class="highlight">aware</span> that they reflected the values of only a <span class="highlight">segment</span> of society, and should not be used to <span class="highlight">draw</span> conclusions about all Americans. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="176.1">[02:56.10]</span>I don't think I held on to her paper, but it was <span class="highlight">subsequently</span> published, so you'll have no trouble tracking it down on the Internet.
