Bob. (I've) been meaning to ask how's that film class going?</p><p>Man:Great! And guess what, there's a special class meeting tomorrow night to view an Alfred Hitchcock film. There will be a discussion after the film.</p><p>Woman:Hitchcock films are great. You're gonna be there, right?</p><p>Man:I don't know. There's a conflict.</p><p>Woman:What's that?</p><p>Man:Well, I'm supposed to have dinner at the dining hall with my cousin. He is coming tomorrow to spend the day on campus and check out the university, trying to decide whether to enroll in classes here next year.</p><p>Woman:Well, maybe I can help. I eat at the dining hall every night. So if you want, he can come to dinner with me and some friends of mine.</p><p>Man:Hmm...that's very nice of you. If would help him if he got to talk to a few different people about campus life.</p><p>Woman:Okay. Let's do that.</p><p>Man:Well, the things is: he's kind of shy and he might be uncomfortable with people he doesn't know. And I do want him to enjoy himself here.</p><p>Woman:Hey. We'll be nice. Anyway, do you have a better idea?</p><p>Man:Well, I can skip the film and have dinner with my cousin as planned. I'd rent the film and watch it later.</p><p>But what about the discussion?</p><p>Man:I'd miss that and it could be very interesting.</p><p>Woman:Well, let me know when you decide.</p></article><section id="question"><h4>Question</h4><p>Briefly summarize the problem the speakers are discussing. Then state which of the two solutions from the conversation you would recommend. Explain the reasons for your recommendation. </p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>The man plans to take part in a special class meeting tomorrow night to view a film and have a discussion after that but he is supposed to have dinner at the dinner hall with his cousin. In the conversation, they talk about two possible solutions. The first solution is that the woman offers to eat at the dining hall with his cousin and some of her friends. But the man says his cousin is shy and he might be uncomfortable with people he doesn't know. The second solution is that the man just skips the film and has dinner with his cousin as planned and rent the film and watch it later. However, he will miss the discussion. Personally, I recommend the man choose the first solution because in that way, his cousin can still visit the campus and the man can watch the film and participate in the discussion. I believe his cousin will understand him.</p></article></div></main></body></html>
