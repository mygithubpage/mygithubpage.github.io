            <b>No More Posters Outside the Student Center</b>
          </h4>
          <p>Traditionally, students have been permitted to put up posters advertising events, clubs, and activities on the concrete wall outside the main entrance to the student center. Beginning next semester, however, students will no longer be allowed to attach anything to the front of the building. According to a university official, the new policy is part of an effort to improve the campus's appearance. "The posters on the wall make the building unattractive," he said, "so they have to come down." He added that posters can instead be displayed in the dining hall: "Students can use the bulletin board in the dining hall for posters, so the policy change should not be a problem.</p>

        <article>
          <p>Now listen to two students discussing the article</p>
          <p>Woman:It's really too bad about this new policy.</p>
          <p>Man:Why do you say that?</p>
          <p>Woman:Well, I mean, you don't notice it so much now, but if you take a good look at that building, it's pretty boring, just your basic square building with gray concrete walls and no kind of ornamentation or anything to make it interesting.</p>
          <p>Man:Yes. I guess that's true now that I think about it.</p>
          <p>Woman:Yeah. The stuff that goes up there now, a lot of it is artistic and colorful, it gives the building character and personality.</p>
          <p>Man:True.</p>
          <p>Woman:Plus, it's always changing and that's cool too.</p>
          <p>Man:Yeah. You are right.</p>
          <p>Woman:So what's gonna be left? A boring old concrete wall.</p>
          <p>Man:Yeah. I guess it will be kind of plain.</p>
          <p>Woman:Yeah. And the idea about the dining hall.not everybody eats there. A lot of students eat at the Snack Bar or off campus. Some students bring lunch from home and eat outside under the trees.</p>
          <p>Man:That's true. I never eat in the dining hall.</p>
          <p>Woman:Okay. See what I mean? So how are you going to see those announcements?</p>
          <p>Man:I won't.</p>
          <p>Woman:I rest my case.</p>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>According to the university official, students will no longer be allowed to attach anything to the front of the building beginning next semester because the posters on the wall make the building unattractive and posters will be displayed in the dining hall. However, in the conversation, the girl thinks it is too bad about the new policy. Firstly, the posters there make the basic square building with gray concrete walls artistic and colorful. It also gives the building character and personality. Secondly, the stuff on the wall is always changing and it is cool. Besides, not everybody eats at the dining hall, so the posters in the dining hall is meaningless. </p>
