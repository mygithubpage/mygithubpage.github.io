And so the <span class="highlight">theory</span> goes: the left side of the face becomes imprinted in our memories.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.86" data-time="196.11">[03:16.11]</span>Student:But the parental imprinting <span class="highlight">hypothesis</span> doesn't explain why left profiles have decreased over time. <span class="time" data-times="4.31" data-time="202.97">[03:22.97]</span>I mean, parents are still carrying their babies in their left arm, right?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.52" data-time="207.28">[03:27.28]</span>Professor:Exactly! All right, what about the way the artists' <span class="highlight">studio</span> is organized, <span class="highlight">specifically</span> the light <span class="highlight">source</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.24" data-time="214.8">[03:34.80]</span>Remember that the light <span class="highlight">source</span> determines where the shadows are. <span class="time" data-times="10.13" data-time="219.04">[03:39.04]</span>So, if you're a right-handed artists, you'd want to the light coming from your left because you don't want your painting hand to <span class="highlight">cast</span> a shadow <span class="highlight">across</span> your <span class="highlight">canvas</span>, right? <span class="time" data-times="7.03" data-time="229.17">[03:49.17]</span>And if the light's coming from your left, you'd want your <span class="highlight">subject</span> to turn to their right into the light. <span class="time" data-times="2.63" data-time="236.2">[03:56.20]</span>If they do that, what do you see?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="1.81" data-time="238.83">[03:58.83]</span>Student:The left side of their face.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.8" data-time="240.64">[04:00.64]</span>Professor:Exactly, and well into the 20th <span class="highlight">century</span>, many an artist's <span class="highlight">primary</span> light <span class="highlight">source</span> would be the sun. <span class="time" data-times="3.88" data-time="248.44">[04:08.44]</span>And they set up their <span class="highlight">studio</span> to take <span class="highlight">maximum</span><span class="highlight">advantage</span> of it. <span class="time" data-times="6.84" data-time="252.32">[04:12.32]</span>But then what happens as other high- <span class="highlight">quality</span>, <span class="highlight">portable</span>, <span class="highlight">artificial</span> light sources become <span class="highlight">available</span>?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.01" data-time="259.16">[04:19.16]</span>Student:Well, you could <span class="highlight">position</span> your <span class="highlight">subject</span> in a lot more different ways and still have good lighting on your <span class="highlight">subject</span> and on your <span class="highlight">canvas</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="1.38" data-time="266.17">[04:26.17]</span>Professor:So...?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="267.55">[04:27.55]</span>Student:You'd <span class="highlight">expect</span> to see a more <span class="highlight">balanced</span><span class="highlight">ratio</span> of left- and right-side portraits.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the lecture mainly about?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Techniques for creating lifelike portraits</p><p>B. Theories about a preference in portrait painting</p><p>C. Reasons for a decline in the popularity of portrait painting</p><p>D. Ways researchers determine whether a painting is authentic</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>At the beginning of the lecture, the professor said that the painter of the 16th century liked to draw a portrait of his left face, and then began to explain the reason specifically, so the correct answer was the B option.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor, what change occurred in portrait paintings over time?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Portrait artists became more skilled at painting profiles.</p><p>B. Portrait artists began painting a greater variety of subjects.</p><p>C. The percentage of left profiles decreased.</p><p>D. A left profile became a symbol of the subject's social status.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The professor clearly stated that with the passage of time, the proportion of left-faced portraiture by the 20th century has decreased, becoming about the same as the right-faced figure at about 50%, corresponding to the C option.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What point does the professor emphasize by his discussion of the lithograph The Potato Eaters?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Profiles are more difficult to create than head-on portraits.</p><p>B. Some artists consider the direction of the profile a key element in a portrait.</p><p>C. Most group portraits include both left and right profiles.</p><p>D. The direction of a profile is usually determined by the characteristics of the subject.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The professor introduced the example of Van Gogh and mainly stated that Van Gogh had been completely dissatisfied because he thought the direction of the picture was completely wrong because of the mirroring. Obviously this example is to prove that the direction is very important for the painting, corresponding to the B option.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor, what is the problem with the "right-handed" hypothesis?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Left-handed artists are equally comfortable painting left and right profiles.</p><p>B. Right hands tend to cover up facial features when painting left profiles.</p><p>C. Statistics show that right-handed artists tend to paint right profiles.</p><p>D. Left hands are less likely to cast shadows when painting right profiles.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The professor introduced the issue of the right-handedness hypothesis. The main problem is that the left-handed artists find it just as easy to paint left profiles as right. That is, the left-handed artist finds it easy to draw either portraits on the left or right, so this The argument cannot be established and corresponds to the A option.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor imply about the "studio organization" hypothesis?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It has been disproved by recent studies.</p><p>B. It accounts for an important change in portrait painting.</p><p>C. It is based on a study of a relatively small number of portraits.</p><p>D. It was first proposed by the owner of a modern-day portrait studio.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Regarding the theory of the studio structure, the professor said that the artificial light source in the modern studio can be polished according to the artist's preference, so both the left and right faces can have very good light, which explains why the ratio of the left and right face portraits gradually becomes balanced. , so the correct answer is the B option.</p></div></div><div class="replay" id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the student say this:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To explain why he prefers to paint left profiles</p><p>B. To point out a difference between adult portraits and baby portraits</p><p>C. To point out a fact that contradicts the "parental imprinting" hypothesis</p><p>D. To provide support for the "parental imprinting" hypothesis</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>Before the professor gave a second hypothesis, ie, the parental imprint hypothesis, the student added an example of his sister to support the professor's statement on the basis of this, and the professor's answer was also positive, so this question should be selected D option .</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
