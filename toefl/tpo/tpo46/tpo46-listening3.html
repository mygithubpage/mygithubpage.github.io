            <span class="time" data-times="3.05" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Listen to part of a lecture in an art <span class="highlight">history</span> class.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="13.6" data-time="3.05">[00:03.05]</span>Professor:As you know, <span class="highlight">portrait</span> artists often <span class="highlight">position</span> their subjects so that their head is turned a little to one side, <span class="highlight">thereby</span> presenting the artist with a semi-side view, a semi-profile view.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="9.34" data-time="16.65">[00:16.65]</span>And for some <span class="highlight">reason</span>, western European artists have historically tended to show the left-side of the <span class="highlight">subject</span>'s face, more than the right. <span class="time" data-times="10.06" data-time="25.99">[00:25.99]</span>A while back, some researchers examine about 1,500 portraits painted from the 16th to the 20th <span class="highlight">century</span> in Western Europe. <span class="time" data-times="5.95" data-time="36.05">[00:36.05]</span>And in the <span class="highlight">majority</span> of them is the left- side of the face that's most <span class="highlight">prominently</span> displayed. <span class="time" data-times="1.2" data-time="42">[00:42.00]</span>Why is that?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="8.47" data-time="43.2">[00:43.20]</span>And interestingly enough, this <span class="highlight">tendency</span> to show the left side has <span class="highlight">diminished</span> over time, especially in the 20th <span class="highlight">century</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.97" data-time="51.67">[00:51.67]</span>In fact, the left-right <span class="highlight">ratio</span> is now about 1:1, 50% left 50% right.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.83" data-time="58.64">[00:58.64]</span>Why is that?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.84" data-time="60.47">[01:00.47]</span>We do know that for many artists, the choice of left side, right side was very important. <span class="time" data-times="8.48" data-time="66.31">[01:06.31]</span>There is an <span class="highlight">image</span> by the Dutch painter Vincent Van Gogh called the Potato Eaters that shows the profiles of a group of farmers. <span class="time" data-times="5.49" data-time="74.79">[01:14.79]</span>It's a lithograph, which is a print made from images drawn on a stone. <span class="time" data-times="5.75" data-time="80.28">[01:20.28]</span>When you print something that way, what you get is a <span class="highlight">mirror</span> <span class="highlight">image</span> of the <span class="highlight">original</span> picture. <span class="time" data-times="16.45" data-time="86.03">[01:26.03]</span>The <span class="highlight">exact</span> same <span class="highlight">image</span>, except that left and right are reversed, and Van Gogh was so dissatisfied with the print that he wrote to his brother, "the figures, I'm sorry to say, are now turned the wrong way."</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="8.21" data-time="102.48">[01:42.48]</span>Anyway, why do you think so many painters in the past chose to <span class="highlight">depict</span> the left side of their subjects' face? Nancy.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="10.82" data-time="110.69">[01:50.69]</span>Student:Could it have to do with whether the artists were left-handed or right-handed, like maybe most of them were right-handed, and maybe for some <span class="highlight">reason</span> they feel more comfortable painting the left side?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="10.88" data-time="121.51">[02:01.51]</span>Professor:Ok, many right-handed artists do find it easier to paint left profiles, and many art historians think that's the <span class="highlight">reason</span> for the directional <span class="highlight">bias</span>. <span class="time" data-times="12.58" data-time="132.39">[02:12.39]</span>But if that <span class="highlight">hypothesis</span>, let's call it the right-handed <span class="highlight">hypothesis</span>, was correct, you'd <span class="highlight">expect</span> that left-handed artists would find it easier to paint right profiles. <span class="time" data-times="7.68" data-time="144.97">[02:24.97]</span>But the research suggests that left-handed artists find it just as easy to paint left profiles as right. <span class="time" data-times="2.26" data-time="152.65">[02:32.65]</span>So any other ideas?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="19.17" data-time="154.91">[02:34.91]</span>Well, another <span class="highlight">theory</span> is what's known as the parental imprinting <span class="highlight">hypothesis</span>, which proposes that people are more used to seeing left profiles because <span class="highlight">supposedly</span> right-handed parents are more likely to hold their babies in their left arm.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.64" data-time="174.08">[02:54.08]</span>Student:Well, my sister just had a baby and she keeps talking about how her left arm is getting so much stronger than her right.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.99" data-time="180.72">[03:00.72]</span>Professor:Ok, so there's some <span class="highlight">anecdotal</span> <span class="highlight">evidence</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.57" data-time="183.71">[03:03.71]</span>Student:So, then when the baby looks up at their parent, what they see is the left profile.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.83" data-time="189.28">[03:09.28]</span>Professor:Right. And so the <span class="highlight">theory</span> goes: the left side of the face becomes imprinted in our memories.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.86" data-time="196.11">[03:16.11]</span>Student:But the parental imprinting <span class="highlight">hypothesis</span> doesn't explain why left profiles have decreased over time. <span class="time" data-times="4.31" data-time="202.97">[03:22.97]</span>I mean, parents are still carrying their babies in their left arm, right?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="7.52" data-time="207.28">[03:27.28]</span>Professor:Exactly! All right, what about the way the artists' <span class="highlight">studio</span> is organized, <span class="highlight">specifically</span> the light <span class="highlight">source</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.24" data-time="214.8">[03:34.80]</span>Remember that the light <span class="highlight">source</span> determines where the shadows are. <span class="time" data-times="10.13" data-time="219.04">[03:39.04]</span>So, if you're a right-handed artists, you'd want to the light coming from your left because you don't want your painting hand to <span class="highlight">cast</span> a shadow <span class="highlight">across</span> your <span class="highlight">canvas</span>, right? <span class="time" data-times="7.03" data-time="229.17">[03:49.17]</span>And if the light's coming from your left, you'd want your <span class="highlight">subject</span> to turn to their right into the light. <span class="time" data-times="2.63" data-time="236.2">[03:56.20]</span>If they do that, what do you see?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.81" data-time="238.83">[03:58.83]</span>Student:The left side of their face.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="7.8" data-time="240.64">[04:00.64]</span>Professor:Exactly, and well into the 20th <span class="highlight">century</span>, many an artist's <span class="highlight">primary</span> light <span class="highlight">source</span> would be the sun. <span class="time" data-times="3.88" data-time="248.44">[04:08.44]</span>And they set up their <span class="highlight">studio</span> to take <span class="highlight">maximum</span> <span class="highlight">advantage</span> of it. <span class="time" data-times="6.84" data-time="252.32">[04:12.32]</span>But then what happens as other high- <span class="highlight">quality</span>, <span class="highlight">portable</span>, <span class="highlight">artificial</span> light sources become <span class="highlight">available</span>?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="7.01" data-time="259.16">[04:19.16]</span>Student:Well, you could <span class="highlight">position</span> your <span class="highlight">subject</span> in a lot more different ways and still have good lighting on your <span class="highlight">subject</span> and on your <span class="highlight">canvas</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.38" data-time="266.17">[04:26.17]</span>Professor:So...?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="267.55">[04:27.55]</span>Student:You'd <span class="highlight">expect</span> to see a more <span class="highlight">balanced</span> <span class="highlight">ratio</span> of left- and right-side portraits.</p>

              <p>The professor introduced the issue of the right-handedness hypothesis. The main problem is that the left-handed artists find it just as easy to paint left profiles as right.

              <p>Regarding the theory of the studio structure, the professor said that the artificial light source in the modern studio can be polished according to the artist's preference, so both the left and right faces can have very good light, which explains why the ratio of the left and right face portraits gradually becomes balanced. , so the correct answer is the B option.</p>
