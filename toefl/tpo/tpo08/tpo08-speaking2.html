Which behavior do you think is better? Explain why.</p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>I prefer to take risks and try new things. I think taking risks is a way to improve oneself, a way to broaden one's horizon. For example, if Columbia hadn't taken risks, he wouldn't have found the New World. If he hadn't found the New World, his horizon wouldn't have been broaden so wouldn't other people's horizon at that time. Also, trying new things is one of the best ways to learn. Take myself as an example, I didn't like reading novels until my junior year in the college so novel was a kind of new thing to me at that time. But I tried to read some novels in my junior year, and gradually I became interested in reading novels. Later on, I even started to write my own novels. If I hadn't tried to read novels, I wouldn't have known how to write my own novels.</p></article></div></main></body></html>
