            <b>Extinction of the Dinosaurs</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>Paleontologists have argued for a long time that the <span class="underline">demise</span> of the dinosaurs was caused by <span class="underline">climatic</span> alterations <span class="underline">associated</span> with slow changes in the positions of continents and seas resulting from <span class="underline">plate</span> <span class="underline">tectonics</span>. Off and on <span class="underline">throughout</span> the Cretaceous (the last period of the <span class="underline">Mesozoic</span> <span class="underline">era</span>, during which dinosaurs flourished), large <span class="underline">shallow</span> seas covered <span class="underline">extensive</span> areas of the continents. <span class="underline">Data</span> from <span class="underline">diverse</span> sources, including geochemical <span class="underline">evidence</span> preserved in seafloor sediments, <span class="underline">indicate</span> that the Late Cretaceous <span class="underline">climate</span> was milder than today's. The days were not too hot, nor the nights too cold. The summers were not too warm, nor the winters too <span class="underline">frigid</span>. The <span class="underline">shallow</span> seas on the continents probably buffered the <span class="underline">temperature</span> of the nearby <span class="underline">air</span>, keeping it <span class="underline">relatively</span> <span class="underline">constant</span>.</p>
          <p>At the end of the Cretaceous, the geological <span class="underline">record</span> shows that these seaways retreated from the continents back into the <span class="underline">major</span> ocean basins. No one knows why. Over a period of about 100,000 years, while the seas pulled back, climates around the world became <span class="underline">dramatically</span> more extreme: warmer days, cooler nights; hotter summers, colder winters. Perhaps dinosaurs could not <span class="underline">tolerate</span> these <span class="underline">extreme</span> <span class="underline">temperature</span> changes and became <span class="underline">extinct</span>.</p>
          <p>If true, though, why did cold-blooded animals such as snakes, lizards, turtles, and crocodiles <span class="underline">survive</span> the freezing winters and torrid summers? These animals are at the <span class="underline">mercy</span> of the <span class="underline">climate</span> to <span class="underline">maintain</span> a livable body <span class="underline">temperature</span>. It's hard to understand why they would not be affected, whereas dinosaurs were left too crippled to cope, especially if, as some scientists believe, dinosaurs were warm-blooded. Critics also point out that the <span class="underline">shallow</span> seaways had retreated from and <span class="underline">advanced</span> on the continents <span class="underline">numerous</span> times during the <span class="underline">Mesozoic</span>, so why did the dinosaurs <span class="underline">survive</span> the <span class="underline">climatic</span> changes <span class="underline">associated</span> with the earlier fluctuations but not with this one? Although <span class="underline">initially</span> <span class="underline">appealing</span>, the <span class="underline">hypothesis</span> of a simple <span class="underline">climatic</span> change related to sea levels is <span class="underline">insufficient</span> to explain all the <span class="underline">data</span>.</p>
          <p>Dissatisfaction with <span class="underline">conventional</span> explanations for <span class="underline">dinosaur</span> extinctions led to a surprising <span class="underline">observation</span> that, in turn, has suggested a new <span class="underline">hypothesis</span>. Many plants and animals disappear <span class="underline">abruptly</span> from the <span class="underline">fossil</span> <span class="underline">record</span> as one moves from layers of rock documenting the end of the Cretaceous up into rocks representing the beginning of the Cenozoic (the <span class="underline">era</span> after the <span class="underline">Mesozoic</span>). Between the last <span class="underline">layer</span> of Cretaceous rock and the first <span class="underline">layer</span> of Cenozoic rock, there is often a thin <span class="underline">layer</span> of <span class="underline">clay</span>. Scientists felt that they could get an idea of how long the extinctions took by determining how long it took to <span class="underline">deposit</span> this one centimeter of <span class="underline">clay</span> and they thought they could <span class="underline">determine</span> the time it took to <span class="underline">deposit</span> the <span class="underline">clay</span> by determining the <span class="underline">amount</span> of the <span class="underline">element</span> <span class="underline">iridium</span> (Ir) it contained.</p>
          <p>Ir has not been <span class="underline">common</span> at Earth's since the very beginning of the <span class="underline">planet</span>'s <span class="underline">history</span>. Because it usually exists in a <span class="underline">metallic</span> <span class="underline">state</span>, 
it was preferentially incorporated in Earth's <span class="underline">core</span> as the <span class="underline">planet</span> cooled and consolidated. Ir is found in high concentrations in some meteorites,
in which the <span class="underline">solar</span> system's <span class="underline">original</span> chemical <span class="underline">composition</span> is preserved. <span class="underline">Even</span> today, <span class="underline">microscopic</span> meteorites continually bombard Earth, falling on both land and sea. 
By measuring how many of these meteorites fall to Earth over a <span class="underline">given</span> period of time, scientists can <span class="underline">estimate</span> how long it might have taken to <span class="underline">deposit</span> the observed <span class="underline">amount</span> of Ir in the <span class="underline">boundary</span> <span class="underline">clay</span>. 
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> These calculations suggest that a period of about one million years would have been required. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>However, other <span class="underline">reliable</span> <span class="underline">evidence</span> suggests that the <span class="underline">deposition</span> of the <span class="underline">boundary</span> <span class="underline">clay</span> could not 
have taken one million years. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>So the unusually high <span class="underline">concentration</span> of Ir seems to <span class="underline">require</span> a <span class="underline">special</span> explanation. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p>
          <p>In view of these facts, scientists hypothesized that a single large <span class="underline">asteroid</span>, about 10 to 15 kilometers <span class="underline">across</span>, collided with Earth, and the resulting fallout created the <span class="underline">boundary</span> <span class="underline">clay</span>. Their calculations show that the <span class="underline">impact</span> kicked up a dust cloud that cut off sunlight for several months, inhibiting <span class="underline">photosynthesis</span> in plants; decreased surface temperatures on continents to below freezing; caused <span class="underline">extreme</span> episodes of <span class="underline">acid</span> rain; and <span class="underline">significantly</span> raised long-term global temperatures <span class="underline">through</span> the greenhouse effect. This disruption of food <span class="underline">chain</span> and <span class="underline">climate</span> would have eradicated the dinosaurs and other organisms in less than fifty years.</p>
