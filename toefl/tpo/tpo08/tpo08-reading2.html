Off and on <span class="highlight">throughout</span> the Cretaceous (the last period of the <span class="highlight">Mesozoic</span><span class="highlight">era</span>, during which dinosaurs flourished), large <span class="highlight">shallow</span> seas covered <span class="highlight">extensive</span> areas of the continents. <span class="highlight">Data</span> from <span class="highlight">diverse</span> sources, including geochemical <span class="highlight">evidence</span> preserved in seafloor sediments, <span class="highlight">indicate</span> that the Late Cretaceous <span class="highlight">climate</span> was milder than today's. The days were not too hot, nor the nights too cold. The summers were not too warm, nor the winters too <span class="highlight">frigid</span>. The <span class="highlight">shallow</span> seas on the continents probably buffered the <span class="highlight">temperature</span> of the nearby <span class="highlight">air</span>, keeping it <span class="highlight">relatively</span><span class="highlight">constant</span>.</p><p>At the end of the Cretaceous, the geological <span class="highlight">record</span> shows that these seaways retreated from the continents back into the <span class="highlight">major</span> ocean basins. No one knows why. Over a period of about 100,000 years, while the seas pulled back, climates around the world became <span class="highlight">dramatically</span> more extreme: warmer days, cooler nights; hotter summers, colder winters. Perhaps dinosaurs could not <span class="highlight">tolerate</span> these <span class="highlight">extreme</span><span class="highlight">temperature</span> changes and became <span class="highlight">extinct</span>.</p><p>If true, though, why did cold-blooded animals such as <span class="question3">snakes, lizards, turtles, and crocodiles</span><span class="highlight">survive</span> the freezing winters and torrid summers? These animals are at the <span class="highlight">mercy</span> of the <span class="highlight">climate</span> to <span class="highlight">maintain</span> a livable body <span class="highlight">temperature</span>. It's hard to understand why they would not be affected, whereas dinosaurs were left too crippled to <span class="question4">cope</span>, especially if, as some scientists believe, dinosaurs were warm-blooded. Critics also point out that the <span class="highlight">shallow</span> seaways had retreated from and <span class="highlight">advanced</span> on the continents <span class="highlight">numerous</span> times during the <span class="highlight">Mesozoic</span>, so why did the dinosaurs <span class="highlight">survive</span> the <span class="highlight">climatic</span> changes <span class="highlight">associated</span> with the earlier <span class="question6">fluctuations</span> but not with this one? Although <span class="highlight">initially</span><span class="highlight">appealing</span>, the <span class="highlight">hypothesis</span> of a simple <span class="highlight">climatic</span> change related to sea levels is <span class="highlight">insufficient</span> to explain all the <span class="highlight">data</span>.</p><p>Dissatisfaction with <span class="highlight">conventional</span> explanations for <span class="highlight">dinosaur</span> extinctions led to a surprising <span class="highlight">observation</span> that, in turn, has suggested a new <span class="highlight">hypothesis</span>. <span class="question7">Many plants and animals disappear <span class="highlight">abruptly</span> from the <span class="highlight">fossil</span><span class="highlight">record</span> as one moves from layers of rock documenting the end of the Cretaceous up into rocks representing the beginning of the Cenozoic (the <span class="highlight">era</span> after the <span class="highlight">Mesozoic</span></span>). Between the last <span class="highlight">layer</span> of Cretaceous rock and the first <span class="highlight">layer</span> of Cenozoic rock, there is often a thin <span class="highlight">layer</span> of <span class="highlight">clay</span>. Scientists felt that they could get an idea of how long the extinctions took by determining how long it took to <span class="highlight">deposit</span> this one centimeter of <span class="highlight">clay</span> and they thought they could <span class="highlight">determine</span> the time it took to <span class="highlight">deposit</span> the <span class="highlight">clay</span> by determining the <span class="highlight">amount</span> of the <span class="highlight">element</span><span class="highlight">iridium</span> (Ir) it contained.</p><p>Ir has not been <span class="highlight">common</span> at Earth's since the very beginning of the <span class="highlight">planet</span>'s <span class="highlight">history</span>. Because it usually exists in a <span class="highlight">metallic</span><span class="highlight">state</span>, 
it was preferentially incorporated in Earth's <span class="highlight">core</span> as the <span class="highlight">planet</span> cooled and consolidated. Ir is found in high concentrations in some meteorites,
in which the <span class="highlight">solar</span> system's <span class="highlight">original</span> chemical <span class="highlight">composition</span> is preserved. <span class="highlight">Even</span> today, <span class="highlight">microscopic</span> meteorites continually <span class="question9">bombard</span> Earth, falling on both land and sea. 
By measuring how many of these meteorites fall to Earth over a <span class="highlight">given</span> period of time, scientists can <span class="highlight">estimate</span> how long it might have taken to <span class="highlight">deposit</span> the observed <span class="highlight">amount</span> of Ir in the <span class="highlight">boundary</span><span class="highlight">clay</span>. 
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> These calculations suggest that a period of about one million years would have been required. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>However, other <span class="highlight">reliable</span><span class="highlight">evidence</span> suggests that the <span class="highlight">deposition</span> of the <span class="highlight">boundary</span><span class="highlight">clay</span> could not 
have taken one million years. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>So the unusually high <span class="highlight">concentration</span> of Ir seems to <span class="highlight">require</span> a <span class="highlight">special</span> explanation. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p><p>In view of these facts, scientists hypothesized that a single large <span class="highlight">asteroid</span>, about 10 to 15 kilometers <span class="highlight">across</span>, collided with Earth, and the resulting fallout created the <span class="highlight">boundary</span><span class="highlight">clay</span>. Their calculations show that the <span class="highlight">impact</span> kicked up a dust cloud that cut off sunlight for several months, inhibiting <span class="highlight">photosynthesis</span> in plants; decreased surface temperatures on continents to below freezing; caused <span class="highlight">extreme</span> episodes of <span class="highlight">acid</span> rain; and <span class="highlight">significantly</span> raised long-term global temperatures <span class="highlight">through</span> the greenhouse effect. This <span class="question11">disruption</span> of food <span class="highlight">chain</span> and <span class="highlight">climate</span> would have eradicated the dinosaurs and other organisms in less than fifty years.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 1, which of the following is true of the Late Cretaceous climate?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Summers were very warm and winters were very cold.</p><p>B. Shallow seas on the continents caused frequent temperature changes.</p><p>C. The climate was very similar to today's climate.</p><p>D. The climate did not change dramatically from season to season.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>Using the Late Cretaceous climate as the key word to locate the fourth last sentence:</p><p>Data from diverse sources, including geochemical evidence preserved in seafloor sediments, indicating that the Late Cretaceous climate was milder than today's. The days were not too hot, nor the nights too cold.</p><p>Said to be milder than it is today, not too hot during the day and not too cold at night. So D is the answer. A is contradictory with the penultimate sentence, wrong; B is contrary to the last sentence, wrong; C said with the current similar, with the original milder contradiction.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the following reasons is suggested in paragraph 2 for the extinction of the dinosaurs?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Changes in the lengths of the days and nights during the late Cretaceous period</p><p>B. Droughts caused by the movement of seaways back into the oceans</p><p>C. The change from mild to severe climates during the Late Cretaceous period</p><p>D. An extreme decrease in the average yearly temperature over 10,ooo years</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C. Using the extinction of the dinosaurs as the key word to the last sentence, the original sentence could not stand the extinction of these extreme temperature dinosaurs. Because of this, so look on the internet and say that the winter is very cold and summer is hot, so C is the answer. A and B did not say; D's decision did not say.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the author mention the survival of "<span class="highlight"><span class="question3">snakes, lizards, turtles, and crocodiles</span></span>" in paragraph 3?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To argue that dinosaurs may have become extinct because they were not cold-blooded animals</p><p>B. To question the adequacy of the hypothesis that climatic change related to sea levels caused the extinction of the dinosaurs</p><p>C. To present examples of animals that could maintain a livable body temperature more easily than dinosaurs</p><p>D. To support a hypothesis that these animals were not as sensitive to climate changes in the Cretaceous period as they are today</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>B, First read the sentence, why animals such as blabla can endure this extreme climate, and this sentence comes to the beginning if true, so it should be the author's questioning the correctness of the conclusions put forward And the last sentence is the central sentence of this paragraph, saying that it is wrong to attribute the cause of climate change to sea level, so the answer is B.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question4">cope</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. adapt</p><p>B. move</p><p>C. continue</p><p>D. compete</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" A"><p>Cope: Cope. A is an adaptation; B is a movement; C is a continuation; D is a competition. So A's adaptation is correct. Corresponding to the original: It's hard to understand why they would not be affected, whereas dinosaurs were left too crippled to <span class="question4">cope</span>, especially if, as some scientists believe, dinosaurs were warm-blooded. The original said it was difficult to understand why other animals were not affected, and Dinosaurs are so weak they can't do anything. The transition shows that the dinosaurs were affected, so it should be easy to spend and so on, so A and C are reliable. As for why not C, they can only rely on understanding.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 3, which of the following is true of changes in climate before the Cretaceous period and the effect of these changes on dinosaurs?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Climate changes associated with the movement of seaways before the Cretaceous period did not cause dinosaurs to become extinct.</p><p>B. Changes in climate before the Cretaceous period caused severe fluctuations in sea level, resulting in the extinction of the dinosaurs.</p><p>C. Frequent changes in climate before the Cretaceous period made dinosaurs better able to maintain a livable body temperature.</p><p>D. Before the Cretaceous period there were few changes in climate, and dinosaurs flourished.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A follows the Cretaceous period keyword, but pay attention to the original corresponding to the penultimate sentence, and ask why the dinosaur survived the previous turmoil and this time there is no, so A is the answer, said before Changes did not cause the extinction of dinosaurs. B said the opposite; C's dinosaurs better able to maintain did not say the original; D's dinosaur flourish did not say so.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question6">fluctuations</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. extremes</p><p>B. retreats</p><p>C. periods</p><p>D. variations</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" D"><p>Fluctuation: <span class="question6">fluctuations</span>, shocks, changes. A is an extreme condition; B is a withdrawal; C is a cycle; D is a change. So D's variation is correct. Corresponding to the original: Critics also point out that the shallow seaways had retreated from and advanced on the continents numerous times during the Mesozoic, so why did the dinosaurs survive the climatic changes associated with the earlier <span class="question6">fluctuations</span> but not with this one? Having survived other climate changes and failed to get through this time, both fluctuation and one refer to change; and it was also said that the sea lane retreats from the land, which is also a change, so the variation is correct; A extreme B retreat C cycle is not right .</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? In correct choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The fossil record suggests that there was an abrupt extinction of many plants and animals at the end of the Mesozoic era.</p><p>B. Few fossils of the Mesozoic era have survived in the rocks that mark the end of the Cretaceous.</p><p>C. Fossils from the Cretaceous period of the Mesozoic up to the beginning of the Cenozoic era have been removed from the layers of rock that surrounded them.</p><p>D. Plants and animals from the Mesozoic era were unable to survive in the Cenozoic era.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>When the original structure of A was blabla, plants and animals suddenly disappeared from the fossils. A correct; B wrong, the original did not say fence fossil; C turned the non-trunk into a trunk, and remove did not say; D option is missing the original fossil information is very important, wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>In paragraph 4, all the following questions are answered EXCEPT:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Why is there a layer of clay between the rocks of the Cretaceous and Cenozoic?</p><p>B. Why were scientists interested in determining how long it took to deposit the layer of clay at the end of the Cretaceous?</p><p>C. What was the effect of the surprising observation scientists made?</p><p>D. Why did scientists want more information about the dinosaur extinctions at the end of the Cretaceous?</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A's layer of clay positioned to the penultimate sentence:</p><p>Between the last layer of Cretaceous rock and the first layer of Cenozoic rock, there is often a thin layer of clay.</p><p>But the original text just said that there is a layer, did not say why, so A's problem has not been answered, choose;</p><p>B's how long and deposit are positioned to the last sentence, correct, not selected:</p><p>Scientists felt that they could get an idea of how long the extinctions took by determined how long it took to deposit this one centimeter of clay and they thought they could determine the time it took to deposit the clay by determining the amount of the element iridium ( Lr) it contained.</p><p>The surprising observation of C corresponds to the first sentence and the second sentence:</p><p>Dissatisfaction with conventional explanations for dinosaur extinctions led to a was that the observation that, in turn, has suggested a new hypothesis.</p><p>C directly corresponds to, correct, not selected; D also corresponds to the first sentence, saying that dissatisfaction with the traditional theory led to an observation and the corresponding hypothesis, so D is correct and not selected.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question9">bombard</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. approach</p><p>B. strike</p><p>C. pass</p><p>D. circle</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>Bombard: <span class="question9">bombard</span>ment, shelling, impact. A is close; B is the strike; C is the pass, D; is the rotation; So B's strike is correct. Corresponding to the original text: Even today, microscopic meteorites, lumps, and on both land and sea. The original sentence says that up to today, those microscopic stars are still on Earth, land and sea. The latter half of the sentence is a supplement to the first half of the sentence and the meaning should be the same. Since it is falling on, then both A and B are likely to be correct. Bomb means bombing, bomb, then B is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Paragraph 5 implies that a special explanation of Ir in the boundary clay is needed because</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. the Ir in microscopic meteorites reaching Earth during the Cretaceous period would have been incorporated into Earth's core</p><p>B. the Ir in the boundary clay was deposited much more than a million years ago</p><p>C. the concentration of Ir in the boundary clay is higher than in microscopic meteorites</p><p>D. the amount of Ir in the boundary clay is too great to have come from microscopic meteorites during the time the boundary clay was deposited</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D Obviously, neither ir nor boundary clay can be used for positioning. Positioning to the last sentence with special explanation, this knowledge repeats the task, and so tells you to look forward. The third and fourth sentences from the bottom of the sentence say: Based on the number of comets that fall into the Earth in a certain period of time, it can be inferred how long it takes to accumulate so many skeletons. It is estimated that it takes millions of years; and the penultimate sentence says: but reliable evidence It shows that it hasn't gone through this long time. Therefore, it can be inferred that such a high level of helium needs further explanation and corresponds to the D option.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question11">disruption</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. exhaustion</p><p>B. disturbance</p><p>C. modification</p><p>D. disappearance</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>Disruption: Interrupted, disturbed. A is depleted and exhausted; B is disturbance, disturbance; C is modified; D is disappearing. So B's disturbance is correct. Corresponding to the original: This <span class="question11">disruption</span> of food chain and the climate would have eradicated the dinosaurs and other organisms in less than fifty years. The original sentence starts with a this, the explanation is related to the previous text, preceded by a very long sentence, saying that an impact is produced A lot of dust cloud, these clouds cut off the sun, hindered the photosynthesis, and did a lot of blabla thing. Therefore, it must be a bad word. C's modification changes its neutrality; it is wrong; A exhaustion and D disappear all say that the food chain is gone, but the original does not say that the food chain has disappeared, and the two words mean too close and are not selected.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Paragraph 6 mentions all of the following effects of the hypothesized asteroid collision EXCEPT</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. a large dust cloud that blocked sunlight</p><p>B. an immediate drop in the surface temperatures of the continents</p><p>C. an extreme decrease in rainfall on the continents</p><p>D. a long-term increase in global temperatures</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C, EXCEPT questions, exclusion. A's dust cloud, B's drop in the surface temperatures, and D's increase in global temperatures can all be located in the second sentence. They are all correct and not selected. C's rainfall is original, wrong, and selected.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Consequently, the idea that the Ir in the boundary clay came from microscopic meteorites cannot be accepted..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Three transition points, boundary clay, Ir, and consequently. According to boundary clay, A/B/C may be the answer. According to Ir, C or D may be the answer, so the initial answer is C. After point A, it said that it takes one million years. The sentence after point B says that there isn't a million years. Therefore, the transition before and after B's transition is tight and B is eliminated. And since there isn't a million years, the previous theory is not valid, so it is to be inserted. When the consequently inserted C in the sentence is causal, C is the answer.</p></div></div><div id="question14" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>For a long time scientists have argued that the extinction of the dinosaurs was related to climate change.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.A simple climate change does not explain some important data related to the extinction of the dinosaurs at the end of the Cretaceous.</p><p>B.The retreat of the seaways at the end of the Cretaceous has not been fully explained.</p><p>C.The abruptness of extinctions at the end of the Cretaceous and the high concentration of Ir found in clay deposited at that time have fueled the development of a new hypothesis.</p><p>D.Extreme changes in daily and seasonal climates preceded the retreat of the seas back into the major ocean basins.</p><p>E.Some scientists hypothesize that the extinction of the dinosaurs resulted from the effects of an asteroid collision with Earth.</p><p>F.Boundary clay layers like the one between the Mesozoic and Cenozoic are used by scientists to determine the rate at which an extinct species declined.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="ACE"><p>The A.C.E a simple option corresponds to the last sentence of the third paragraph of the original text, correct. The retreat option corresponds to the first sentence of the second paragraph of the original text, but it is part of the cause of climate change. The abruptness option corresponds to the first sentence of the fourth paragraph of the original text, correct. The extreme option did not say the original, do not choose. The some option corresponds to the first sentence of the sixth paragraph of the original text, correct. The original clay of the boundary clay option was not selected.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
