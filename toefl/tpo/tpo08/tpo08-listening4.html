Yeah. <span class="time" data-times="5.04" data-time="98.64">[1:38.64]</span>And you know another thing is I think people probably feel good about themselves when they are at the <span class="highlight">gym</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.09" data-time="103.68">[01:43.68]</span>And they can meet new people, socialize. </p>

              <span class="time" data-times="4.27" data-time="105.77">[01:45.77]</span>Pro: Right, so health clubs <span class="highlight">offer</span> high <span class="highlight">quality</span> facilities. <span class="time" data-times="8.98" data-time="110.04">[01:50.04]</span>And also they sell an <span class="highlight">image</span> about people having more fun, relating better to others and improving their own lives if they become members. </p>

              <span class="time" data-times="1.25" data-time="119.02">[01:59.02]</span>Stu: Sure, that makes <span class="highlight">sense</span>. </p>

              <span class="time" data-times="8.44" data-time="151.04">[02:31.04]</span>Stu: Well, they can be, but now with the internet and big book stores, you can probably get what you need without going to a library. </p>

              <span class="time" data-times="1.1" data-time="159.48">[02:39.48]</span>Pro: That's true. <span class="time" data-times="4.38" data-time="160.58">[02:40.58]</span>So if you were the <span class="highlight">director</span> of a public library, what would you do about that? </p>

              <span class="time" data-times="1.83" data-time="164.96">[02:44.96]</span>Stu: To get more people to stop in? <span class="time" data-times="12.02" data-time="166.79">[02:46.79]</span>Well, like you said, better equipment, maybe a super-fast internet connection, and not just a good <span class="highlight">variety</span> of books, but also like nice comfortable areas where people can read and do research. <span class="time" data-times="2.56" data-time="178.81">[02:58.81]</span>Things that make them want to come to the library and stay. </p>
