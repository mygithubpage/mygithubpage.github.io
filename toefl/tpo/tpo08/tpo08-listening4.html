            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.61" data-time="23.53">[00:23.53]</span>Stu: Yeah, you were talking about a <span class="underline">gym</span>... a health <span class="underline">club</span> where people can go to <span class="underline">exercise</span>, that kind of thing. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.48" data-time="29.14">[00:29.14]</span>Pro: Ok, but the health <span class="underline">club</span> model is actually from chapter 5, so... </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.15" data-time="33.62">[00:33.62]</span>Stu: Oh, chapter 5? <span class="time" data-times="3.92" data-time="34.77">[00:34.77]</span>Oh so it not... OK, but I guess I still want to try to understand... </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.26" data-time="38.69">[00:38.69]</span>Pro: Of <span class="underline">course</span>. <span class="time" data-times="11.89" data-time="39.95">[00:39.95]</span>Well, I was talking about an <span class="underline">issue</span> in <span class="underline">strategic</span> marketing, the health <span class="underline">club</span> model; I mean with a health <span class="underline">club</span> you might think they would have trouble attracting customers, right? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.96" data-time="51.84">[00:51.84]</span>Stu: Well, I know when I pass by a health <span class="underline">club</span> and I see all those people working out. <span class="time" data-times="1.15" data-time="55.8">[00:55.80]</span>They're exercising. <span class="time" data-times="1.5" data-time="56.95">[00:56.95]</span>I just as soon walk on by. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.4" data-time="58.45">[00:58.45]</span>Pro: Yes, there is that. <span class="time" data-times="6.36" data-time="59.85">[00:59.85]</span>Plus, lots of people have <span class="underline">exercise</span> equipment at home, or they can play sports with their friends. Right? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="0.69000000000001" data-time="66.21">[01:06.21]</span>Stu: Sure. </p>

              <span class="time" data-times="8.72" data-time="66.9">[01:06.90]</span>Pro: But nowadays, in spite of all that, and expensive membership fees, health clubs are hugely <span class="underline">popular</span>, so how come? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.07" data-time="75.62">[01:15.62]</span>Stu: I guess that is what I didn't understand. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.21" data-time="77.69">[01:17.69]</span>Pro: Ok, basically they have to <span class="underline">offer</span> things that most people can't find anywhere else – (you know) <span class="underline">quality</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9.4" data-time="84.9">[01:24.90]</span>That means better <span class="underline">exercise</span> equipment, high-end <span class="underline">stuff</span>, and classes... <span class="underline">exercise</span> classes, maybe <span class="underline">aerobics</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.34" data-time="94.3">[01:34.30]</span>Stu: I am not sure if I...ok I get it. Yeah. <span class="time" data-times="5.04" data-time="98.64">[1:38.64]</span>And you know another thing is I think people probably feel good about themselves when they are at the <span class="underline">gym</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.09" data-time="103.68">[01:43.68]</span>And they can meet new people, socialize. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.27" data-time="105.77">[01:45.77]</span>Pro: Right, so health clubs <span class="underline">offer</span> high <span class="underline">quality</span> facilities. <span class="time" data-times="8.98" data-time="110.04">[01:50.04]</span>And also they sell an <span class="underline">image</span> about people having more fun, relating better to others and improving their own lives if they become members. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.25" data-time="119.02">[01:59.02]</span>Stu: Sure, that makes <span class="underline">sense</span>. </p>

              <span class="time" data-times="5.48" data-time="120.27">[02:00.27]</span>Pro: Well, then, can you think of another business or <span class="underline">organization</span> that could <span class="underline">benefit</span> from doing this? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.31" data-time="125.75">[02:05.75]</span>Stu: Um... </p>

              <span class="time" data-times="8.99" data-time="127.06">[02:07.06]</span>Pro: Think about an important building on <span class="underline">campus</span> here, something everyone uses, a <span class="underline">major</span> <span class="underline">source</span> of information. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.92" data-time="136.05">[02:16.05]</span>Stu: You mean like an administrative building? </p>

              <span class="time" data-times="2.61" data-time="143.39">[02:23.39]</span>Pro: Exactly, libraries. <span class="time" data-times="5.04" data-time="146">[02:26.00]</span>Imagine public libraries; they're an information <span class="underline">resource</span> for the whole <span class="underline">community</span>, right? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.44" data-time="151.04">[02:31.04]</span>Stu: Well, they can be, but now with the internet and big book stores, you can probably get what you need without going to a library. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.1" data-time="159.48">[02:39.48]</span>Pro: That's true. <span class="time" data-times="4.38" data-time="160.58">[02:40.58]</span>So if you were the <span class="underline">director</span> of a public library, what would you do about that? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.83" data-time="164.96">[02:44.96]</span>Stu: To get more people to stop in? <span class="time" data-times="12.02" data-time="166.79">[02:46.79]</span>Well, like you said, better equipment, maybe a super-fast internet connection, and not just a good <span class="underline">variety</span> of books, but also like nice comfortable areas where people can read and do research. <span class="time" data-times="2.56" data-time="178.81">[02:58.81]</span>Things that make them want to come to the library and stay. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="0.99" data-time="181.37">[03:01.37]</span>Pro: Great! </p>

              <span class="time" data-times="6.64" data-time="182.36">[03:02.36]</span>Stu: Oh, and maybe have authors come and do some readings or ... I don't know, <span class="underline">special</span> presentations. <span class="time" data-times="1.67" data-time="189">[03:09.00]</span>Something people couldn't get at home. </p>
