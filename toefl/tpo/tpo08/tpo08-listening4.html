        <h3>Listening Text</h3>
        <article>
          <p>Narrator: Listen to a conversation between a student and a business professor.</p>
          <p>:Pro: So, Richard... what's up?</p>
          <p>:Stu: Well, I know we have a test coming up on chapters, um...</p>
          <p>:Pro: Chapters 3 and 4 from your textbook.</p>
          <p>:Stu: Right, 3 and 4. Well, I didn't get something you said in class Monday.</p>
          <p>:Pro: Alright. Do you remember what it was about?</p>
          <p>:Stu: Yeah, you were talking about a gym... a health club where people can go to exercise, that kind of thing.</p>
          <p>:Pro: Ok, but the health club model is actually from chapter 5, so...</p>
          <p>:Stu: Oh, chapter 5? Oh so it not... OK, but I guess I still want to try to understand...</p>
          <p>:Pro: Of course. Well, I was talking about an issue in strategic marketing, the health club model; I mean with a health club you might think they would have trouble attracting customers, right?</p>
          <p>:Stu: Well, I know when I pass by a health club and I see all those people working out. They're exercising. I just as soon walk on by.</p>
          <p>:Pro: Yes, there is that. Plus, lots of people have exercise equipment at home, or they can play sports with their friends. Right?</p>
          <p>:Stu: Sure.</p>
          <p>:Pro: But nowadays, in spite of all that, and expensive membership fees, health clubs are hugely popular, so how come?</p>
          <p>:Stu: I guess that is what I didn't understand.</p>
          <p>:Pro: Ok, basically they have to offer things that most people can't find anywhere else - (you know) quality. That means better exercise equipment, high-end stuff, and classes... exercise classes, maybe aerobics.</p>
          <p>:Stu: I am not sure if I...ok I get it. Yeah. [1:38.64]And you know another thing is I think people probably feel good about themselves when they are at the gym. And they can meet new people, socialize.</p>
          <p>:Pro: Right, so health clubs offer high quality facilities. And also they sell an image about people having more fun, relating better to others and improving their own lives if they become members.</p>
          <p>:Stu: Sure, that makes sense.</p>
          <p>:Pro: Well, then, can you think of another business or organization that could benefit from doing this?</p>
          <p>:Stu: Um...</p>
          <p>:Pro: Think about an important building on campus here, something everyone uses, a major source of information.</p>
          <p>:Stu: You mean like an administrative building?</p>
          <p>:Pro: Well, that's not what I had in mind.</p>
          <p>:Stu: Oh, you mean the library!</p>
          <p>:Pro: Exactly, libraries. Imagine public libraries; they're an information resource for the whole community, right?</p>
          <p>:Stu: Well, they can be, but now with the internet and big book stores, you can probably get what you need without going to a library.</p>
          <p>:Pro: That's true. So if you were the director of a public library, what would you do about that?</p>
          <p>:Stu: To get more people to stop in? Well, like you said, better equipment, maybe a super-fast internet connection, and not just a good variety of books, but also like nice comfortable areas where people can read and do research. Things that make them want to come to the library and stay.</p>
          <p>:Pro: Great!</p>
          <p>:Stu: Oh, and maybe have authors come and do some readings or ... I don't know, special presentations. Something people couldn't get at home.</p>
          <p>:Pro: Now, you are getting it.</p>
          <p>:Stu: Thanks, Professor Wilkins. I think too. </p>
