            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.05" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in a <span class="underline">History</span> class.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.62" data-time="7.05">[00:07.05]</span>Pro: So, we've been talking about the printing <span class="underline">press</span>, how it changed people's lives, making books more <span class="underline">accessible</span> to everyone. <span class="time" data-times="2.71" data-time="14.67">[00:14.67]</span>More books meant more reading, right? <span class="time" data-times="3.41" data-time="17.38">[00:17.38]</span>But, as you know, not everyone has <span class="underline">perfect</span> <span class="underline">vision</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.61" data-time="20.79">[00:20.79]</span>This increase in <span class="underline">literacy</span>, um, in reading, led to an increase in demand for eyeglasses. <span class="time" data-times="3.37" data-time="28.4">[00:28.40]</span>And here's something you probably <span class="underline">haven</span>'t thought of. <span class="time" data-times="5.74" data-time="31.77">[00:31.77]</span>This increased demand impacted societal attitudes towards eyeglasses.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.74" data-time="37.51">[00:37.51]</span>But, first let me back up a bit and talk about <span class="underline">vision</span> correction before the printing <span class="underline">press</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.26" data-time="44.25">[00:44.25]</span>And, um, what did people with poor <span class="underline">vision</span> do, I mean, especially those few people who were actually <span class="underline">literate</span>? <span class="time" data-times="3.03" data-time="52.51">[00:52.51]</span>What did they do before glasses were invented? <span class="time" data-times="5.22" data-time="55.54">[00:55.54]</span>Well, they had different ways of dealing with not seeing well.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.5" data-time="60.76">[01:00.76]</span>If you think about it, poor <span class="underline">vision</span> wasn't their only problem. <span class="time" data-times="9.98" data-time="64.26">[01:04.26]</span>I mean, um, think about the conditions they lived in: houses were dark; sometimes there weren't any windows; candles were the only <span class="underline">source</span> of light. <span class="time" data-times="10.96" data-time="74.24">[01:14.24]</span>So, in some places, um, like <span class="underline">ancient</span> Greece, for example, the wealthiest people with poor <span class="underline">vision</span> could have someone else read to them – easy <span class="underline">solution</span> if you could <span class="underline">afford</span> it.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.92" data-time="85.2">[01:25.20]</span>Another <span class="underline">solution</span> was something called a "reading stone". <span class="time" data-times="9.67" data-time="90.12">[01:30.12]</span>Around 1000 C.E., European monks would take a piece of <span class="underline">clear</span> rock, often <span class="underline">quartz</span>, and place it on top of the reading <span class="underline">material</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.23" data-time="99.79">[01:39.79]</span>The <span class="underline">clear</span> rock magnified the letters, making them <span class="underline">appear</span> larger. <span class="time" data-times="5.38" data-time="104.02">[01:44.02]</span>Um, well, it's like what happens when a <span class="underline">drop</span> of water falls on something. <span class="time" data-times="3.11" data-time="109.4">[01:49.40]</span>Whatever's below the <span class="underline">drop</span> of water appears larger, right? <span class="time" data-times="2.93" data-time="112.51">[01:52.51]</span>Well, the "reading stone" works in a <span class="underline">similar</span> way.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.25" data-time="115.44">[01:55.44]</span>But rocks like <span class="underline">quartz</span>, well, <span class="underline">quartz</span> of <span class="underline">optical</span> <span class="underline">quality</span> weren't cheap. <span class="time" data-times="5.24" data-time="120.69">[02:00.69]</span>Late in the 13th <span class="underline">century</span>, glass makers in Italy came up with a less expensive <span class="underline">alternative</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4" data-time="125.93">[02:05.93]</span>They made reading stones out of <span class="underline">clear</span> glass. <span class="time" data-times="5.44" data-time="129.93">[02:09.93]</span>And these <span class="underline">clear</span> glass reading stones evolved into the eyeglasses we know today. <span class="time" data-times="8.04" data-time="135.37">[02:15.37]</span>So we're <span class="underline">pretty</span> sure that glasses were invented about the late 1200's, well, over a hundred years before the printing <span class="underline">press</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.16" data-time="143.41">[02:23.41]</span>But it's not <span class="underline">clear</span> who exactly invented them first or exactly what year. <span class="time" data-times="5.59" data-time="150.57">[02:30.57]</span>But <span class="underline">record</span> showed that they were invented in both Europe and China at about the same time. <span class="time" data-times="4.02" data-time="156.16">[02:36.16]</span>By the way, we call this "<span class="underline">independent</span> discovery". <span class="time" data-times="9.25" data-time="160.18">[02:40.18]</span> <span class="underline">Independent</span> discovery means when something is invented in different parts of the world at the same time and it's not as unusual as it sounds. <span class="time" data-times="11.34" data-time="169.43">[02:49.43]</span>You can look at the timeline charts in the back of your textbook to see when things were invented in different cultures at about the same time to see what I'm talking about.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.74" data-time="180.77">[03:00.77]</span>So now let's tie this to what I've said before about societal attitudes towards glasses. <span class="time" data-times="6.79" data-time="187.51">[03:07.51]</span>Initially, in parts of Europe and in China, glasses were a <span class="underline">symbol</span> of wisdom and <span class="underline">intelligence</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.19" data-time="194.3">[03:14.30]</span>This is <span class="underline">evident</span> in the artwork from the period. <span class="time" data-times="6.5" data-time="197.49">[03:17.49]</span>European paintings often portrayed doctors or judges wearing glasses. <span class="time" data-times="2.61" data-time="203.99">[03:23.99]</span>In China, glasses were very expensive.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.64" data-time="206.6">[03:26.60]</span>So in <span class="underline">addition</span> to <span class="underline">intelligence</span>, they also <span class="underline">symbolize</span> affluence, um, wealth. <span class="time" data-times="7.6" data-time="212.24">[03:32.24]</span>In 14th-century Chinese portraits, the bigger the glasses, the smarter and wealthier the <span class="underline">subject</span> was. <span class="time" data-times="3.01" data-time="219.84">[03:39.84]</span>So glasses were a <span class="underline">status</span> <span class="underline">symbol</span> in some parts of the world.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.91" data-time="222.85">[03:42.85]</span>Now let's get back to the invention of the painting <span class="underline">press</span> in 1440. <span class="time" data-times="1.2" data-time="227.76">[03:47.76]</span>What happened? <span class="time" data-times="4.91" data-time="228.96">[03:48.96]</span>Suddenly, books became <span class="underline">readily</span> <span class="underline">available</span> and more people <span class="underline">wanted</span> to read. <span class="time" data-times="7.16" data-time="233.87">[03:53.87]</span>So the need, oh well, actually not only the need but the demand for more <span class="underline">affordable</span> glasses rose <span class="underline">drastically</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.67" data-time="241.03">[04:01.03]</span>Eventually, inexpensive glasses were produced, and then glasses were <span class="underline">available</span> to everyone. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="246.7">[04:06.70]</span>People could <span class="underline">purchase</span> them easily from a traveling peddler.</p>
