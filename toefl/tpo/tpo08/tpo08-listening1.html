              <span class="time" data-times="8.43" data-time="37.9">[00:37.90]</span>Pro: Well, then you know you need 48 credits in your <span class="underline">major</span> <span class="underline">field</span> to graduate and at <span class="underline">least</span> 24 credits at the <span class="underline">intermediate</span> <span class="underline">level</span> or higher. <span class="time" data-times="7.43" data-time="46.33">[00:46.33]</span>Also, after your <span class="underline">second</span> year, you have to meet with your <span class="underline">department</span> chair to <span class="underline">outline</span> a plan for the rest of your time here. <span class="time" data-times="10.08" data-time="53.76">[00:53.76]</span>In the past, we also <span class="underline">issue</span> letters before students' final year began to let them know what they needed to take in the final year to be OK, but we don't do that anymore.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.4" data-time="63.84">[01:03.84]</span>Stu: I <span class="underline">definitely</span> met with my chairperson 2 years ago. <span class="time" data-times="6.22" data-time="67.24">[01:07.24]</span>He told me that I needed 8 more courses at the <span class="underline">intermediate</span> <span class="underline">level</span> or higher in the last 2 years to be OK. <span class="time" data-times="3.29" data-time="73.46">[01:13.46]</span>So I am not sure what the problem is. <span class="time" data-times="2.09" data-time="76.75">[01:16.75]</span>I make sure I got those credits.</p>
            <p>

              <span class="time" data-times="5.18" data-time="85.52">[01:25.52]</span>Stu: It could be that I have taken 2 <span class="underline">basic</span> courses but coupled both of them with, uh, <span class="underline">field</span> experiences.</p>

              <span class="time" data-times="7.95" data-time="92.21">[01:32.21]</span>Stu: Well, I could only take intro courses because there were no <span class="underline">intermediate</span> <span class="underline">level</span> courses <span class="underline">available</span> for those <span class="underline">particular</span> topics. <span class="time" data-times="8.77" data-time="100.16">[01:40.16]</span>My chair person told me that if I did <span class="underline">independent</span> <span class="underline">field</span> research in <span class="underline">addition</span> to the assigned work in each <span class="underline">course</span>, they would <span class="underline">count</span> as <span class="underline">intermediate</span> <span class="underline">level</span> courses. <span class="time" data-times="11.31" data-time="108.93">[01:48.93]</span>My classmates, um, some of my classmates, did this for an easy way to meet their <span class="underline">intermediate</span> <span class="underline">course</span> requirement, but I did it to get the kind of depth in those topics I was going for. <span class="time" data-times="2.88" data-time="120.24">[02:00.24]</span>As it turned out I really enjoyed the <span class="underline">field</span> work. <span class="time" data-times="2.82" data-time="123.12">[02:03.12]</span>It was a nice <span class="underline">supplement</span> to just sitting and listening to lectures.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.41" data-time="125.94">[02:05.94]</span>Pro: I am sure that's true, but the computer is still showing them as <span class="underline">basic</span> <span class="underline">level</span> courses despite the <span class="underline">field</span> work.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.24" data-time="132.35">[02:12.35]</span>Stu: I am not sure what to do then. <span class="time" data-times="3.34" data-time="134.59">[02:14.59]</span>I mean, should I <span class="underline">cancel</span> my graduation party?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.11" data-time="137.93">[02:17.93]</span>Pro: No, no <span class="underline">reason</span> to get worried like that. <span class="time" data-times="2.92" data-time="141.04">[02:21.04]</span>Just <span class="underline">contact</span> your chair person immediately, ok? <span class="time" data-times="7.76" data-time="143.96">[02:23.96]</span>Tell him to call me as soon as possible so that we can <span class="underline">verify</span> your <span class="underline">field</span> work arrangement and certify those credits right away. <span class="time" data-times="2.88" data-time="151.72">[02:31.72]</span>It's not like there is an actual <span class="underline">deadline</span> to <span class="underline">date</span> or anything. <span class="time" data-times="6.94" data-time="154.6">[02:34.60]</span>But if more than a few weeks go by, we might have a real problem that would very difficult to <span class="underline">fix</span> in time for you to graduate. <span class="time" data-times="3.11" data-time="161.54">[02:41.54]</span>In fact, there probably would be nothing we could do.</p>
