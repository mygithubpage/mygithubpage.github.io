          <h4 class="w3-center">Running Water on Mars</h4>
          <p>
            <span class="highlight">Photographic</span>
            <span class="highlight">evidence</span> suggests that <span class="highlight">liquid</span> water once existed in great <span class="highlight">quantity</span> on the surface of Mars. Two types of flow features are seen: <span class="highlight">runoff</span> channels and outflow channels. <span class="highlight">Runoff</span> channels are found in the southern highlands. These flow features are <span class="highlight">extensive</span> systems-sometimes hundreds of kilometers in total length-of interconnecting, twisting channels that <span class="highlight">seem</span> to <span class="highlight question1">merge</span> into larger, wider channels. They <span class="highlight">bear</span> a strong resemblance to river systems on Earth, and geologists think that they are dried-up beds of long-gone rivers that once carried <span class="highlight">rainfall</span> on Mars from the mountains down into the valleys. <span class="highlight">Runoff</span> channels on Mars speak of a time 4 billion years ago (the age of the Martian highlands), when the <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span> was thicker, the surface warmer, and <span class="highlight">liquid</span> water <span class="highlight">widespread</span>.</p>
          <p>Outflow channels are probably <span class="question3">relics</span> of <span class="highlight">catastrophic</span> flooding on Mars long ago. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>They <span class="highlight">appear</span> only in <span class="highlight">equatorial</span> regions and generally do not form <span class="highlight">extensive</span> interconnected networks.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> <span class="highlight">Instead</span>, they are probably the paths taken by huge volumes of water draining from the southern highlands into the northern plains. 
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>The onrushing water arising from these <span class="highlight">flash</span> floods 
likely also formed the <span class="highlight">odd</span> teardrop-shaped "islands" (resembling the <span class="question4">miniature</span> versions seen in the wet sand of our beaches at low <span class="highlight">tide</span>) that have been found on the plains close to the
ends of the outflow channels. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>Judging from the width and depth of the channels, the flow rates must have been truly <span class="highlight">enormous</span>-perhaps as much as a hundred times greater than the 105 tons per 
<span class="highlight">second</span> carried by the great Amazon river. Flooding shaped the outflow channels <span class="highlight">approximately</span> 3 billion years ago, about the same times as the northern <span class="highlight">volcanic</span> plains formed.</p>
          <p>Some scientists <span class="highlight">speculate</span> that Mars may have enjoyed an extended early Period during which rivers, lakes, and perhaps <span class="highlight">even</span> oceans adorned its surface. A 2003 Mars Global <span class="highlight">Surveyor</span> <span class="highlight">image</span> shows what <span class="highlight">mission</span> specialists think may be a <span class="highlight">delta</span>-a fan-shaped network of channels and sediments where a river once flowed into a larger body of water, in this case a lake filling a <span class="highlight">crater</span> in the southern highlands. Other researchers go <span class="highlight">even</span> further, suggesting that the <span class="highlight">data</span> provide <span class="highlight">evidence</span> for large open expenses of water on the early Martian surface. A computer-generated view of the Martian north <span class="highlight">polar</span> <span class="highlight">region</span> shows the <span class="highlight">extent</span> of what may have been an <span class="highlight">ancient</span> ocean covering much of the northern lowlands. The Hellas <span class="highlight">Basin</span>, which measures some 3,000 kilometers <span class="highlight">across</span> and has a floor that lies nearly 9 kilometers below the <span class="highlight">basin</span>'s rim, is another <span class="highlight">candidate</span> for an <span class="highlight">ancient</span> Martian sea.</p>
          <p>These ideas <span class="highlight">remain</span> <span class="highlight">controversial</span>. Proponents point to features such as the terraced "beaches" shown in one <span class="highlight">image</span>, which could <span class="highlight">conceivably</span> have been left behind as a lake or ocean evaporated and the shoreline receded. <span class="question9">But detractors <span class="highlight">maintain</span> that the terraces could also have been created by geological <span class="highlight">activity</span>, perhaps related to the geologic forces that depressed the Northern Hemisphere far below the <span class="highlight">level</span> of the south, in which case they have nothing whatever to do with Martian water.</span> Furthermore, Mars Global <span class="highlight">Surveyor</span> <span class="highlight">data</span> released in 2003 <span class="highlight">seem</span> to <span class="highlight">indicate</span> that the Martian surface contains too few <span class="highlight">carbonate</span> rock layers-layers containing compounds of <span class="highlight">carbon</span> and <span class="highlight">oxygen</span>-that should have been formed in <span class="highlight">abundance</span> in an <span class="highlight">ancient</span> ocean. Their <span class="highlight">absence</span> supports the picture of a cold, dry Mars that never experienced the extended <span class="highlight">mild</span> period required to form lakes and oceans. However, more recent <span class="highlight">data</span> <span class="highlight">imply</span> that at <span class="highlight">least</span> some parts of the <span class="highlight">planet</span> did in fact experience long periods in the past during which <span class="highlight">liquid</span> water existed on the surface.</p>
          <p>Aside from some small-scale gullies (channels) found since 2000, which are <span class="highlight">inconclusive</span>, astronomers have no direct <span class="highlight">evidence</span> for <span class="highlight">liquid</span> water anywhere on the surface of Mars today, and the <span class="highlight">amount</span> of water <span class="highlight">vapor</span> in the Martian <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span> is tiny. Yet <span class="highlight">even</span> <span class="highlight">setting</span> aside the unproven <span class="question11">hints</span> of <span class="highlight">ancient</span> oceans, the <span class="highlight">extent</span> of the outflow channels suggests that a huge total <span class="highlight">volume</span> of water existed on Mars in the past. Where did all the water go? The answer may be that <span class="highlight">virtually</span> all the water on Mars is now locked in the permafrost <span class="highlight">layer</span> under the surface, with more contained in the <span class="highlight">planet</span>'s <span class="highlight">polar</span> caps.</p>

              <p>Merge: Merge. A is an expansion; B is a separation; C is a correction, leveling; D is a combination. So D's combine is correct. The original text: These flow features are extensive systems--sometimes hundreds of kilometers in total length--of interconnecting, twisting channels that seem to merge into larger, wider channels. The original sentence says how those interconnecting, twisting channels become big The wider channel, merge should mean bigger. The expand and combine may be correct.
