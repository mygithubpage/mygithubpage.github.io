            <b>Running Water on Mars</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>
            <span class="underline">Photographic</span>
            <span class="underline">evidence</span> suggests that <span class="underline">liquid</span> water once existed in great <span class="underline">quantity</span> on the surface of Mars. Two types of flow features are seen: <span class="underline">runoff</span> channels and outflow channels. <span class="underline">Runoff</span> channels are found in the southern highlands. These flow features are <span class="underline">extensive</span> systems-sometimes hundreds of kilometers in total length-of interconnecting, twisting channels that <span class="underline">seem</span> to <span class="light">merge</span> into larger, wider channels. They <span class="underline">bear</span> a strong resemblance to river systems on Earth, and geologists think that they are dried-up beds of long-gone rivers that once carried <span class="underline">rainfall</span> on Mars from the mountains down into the valleys. <span class="underline">Runoff</span> channels on Mars speak of a time 4 billion years ago (the age of the Martian highlands), when the <span class="underline">atmosphere</span> was thicker, the surface warmer, and <span class="underline">liquid</span> water <span class="underline">widespread</span>.</p>
          <p>Outflow channels are probably relics of <span class="underline">catastrophic</span> flooding on Mars long ago. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>They <span class="underline">appear</span> only in <span class="underline">equatorial</span> regions and generally do not form <span class="underline">extensive</span> interconnected networks.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> <span class="underline">Instead</span>, they are probably the paths taken by huge volumes of water draining from the southern highlands into the northern plains. 
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>The onrushing water arising from these <span class="underline">flash</span> floods 
likely also formed the <span class="underline">odd</span> teardrop-shaped "islands" (resembling the miniature versions seen in the wet sand of our beaches at low <span class="underline">tide</span>) that have been found on the plains close to the
ends of the outflow channels. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>Judging from the width and depth of the channels, the flow rates must have been truly <span class="underline">enormous</span>-perhaps as much as a hundred times greater than the 105 tons per 
<span class="underline">second</span> carried by the great Amazon river. Flooding shaped the outflow channels <span class="underline">approximately</span> 3 billion years ago, about the same times as the northern <span class="underline">volcanic</span> plains formed.</p>
          <p>Some scientists <span class="underline">speculate</span> that Mars may have enjoyed an extended early Period during which rivers, lakes, and perhaps <span class="underline">even</span> oceans adorned its surface. A 2003 Mars Global <span class="underline">Surveyor</span> <span class="underline">image</span> shows what <span class="underline">mission</span> specialists think may be a <span class="underline">delta</span>-a fan-shaped network of channels and sediments where a river once flowed into a larger body of water, in this case a lake filling a <span class="underline">crater</span> in the southern highlands. Other researchers go <span class="underline">even</span> further, suggesting that the <span class="underline">data</span> provide <span class="underline">evidence</span> for large open expenses of water on the early Martian surface. A computer-generated view of the Martian north <span class="underline">polar</span> <span class="underline">region</span> shows the <span class="underline">extent</span> of what may have been an <span class="underline">ancient</span> ocean covering much of the northern lowlands. The Hellas <span class="underline">Basin</span>, which measures some 3,000 kilometers <span class="underline">across</span> and has a floor that lies nearly 9 kilometers below the <span class="underline">basin</span>'s rim, is another <span class="underline">candidate</span> for an <span class="underline">ancient</span> Martian sea.</p>
          <p>These ideas <span class="underline">remain</span> <span class="underline">controversial</span>. Proponents point to features such as the terraced "beaches" shown in one <span class="underline">image</span>, which could <span class="underline">conceivably</span> have been left behind as a lake or ocean evaporated and the shoreline receded. But detractors <span class="underline">maintain</span> that the terraces could also have been created by geological <span class="underline">activity</span>, perhaps related to the geologic forces that depressed the Northern Hemisphere far below the <span class="underline">level</span> of the south, in which case they have nothing whatever to do with Martian water. Furthermore, Mars Global <span class="underline">Surveyor</span> <span class="underline">data</span> released in 2003 <span class="underline">seem</span> to <span class="underline">indicate</span> that the Martian surface contains too few <span class="underline">carbonate</span> rock layers-layers containing compounds of <span class="underline">carbon</span> and <span class="underline">oxygen</span>-that should have been formed in <span class="underline">abundance</span> in an <span class="underline">ancient</span> ocean. Their <span class="underline">absence</span> supports the picture of a cold, dry Mars that never experienced the extended <span class="underline">mild</span> period required to form lakes and oceans. However, more recent <span class="underline">data</span> <span class="underline">imply</span> that at <span class="underline">least</span> some parts of the <span class="underline">planet</span> did in fact experience long periods in the past during which <span class="underline">liquid</span> water existed on the surface.</p>
          <p>Aside from some small-scale gullies (channels) found since 2000, which are <span class="underline">inconclusive</span>, astronomers have no direct <span class="underline">evidence</span> for <span class="underline">liquid</span> water anywhere on the surface of Mars today, and the <span class="underline">amount</span> of water <span class="underline">vapor</span> in the Martian <span class="underline">atmosphere</span> is tiny. Yet <span class="underline">even</span> <span class="underline">setting</span> aside the unproven hints of <span class="underline">ancient</span> oceans, the <span class="underline">extent</span> of the outflow channels suggests that a huge total <span class="underline">volume</span> of water existed on Mars in the past. Where did all the water go? The answer may be that <span class="underline">virtually</span> all the water on Mars is now locked in the permafrost <span class="underline">layer</span> under the surface, with more contained in the <span class="underline">planet</span>'s <span class="underline">polar</span> caps.</p>
