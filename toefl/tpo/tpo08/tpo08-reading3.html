Two types of flow features are seen: <span class="highlight">runoff</span> channels and outflow channels. <span class="highlight">Runoff</span> channels are found in the southern highlands. These flow features are <span class="highlight">extensive</span> systems-sometimes hundreds of kilometers in total length-of interconnecting, twisting channels that <span class="highlight">seem</span> to <span class="highlight question1">merge</span> into larger, wider channels. They <span class="highlight">bear</span> a strong resemblance to river systems on Earth, and geologists think that they are dried-up beds of long-gone rivers that once carried <span class="highlight">rainfall</span> on Mars from the mountains down into the valleys. <span class="highlight">Runoff</span> channels on Mars speak of a time 4 billion years ago (the age of the Martian highlands), when the <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span> was thicker, the surface warmer, and <span class="highlight">liquid</span> water <span class="highlight">widespread</span>.</p><p>Outflow channels are probably <span class="question3">relics</span> of <span class="highlight">catastrophic</span> flooding on Mars long ago. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>They <span class="highlight">appear</span> only in <span class="highlight">equatorial</span> regions and generally do not form <span class="highlight">extensive</span> interconnected networks.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span><span class="highlight">Instead</span>, they are probably the paths taken by huge volumes of water draining from the southern highlands into the northern plains. 
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>The onrushing water arising from these <span class="highlight">flash</span> floods 
likely also formed the <span class="highlight">odd</span> teardrop-shaped "islands" (resembling the <span class="question4">miniature</span> versions seen in the wet sand of our beaches at low <span class="highlight">tide</span>) that have been found on the plains close to the
ends of the outflow channels. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>Judging from the width and depth of the channels, the flow rates must have been truly <span class="highlight">enormous</span>-perhaps as much as a hundred times greater than the 105 tons per 
<span class="highlight">second</span> carried by the great Amazon river. Flooding shaped the outflow channels <span class="highlight">approximately</span> 3 billion years ago, about the same times as the northern <span class="highlight">volcanic</span> plains formed.</p><p>Some scientists <span class="highlight">speculate</span> that Mars may have enjoyed an extended early Period during which rivers, lakes, and perhaps <span class="highlight">even</span> oceans adorned its surface. A 2003 Mars Global <span class="highlight">Surveyor</span><span class="highlight">image</span> shows what <span class="highlight">mission</span> specialists think may be a <span class="highlight">delta</span>-a fan-shaped network of channels and sediments where a river once flowed into a larger body of water, in this case a lake filling a <span class="highlight">crater</span> in the southern highlands. Other researchers go <span class="highlight">even</span> further, suggesting that the <span class="highlight">data</span> provide <span class="highlight">evidence</span> for large open expenses of water on the early Martian surface. A computer-generated view of the Martian north <span class="highlight">polar</span><span class="highlight">region</span> shows the <span class="highlight">extent</span> of what may have been an <span class="highlight">ancient</span> ocean covering much of the northern lowlands. The Hellas <span class="highlight">Basin</span>, which measures some 3,000 kilometers <span class="highlight">across</span> and has a floor that lies nearly 9 kilometers below the <span class="highlight">basin</span>'s rim, is another <span class="highlight">candidate</span> for an <span class="highlight">ancient</span> Martian sea.</p><p>These ideas <span class="highlight">remain</span><span class="highlight">controversial</span>. Proponents point to features such as the terraced "beaches" shown in one <span class="highlight">image</span>, which could <span class="highlight">conceivably</span> have been left behind as a lake or ocean evaporated and the shoreline receded. <span class="question9">But detractors <span class="highlight">maintain</span> that the terraces could also have been created by geological <span class="highlight">activity</span>, perhaps related to the geologic forces that depressed the Northern Hemisphere far below the <span class="highlight">level</span> of the south, in which case they have nothing whatever to do with Martian water.</span> Furthermore, Mars Global <span class="highlight">Surveyor</span><span class="highlight">data</span> released in 2003 <span class="highlight">seem</span> to <span class="highlight">indicate</span> that the Martian surface contains too few <span class="highlight">carbonate</span> rock layers-layers containing compounds of <span class="highlight">carbon</span> and <span class="highlight">oxygen</span>-that should have been formed in <span class="highlight">abundance</span> in an <span class="highlight">ancient</span> ocean. Their <span class="highlight">absence</span> supports the picture of a cold, dry Mars that never experienced the extended <span class="highlight">mild</span> period required to form lakes and oceans. However, more recent <span class="highlight">data</span><span class="highlight">imply</span> that at <span class="highlight">least</span> some parts of the <span class="highlight">planet</span> did in fact experience long periods in the past during which <span class="highlight">liquid</span> water existed on the surface.</p><p>Aside from some small-scale gullies (channels) found since 2000, which are <span class="highlight">inconclusive</span>, astronomers have no direct <span class="highlight">evidence</span> for <span class="highlight">liquid</span> water anywhere on the surface of Mars today, and the <span class="highlight">amount</span> of water <span class="highlight">vapor</span> in the Martian <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span> is tiny. Yet <span class="highlight">even</span><span class="highlight">setting</span> aside the unproven <span class="question11">hints</span> of <span class="highlight">ancient</span> oceans, the <span class="highlight">extent</span> of the outflow channels suggests that a huge total <span class="highlight">volume</span> of water existed on Mars in the past. Where did all the water go? The answer may be that <span class="highlight">virtually</span> all the water on Mars is now locked in the permafrost <span class="highlight">layer</span> under the surface, with more contained in the <span class="highlight">planet</span>'s <span class="highlight">polar</span> caps.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">merge</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. expand</p><p>B. separate</p><p>C. straighten out</p><p>D. combine</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>Merge: Merge. A is an expansion; B is a separation; C is a correction, leveling; D is a combination. So D's combine is correct. The original text: These flow features are extensive systems--sometimes hundreds of kilometers in total length--of interconnecting, twisting channels that seem to merge into larger, wider channels. The original sentence says how those interconnecting, twisting channels become big The wider channel, merge should mean bigger. The expand and combine may be correct. Which specific pair can only rely on understanding.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the discussion in paragraph 1 of runoff channels in the southern highlands suggest about Mars?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The atmosphere of Mars was once thinner than it is today.</p><p>B. Large amounts of rain once fell on parts of Mars.</p><p>C. The river systems of Mars were once more extensive than Earth's.</p><p>D. The rivers of Mars began to dry up about 4 billion years ago.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B uses the keywords of runoff channels and southern highlands to locate the third sentence. However, the question asks what is indicated. The sentence where the keyword is located is obviously not stated. Then this paragraph says a lot of the characteristics of this channel until the end. One sentence says speak of blabla, the answer is in the last sentence, B is correct; A and D say the opposite; C did not say.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question3">relics</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. remains</p><p>B. sites</p><p>C. requirements</p><p>D. sources</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" A"><p>A, <span class="question3">relics</span>: remains, remnants. A is a remnant; B is a site; C is a requirement; D is a resource. So the remainder of A is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question4">miniature</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. temporary</p><p>B. small</p><p>C. multiple</p><p>D. familiar</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>B <span class="question4">miniature</span>: Small, thumbnail, small model, so B's small is correct. Look at the word itself, the first half is a mini, it means a small, mini, so I guess it is related to the small. A is temporary; C is multiple and diverse; D is familiar.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>In paragraph 2, why does the author include the information that 105 tons of water flow through the Amazon river per second?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To emphasize the great size of the volume of water that seems to have flowed through Mars' outflow channels</p><p>B. To indicate data used by scientists to estimate how long ago Mars' outflow channels were formed</p><p>C. To argue that flash floods on Mars may have been powerful enough to cause tear-shaped "islands" to form</p><p>D. To argue that the force of flood waters on Mars was powerful enough to shape the northern volcanic plains</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A. The rhetorical question, look forward, there is a dash before the sentence repair point, to prove that 105 ton is to explain the content of the previous. Before saying that the water flow of those channels is very large, then immediately there is a 105 ton example, so the answer is A.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 2, all of the following are true of the outflow channels on Mars EXCEPT:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They formed at around the same time that volcanic activity was occurring on the northern plains.</p><p>B. They are found only on certain parts of the Martian surface.</p><p>C. They sometimes empty onto what appear to have once been the wet sands of tidal beaches.</p><p>D. They are thought to have carried water northward from the equatorial regions.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C EXCEPT questions, exclusion. A's volcanic activity is keyword-targeted to the last sentence, correct, not selected; B's certain parts are synonymous with the original sentence's second sentence's equatorial regions, are correct, not selected; C's beaches are targeted to the penultimate sentence , but the original text says that the island formed by the flood is shaped like the sand on the beach. It is different from what C said. So C is wrong and it is chosen; D's northward is targeted to the third sentence, and then the second sentence shows that D is correct. Do not choose.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>All of the following questions about geological features on Mars are answered in paragraph 3 EXCEPT:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. What are some regions of Mars that may have once been covered with an ocean?</p><p>B. Where do mission scientists believe that the river forming the delta emptied?</p><p>C. Approximately how many craters on Mars do mission scientists believe may once have been lakes filled with water?</p><p>D. During what period of Mars' history do some scientists think it may have had large bodies of water?</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>D EXCEPT questions, exclusion. A region's keywords are positioned to the second half of the second sentence and the penultimate sentence, correct, not selected; B's delta keyword positioning to the second sentence of the original, correct, not selected; C craters to do the keyword Positioned to the second sentence, but the original only said that there were craters filled, did not say a few, so C wrong, election; D's large bodies of water and the original sentence of the first sentence of the synonyms, lakes and even oceans synonymous, correct , do not choose.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 3, images of Mars' surface have been interpreted as support for the idea that</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. the polar regions of Mars were once more extensive than they are now</p><p>B. a large part of the northern lowlands may once have been under water</p><p>C. deltas were once a common feature of the Martian landscape</p><p>D. the shape of the Hellas Basin has changed considerably over time</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>D exclusion. A's polar keyword positioning to the penultimate sentence, the original did not say more extensive than now, wrong, not selected; the same time saying that the northern lowland may be an ancient ocean, and the B option is said to be synonymous under water Now, so B is correct, choose; C deltas do keyword positioning to the second sentence, the original did not say common, wrong, not selected; D's proper noun positioning to the last sentence, did not say change, wrong, not selected.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. But detractors argue that geological activity may be responsible for the water associated with the terraces.</p><p>B. But detractors argue that the terraces may have been formed by geological activity rather than by the presence of water.</p><p>C. But detractors argue that the terraces may be related to geological forces in the Northern Hemisphere of Mars, rather than to Martian water in the south.</p><p>D. But detractors argue that geological forces depressed the Northern Hemisphere so far below the level of the south that the terraces could not have been formed by water.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The B clause sets a parallel sentence. The original sentence says that detractors think that the terrace is formed by geological activities rather than water. A mistake, water and geological activities are two sides of equivalence, not causality; B is correct; C's southern and northern steal the original concept, the content is chaotic, wrong; D is similar to A's mistake, the original geological activity and water is The relationship between the opposites is not the so-called cause and effect relationship of the so that it is here.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, what do the 2003 Global Surveyor data suggest about Mars?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Ancient oceans on Mars contained only small amounts of carbon.</p><p>B. The climate of Mars may not have been suitable for the formation of large bodies of water.</p><p>C. Liquid water may have existed on some parts of Mars' surface for long periods of time.</p><p>D. The ancient oceans that formed on Mars dried up during periods of cold, dry weather.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B. Using the 2003 Global Surveyor data as a key word to position the fourth sentence, saying that there is no carbonate, and carbonate is often found in the ocean, that is to say there is no ocean on Mars, and the next sentence says cold dry to Mars, so B is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question11">hints</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. clues</p><p>B. features</p><p>C. arguments</p><p>D. effects</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" A"><p>Hint: hint, hint. A is a clue; B is a feature; C is a demonstration; D is an effect. So A's clue is correct. Corresponding to the original: Yet even setting aside the unproven <span class="question11">hints</span> of ancient oceans, the extent of the outflow channels proposed that a huge total volume of water existed on Mars in the past. The original sentence says to put the unconfirmed In addition to some gully discovered in the year, astronomers have no direct evidence, followed by saying that the unconfirmed ones are definitely evidence and the like, and the B features C argued that D was not right.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>These landscape features differ from runoff channels in a number of ways..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A, two transition points, these landscape features and a number of ways, pay special attention to a number of ways should be a summary of the sentence, so it should be inserted as far as possible, followed by a few words in the statement outflow and runoff channel different So A is correct. These landscape features refer to the previous <span class="question3">relics</span> of catastrophic flooding.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>There is much debate concerning whether Mars once had water.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.Mars' runoff and outflow channels are large-scale, distinctive features that suggest that large quantities of liquid water once flowed on Mars.</p><p>B.Although some researchers claim that Mars may once have had oceans, others dispute this, pointing to an absence of evidence or offering alternative interpretations of evidence.</p><p>C.Various types of images have been used to demonstrate that most of Martian surface contains evidence of flowing water.</p><p>D.The runoff and outflow channels of Mars apparently carried a higher volume of water and formed more extensive networks than do Earth's river systems.</p><p>E.There is very little evidence of liquid water on Mars today, and it is assumed that all the water that once existed on the planet is frozen beneath its surface.</p><p>F.While numerous gullies have been discovered on Mars since 2000, many astronomers dismiss them as evidence that Mars once had liquid water.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="ABE"><p>The ABE Mars option corresponds to the first paragraph of the first paragraph of the original text and the first sentence of the second paragraph, correct. The options, which correspond to the first sentence of the third and fourth paragraphs of the original text, are correct. The MS option corresponds to the first sentence of the first paragraph, but the original does not say that the photo has a different type. The runoff option MS corresponds to the penultimate sentence of the first paragraph, but the original text does not compare Mars with the earth. The There is option corresponds to the first sentence and the last sentence of the fifth paragraph, correct. The While option MS corresponds to the first sentence of the fifth paragraph, but the original says no evidence, and the answer says dismiss the evidence, say, wrong.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
