The Chevalier was a somewhat controversial figure, but since he met many famous people, including kings and writers, his memoir has become a valuable historical source about European society in the eighteenth century. However, some critics have raised doubts about the accuracy of the memoir. They claim that the Chevalier distorted or invented many events in the memoir to make his life seem more exciting and glamorous than it really was.</p><p>For example, in his memoir the Chevalier claims that while living in Switzerland, he was very wealthy, and it is known that he spent a great deal of money there on parties and gambling. However, evidence has recently surfaced that the Chevalier borrowed considerable sums of money from a Swiss merchant. Critics thus argue that if the Chevalier had really been very rich, he would not have needed to borrow money.</p><p>Critics are also skeptical about the accuracy of the conversations that the Chevalier records in the memoir between himself and the famous writer Voltaire. No one doubts that the Chevalier and Voltaire met and conversed. However, critics complain that the memoir cannot possibly capture these conversations accurately, because it was written many years after the conversations occurred. Critics point out that it is impossible to remember exact phrases from extended conversations held many years earlier.</p><p>Critics have also questioned the memoir's account of the Chevalier's escape from a notorious prison in Venice, Italy. He claims to have escaped the Venetian prison by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climbing through the roof. Critics claim that while such a daring escape makes for enjoyable reading, it is more likely that the Chevaliers jailers were bribed to free him. They point out that the Chevalier had a number of politically well-connected friends in Venice who could have offered a bribe. </p></article><div><audio src="tpo08-writing1.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></div><article id="listening-passage" class="passage"><h3>Listening Text</h3><p>ProfessorNo memoir can possibly be correct in every detail, but still, the Chevalier's memoir is pretty accurate overall, and is, by and large, a reliable historical source. Let's look at the accuracy of the three episodes mentioned in the reading.</p><p>First, the loan from the merchant. Well, that doesn't mean that the Chevalier was poor. Let me explain. We know that in Switzerland, the Chevalier spent huge amounts of money on parties and gambling, and he had wealth. But it was a kind of property you have to sell first to get money. So it usually took a few days to convert his assets into actual money. So when he ran out of cash, he had to borrow some while he was waiting for his money to arrive, but that's not being poor.</p><p>Second, the conversations with Voltaire. The Chevalier states in his memoir that each night immediately after conversing with Voltaire, he wrote down everything he could remember about that particular night's conversation. Evidently the Chevalier kept his notes of these conversations for many years and referred to them when writing the memoir. Witnesses who lived with the Chevalier in his later life confirmed that he regularly consulted notes and journals when composing the memoir.</p><p>Third, the Chevalier's escape from a prison in Venice. Other prisoners in that prison had even more powerful friends than he did, and none of them were ever able to bribe their way to freedom, so bribery hardly seems likely in his case. The best evidence, though, comes from some old Venetian government documents. They indicate that soon after the Chevalier escaped from the prison, the ceiling of his old prison room had to be repaired. Why would they need to repair a ceiling unless he had escaped exactly as he said he did? </p></article><section id="question"><h4>Question</h4><p>Summarize the points made in the lecture, being sure to explain how they respond to the specific points made reading passage.</p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>The reading passage raises several doubts about the accuracy of the memoir written by the Chevalier de Seingalt, whereas the professor defends the memoir in the lecture by clarifying the seeming contradictions in the Chevalier's accounts.</p><p>The professor argues that because the Chevalier was rich in assets but poor in cash while he was living in Switzerland, he occasionally had to borrow funds to pay for expensive recreational activities. According to the professor, having low amounts of cash is not the same as being financially poor. The reading, however, holds that as someone who had to borrow large amounts of  money  from  others,  the  Chevalier  must  have  fabricated  stories  of  his  wealthy  life  in Switzerland.</p><p>Moreover,  the  professor  challenges  the  skepticism  expressed  in  the  reading  regarding  the reliability of the conversations with Voltaire that the Chevalier recorded in his memoir. She explains that because the Chevalier had a habit of recording each conversation with Voltaire in a diary immediately afterward, he was able to recall those discussions in detail even years later.</p><p>Finally, the professor rejects the claim in the reading that the Chevalier bribed his way out of a prison in Venice. She says that the fact that none of the other prisoners, even those with better resources, had been able to do so shows that bribery was unlikely. Furthermore, she points to a government paper that recorded the repair work done to the Chevalier's prison cell, citing this as strong evidence that the account of his escape from the prison was indeed accurate.</p></article></div></main></body></html>
