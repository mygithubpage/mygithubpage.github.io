        <h3>Listening Text</h3>
        <article>
          <p>Listen to a conversation between two students.</p>
          <p>(woman) Hey, Steve, are you ready for classes to start?</p>
          <p>(man) Not really. There's still a big conflict in my course schedule.</p>
          <p>(woman) What's wrong?</p>
          <p>(man) This is my last semester and I've still got two required courses left to take in order to finish my literature degree.</p>
          <p>(woman) Ok?</p>
          <p>(man) I have to take both History of the Novel and Shakespeare or I can't graduate! Problem is the two courses meet at the same time!</p>
          <p>(woman) Uh, oh. What are you gonna do?</p>
          <p>(man) Well, I talked to the professor who's gonna teach Shakespeare, he said I could do an independent study to fulfill that requirement.</p>
          <p>(woman) How would that work?</p>
          <p>(man) I'd read the assigned text on my own, do all the same assignments, and meet with him when I need to, if I had any questions.</p>
          <p>(woman) Well, that sounds a good way to fulfill the requirement.</p>
          <p>(man) Yeah, plus it'd be nice to have one-on-one discussions with the professor. It's just that, well, working o n my own like that, I'm kind of concerned I won't be able to motivate myself to get the work done on time. It's easy to put things off when it's not an actual class, you know?</p>
          <p>(woman) Yeah, are there other options?</p>
          <p>(man) Um, yeah, I found out that the Shakespeare class is being offered at another university about a half an hour from here. That university has a really great literature program and our university will accept their credits, so...</p>
          <p>(woman) That's an idea!</p>
          <p>(man) Yeah, I'm sure it'll be a good class. And it'd fulfill the requirement. Only thing is, you know, I'd have to drive a half an hour to get to the class and then half an hour to come back, three times a week! That's a lot of time and gas money."</p>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>Well, the man's problem is that he needs to take two required courses to get his degree since it's his last semester, but those two courses just conflict in his schedule. Accordingly, there are two solutions for the man: first he could do an independent study to fulfill that requirement with the permission and help of the professor; and second, he could try the same course in another university. Well, I think the first solution is a better idea for two reasons. Firstly, independent study is an indispensable way of study in college life and has essentially no difference from class study, especially with the permission and help of the professor. The man could also use the study notes from students in class and do all the reading or researching assignment, which will promote his efficiency of studying. When he's got any questions he could just go straight to the professor on the office hours as the professor promises. Secondly, going to another university is a bad idea mainly because that will be too time-consuming. So I agree with the first solution. (185 words)</p>
