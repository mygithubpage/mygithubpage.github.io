            <b>Music Coming to Cafeterias</b>
          </h4>
          <p>Mary Dixon, Director of the Student Life Committee, announced yesterday that beginning next semester, university cafeterias will broadcast classical music during mealtimes. "Music will foster a more relaxed atmosphere," said Dixon. "Students' lives are hectic, and mealtimes provide important opportunities to take a break and catch up with friends before moving on to the next class or assignment." Added Dixon, "We're hoping that, if we provide the music, students will unplug their music devices – their walkmans and mp3 players or whatever – and will spend more time talking to each other. When students have their headphones on, they're not connecting with each other."</p>

        <h3>Listening Text</h3>
        <article>
          <p>Now listen to two students discussing the university's plan.</p>
          <p>(man) Have you read this article? Are they serious?</p>
          <p>(woman) Yeah, I think so. Why?</p>
          <p>(man) Well, first of all, a lot of kids aren't looking for relaxing breaks at lunch time. They like to study while they, especially while they have exams coming up or some assignments they have to get done.</p>
          <p>(woman) Yeah, that's true.</p>
          <p>(man) And now they won't be able to concentrate. This is gonna be very distracting.(woman) Hmmm. Ok, yeah, I see your point.</p>
          <p>(man) And second, most students don't like classical music.</p>
          <p>(woman) It's certainly not what I listen to.</p>
          <p>(man) So, are people going to stop listening to their own music?(woman) No!</p>
          <p>(man) I think people are going to be even more likely to bring their mp3 player, you know, to play their own music and block out the classical stuff.</p>
          <p>(woman) Yeah, that makes sense.</p>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>Well, the man is against the plan for two main reasons. First of all, he thinks that a lot of students would like to study during the lunch time especially when they have coming-up exams or some soon-due assignments. The broadcast music will be distracting those who need concentration. Secondly, the man believes that most students just don't like classical music, so he thinks even if there is classical music broadcasting out loud, the students will still plug in their own mp3 players and listen to their own preference to avoid the broadcast classical music and stuff like that.
