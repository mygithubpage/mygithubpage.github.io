          <p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.23" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in an animal <span class="underline">behavior</span> class.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.32" data-time="7.23">[00:07.23]</span>Pro: OK. Well, last time we talked about <span class="underline">passive</span> <span class="underline">habitat</span> <span class="underline">selection</span>, like plants for example. <span class="time" data-times="2.42" data-time="15.55">[00:15.55]</span>They don't make active choices about where to grow. <span class="time" data-times="3.45" data-time="17.97">[00:17.97]</span>They are dispersed by some other agent, like the wind. <span class="time" data-times="5.28" data-time="21.42">[00:21.42]</span>And if the seeds land in a <span class="underline">suitable</span> <span class="underline">habitat</span>, they do well and <span class="underline">reproduce</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.67" data-time="26.7">[00:26.70]</span>With active <span class="underline">habitat</span> <span class="underline">selection</span>, an <span class="underline">organism</span> is able to physically select where to live and <span class="underline">breed</span>. <span class="time" data-times="13.26" data-time="33.37">[00:33.37]</span>And because an animal's <span class="underline">breeding</span> <span class="underline">habitat</span> is so important, we'd <span class="underline">expect</span> animal <span class="underline">species</span> to have developed preferences for <span class="underline">particular</span> types of habitats, places where their <span class="underline">offspring</span> have the best <span class="underline">chance</span> of <span class="underline">survival</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.54" data-time="46.63">[00:46.63]</span>So let's look at the effect this <span class="underline">preference</span> can have by looking at some examples. <span class="time" data-times="1.62" data-time="52.17">[00:52.17]</span>But first let's recap. <span class="time" data-times="3.74" data-time="53.79">[00:53.79]</span>What do we mean by <span class="underline">habitat</span>? <span class="underline">Frank</span>?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.86" data-time="57.53">[00:57.53]</span>Stu: Well, it's basically the place or environment where an <span class="underline">organism</span> <span class="underline">normally</span> lives and grows.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="13.38" data-time="64.39">[01:04.39]</span>Pro: Right, and as we've discussed, there are some key elements that a <span class="underline">habitat</span> must <span class="underline">contain</span> – food <span class="underline">obviously</span>, water and it's got to have the right <span class="underline">climate</span> and spaces for <span class="underline">physical</span> protection. <span class="time" data-times="9.5" data-time="77.77">[01:17.77]</span>And we saw how important <span class="underline">habitat</span> <span class="underline">selection</span> is when we look at habitats where some of these factors are removed, perhaps <span class="underline">through</span> <span class="underline">habitat</span> <span class="underline">destruction</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.24" data-time="87.27">[01:27.27]</span>Um, I just read about a shorebird, the plover.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.87" data-time="90.51">[01:30.51]</span>The plover lives by the ocean and feeds on small <span class="underline">shellfish</span>, insects and plants. <span class="time" data-times="5.12" data-time="97.38">[01:37.38]</span>It blends in with the sand, so it's well-camouflaged from <span class="underline">predator</span> birds above. <span class="time" data-times="5.96" data-time="102.5">[01:42.50]</span>But it lays its eggs in <span class="underline">shallow</span> depressions in the sand with very little protection around them. <span class="time" data-times="6.4" data-time="108.46">[01:48.46]</span>So if there are people or dogs on the <span class="underline">beach</span>, the eggs and fledglings in the nests are really <span class="underline">vulnerable</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.77" data-time="114.86">[01:54.86]</span>Out in California where there has been a lot of human <span class="underline">development</span> by the ocean, the plovers are now a threatened <span class="underline">species</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.28" data-time="121.63">[02:01.63]</span>So conservationists tried to recreate a new <span class="underline">habitat</span> for them. <span class="time" data-times="5.32" data-time="125.91">[02:05.91]</span>They made <span class="underline">artificial</span> beaches and sand bars in areas <span class="underline">inaccessible</span> to people and dogs.<span class="time" data-times="4.66" data-time="131.23">[02:11.23]</span>And the plover <span class="underline">population</span> is up quite a bit in those places.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.06" data-time="135.89">[02:15.89]</span>Ok. That is an <span class="underline">instance</span> where a <span class="underline">habitat</span> is made less <span class="underline">suitable</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.85" data-time="140.95">[02:20.95]</span>But now, what about cases where an animal exhibits a <span class="underline">clear</span> choice between two <span class="underline">suitable</span> habitats? <span class="time" data-times="3.03" data-time="147.8">[02:27.80]</span>In cases like that, does the <span class="underline">preference</span> matter? <span class="time" data-times="4.25" data-time="150.83">[02:30.83]</span>Well, Let's look at the blue warbler.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.28" data-time="155.08">[02:35.08]</span>The Blue warbler is a songbird that lives in North America. <span class="time" data-times="7.88" data-time="158.36">[02:38.36]</span>They clearly <span class="underline">prefer</span> hard wood forests with <span class="underline"><span class="underline">dense</span></span> shrubs, bushes <span class="underline">underneath</span> the trees. <span class="time" data-times="3.4" data-time="166.24">[02:46.24]</span>They actually <span class="underline">nest</span> in the shrubs, not the trees. <span class="time" data-times="6.63" data-time="169.64">[02:49.64]</span>So they're <span class="underline">pretty</span> close to the ground, but these warblers also <span class="underline">nest</span> in forests that have low <span class="underline">shrub</span> <span class="underline">density</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9.68" data-time="176.27">[02:56.27]</span>It is usually the younger warblers that <span class="underline">nest</span> in these areas because the preferred spots where there are a lot of shrubs are taken by the older, more <span class="underline">dominant</span> birds.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.03" data-time="185.95">[03:05.95]</span>And the choice of <span class="underline">habitat</span> seems to <span class="underline">affect</span> <span class="underline">reproductive</span> success. <span class="time" data-times="16.82" data-time="190.98">[03:10.98]</span>Because the older, more experienced birds who <span class="underline">nest</span> in the high <span class="underline">density</span> <span class="underline">shrub</span> areas have <span class="underline">significantly</span> more <span class="underline">offspring</span> than those in low <span class="underline">density</span> areas, which suggests that the choice of where to <span class="underline">nest</span> does have an <span class="underline">impact</span> on the number of chicks they have.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.22" data-time="207.8">[03:27.80]</span>But a preferred environment doesn't always <span class="underline">seem</span> to <span class="underline">correlate</span> with greater <span class="underline">reproductive</span> success. <span class="time" data-times="4.49" data-time="214.02">[03:34.02]</span>For example, In Europe, studies have been done of blackcap warblers. <span class="time" data-times="3.22" data-time="218.51">[03:38.51]</span>We just call them blackcaps.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.97" data-time="221.73">[03:41.73]</span>The Blackcap can be found in two different environments. <span class="time" data-times="5.08" data-time="225.7">[03:45.70]</span>Their preferred <span class="underline">habitat</span> is forests near the <span class="underline">edge</span> of streams. <span class="time" data-times="5.03" data-time="230.78">[03:50.78]</span>However, blackcaps also live in <span class="underline">pine</span> woods away from water. <span class="time" data-times="14.26" data-time="235.81">[03:55.81]</span>Studies have been done on the <span class="underline">reproductive</span> success rates for the birds in both areas, and the result showed surprisingly that the <span class="underline">reproductive</span> success was <span class="underline">essentially</span> the same in both areas – the preferred and the <span class="underline">second</span> choice <span class="underline">habitat</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.45" data-time="250.07">[04:10.07]</span>Well. Why?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="11.87" data-time="252.52">[04:12.52]</span>It turned out that there were actually four times as many bird pairs or couples living in the <span class="underline">stream</span> <span class="underline">edge</span> <span class="underline">habitat</span> compared to the area away from the <span class="underline">stream</span>. <span class="time" data-times="18.45" data-time="264.39">[04:24.39]</span>So this <span class="underline">stream</span> <span class="underline">edge</span> area had a much denser <span class="underline">population</span>, which meant more members of the same <span class="underline">species</span> <span class="underline">competing</span> for resources, wanting to feed on the same things or build their nests in the same places, which <span class="underline">lower</span> the suitability of the <span class="underline">prime</span> <span class="underline">habitat</span> <span class="underline">even</span> though it's their preferred <span class="underline">habitat</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="15.83" data-time="282.84">[04:42.84]</span>So the results of the study suggest that when the number of the competitors in the <span class="underline">prime</span> <span class="underline">habitat</span> reaches a certain point, the <span class="underline">second</span> <span class="underline">rank</span> <span class="underline">habitat</span> becomes just as successful as the <span class="underline">prime</span> <span class="underline">habitat</span>, just because there are fewer members of the same <span class="underline">species</span> living there. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="298.67">[04:58.67]</span>So it looks like competition for resources is another important <span class="underline">factor</span> in determining if a <span class="underline">particular</span> <span class="underline">habitat</span> is <span class="underline">suitable</span>.</p>
