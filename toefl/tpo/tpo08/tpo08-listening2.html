To examine the consequences of habitat selection by animals.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The general professor will start with lecture to review the contents of the last lesson and explain the main content of this course. So let's look at the effect of preference can have by looking at some examples, but first let's recap. look at the effect, ie the consequences.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What element of the plover's habitat in California was threatened?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

The protection of nests from predatory birds.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Professor said that if people and dogs are on the beach, the egg is vulnerable to injury, and C is also a lot of human development.

The reproductive advantage that young warblers have over older warblers.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>And the choice of survival seems to affect the reproductive success.

Their preferred habitat became too competitive.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>Select D, other options are not mentioned.
