            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.01" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in a Chemistry class. <span class="time" data-times="5.64" data-time="6.01">[00:06.01]</span>The professor has been discussing the periodical table of elements.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.14" data-time="11.65">[00:11.65]</span>Pro: So, are there any questions?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.17" data-time="13.79">[00:13.79]</span>Stu: Yes, um, Professor Harrison, you were saying that the <span class="underline">periodic</span> table is predictive. <span class="time" data-times="1.72" data-time="19.96">[00:19.96]</span>What exactly does that mean? <span class="time" data-times="5.07" data-time="21.68">[00:21.68]</span>I mean I understand how it organizes the elements, but where's the prediction?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.44" data-time="26.75">[00:26.75]</span>Pro: Ok, let's look at our <span class="underline">periodic</span> table again. <span class="time" data-times="4.36" data-time="31.19">[00:31.19]</span>Ok, it groups elements into categories that share certain properties, right?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="0.89" data-time="35.55">[00:35.55]</span>Stu: Uh-huh.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.29" data-time="36.44">[00:36.44]</span>Pro: And it is arranged according to increasing <span class="underline">atomic</span> number, which is...</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.23" data-time="40.73">[00:40.73]</span>Stu: The number of protons in each <span class="underline">atom</span> of an <span class="underline">element</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="0.53" data-time="43.96">[00:43.96]</span>Pro: Right. <span class="time" data-times="3.92" data-time="44.49">[00:44.49]</span>Well, early versions of the <span class="underline">periodic</span> table had gaps, missing elements. <span class="time" data-times="3.65" data-time="48.41">[00:48.41]</span>Every time you had one more proton, you had another <span class="underline">element</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.81" data-time="52.06">[00:52.06]</span>And then, oops, there'd be an <span class="underline">atomic</span> number, for which there was no known <span class="underline">element</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.99" data-time="56.87">[00:56.87]</span>And the prediction was that an <span class="underline">element</span> with that <span class="underline">atomic</span> number existed somewhere, but it just hadn't been found yet. <span class="time" data-times="4.18" data-time="64.86">[01:04.86]</span>And its location in the table would tell you what properties it should have. <span class="time" data-times="7.63" data-time="69.04">[01:09.04]</span>It was really <span class="underline">pretty</span> <span class="underline">exciting</span> for scientists at that time to find these missing elements and <span class="underline">confirm</span> their predictive properties.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.79" data-time="76.67">[01:16.67]</span>Um, actually, that reminds me of a ... of a very good example of all these, <span class="underline">element</span> 43. <span class="time" data-times="6.22" data-time="83.46">[01:23.46]</span>See on the table, the symbols for elements 42 and 44. <span class="time" data-times="9.19" data-time="89.68">[01:29.68]</span>Well, in early versions of the table, there was no <span class="underline">symbol</span> for an <span class="underline">element</span> 43 protons because no <span class="underline">element</span> with 43 protons had been discovered yet. <span class="time" data-times="5.54" data-time="98.87">[01:38.87]</span>So the <span class="underline">periodic</span> table had a <span class="underline">gap</span> between elements 42 and 44.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.76" data-time="104.41">[01:44.41]</span>And then in 1925, a team of chemists led by a scientist named Ida Tacke claimed that they had found <span class="underline">element</span> 43. <span class="time" data-times="11.86" data-time="115.17">[01:55.17]</span>They had been using a <span class="underline">relatively</span> new technology called X-ray spectroscopy, and they were using this to examine an <span class="underline">ore</span> <span class="underline">sample</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.66" data-time="127.03">[02:07.03]</span>And they claimed that they'd found an <span class="underline">element</span> with 43 protons. <span class="time" data-times="3.84" data-time="130.69">[02:10.69]</span>And they named it Masurium.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.21" data-time="134.53">[02:14.53]</span>Stu: Um, Professor Harrison, then, how come in my <span class="underline">periodic</span> table here, <span class="underline">element</span> 43 is Tc? <span class="time" data-times="1.83" data-time="141.74">[02:21.74]</span>That's Technetium, right?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.24" data-time="143.57">[02:23.57]</span>Pro: Ok, let me add that. <span class="time" data-times="2.74" data-time="146.81">[02:26.81]</span>Actually, um, that's the point I'm coming to. <span class="time" data-times="3.5" data-time="149.55">[02:29.55]</span> <span class="underline">Hardly</span> anyone believed that Tacke'd discovered a new <span class="underline">element</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.4" data-time="153.05">[02:33.05]</span>X-ray spectroscopy was a new <span class="underline">method</span> at that time. <span class="time" data-times="6.48" data-time="156.45">[02:36.45]</span>And they were never able to <span class="underline">isolate</span> enough Masurium to have a weighable <span class="underline">sample</span> to <span class="underline">convince</span> everyone of the discovery. <span class="time" data-times="2.29" data-time="162.93">[02:42.93]</span>So they were discredited. <span class="time" data-times="7.79" data-time="165.22">[02:45.22]</span>But then, 12 years later in 1937, a different team became the first to <span class="underline">synthesize</span> an <span class="underline">element</span> using a cyclotron. <span class="time" data-times="4.39" data-time="173.01">[02:53.01]</span>And that <span class="underline">element</span> had...</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.67" data-time="177.4">[02:57.40]</span>Stu: 43 protons?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.53" data-time="179.07">[02:59.07]</span>Pro: That's right, but they named it Technetium to <span class="underline">emphasize</span> that it was artificially created with technology. <span class="time" data-times="5.83" data-time="185.6">[03:05.60]</span>And people thought that synthesizing this <span class="underline">element</span>, making it artificially was the only way to get it. <span class="time" data-times="2.24" data-time="191.43">[03:11.43]</span>We still hadn't found it occurring in nature. <span class="time" data-times="6.27" data-time="193.67">[03:13.67]</span>Now <span class="underline">element</span> 43, whether you call it Masurium or Technetium, is <span class="underline">radioactive</span>. <span class="time" data-times="1.27" data-time="199.94">[03:19.94]</span>Why does that matter? <span class="time" data-times="4.35" data-time="201.21">[03:21.21]</span>What is true of a <span class="underline">radioactive</span> <span class="underline">element</span>?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.02" data-time="205.56">[03:25.56]</span>Stu: It decays, it turns into other elements. <span class="time" data-times="4.81" data-time="209.58">[03:29.58]</span>Oh, so does that explain why it was missing in the <span class="underline">periodic</span> table?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.06" data-time="214.39">[03:34.39]</span>Pro: Exactly, because of its <span class="underline">radioactive</span> <span class="underline">decay</span>, <span class="underline">element</span> 43 doesn't last very long. <span class="time" data-times="5.07" data-time="220.45">[03:40.45]</span>And <span class="underline">therefore</span>, if that ever had been present on Earth, it would have <span class="underline">decayed</span> ages ago. <span class="time" data-times="5.14" data-time="225.52">[03:45.52]</span>So the Masurium people were <span class="underline">obviously</span> wrong, and the Technetium people were right. <span class="time" data-times="2.38" data-time="230.66">[03:50.66]</span>Right? Well, that was then.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.6" data-time="233.04">[03:53.04]</span>Now we know that <span class="underline">element</span> 43 does <span class="underline">occur</span> naturally.<span class="time" data-times="4.71" data-time="236.64">[03:56.64]</span>It can be naturally generated from Uranium atoms that have spontaneously <span class="underline">split</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.88" data-time="241.35">[04:01.35]</span>And guess what, the <span class="underline">ore</span> <span class="underline">sample</span> the Masurium group was working with had plenty of Uranium in it, enough to <span class="underline">split</span> into measurable amounts of Masurium. <span class="time" data-times="4.54" data-time="250.23">[04:10.23]</span>So Tacke's team might very well have found small amounts of Masurium in the <span class="underline">ore</span> samples. <span class="time" data-times="4.86" data-time="254.77">[04:14.77]</span>It's just that once was generated from <span class="underline">split</span> Uranium, it <span class="underline">decayed</span> very quickly.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.51" data-time="259.63">[04:19.63]</span>And you know here's an <span class="underline">incredible</span> <span class="underline">irony</span>. <span class="time" data-times="12.54" data-time="262.14">[04:22.14]</span>Ida Tacke, the chemist led the Masurium team, well, she was the first to suggest that Uranium could <span class="underline">break</span> up into smaller pieces, but she didn't know that that was the <span class="underline">defense</span> of her own discovery of <span class="underline">element</span> 43.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.26" data-time="274.68">[04:34.68]</span>Stu: So is my <span class="underline">version</span> of the <span class="underline">periodic</span> table wrong? <span class="time" data-times="3.03" data-time="277.94">[04:37.94]</span>Should <span class="underline">element</span> 43 really be called Masurium?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.53" data-time="280.97">[04:40.97]</span>Pro: Maybe, but you know it's hard to tell for sure after all this time, if Ida Tacke's group did discover <span class="underline">element</span> 43. <span class="time" data-times="6.21" data-time="288.5">[04:48.50]</span>They didn't, um, <span class="underline">publish</span> enough <span class="underline">detail</span> on their methods or instruments for us to know for sure.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.5" data-time="294.71">[04:54.71]</span>But I'd like to think <span class="underline">element</span> 43 was discovered twice. <span class="time" data-times="10.92" data-time="298.21">[04:58.21]</span>As Masurium, it was the first <span class="underline">element</span> discovered that occurs in nature only from <span class="underline">spontaneous</span> <span class="underline">fission</span>, and as Technetium, it was the first <span class="underline">element</span> discovered in a <span class="underline">laboratory</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="309.13">[05:09.13]</span>And of <span class="underline">course</span>, it was an <span class="underline">element</span> the <span class="underline">periodic</span> table let us to <span class="underline">expect</span> existed before anyone had found it or made it.</p>
