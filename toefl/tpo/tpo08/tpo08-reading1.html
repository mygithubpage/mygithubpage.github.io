            <b>The Rise of Teotihuacán</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>The city of Teotihuacán, which <span class="underline">lay</span> about 50 kilometers northeast of modern-day Mexico City, began its growth by 200-100 B.C. At its height, between about A.D. 150 and 700, it probably had a <span class="underline">population</span> of more than 125,000 people and covered at <span class="underline">least</span> 20 <span class="underline">square</span> kilometers. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>It had over 2,000 <span class="underline">apartment</span> complexes, a great <span class="underline">market</span>, a large number of <span class="underline">industrial</span> workshops, an administrative center, a number of <span class="light"><span class="underline">massive</span></span> <span class="underline">religious</span> edifices, and a <span class="underline">regular</span> <span class="underline">grid</span> <span class="underline">pattern</span> of streets and buildings. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>Clearly, much planning and central control were involved in the <span class="underline">expansion</span> and ordering of this great <span class="underline">metropolis</span>.  <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>Moreover, the city had <span class="underline">economic</span> and perhaps <span class="underline">religious</span> contacts with most parts of Mesoamerica (modern Central America and Mexico). <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p>
          <p>How did this <span class="underline">tremendous</span> <span class="underline">development</span> take place, and why did it happen in the Teotihuacán <span class="underline">Valley</span>? Among the main factors are Teotihuacán's geographic location on a natural <span class="underline">trade</span> <span class="underline">route</span> to the south and east of the <span class="underline">Valley</span> of Mexico, the <span class="underline">obsidian</span> resources in the Teotihuacán <span class="underline">Valley</span> itself, and the <span class="underline">valley</span>'s <span class="underline">potential</span> for <span class="underline">extensive</span> <span class="underline">irrigation</span>. The <span class="underline">exact</span> role of other factors is much more difficult to <span class="underline">pinpoint</span>?for <span class="underline">instance</span>, Teotihuacán's <span class="underline">religious</span> <span class="underline">significance</span> as a <span class="underline">shrine</span>, the historical situation in and around the <span class="underline">Valley</span> of Mexico toward the end of the first <span class="underline">millennium</span> B.C., the <span class="underline">ingenuity</span> and foresightedness of Teotihuacán's elite, and, finally, the <span class="underline">impact</span> of natural disasters, such as the <span class="underline">volcanic</span> eruptions of the late first <span class="underline">millennium</span> B.C.</p>
          <p>This last <span class="underline">factor</span> is at <span class="underline">least</span> circumstantially <span class="underline">implicated</span> in Teotihuacán's rise. <span class="underline">Prior</span> to 200 B.C., a number of <span class="underline">relatively</span> small centers coexisted in and near the <span class="underline">Valley</span> of Mexico. Around this time, the largest of these centers, Cuicuilco, was seriously affected by a <span class="underline">volcanic</span> <span class="underline">eruption</span>, with much of its agricultural land covered by <span class="underline">lava</span>. With Cuicuilco eliminated as a <span class="underline">potential</span> <span class="underline">rival</span>, any one of a number of <span class="underline">relatively</span> <span class="underline">modest</span> towns might have emerged as a <span class="underline">leading</span> <span class="underline">economic</span> and <span class="underline">political</span> power in Central Mexico. The <span class="underline">archaeological</span> <span class="underline">evidence</span> clearly indicates, though, that Teotihuacán was the center that did arise as the <span class="underline">predominant</span> force in the area by the first <span class="underline">century</span> A.D.</p>
          <p>It seems likely that Teotihuacán's natural resources, <span class="underline">along</span> with the city elite's <span class="underline">ability</span> to <span class="underline">recognize</span> their <span class="underline">potential</span>, gave the city a <span class="underline">competitive</span> <span class="underline">edge</span> over its neighbors. The <span class="underline">valley</span>, like many other places in Mexican and Guatemalan highlands, was rich in <span class="underline">obsidian</span>. The hard <span class="underline">volcanic</span> stone was a <span class="underline">resource</span> that had been in great demand for many years, at <span class="underline">least</span> since the rise of the Olmecs (a people who flourished between 1200 and 400 B.C.), and it apparently had a <span class="underline">secure</span> <span class="underline">market</span>. Moreover, recent research on <span class="underline">obsidian</span> tools found at <span class="underline">Olmec</span> sites has shown that some of the <span class="underline">obsidian</span> obtained by the Olmecs originated near Teotihuacán. Teotihuacán <span class="underline">obsidian</span> must have been recognized as a <span class="underline">valuable</span> <span class="underline">commodity</span> for many centuries before the great city arose.</p>
          <p>Long-distance <span class="underline">trade</span> in <span class="underline">obsidian</span> probably gave the elite residents of Teotihuacán <span class="underline">access</span> to a wide <span class="underline">variety</span> of <span class="underline">exotic</span> good, as well as a <span class="underline">relatively</span> <span class="underline">prosperous</span> life. Such success may have attracted immigrants to Teotihuacán. In <span class="underline">addition</span>, Teotihuacán's elite may have <span class="underline">consciously</span> attempted to <span class="underline">attract</span> new inhabitants. It is also probable that as early as 200 B.C.Teotihuacán may have achieved some <span class="underline">religious</span> <span class="underline">significance</span> and its <span class="underline">shrine</span> (or shrines) may have served as an <span class="underline">additional</span> <span class="underline">population</span> <span class="underline">magnet</span>. Finally, the growing <span class="underline">population</span> was probably fed by increasing the number and size of irrigated fields.</p>
          <p>The picture of Teotihuacán that emerges is a <span class="underline">classic</span> picture of <span class="underline">positive</span> <span class="underline">feedback</span> among <span class="underline">obsidian</span> <span class="underline">mining</span> and working, <span class="underline">trade</span>, <span class="underline">population</span> growth, <span class="underline">irrigation</span>, and <span class="underline">religious</span> tourism. The thriving <span class="underline">obsidian</span> operation, for example, would necessitate more miners, <span class="underline">additional</span> manufacturers of <span class="underline">obsidian</span> tools, and <span class="underline">additional</span> traders to carry the goods to new markets. All this led to increased wealth, which in turn would <span class="underline">attract</span> more immigrants to Teotihuacán. The growing power of the elite, who controlled the <span class="underline">economy</span>, would give them the means to physically <span class="underline">coerce</span> people to move to Teotihuacán and serve as additions to the labor force. More <span class="underline">irrigation</span> works would have to be built to feed the growing <span class="underline">population</span>, and this resulted in more power and wealth for the elite.</p>
