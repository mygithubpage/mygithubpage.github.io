At its height, between about A.D. 150 and 700, it probably had a <span class="highlight">population</span> of more than 125,000 people and covered at <span class="highlight">least</span> 20 <span class="highlight">square</span> kilometers. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>It had over 2,000 <span class="highlight">apartment</span> complexes, a great <span class="highlight">market</span>, a large number of <span class="highlight">industrial</span> workshops, an administrative center, a number of <span class="highlight question1">massive</span><span class="highlight">religious</span> edifices, and a <span class="highlight">regular</span><span class="highlight">grid</span><span class="highlight">pattern</span> of streets and buildings. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>Clearly, much planning and central control were involved in the <span class="highlight">expansion</span> and ordering of this great <span class="highlight">metropolis</span>.  <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>Moreover, the city had <span class="highlight">economic</span> and perhaps <span class="highlight">religious</span> contacts with most parts of Mesoamerica (modern Central America and Mexico). <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p><p>How did this <span class="highlight">tremendous</span><span class="highlight">development</span> take place, and why did it happen in the Teotihuacï¿½n <span class="highlight">Valley</span>? Among the main factors are Teotihuacï¿½n's geographic location on a natural <span class="highlight">trade</span><span class="highlight">route</span> to the south and east of the <span class="highlight">Valley</span> of Mexico, the <span class="highlight">obsidian</span> resources in the Teotihuacï¿½n <span class="highlight">Valley</span> itself, and the <span class="highlight">valley</span>'s <span class="highlight">potential</span> for <span class="highlight">extensive</span><span class="highlight">irrigation</span>. The <span class="highlight">exact</span> role of other factors is much more difficult to <span class="highlight"><span class="question3">pinpoint</span></span>?for <span class="highlight">instance</span>, Teotihuacï¿½n's <span class="highlight">religious</span><span class="highlight">significance</span> as a <span class="highlight">shrine</span>, the historical situation in and around the <span class="highlight">Valley</span> of Mexico toward the end of the first <span class="highlight">millennium</span> B.C., the <span class="highlight"><span class="question4">ingenuity</span></span> and foresightedness of Teotihuacï¿½n's elite, and, finally, the <span class="highlight">impact</span> of natural disasters, such as the <span class="highlight">volcanic</span> eruptions of the late first <span class="highlight">millennium</span> B.C.</p><p>This last <span class="highlight">factor</span> is at <span class="highlight">least</span> circumstantially <span class="highlight">implicated</span> in Teotihuacï¿½n's rise. <span class="highlight">Prior</span> to 200 B.C., a number of <span class="highlight">relatively</span> small centers coexisted in and near the <span class="highlight">Valley</span> of Mexico. Around this time, the largest of these centers, Cuicuilco, was seriously affected by a <span class="highlight">volcanic</span><span class="highlight">eruption</span>, with much of its agricultural land covered by <span class="highlight">lava</span>. With Cuicuilco eliminated as a <span class="highlight">potential</span><span class="highlight">rival</span>, any one of a number of <span class="highlight">relatively</span><span class="highlight">modest</span> towns might have emerged as a <span class="highlight">leading</span><span class="highlight">economic</span> and <span class="highlight">political</span> power in Central Mexico. The <span class="highlight">archaeological</span><span class="highlight">evidence</span> clearly indicates, though, that Teotihuacï¿½n was the center that did arise as the <span class="highlight"><span class="question8">predominant</span></span> force in the area by the first <span class="highlight">century</span> A.D.</p><p>It seems likely that Teotihuacï¿½n's natural resources, <span class="highlight">along</span> with the city elite's <span class="highlight">ability</span> to <span class="highlight">recognize</span> their <span class="highlight">potential</span>, gave the city <span class="question9">a <span class="highlight">competitive</span><span class="highlight">edge</span> over its neighbors.</span> The <span class="highlight">valley</span>, like many other places in Mexican and Guatemalan highlands, was rich in <span class="highlight">obsidian</span>. The hard <span class="highlight">volcanic</span> stone was a <span class="highlight">resource</span> that had been in great demand for many years, at <span class="highlight">least</span> since the rise of the Olmecs (a people who flourished between 1200 and 400 B.C.), and it apparently had a <span class="highlight">secure</span><span class="highlight">market</span>. Moreover, recent research on <span class="highlight">obsidian</span> tools found at <span class="highlight">Olmec</span> sites has shown that some of the <span class="highlight">obsidian</span> obtained by the Olmecs originated near Teotihuacï¿½n. Teotihuacï¿½n <span class="highlight">obsidian</span> must have been recognized as a <span class="highlight">valuable</span><span class="highlight">commodity</span> for many centuries before the great city arose.</p><p>Long-distance <span class="highlight">trade</span> in <span class="highlight">obsidian</span> probably gave the elite residents of Teotihuacï¿½n <span class="highlight">access</span> to a wide <span class="highlight">variety</span> of <span class="highlight">exotic</span> good, as well as a <span class="highlight">relatively</span><span class="highlight">prosperous</span> life. Such success may have attracted immigrants to Teotihuacï¿½n. In <span class="highlight">addition</span>, Teotihuacï¿½n's elite may have <span class="highlight">consciously</span> attempted to <span class="highlight">attract</span> new inhabitants. It is also probable that as early as 200 B.C.Teotihuacï¿½n may have achieved some <span class="highlight">religious</span><span class="highlight">significance</span> and its <span class="highlight">shrine</span> (or shrines) may have served as an <span class="highlight">additional</span><span class="highlight">population</span><span class="highlight">magnet</span>. Finally, the growing <span class="highlight">population</span> was probably fed by increasing the number and size of irrigated fields.</p><p>The picture of Teotihuacï¿½n that emerges is a <span class="highlight">classic</span> picture of <span class="highlight">positive</span><span class="highlight">feedback</span> among <span class="highlight">obsidian</span><span class="highlight">mining</span> and working, <span class="highlight">trade</span>, <span class="highlight">population</span> growth, <span class="highlight">irrigation</span>, and <span class="highlight">religious</span> tourism. <span class="question12">The thriving <span class="highlight">obsidian</span> operation</span>, for example, would necessitate more miners, <span class="highlight">additional</span> manufacturers of <span class="highlight">obsidian</span> tools, and <span class="highlight">additional</span> traders to carry the goods to new markets. All this led to increased wealth, which in turn would <span class="highlight">attract</span> more immigrants to Teotihuacï¿½n. The growing power of the elite, who controlled the <span class="highlight">economy</span>, would give them the means to physically <span class="highlight">coerce</span> people to move to Teotihuacï¿½n and serve as additions to the labor force. More <span class="highlight">irrigation</span> works would have to be built to feed the growing <span class="highlight">population</span>, and this resulted in more power and wealth for the elite.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">massive</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. ancient</p><p>B. carefully</p><p>C. very large</p><p>D. carefully protected</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Massive: Large, massive. A is old; B is serious; C is very big; D is carefully protected. So C is the correct answer. The original text: It had over 2,000 apartment complexes, a great market, a large number of industrial workshops, an administrative center, a number of massive religious edifices, and a regular grid pattern of streets and buildings. The facility, the previous adjective great/a large number of, etc., all said that the facility here is very large, so the massive should be close to the meaning of these words, and the old A carefully protected the D well.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>In paragraph 1, each of the following is mentioned as a feature of the city of Teotihuacï¿½n between A.D. 150 and 700 EXCEPT</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. regularly arranged streets</p><p>B. several administrative centers spread across the city</p><p>C. many manufacturing workshops</p><p>D. apartment complexes</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B EXCEPT questions, exclusion method.

It was said that other factors played a role in the difficulty of <span class="question3">pinpoint</span>ing. , The latter example is a possible role, so it should be to determine exactly which is difficult. The latter example is already described, so it is difficult to describe it incorrectly; likewise, the example has nothing to do with comprehension, so understood is also wrong; the original does not mean argument, so make an argument is completely insensitive.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question4">ingenuity</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. ambition</p><p>B. sincerity</p><p>C. faith</p><p>D. cleverness</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" D"><p>Ingenuity: Ingenuity, <span class="question4">ingenuity</span>.

The word foresightedness, which is juxtaposed with <span class="question4">ingenuity</span>, means that the foresightedness that can be juxtaposed with the foresight can only be intelligent, so D is correct. .</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the following is NOT mentioned in paragraph 2 as a main factor in the development of Teotihuacï¿½n?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.
