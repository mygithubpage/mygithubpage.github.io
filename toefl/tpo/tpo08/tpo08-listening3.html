              <span class="time" data-times="7.51" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in an Art <span class="underline">History</span> class.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.73" data-time="7.51">[00:07.51]</span>Pro: We've been talking about the art world of the late 19th <span class="underline">century</span> in Paris. <span class="time" data-times="6.05" data-time="12.24">[00:12.24]</span>And today I'd like to look at the women who went to Paris at that time to become artists. <span class="time" data-times="8.47" data-time="18.29">[00:18.29]</span>Now from your reading, what do you know about Paris, about the art world of Paris during the late 19th <span class="underline">century</span>?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.04" data-time="26.76">[00:26.76]</span>Stu: People came there from all over the world to study.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.12" data-time="30.8">[00:30.80]</span>Stu: It had a lot of art schools and artists who taught painting. <span class="time" data-times="4.76" data-time="34.92">[00:34.92]</span>There were, (our book mentions) classes for women artists. <span class="time" data-times="4.11" data-time="39.68">[00:39.68]</span>And it was a good place to go to study art.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.16" data-time="43.79">[00:43.79]</span>Pro: If you <span class="underline">wanted</span> to become an artist, Paris was not a good place to go; Paris was "THE" place to go. <span class="time" data-times="3.72" data-time="51.95">[00:51.95]</span>And women could find skilled instructors there. <span class="time" data-times="10.97" data-time="55.67">[00:55.67]</span>Before the late 19th <span class="underline">century</span>, if (they) women who <span class="underline">wanted</span> to become artists had to take private lessons or learn from family members. <span class="time" data-times="2.72" data-time="66.64">[01:06.64]</span>They had more limited options than men did.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.53" data-time="69.36">[01:09.36]</span>But around 1870s, some artists in Paris began to <span class="underline">offer</span> classes for <span class="underline">female</span> students. <span class="time" data-times="2.56" data-time="75.89">[01:15.89]</span>These classes were for women only. <span class="time" data-times="8.42" data-time="78.45">[01:18.45]</span>And by the end of the 19th <span class="underline">century</span>, it became much more <span class="underline">common</span> for women and men to study together in the same classes. <span class="time" data-times="4.79" data-time="86.87">[01:26.87]</span>So <span class="underline">within</span> a few decades, things had changed <span class="underline">significantly</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="11.6" data-time="91.66">[01:31.66]</span>OK. Let's back up again and talk about the time period from the 1860s to the 1880s and talk more about what happened in women's art classes. <span class="time" data-times="11.23" data-time="103.26">[01:43.26]</span>In 1868, a private art <span class="underline">academy</span> opened in Paris, and for decades it was probably the most famous private art school in the world. <span class="time" data-times="5.54" data-time="114.49">[01:54.49]</span>Its founder, Rodolphe Julian, was a canny businessman. <span class="time" data-times="5.93" data-time="120.03">[02:00.03]</span>And quickly established his school as a premier <span class="underline">destination</span> for women artists. <span class="time" data-times="7.46" data-time="125.96">[02:05.96]</span>What he did was: After an <span class="underline">initial</span> <span class="underline">trail</span> period of mixed classes, he changed the school <span class="underline">policy</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.96" data-time="133.42">[02:13.42]</span>He completely separated the men and women students.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.83" data-time="137.38">[02:17.38]</span>Stu: Any <span class="underline">reason</span> why he did that?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.9" data-time="139.21">[02:19.21]</span>Pro: Well. Like I said, Julian was a <span class="underline">brilliant</span> businessman, with <span class="underline">progressive</span> ideas. <span class="time" data-times="7.63" data-time="145.11">[02:25.11]</span>He saw that another small private art school where all the students were women was very <span class="underline">popular</span> at that time. <span class="time" data-times="4.18" data-time="152.74">[02:32.74]</span>And that's probably why he adopted the women only classes. <span class="time" data-times="9.09" data-time="156.92">[02:36.92]</span>His classes were typically offered by... by established artists and were held in the <span class="underline">studio</span>, the place where they painted.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.06" data-time="166.01">[02:46.01]</span>This was a big <span class="underline">deal</span> because finally women could study art in a <span class="underline">formal</span> <span class="underline">setting</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.08" data-time="172.07">[02:52.07]</span>And there was another <span class="underline">benefit</span> to the group <span class="underline">setting</span> of these classes. The classes included weekly <span class="underline">criticism</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.53" data-time="179.15">[02:59.15]</span>And the teacher would <span class="underline">rank</span> the art of all the students in the class from best to worst. <span class="time" data-times="3.04" data-time="185.68">[03:05.68]</span>How would you like it if I did that in this class?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.53" data-time="188.72">[03:08.72]</span>Stu1: Hah...No way.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.65" data-time="190.25">[03:10.25]</span>Stu2: But our textbook said that the <span class="underline">competitive</span>...the competition was good for women. <span class="time" data-times="2.56" data-time="194.9">[03:14.90]</span>It helped them see where they needed to <span class="underline">improve</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.72" data-time="197.46">[03:17.46]</span>Pro: Isn't that interesting? <span class="time" data-times="5.46" data-time="199.18">[03:19.18]</span>One woman artist, her name was Marie Bashkirtseff. <span class="time" data-times="6.33" data-time="204.64">[03:24.64]</span>Bashkirtseff once wrote how she felt about a classmate's work. <span class="time" data-times="7.15" data-time="210.97">[03:30.97]</span>She thought her classmate's art was much better than her own and it gave her an <span class="underline">incentive</span> to do better.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.01" data-time="218.12">[03:38.12]</span>
              <span class="underline">Overall</span> the competition in the women's art classes gave women more <span class="underline">confidence</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.34" data-time="224.13">[03:44.13]</span> <span class="underline">Confidence</span> that they could also <span class="underline">compete</span> in the art world after their schooling. <span class="time" data-times="7.8" data-time="228.47">[03:48.47]</span>And <span class="underline">even</span> though Bashkirtseff could not study in the same classes as men, she was having an <span class="underline">impact</span> as an artist. <span class="time" data-times="3.32" data-time="236.27">[03:56.27]</span>Just look at the <span class="underline">salon</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.91" data-time="239.59">[03:59.59]</span>What do you know about the <span class="underline">salon</span>?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.07" data-time="242.5">[04:02.50]</span>Stu: It was a big exhibition, a big art show that they had in Pairs every year. <span class="time" data-times="2.36" data-time="249.57">[04:09.57]</span>The art had to be accepted by judges.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.2" data-time="251.93">[04:11.93]</span>Stu: It was a big <span class="underline">deal</span>. <span class="time" data-times="1.62" data-time="253.13">[04:13.13]</span>You can make a name for yourself.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.96" data-time="254.75">[04:14.75]</span>Pro: You can have a painting or <span class="underline">sculpture</span> in the <span class="underline">salon</span> and go back to your home country saying you've been a success in Paris. <span class="time" data-times="3.14" data-time="262.71">[04:22.71]</span>It was <span class="underline">sort</span> of uh, a <span class="underline">seal</span> of <span class="underline">approval</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.76" data-time="265.85">[04:25.85]</span>It was a great encouragement for an artist's <span class="underline">career</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.62" data-time="269.61">[04:29.61]</span>And by the last two decades of the 19th <span class="underline">century</span>, one fifth of the paintings in the <span class="underline">salon</span> were by women, much higher than in the past.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.96" data-time="278.23">[04:38.23]</span>In fact, Marie Bashkirtseff herself had a painting in the <span class="underline">salon</span> in 1881. <span class="time" data-times="9.35" data-time="284.19">[04:44.19]</span>Interestingly this masterpiece called "In the <span class="underline">Studio</span>" is a painting of the <span class="underline">interior</span> of Julian's art school. <span class="time" data-times="1.96" data-time="293.54">[04:53.54]</span>It is not in your textbook. <span class="time" data-times="1.83" data-time="295.5">[04:55.50]</span>I will show you the painting next week. <span class="time" data-times="7.42" data-time="297.33">[04:57.33]</span>The painting depicts an active crowded <span class="underline">studio</span> with women drawing and painting a live model.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="13.47" data-time="304.75">[05:04.75]</span>It was actually, Bashkirtseff actually followed Julian's savvy suggestion and painted her <span class="underline">fellow</span> students in a class at the school with the artist herself at the far right. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="318.22">[05:18.22]</span>A great advertisement for the school when the painting <span class="underline">eventually</span> hung up at the <span class="underline">salon</span>, for a women's <span class="underline">studio</span> had never been painted before.</p>
