One defensive strategy involving the use of coloration is what is known as revealing coloration. Animals employing this strategy have an area of bright color on some part of their body, this bright color is usually hidden from predators' view. When approached by a predator, the animal suddenly reveals the area of bright color, this unexpected display of color startles or confuses the predator and provides the would-be-prey with an opportunity to escape.</p></article><div><audio src="tpo08-speaking4.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></div><article id="listening-passage" class="passage"><h3>Listening Text</h3><p>Now listen to part of a lecture from a biology class.</p><p>(male) There's a large tropical insect called the Peanut Bug. Yes, like the peanuts you eat. Um, and the Peanut Bugs front wings are colored so they blend in with their surroundings. But its back wings, which are usually closed and hidden, have these bright colorful spots on them. And when the Peanut Bugs are attacked, it suddenly opens its back wings and out pop these bright colors. And that surprises the predator and gives the Peanut Bug a chance to get away.Um, then you have a butterfly called the morpho butterfly. And parts of the morpho butterfly wings are very shiny. They reflect a lot of sunlight. When this butterfly is resting, this shiny part of its wings is hidden. Now morpho butterflies are often attacked by birds. So when a bird approaches, the morpho flies away. And when the morpho flaps its wings, all the bird can see are flashes of light reflected from the morpho's wings. Those flashes of light make it very difficult for the bird to follow the morpho. And the morpho is usually able to get away."</p></article><section id="question"><h4>Question</h4><p>Using the example of the Peanut Bug and the morpho butterfly, explain the concept of revealing coloration. </p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>Many animals use sudden revealing of their body color to protect themselves. There're two examples. The first one is peanut bug. The peanut bug has colored front wings so they blend in with the environment. But its back wings have bright colorful spots on them. Usually the back wings are closed and hidden. But once the bug is attacked, they suddenly pop it out and reveal the bright colors. This surprises the predators so the peanut bug can get away. The second one is morpho butterfly, which has special wings whose shiny parts are usually hidden when it's resting. But if a bird approaches, the morpho flies away. While taking off, its wings open and the flashes of light reflected from the wings block the bird's view to prevent it from following the morpho. (137 words)</p></article></div></main></body></html>
