It is the <span class="highlight">dominant</span> native <span class="highlight">species</span> of the <span class="highlight">lower</span> salt marshes <span class="highlight">along</span> these coasts, where it grows in the <span class="highlight">intertidal</span><span class="highlight">zone</span> (the area covered by water some parts of the day and <span class="highlight">exposed</span> others).</p><p>These natural salt marshes are among the most <span class="highlight">productive</span> habitats in the <span class="highlight">marine</span> environment. Nutrient-rich water is brought to the wetlands during each high <span class="highlight">tide</span>, making a high <span class="highlight">rate</span> of food production possible. As the seaweed and <span class="highlight">marsh</span> grass leaves die, <span class="highlight">bacteria</span><span class="highlight">break</span> down the plant <span class="highlight">material</span>, and insects, small shrimplike organisms, fiddler crabs, and <span class="highlight">marsh</span> snails eat the decaying plant <span class="highlight">tissue</span>, <span class="highlight">digest</span> it, and excrete wastes high in nutrients. <span class="question3"><span class="highlight">Numerous</span> insects <span class="highlight">occupy</span> the <span class="highlight">marsh</span>, feeding on living or dead cordgrass <span class="highlight">tissue</span>, and redwing blackbirds, sparrows, rodents, rabbits, and deer feed directly on the cordgrass.</span> Each <span class="highlight">tidal</span><span class="highlight">cycle</span> carries plant <span class="highlight">material</span> into the offshore water to be used by the subtidal organisms.</p><p>Spartina is an <span class="highlight"><span class="question5">exceedingly</span></span><span class="highlight">competitive</span> plant. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>It spreads <span class="highlight">primarily</span> by <span class="highlight">underground</span> stems; colonies form when pieces of the <span class="highlight">root</span> system or whole plants <span class="highlight">float</span> into an area and take 
<span class="highlight">root</span> or when seeds <span class="highlight">float</span> into a <span class="highlight">suitable</span> area and <span class="highlight">germinate</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>Spartina establishes itself on substrates ranging from sand and <span class="highlight">silt</span> to <span class="highlight">gravel</span> and cobble and is <span class="highlight">tolerant</span> of salinities ranging 
from that of near freshwater (0.05 percent) to that of salt water (3.5 percent). <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>Because they <span class="highlight">lack</span><span class="highlight">oxygen</span>, <span class="highlight">marsh</span> sediments are high in sulfides that are <span class="highlight">toxic</span> to most plants.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>Spartina has the <span class="highlight">ability</span> to take up sulfides and <span class="highlight">convert</span> them to sulfate, a form of <span class="highlight">sulfur</span> that the plant can use; this <span class="highlight">ability</span> makes it easier for the grass to <span class="highlight">colonize</span><span class="highlight">marsh</span> environments. Another <span class="highlight">adaptive</span><span class="highlight">advantage</span> is Spartina's <span class="highlight">ability</span> to use <span class="highlight">carbon</span><span class="highlight">dioxide</span> more efficiently than most other plants.</p><p>These characteristics make Spartina a <span class="highlight">valuable</span><span class="highlight">component</span> of the estuaries where it occurs naturally. The plant functions as a stabilizer and a <span class="highlight">sediment</span><span class="highlight">trap</span> and as a nursery area for estuarine fish and <span class="highlight">shellfish</span>. Once established, a stand of Spartina begins to <span class="highlight">trap</span><span class="highlight">sediment</span>, changing the <span class="highlight">substrate</span><span class="highlight">elevation</span>, and <span class="highlight">eventually</span> the stand evolves into a high <span class="highlight">marsh</span> system where Spartina is <span class="highlight">gradually</span> displaced by higher-elevation, brackish-water <span class="highlight">species</span>. As <span class="highlight">elevation</span> increases, narrow, deep channels of water form <span class="highlight">throughout</span> the <span class="highlight">marsh</span>. <span class="highlight">Along</span> the east <span class="highlight">coast</span> Spartina is considered <span class="highlight">valuable</span> for its <span class="highlight">ability</span> to prevent <span class="highlight">erosion</span> and marshland <span class="highlight">deterioration</span>; it is also used for coastal <span class="highlight">restoration</span> projects and the creation of new wetland sites.</p><p>Spartina was transported to Washington <span class="highlight">State</span> in packing materials for oysters transplanted from the east <span class="highlight">coast</span> in 1894. Leaving its <span class="highlight">insect</span> predators behind, the cordgrass has been spreading slowly and steadily <span class="highlight">along</span> Washington's <span class="highlight">tidal</span> estuaries on the west <span class="highlight">coast</span>, crowding out the native plants and <span class="highlight">drastically</span> altering the <span class="highlight">landscape</span> by trapping <span class="highlight">sediment</span>. Spartina <span class="question10">modifies</span><span class="highlight">tidal</span> mudflats, turning them into high marshes <span class="highlight">inhospitable</span> to the many fish and <span class="highlight">waterfowl</span> that <span class="highlight">depend</span> on the mudflats. It is already hampering the <span class="highlight">oyster</span><span class="highlight">harvest</span> and the Dungeness <span class="highlight">crab</span> fishery, and it interferes with the recreational use of beaches and waterfronts. Spartina has been transplanted to England and to New Zealand for land <span class="highlight">reclamation</span> and shoreline <span class="highlight">stabilization</span>. In New Zealand the plant has <span class="highlight">spread</span> rapidly, changing mudflats with <span class="highlight">marshy</span> fringes to <span class="highlight">extensive</span> salt meadows and reducing the number and kinds of birds and animals that use the <span class="highlight">marsh</span>.</p><p><span class="question12">Efforts</span> to control Spartina outside its natural environment have included burning, flooding, shading plants with black <span class="highlight">canvas</span> or <span class="highlight">plastic</span>, smothering the plants with dredged materials or <span class="highlight">clay</span>, applying <span class="highlight">herbicide</span>, and mowing repeatedly. Little success has been reported in New Zealand and England; Washington <span class="highlight">State</span>'s <span class="highlight">management</span> program has tried many of these methods and is presently using the <span class="highlight">herbicide</span> glyphosphate to control its <span class="highlight">spread</span>. Work has begun to <span class="highlight">determine</span> the <span class="highlight">feasibility</span> of using insects as biological controls, but <span class="highlight">effective</span> biological controls are considered years away. <span class="highlight">Even</span> with a <span class="highlight">massive</span> effort, it is doubtful that complete eradication of Spartina from nonnative habitats is possible, for it has become an <span class="highlight">integral</span> part of these shorelines and estuaries during the last 100 to 200 years.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 1, each of the following is true of Spartina alrerniflora EXCEPT:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It rarely flowers in salt marshes.</p><p>B. It grows well in intertidal zones.</p><p>C. It is commonly referred to as cordgrass.</p><p>D. It occurs naturally along the Gulf Coast and the Atlantic coast of the United States.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A EXCEPT questions, exclusion. A salt marshes keyword positioning to the second sentence, but this does not say whether the flowering information, the first sentence said spartina is perennial flowering plant, and A said does not bloom, so A said anti-selection; B of the intertidal zone Do the same keyword to the second sentence, correct, not selected; C's cordgrass keyword positioning to the first sentence, said spartina also called cordgrass, correct, not selected; D's a series of proper nouns to keyword positioning to the first Sentences, correct, not selected. The answer to this question pps is wrong, and the correct answer is A.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 2, a major reason why natural salt marshes are so productive is that they are</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. inhabited by long-lived seaweed and marsh grasses that reproduce gradually</p><p>B. kept clear of excess plant material by the tides</p><p>C. regularly supplied with high levels of nutrients</p><p>D. home to a wide variety of different species of grasses</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C. Using salt marshes are so productive keywords to locate the second sentence, said that nutrient-rich eutrophic water was brought to marsh by the tide, resulting in high productivity, so the correct answer is C. None of the other answers said.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best express the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Insects feed only on dead cordgrass, while most other marsh inhabitants feed on live cordgrass.</p><p>B. The marsh is a good habitat for insects, but a relatively poor one for birds and animals.</p><p>C. Although cordgrass provides food for birds and animals, it gives insects both food and a place to live.</p><p>D. Cordgrass provides food for numerous insects, birds, and other animals.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D The structure of the original text is that the insects and a lot of chaotic animals all eat cordgrass, so the correct answer is D. A's only dead cordgrass is the opposite of the original; B's habitat and C's a place to live did not say.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the organizational structure of paragraph 3?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It makes a general claim about Spartina and then provides specific evidence to defend that claim against objections to the claim.</p><p>B. It presents a general characterization of Spartina and then describes particular features on which this characterization is based.</p><p>C. It reports a widely held view about Spartina and then considers evidence both for and against that view.</p><p>D. It presents a general hypothesis about Spartina and then lists specific evidence that disputes that hypothesis.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B asked the structure of the whole paragraph, look at the beginning, look at the second sentence and the last sentence. The first sentence says that S is a very strong competing plant. The second sentence says how the plant grows. The last sentence says that the other advantage of adaptability is to be able to use carbon dioxide. The whole thing is saying how long the spartina is. It's What are the characteristics of the two competing features that correspond to the features of the B option? This paragraph has never said opposition, so A's objection, C's against and D's dispute are all wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question5">exceedingly</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. unusually</p><p>B. dangerously</p><p>C. surprisingly</p><p>D. highly</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" D"><p>D <span class="question5">exceedingly</span>: Very, very much. The A option is exotic, the B option is dangerously dangerous, the C option is amazing, and the D option is very, highly. So the correct answer is D's highly.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 3, one reason that Spartina is able to compete in marsh environments so successfully is its ability to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. alter the substrate in which it grows</p><p>B. convert sulfides into a usable form of sulfur</p><p>C. grow and produce seeds while floating on the surface of the water</p><p>D. produce carbon dioxide with great efficiency</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B. Position the keyword to the penultimate sentence using the marsh environments. Say that spartina can absorb sulfide and convert it to sulfate. This ability allows spartina to occupy the marsh environments. So the correct answer is B, A changes to the substrate, C's floating. The production carbon dioxide on the surface and D did not mention.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Paragraph 4 suggests that where Spartina occurs naturally, an established stand of it will eventually</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. create conditions in which it can no longer survive</p><p>B. get washed away by water flowing through the deep channels that form around it</p><p>C. become adapted to brackish water</p><p>D. take over other grass species growing in the area</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A. Positioned with the established keyword to the third sentence, said that once established, spartina will do blabla things, stand becomes a high marsh system, spartina will be replaced, so the correct answer is A no longer survive. B got washed, C's adapt and D's take over did not say.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, in its natural habitats, Spartina helps estuaries by</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. controlling marshland decline</p><p>B. decreasing the substrate elevation</p><p>C. reducing the brackishness of the water</p><p>D. increasing the flow of water into the estuary</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A. The whole paragraph is saying how spartina helps estuary, so fade out to find keywords from the question, use exclusion. A Marshland keyword positioning to the last sentence, saying that spartina can prevent erosion and marshland deterioration, and A's decline is synonymous and replace, correct; B's substrate elevation, C's reduce brackishness and D's increase the flow of water Did not say.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 5, Spartina negatively affects wildlife in estuaries by</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. trapping fish and waterfowl in sediment</p><p>B. preventing oysters from transplanting successfully</p><p>C. turning mudflats into high marshes and salt meadows</p><p>D. expanding the marshy fringes of salt meadows</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C %E9%A2%98%E5%B9%B2 negatively affects wildlife in estuaries information that can be negatively affected by: 1 crowding out the native plants and drastically altering the landscape by trapping sediment. 2 Spartina <span class="question10">modifies</span> tidal mudflats, turning them into high marshes inhospitable to the many Fish and waterfowl that depend on the mudflats. 3 changing mudflats with marshy fringes to extensive salt meadows and reducing the number and kinds of birds and animals that use the marsh.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question10">modifies</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. creates</p><p>B. changes</p><p>C. grows on</p><p>D. breaks down</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>B modify changes, so the correct answer is b. The original says that spartina is like tidal mudflats. Turn them into high marshes. Turning into is an explanation of the previous edit, so the correct answer is change. Ac grows and d breaks completely</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 6, each of the following methods has been used in attempts to control Spartina EXCEPT</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. flooding plants</p><p>B. cutting plants down repeatedly</p><p>C. applying herbicides</p><p>D. introducing predatory insects</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>Asked what bad effects the creatures had, and then took the ninth question, saying that spartina raised the tidal mudflat, making the environment unfavorable to those fish and waterfowl who rely on the mudflat, so the answer is C. A wrong, the original said trapping sediment, not fish and waterfowl; B's transport is wrong, the original is to stop the harvest; the original said to marshy fringe into a salt meadow, not D's expansion, D wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question12">Efforts</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Laws</p><p>B. Suggestions</p><p>C. Attempts</p><p>D. Failures</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" C"><p>Effort effort, try, so c's attempt is correct. The original said that controlling spartina includes burning, flooding, cutting, suffocating and so on. Law and suggestion are obviously wrong because they have already been put into action. Failure failure is repeated with the success of later text.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Spartina is particularly able to tolerate high salinities because salt glands on the surface of the leaves remove the salt from the plant sap..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C. Two transition points are the noun high salinities and the conjunction because. Using high salinities as the key word can determine whether the answer is B or C. However, according to the normal narrative mode, after the phenomenon is first described, the reason should be stated first. Surviving in the salinity environment, and then the reason, so determine the correct answer based on the cause is C.</p></div></div><div id="question14" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>
Spartina alrerniflora, or cordgrass, is the dominant native species in salt marshes along the Atlantic coast and the Gulf Coast of the United States.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.Spartina is very well adapted to conditions in salt marshes, where it plays a valuable role in stabilizing them and making them highly productive marine habitats.</p><p>B.Spartina expands by growing root systems that float on the water's surface and descend underground, where it finds the nutrients that it needs to germinate.</p><p>C.As a result of its spread in Washington State over the past hundred years,Spartina has now become a threat to native oysters by releasing sediments that contain sulfides into the waters.</p><p>D.The dead leaves of Spartina become food for a wide variety of marine organisms.</p><p>E.Outside its native regions, Spartina can pose serious problems by turning mudflats into high marshes that are inhospitable to many native fish and birds.</p><p>F.Spartina has physiological adaptations that allow it to grow in environments where other plants cannot, making it a very strong competitor that is difficult to control once it is established.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="AEF"><p>The AEF spartina is very well option corresponds to the first sentence of the second paragraph of the original text. The correct .as a result option does not say the original, and the .outside option does not correspond to the third paragraph of the original paragraph. Note that the first sentence of this paragraph is not the central sentence, and the first sentence and the second sentence are speaking an example, so do not look. Spartina expands option is a detail of the third paragraph, not selected. The dead option is mentioned in the second paragraph The details of not selecting the .spartina has option correspond to the third paragraph and the last clause, correct.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
