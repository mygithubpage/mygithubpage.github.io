            <b>Spartina</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>Spartina alterniflora, known as cordgrass, is a <span class="underline">deciduous</span>, <span class="underline">perennial</span> flowering plant native to the Atlantic <span class="underline">coast</span> and the Gulf <span class="underline">Coast</span> of the United States. It is the <span class="underline">dominant</span> native <span class="underline">species</span> of the <span class="underline">lower</span> salt marshes <span class="underline">along</span> these coasts, where it grows in the <span class="underline">intertidal</span> <span class="underline">zone</span> (the area covered by water some parts of the day and <span class="underline">exposed</span> others).</p>
          <p>These natural salt marshes are among the most <span class="underline">productive</span> habitats in the <span class="underline">marine</span> environment. Nutrient-rich water is brought to the wetlands during each high <span class="underline">tide</span>, making a high <span class="underline">rate</span> of food production possible. As the seaweed and <span class="underline">marsh</span> grass leaves die, <span class="underline">bacteria</span> <span class="underline">break</span> down the plant <span class="underline">material</span>, and insects, small shrimplike organisms, fiddler crabs, and <span class="underline">marsh</span> snails eat the decaying plant <span class="underline">tissue</span>, <span class="underline">digest</span> it, and excrete wastes high in nutrients. <span class="underline">Numerous</span> insects <span class="underline">occupy</span> the <span class="underline">marsh</span>, feeding on living or dead cordgrass <span class="underline">tissue</span>, and redwing blackbirds, sparrows, rodents, rabbits, and deer feed directly on the cordgrass. Each <span class="underline">tidal</span> <span class="underline">cycle</span> carries plant <span class="underline">material</span> into the offshore water to be used by the subtidal organisms.</p>
          <p>Spartina is an <span class="underline">exceedingly</span> <span class="underline">competitive</span> plant. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>It spreads <span class="underline">primarily</span> by <span class="underline">underground</span> stems; colonies form when pieces of the <span class="underline">root</span> system or whole plants <span class="underline">float</span> into an area and take 
<span class="underline">root</span> or when seeds <span class="underline">float</span> into a <span class="underline">suitable</span> area and <span class="underline">germinate</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>Spartina establishes itself on substrates ranging from sand and <span class="underline">silt</span> to <span class="underline">gravel</span> and cobble and is <span class="underline">tolerant</span> of salinities ranging 
from that of near freshwater (0.05 percent) to that of salt water (3.5 percent). <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>Because they <span class="underline">lack</span> <span class="underline">oxygen</span>, <span class="underline">marsh</span> sediments are high in sulfides that are <span class="underline">toxic</span> to most plants.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>Spartina has the <span class="underline">ability</span> to take up sulfides and <span class="underline">convert</span> them to sulfate, a form of <span class="underline">sulfur</span> that the plant can use; this <span class="underline">ability</span> makes it easier for the grass to <span class="underline">colonize</span> <span class="underline">marsh</span> environments. Another <span class="underline">adaptive</span> <span class="underline">advantage</span> is Spartina's <span class="underline">ability</span> to use <span class="underline">carbon</span> <span class="underline">dioxide</span> more efficiently than most other plants.</p>
          <p>These characteristics make Spartina a <span class="underline">valuable</span> <span class="underline">component</span> of the estuaries where it occurs naturally. The plant functions as a stabilizer and a <span class="underline">sediment</span> <span class="underline">trap</span> and as a nursery area for estuarine fish and <span class="underline">shellfish</span>. Once established, a stand of Spartina begins to <span class="underline">trap</span> <span class="underline">sediment</span>, changing the <span class="underline">substrate</span> <span class="underline">elevation</span>, and <span class="underline">eventually</span> the stand evolves into a high <span class="underline">marsh</span> system where Spartina is <span class="underline">gradually</span> displaced by higher-elevation, brackish-water <span class="underline">species</span>. As <span class="underline">elevation</span> increases, narrow, deep channels of water form <span class="underline">throughout</span> the <span class="underline">marsh</span>. <span class="underline">Along</span> the east <span class="underline">coast</span> Spartina is considered <span class="underline">valuable</span> for its <span class="underline">ability</span> to prevent <span class="underline">erosion</span> and marshland <span class="underline">deterioration</span>; it is also used for coastal <span class="underline">restoration</span> projects and the creation of new wetland sites.</p>
          <p>Spartina was transported to Washington <span class="underline">State</span> in packing materials for oysters transplanted from the east <span class="underline">coast</span> in 1894. Leaving its <span class="underline">insect</span> predators behind, the cordgrass has been spreading slowly and steadily <span class="underline">along</span> Washington's <span class="underline">tidal</span> estuaries on the west <span class="underline">coast</span>, crowding out the native plants and <span class="underline">drastically</span> altering the <span class="underline">landscape</span> by trapping <span class="underline">sediment</span>. Spartina modifies <span class="underline">tidal</span> mudflats, turning them into high marshes <span class="underline">inhospitable</span> to the many fish and <span class="underline">waterfowl</span> that <span class="underline">depend</span> on the mudflats. It is already hampering the <span class="underline">oyster</span> <span class="underline">harvest</span> and the Dungeness <span class="underline">crab</span> fishery, and it interferes with the recreational use of beaches and waterfronts. Spartina has been transplanted to England and to New Zealand for land <span class="underline">reclamation</span> and shoreline <span class="underline">stabilization</span>. In New Zealand the plant has <span class="underline">spread</span> rapidly, changing mudflats with <span class="underline">marshy</span> fringes to <span class="underline">extensive</span> salt meadows and reducing the number and kinds of birds and animals that use the <span class="underline">marsh</span>.</p>
          <p>Efforts to control Spartina outside its natural environment have included burning, flooding, shading plants with black <span class="underline">canvas</span> or <span class="underline">plastic</span>, smothering the plants with dredged materials or <span class="underline">clay</span>, applying <span class="underline">herbicide</span>, and mowing repeatedly. Little success has been reported in New Zealand and England; Washington <span class="underline">State</span>'s <span class="underline">management</span> program has tried many of these methods and is presently using the <span class="underline">herbicide</span> glyphosphate to control its <span class="underline">spread</span>. Work has begun to <span class="underline">determine</span> the <span class="underline">feasibility</span> of using insects as biological controls, but <span class="underline">effective</span> biological controls are considered years away. <span class="underline">Even</span> with a <span class="underline">massive</span> effort, it is doubtful that complete eradication of Spartina from nonnative habitats is possible, for it has become an <span class="underline">integral</span> part of these shorelines and estuaries during the last 100 to 200 years.</p>
