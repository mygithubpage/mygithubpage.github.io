              <span class="time" data-times="6.9" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a <span class="underline">conversation</span> between a student and his music <span class="underline">history</span> professor. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.04" data-time="6.9">[00:06.90]</span>Student: So, I was wondering what I could do to <span class="underline">improve</span> my paper before the final <span class="underline">draft</span> is <span class="underline">due</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.77" data-time="12.94">[00:12.94]</span>Professor: Well, Michael, I have no problem with your writing style. <span class="time" data-times="1.93" data-time="16.71">[00:16.71]</span>It's graceful and <span class="underline">clear</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.42" data-time="18.64">[00:18.64]</span>Eh, and it's interesting that you are writing about your grandmother's piano <span class="underline">concert</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.71" data-time="24.06">[00:24.06]</span>Student: Yeah, when you said we had to <span class="underline">attend</span> a <span class="underline">concert</span> and write about it, I immediately thought of her. <span class="time" data-times="1.89" data-time="28.77">[00:28.77]</span>I have been to lots of her concerts.<span class="time" data-times="1.65" data-time="30.66">[00:30.66]</span> So I am really <span class="underline">familiar</span> with her music. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.03" data-time="32.31">[00:32.31]</span>Professor: That's not necessarily an <span class="underline">advantage</span>.<span class="time" data-times="4.58" data-time="35.34">[00:35.34]</span> Familiarity sometimes makes it hard to see things objectively. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.47" data-time="39.92">[00:39.92]</span>Student: So I shouldn't write about my grandmother? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.52" data-time="42.39">[00:42.39]</span>Professor: No, no, no. I am just talking in general. <span class="time" data-times="8.14" data-time="46.91">[00:46.91]</span>But as I mentioned in my comments, I'd like you to place your grandmother's <span class="underline">concert</span> in... in a broader <span class="underline">context</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.27" data-time="55.05">[00:55.05]</span>Student: Yeah, I saw that, but I wasn't sure what you meant. <span class="time" data-times="7.84" data-time="58.32">[00:58.32]</span>I mean, I mentioned my grandmother's childhood, how much her parents love music, how she played the piano at all our family gatherings. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.82" data-time="66.16">[01:06.16]</span>Professor: Ok. I see what happened now. <span class="time" data-times="7.14" data-time="68.98">[01:08.98]</span>By broader <span class="underline">context</span>, I mean how the <span class="underline">concert</span> relates to some period in music <span class="underline">history</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.12" data-time="76.12">[01:16.12]</span>Student: I see. Ok. Um... I have an idea. </p>

              <span class="time" data-times="1.5" data-time="80.24">[01:20.24]</span>Professor: Ok. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.08" data-time="81.74">[01:21.74]</span>Student: Well, as you read in my paper, my grandmother performs <span class="underline">classical</span> music. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.1" data-time="86.82">[01:26.82]</span>Professor: Yes. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.31" data-time="87.92">[01:27.92]</span>Student: That's her true love. <span class="time" data-times="2.97" data-time="89.23">[01:29.23]</span>But for most of her <span class="underline">career</span>, she performed jazz. <span class="time" data-times="2.99" data-time="92.2">[01:32.20]</span>She originally studied to be a <span class="underline">classical</span> pianist. <span class="time" data-times="6.68" data-time="95.19">[01:35.19]</span>But jazz was in its <span class="underline">heyday</span> back then, and when she got out of the <span class="underline">conservatory</span>, she was invited to join a jazz <span class="underline">orchestra</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.51" data-time="101.87">[01:41.87]</span>And the <span class="underline">opportunity</span> was just too good to turn down. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.96" data-time="104.38">[01:44.38]</span>Professor: Really. Well, that's <span class="underline">fascinating</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.4" data-time="107.34">[01:47.34]</span>Because she probably had to reinvent her whole <span class="underline">musical</span> style. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.48" data-time="110.74">[01:50.74]</span>Student: She did. But jazz was where the money was at that time, at <span class="underline">least</span> for her. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.73" data-time="115.22">[01:55.22]</span>Professor: But she <span class="underline">eventually</span> went back to <span class="underline">classical</span>? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.26" data-time="117.95">[01:57.95]</span>Student: Right. But only recently. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.18" data-time="120.21">[02:00.21]</span>Professor: Ok. </p>

              <span class="time" data-times="5.14" data-time="121.39">[02:01.39]</span>Student: So if I can show how her choices <span class="underline">relate</span> to what was happening in the world of music at the time...? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.32" data-time="126.53">[02:06.53]</span>Professor: I think that might work very nicely. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.54" data-time="129.85">[02:09.85]</span>Student: And if I do that, I guess I'll have to like, interview her. </p>
            <p>

              <span class="time" data-times="1.8" data-time="135.34">[02:15.34]</span>Student: And I guess that would mean... </p>

              <span class="time" data-times="3.57" data-time="137.14">[02:17.14]</span>Professor: You'll have to rewrite most of your paper. </p>

              <span class="time" data-times="3.91" data-time="141.81">[02:21.81]</span>Professor: Yeah. Would an <span class="underline">extra</span> week <span class="underline">ease</span> the pain? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.46" data-time="145.72">[02:25.72]</span>Student: Definitely. </p>

              <span class="time" data-times="1.95" data-time="151.26">[02:31.26]</span>Student: Yeah. My mother plays piano, too.<span class="time" data-times="2.11" data-time="153.21">[02:33.21]</span> Not as well as my grandmother, but... </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.02" data-time="155.32">[02:35.32]</span>Professor: And you? </p>
