Children should be required to learn practical skills in school, such as cooking or personal finance, in addition to academic subjects.
Use details and examples to explain your opinion.</p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>I totally agree with the statement. School isn't just a place for kids to learn math, physics or chemistry. Children need to learn some practical and useful skills. Like, if children can learn cooking at school, they not only learn the basic survival skill but also a skill that can help them become more sociable. In a party, children can cook for friends. At home, children can cook for parents and relatives. Also, if children can learn personal finance at school, they'll learn how to budget their allowance and develop a good habit of spending money. Therefore, I think children should be required to learn practical skills.</p></article></div></main></body></html>
