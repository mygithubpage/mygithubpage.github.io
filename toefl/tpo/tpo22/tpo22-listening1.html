              <span class="time" data-times="2.86" data-time="5.82">[00:05.82]</span>Student: Hi, I am sorry to bother you, but... </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="0.61" data-time="8.68">[00:08.68]</span>
              <span class="underline">Faculty</span> advisor: Yes? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.05" data-time="9.29">[00:09.29]</span>Student: This is about the newspaper. </p>

              <span class="underline">Faculty</span> Advisor: Oh, Ok. Well. I am only the advisor. <span class="time" data-times="3.37" data-time="14.07">[00:14.07]</span>The newspaper office is off <span class="underline">campus</span> on Pine Street. <span class="time" data-times="1.52" data-time="17.44">[00:17.44]</span>Eh...what was it?<span class="time" data-times="1.47" data-time="18.96">[00:18.96]</span> Did you want to work for the paper? <span class="time" data-times="1.86" data-time="20.43">[00:20.43]</span>We are always looking for writers. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.93" data-time="22.29">[00:22.29]</span>Student: Well, my problem was with the writing actually, with an article that was published in yesterday's newspaper. </p>

              <span class="time" data-times="3.7" data-time="29.47">[00:29.47]</span>Student: The one about the student <span class="underline">government</span> and its <span class="underline">president</span> Sally Smith. </p>

              <span class="time" data-times="4.08" data-time="33.17">[00:33.17]</span>
              <span class="underline">Faculty</span> Advisor: Is this something to do with what the editor wrote about the <span class="underline">statue</span>? <span class="time" data-times="2.49" data-time="37.25">[00:37.25]</span>Eh, the <span class="underline">statue</span> at the main <span class="underline">entrance</span> of the university? </p>

              <span class="time" data-times="1.46" data-time="39.74">[00:39.74]</span>Student: Well, that's part of it. <span class="time" data-times="10.1" data-time="41.2">[00:41.20]</span>But you know, the editor used the situation to say some really unfair things, about the student <span class="underline">government</span>, and the <span class="underline">president</span> Sally Smith in <span class="underline">particular</span>.<span class="time" data-times="5.39" data-time="51.3">[00:51.30]</span>I think the paper should <span class="underline">publish</span> a retraction, or at the very <span class="underline">least</span> an apology to Sally. </p>

              <span class="underline">Faculty</span> Advisor: Ok. Um... if I remember correctly, what you are referring to wasn't a news story, but an <span class="underline">editorial</span>, right?<span class="time" data-times="6.4" data-time="63.9">[01:03.90]</span>Eh, it was on the opinion page, it was signed by one of the editors, and was clearly labeled as <span class="underline">commentary</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.64" data-time="70.3">[01:10.30]</span>Student: Well, yes. But the thing about the <span class="underline">statue</span>, Sally made this simple <span class="underline">comment</span> that was in really bad condition and should be replaced. <span class="time" data-times="3.65" data-time="77.94">[01:17.94]</span>And, well, the tone in the <span class="underline">editorial</span> was demeaning. <span class="time" data-times="6.44" data-time="81.59">[01:21.59]</span>It accused her of not respecting the past and it had some <span class="underline">personal</span> <span class="underline">stuff</span> that seemed unnecessary. </p>

              <span class="time" data-times="1.67" data-time="88.03">[01:28.03]</span>
              <span class="underline">Faculty</span> Advisor: Wait a <span class="underline">minute</span>. <span class="underline">Remind</span> me. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.38" data-time="89.7">[01:29.70]</span>Student: Well, you know, it implied that Sally doesn't know much about the university's <span class="underline">history</span> and it called her a big city <span class="underline">politician</span> because she's from Boston. <span class="time" data-times="2.59" data-time="99.08">[01:39.08]</span>It's just mean-spirited, isn't it? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.04" data-time="101.67">[01:41.67]</span>
              <span class="underline">Faculty</span> Advisor: <span class="underline">Haven</span>'t you heard the saying "all publicity is good publicity"? </p>

              <span class="underline">Faculty</span> Advisor: I'd say the article is bringing <span class="underline">attention</span> to the student <span class="underline">government</span> <span class="underline">organization</span>, which is <span class="underline">pretty</span> <span class="underline">invisible</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.06" data-time="111.39">[01:51.39]</span>Eh, you <span class="underline">rarely</span> hear about what the student <span class="underline">government</span> is doing. </p>

              <span class="time" data-times="1.32" data-time="114.45">[01:54.45]</span>Student: But this article... </p>

              <span class="underline">Faculty</span> Advisor: And the piece, well, yeah, it had a bit of an exaggerated tone. <span class="time" data-times="2.76" data-time="120.2">[02:00.20]</span>It was satirical, or at <span class="underline">least</span> it was meant to be.<span class="time" data-times="8.88" data-time="122.96">[02:02.96]</span> It wasn't just poking fun at Sally, but the whole idea that our school is <span class="underline">sort</span> of <span class="underline">rural</span>, and you know, not cosmopolitan. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.31" data-time="131.84">[02:11.84]</span>Student: Well, none of us thought it was very funny. </p>

              <span class="time" data-times="3.01" data-time="135.15">[02:15.15]</span>
              <span class="underline">Faculty</span> Advisor: Well, sometimes it's best just to <span class="underline">roll</span> with it.<span class="time" data-times="3.12" data-time="138.16">[02:18.16]</span> It is just a cliché; everybody knows it is not true. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.85" data-time="141.28">[02:21.28]</span>Student: But I thought we could <span class="underline">expect</span> better than that here. </p>

              <span class="underline">Faculty</span> Advisor: Well, I am certainly in <span class="underline">favor</span> of getting a <span class="underline">variety</span> of viewpoints.<span class="time" data-times="6.35" data-time="147.78">[02:27.78]</span> So why don't you go talk to the editor, Jennifer Hamilton, and tell her you want <span class="underline">equal</span> time?<span class="time" data-times="2.34" data-time="154.13">[02:34.13]</span> You or Sally could write a <span class="underline">response</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.48" data-time="156.47">[02:36.47]</span>Student: Really? She would let us do that? <span class="time" data-times="1.82" data-time="158.95">[02:38.95]</span>Didn't she write it? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.76" data-time="160.77">[02:40.77]</span>
              <span class="underline">Faculty</span> Advisor: I'll let Jennifer know you are coming, she feels the same way I do. <span class="time" data-times="1.58" data-time="164.53">[02:44.53]</span>She is <span class="underline">journalism</span> <span class="underline">major</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="166.11">[02:46.11]</span>She would be happy to <span class="underline">publish</span> another point of view. </p>
