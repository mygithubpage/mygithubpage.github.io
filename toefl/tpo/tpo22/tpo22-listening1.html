To get some advice on an article that she is writing.</p><p>B. To find out about getting a job on the student newspaper.</p><p>C. To protest the university's decision about a statue.</p><p>D. To complain about an article in the student newspaper.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>Advisor Q: Is this something to do with what the editor wrote about statue? Well, my problem was with the writing actually, with an article that was published in yesterday's newspaper.</p><p>The beginning here is the focus. Although there are questions and answers in the front, but the students answered too general, the question finally began to ask key questions! The student's answer is also obvious. But you know is a reminder. She said that the editor used her position to read articles that were very unfair, especially for Sally Smith, who demanded an apology and had no confusing options. Select D.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>What points does the man make about the article they are discussing?Click on 2 answers.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It was the personal viewpoint of the writer.</p><p>B. It was based on research by one of the editors.</p><p>C. It was meant to be humorous.</p><p>D. Not many people have read it.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="AC"><p>Ok. Um... if I remember correctly, what you are referring to wasn't a news story, but an editorial, right? Eh, it was on the opinion page, it was signed by one of the editors, and was clearly labeled as Commentary.</p><p>The advisor said that he remembered that it was a personal point of view and stated that it was a commentary. So the answer AC is correct, B's research did not mention it, and D didn't say how many people read it.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the student's opinion of the editorial's representation of Sally Smith?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. She agrees it was accurate.</p><p>B. She believes it was not respectful.</p><p>C. She believes that the editor was referring to someone else.</p><p>D. She agrees that the editorial's focus on Sally's background is relevant.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>And, well, the tone in the editorial was demeaning. It accused her of not respecting the past and it had some personal stuff that seemed unnecessary.</p><p>And,well also slightly paused, the question appeared ~ girls said the editor's voice is demeaning (demeaning), so the answer is B, does not respect people.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the man imply about the university's student government organization?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Its reputation has been damaged by recent events.</p><p>B. Its leaders need to be more careful about what they say in public about the university.</p><p>C. It will probably benefit from what the newspaper printed about it.</p><p>D. Its communications with the public have recently become more effective.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>I'd say the article is bringing attention to the student government organization, which is pretty invisible. Eh, you rarely hear about what the student government is doing.</p><p>This sentence is quoted in the advisor "all publicity is good publicity", but also appears after the question, should attract attention. Advisor said that this article brought attention to the student government organization, so the student government organization also benefited. In the past, you rarely heard what student organizations were doing, so choose C, benefit from the article.</p></div></div><div class="replay" id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the woman imply when she says this:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. She does not think that she is capable of writing the response herself.</p><p>B. She has already prepared a response to give to the editor.</p><p>C. She is worried that Sally is too upset to participate.</p><p>D. She is not convinced that the editor will agree to the request.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>Really? She would let us do that?</p><p>Both were replayed before and after, said earlier advisor suggested that girls go to the editor, hoping to be fair, and can write a response, girls say really? Express doubts about this proposal. Select D. The tone plus the previous scene is easy to understand.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
