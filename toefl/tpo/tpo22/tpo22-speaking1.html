        <article>
          <p>On way my personality has changed since I was a child is that I became honest. When I was a little kid, I always lied to my parents because I didn't want them to know that I stole money from them, didn't do homework well and played video games outside. Once I stole five yuan from my mom and used the money to play video games. Also, I was late for school. On that day, I lied to my teacher and my parents. Even if I wasn't caught by anyone, I still felt guilty of lying. I found that one lie makes many and that once people realized that I had lied to them, they started not to believe me. I felt sad about myself at that time. Gradually, I started to hold the belief that honesty is the best policy.</p>
