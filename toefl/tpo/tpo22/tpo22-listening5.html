          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="9.53" data-time="34.88">[00:34.88]</span>Well, today we are witnessing a sixth <span class="highlight">mass</span> <span class="highlight">extinction</span>, but unlike the others, the <span class="highlight">current</span> loss of bio-diversity can be traced to human to human <span class="highlight">activity</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.96" data-time="44.41">[00:44.41]</span>Since the Stone Age, humans have been eliminating <span class="highlight">species</span> and altering ecosystems with <span class="highlight">astounding</span> speed. <span class="time" data-times="10.76" data-time="51.37">[00:51.37]</span>Countless <span class="highlight">species</span> have disappeared <span class="highlight">due</span> to over-hunting, <span class="highlight">habitat</span> <span class="highlight">destruction</span> and <span class="highlight">habitat</span> fragmentation, pollution and other unnatural human causes. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="13.46" data-time="62.13">[01:02.13]</span>So, as a way of repairing some of that damage, a group of <span class="highlight">conservation</span> biologists has proposed an <span class="highlight">ambitious</span>, or some might say, a <span class="highlight">radical</span> plan, involving large vertebrates, or, megafauna. <span class="time" data-times="6.11" data-time="75.59">[01:15.59]</span>Megafauna include elephants, wild horses, big cats, camels, large animals. <span class="time" data-times="8.06" data-time="81.7">[01:21.70]</span>Eh, actually, the <span class="highlight">proposal</span> focuses on a <span class="highlight">particular</span> subset of megafauna, the kind that lived during the <span class="highlight">Pleistocene</span> <span class="highlight">epoch</span>. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="9.98" data-time="89.76">[01:29.76]</span>Ok. The <span class="highlight">Pleistocene</span> <span class="highlight">epoch</span>, most commonly known as the Ice Age, stretched from 1.8 million to 11,500 years ago. <span class="time" data-times="5.2" data-time="99.74">[01:39.74]</span>In the Americas, most megafauna began disappearing by the end of the <span class="highlight">Pleistocene</span>. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.67" data-time="104.94">[01:44.94]</span>So here's the biologists' idea. <span class="time" data-times="12.21" data-time="107.61">[01:47.61]</span>Take a select group of animals, megafauna from places like Africa and Asia, and introduce them into other ecosystems <span class="highlight">similar</span> to their <span class="highlight">current</span> homes, beginning in the United States. <span class="time" data-times="4.08" data-time="119.82">[01:59.82]</span>They call their plan <span class="highlight">Pleistocene</span> rewilding. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.87" data-time="123.9">[02:03.90]</span>Now, the advocates of <span class="highlight">Pleistocene</span> rewilding <span class="highlight">cite</span> two main goals.<span class="time" data-times="7.39" data-time="128.77">[02:08.77]</span> One is to help prevent the <span class="highlight">extinction</span> of some <span class="highlight">endangered</span> megafauna by providing new refuges, new habitats for them. <span class="time" data-times="6.58" data-time="136.16">[02:16.16]</span>The other is to <span class="highlight">restore</span> some of the <span class="highlight">evolutionary</span> and <span class="highlight">ecological</span> <span class="highlight">potential</span> that has been lost in North America.<span class="time" data-times="4.27" data-time="142.74">[02:22.74]</span> What do I mean by <span class="highlight">restore</span> <span class="highlight">evolutionary</span> <span class="highlight">potential</span>? <span class="time" data-times="6.57" data-time="147.01">[02:27.01]</span>Well, as you know the <span class="highlight">evolution</span> of any <span class="highlight">species</span> is largely influenced by its interactions with other <span class="highlight">species</span>. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="7.03" data-time="153.58">[02:33.58]</span>So during the <span class="highlight">Pleistocene</span> <span class="highlight">epoch</span>... let's take the now <span class="highlight">extinct</span> American <span class="highlight">cheetah</span>, for <span class="highlight">instance</span>. <span class="time" data-times="13.28" data-time="160.61">[02:40.61]</span>We believe it played a <span class="highlight">pivotal</span> role in the <span class="highlight">evolution</span> of the pronghorn <span class="highlight">antelope</span>, the <span class="highlight">antelope</span>'s amazing speed, to be <span class="highlight">exact</span>, because natural <span class="highlight">selection</span> would <span class="highlight">favor</span> those <span class="highlight">antelope</span> that could outrun a <span class="highlight">cheetah</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.4" data-time="173.89">[02:53.89]</span>When the American cheetahs disappeared, their influence on the <span class="highlight">evolution</span> of pronghorn and <span class="highlight">presumably</span> on other <span class="highlight">prey</span> animals stopped. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="8.68" data-time="182.29">[03:02.29]</span>So it is conceivable that the pronghorn <span class="highlight">antelope</span> would have continued to <span class="highlight">evolve</span>, get faster maybe, if the cheetahs were still around.<span class="time" data-times="3.41" data-time="190.97">[03:10.97]</span>That's what's meant by <span class="highlight">evolutionary</span> <span class="highlight">potential</span>. <span class="time" data-times="11.97" data-time="194.38">[03:14.38]</span>Importing African cheetahs to the western United States could, in <span class="highlight">theory</span>, put the pronghorn back onto its... uh, natural <span class="highlight">evolutionary</span> trajectory according to these biologists. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="9.06" data-time="206.35">[03:26.35]</span>Another example is the <span class="highlight">interaction</span> of megafauna with <span class="highlight">local</span> <span class="highlight">flora</span>, in <span class="highlight">particular</span>, plants that <span class="highlight">rely</span> on animals to <span class="highlight">disperse</span> their seeds. <span class="time" data-times="7.58" data-time="215.41">[03:35.41]</span>Like <span class="highlight">Pleistocene</span> rewilding could <span class="highlight">spark</span> the re-emergence of large seeded American plants, such as the maclura tree. <span class="time" data-times="8.11" data-time="222.99">[03:42.99]</span>Many types of maclura used to grow in North American, buy today, just one <span class="highlight">variety</span> remains and it is found in only two states. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="8.37" data-time="231.1">[03:51.10]</span>In the <span class="highlight">distant</span> past, large herbivores like mastodons dispersed maclura seeds, each the size of an orange in their droppings. <span class="time" data-times="5.95" data-time="239.47">[03:59.47]</span>Well, there aren't any mastodons left, but there are elephants, which descended from mastodons. <span class="time" data-times="6.72" data-time="245.42">[04:05.42]</span>Introduce elephants into that <span class="highlight">ecosystem</span> and they might <span class="highlight">disperse</span> those large maclura seeds, like their ancestors did. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.16" data-time="252.14">[04:12.14]</span>Get the idea?<span class="time" data-times="3.18" data-time="253.3">[04:13.30]</span> Restoring some of the <span class="highlight">former</span> <span class="highlight">balance</span> to the <span class="highlight">ecosystem</span>? <span class="time" data-times="5.91" data-time="256.48">[04:16.48]</span>But as I alluded to earlier, <span class="highlight">Pleistocene</span> rewilding is extremely <span class="highlight">controversial</span>.<span class="time" data-times="7.47" data-time="262.39">[04:22.39]</span>A big worry is that these transplanted megafauna might <span class="highlight">devastate</span> plants and animals that are native to the western United States.<span class="time" data-times="11.8" data-time="269.86">[04:29.86]</span>In the years since the <span class="highlight">Pleistocene</span> <span class="highlight">epoch</span>, native <span class="highlight">species</span> have adapted to the changing <span class="highlight">environmental</span> there, plants, smaller animals, they have been evolving without megafauna for <span class="highlight">millennia</span>. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="16.78" data-time="281.66">[04:41.66]</span>Also, animal <span class="highlight">species</span> that went <span class="highlight">extinct</span> 11,000 years ago, uh, some are quite different <span class="highlight">genetically</span> from their modern-day counterparts, like elephants don't have thick coasts like their mastodon ancestors do when they graze the prairies of the America West during the Ice Age. <span class="time" data-times="4.52" data-time="298.44">[04:58.44]</span>Granted, the <span class="highlight">climate</span> today is not as cold as it was in the <span class="highlight">Pleistocene</span>. </p>

            <span class="time" data-times="3.37" data-time="302.96">[05:02.96]</span>But winters on the <span class="highlight">prairie</span> can still get <span class="highlight">pretty</span> <span class="highlight">harsh</span> today. <span class="time" data-times="2.84" data-time="306.33">[05:06.33]</span>And there are many more considerations. <span class="time" data-times="2.29" data-time="309.17">[05:09.17]</span>Well, you see how <span class="highlight">complex</span> this is.<span class="time" data-times="7.63" data-time="311.46">[05:11.46]</span> If you think about it though, the <span class="highlight">core</span> problem with this sixth <span class="highlight">mass</span> <span class="highlight">extinction</span> is human interference. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="319.09">[05:19.09]</span> <span class="highlight">Pleistocene</span> rewilding is based on good intentions, but you know, it probably would just be more of the same thing. </p>

              <p>But as I alluded to earlier, Pleistocene rewilding is extremely controversial. After the professor asked two questions, he suddenly got a but, and then... Basically asked why the professor wanted to do this, all for the center's service, for the purpose of the service. . This question, why do plants and small animals continue to evolve? It is to illustrate that rewilding is controversial. Need to be positioned after the topic sentence and understand what is said later. Select C</p>

              <p>Pleistocene rewilding is based on good intentions, but you know, it probably would just be be more of the same thing. But you know after that, it shows the answer here. The professor said that although this plan has a good starting point, it may not be one thing that he may imagine. Select D</p>
