            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.07" data-time="4.15">[00:04.15]</span>Professor: A <span class="underline">mass</span> <span class="underline">extinction</span> as when <span class="underline">numerous</span> <span class="underline">species</span> become <span class="underline">extinct</span> over a very short time period. <span class="time" data-times="6.67" data-time="10.22">[00:10.22]</span>Short, geologically speaking that is, like when the dinosaurs died out 65 million years ago. <span class="time" data-times="10.63" data-time="16.89">[00:16.89]</span>And the <span class="underline">fossil</span> <span class="underline">record</span>, it indicates that in all the time that animals have inhabited Earth, there have been five great <span class="underline">mass</span> extinctions, dinosaurs being the most recent. <span class="time" data-times="7.36" data-time="27.52">[00:27.52]</span>In each of the others up to half of all land animals and up to 95 percent of <span class="underline">marine</span> <span class="underline">species</span> disappeared. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.53" data-time="34.88">[00:34.88]</span>Well, today we are witnessing a sixth <span class="underline">mass</span> <span class="underline">extinction</span>, but unlike the others, the <span class="underline">current</span> loss of bio-diversity can be traced to human to human <span class="underline">activity</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.96" data-time="44.41">[00:44.41]</span>Since the Stone Age, humans have been eliminating <span class="underline">species</span> and altering ecosystems with <span class="underline">astounding</span> speed. <span class="time" data-times="10.76" data-time="51.37">[00:51.37]</span>Countless <span class="underline">species</span> have disappeared <span class="underline">due</span> to over-hunting, <span class="underline">habitat</span> <span class="underline">destruction</span> and <span class="underline">habitat</span> fragmentation, pollution and other unnatural human causes. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="13.46" data-time="62.13">[01:02.13]</span>So, as a way of repairing some of that damage, a group of <span class="underline">conservation</span> biologists has proposed an <span class="underline">ambitious</span>, or some might say, a <span class="underline">radical</span> plan, involving large vertebrates, or, megafauna. <span class="time" data-times="6.11" data-time="75.59">[01:15.59]</span>Megafauna include elephants, wild horses, big cats, camels, large animals. <span class="time" data-times="8.06" data-time="81.7">[01:21.70]</span>Eh, actually, the <span class="underline">proposal</span> focuses on a <span class="underline">particular</span> subset of megafauna, the kind that lived during the <span class="underline">Pleistocene</span> <span class="underline">epoch</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.98" data-time="89.76">[01:29.76]</span>Ok. The <span class="underline">Pleistocene</span> <span class="underline">epoch</span>, most commonly known as the Ice Age, stretched from 1.8 million to 11,500 years ago. <span class="time" data-times="5.2" data-time="99.74">[01:39.74]</span>In the Americas, most megafauna began disappearing by the end of the <span class="underline">Pleistocene</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.67" data-time="104.94">[01:44.94]</span>So here's the biologists' idea. <span class="time" data-times="12.21" data-time="107.61">[01:47.61]</span>Take a select group of animals, megafauna from places like Africa and Asia, and introduce them into other ecosystems <span class="underline">similar</span> to their <span class="underline">current</span> homes, beginning in the United States. <span class="time" data-times="4.08" data-time="119.82">[01:59.82]</span>They call their plan <span class="underline">Pleistocene</span> rewilding. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.87" data-time="123.9">[02:03.90]</span>Now, the advocates of <span class="underline">Pleistocene</span> rewilding <span class="underline">cite</span> two main goals.<span class="time" data-times="7.39" data-time="128.77">[02:08.77]</span> One is to help prevent the <span class="underline">extinction</span> of some <span class="underline">endangered</span> megafauna by providing new refuges, new habitats for them. <span class="time" data-times="6.58" data-time="136.16">[02:16.16]</span>The other is to <span class="underline">restore</span> some of the <span class="underline">evolutionary</span> and <span class="underline">ecological</span> <span class="underline">potential</span> that has been lost in North America.<span class="time" data-times="4.27" data-time="142.74">[02:22.74]</span> What do I mean by <span class="underline">restore</span> <span class="underline">evolutionary</span> <span class="underline">potential</span>? <span class="time" data-times="6.57" data-time="147.01">[02:27.01]</span>Well, as you know the <span class="underline">evolution</span> of any <span class="underline">species</span> is largely influenced by its interactions with other <span class="underline">species</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.03" data-time="153.58">[02:33.58]</span>So during the <span class="underline">Pleistocene</span> <span class="underline">epoch</span>... let's take the now <span class="underline">extinct</span> American <span class="underline">cheetah</span>, for <span class="underline">instance</span>. <span class="time" data-times="13.28" data-time="160.61">[02:40.61]</span>We believe it played a <span class="underline">pivotal</span> role in the <span class="underline">evolution</span> of the pronghorn <span class="underline">antelope</span>, the <span class="underline">antelope</span>'s amazing speed, to be <span class="underline">exact</span>, because natural <span class="underline">selection</span> would <span class="underline">favor</span> those <span class="underline">antelope</span> that could outrun a <span class="underline">cheetah</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.4" data-time="173.89">[02:53.89]</span>When the American cheetahs disappeared, their influence on the <span class="underline">evolution</span> of pronghorn and <span class="underline">presumably</span> on other <span class="underline">prey</span> animals stopped. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.68" data-time="182.29">[03:02.29]</span>So it is conceivable that the pronghorn <span class="underline">antelope</span> would have continued to <span class="underline">evolve</span>, get faster maybe, if the cheetahs were still around.<span class="time" data-times="3.41" data-time="190.97">[03:10.97]</span>That's what's meant by <span class="underline">evolutionary</span> <span class="underline">potential</span>. <span class="time" data-times="11.97" data-time="194.38">[03:14.38]</span>Importing African cheetahs to the western United States could, in <span class="underline">theory</span>, put the pronghorn back onto its... uh, natural <span class="underline">evolutionary</span> trajectory according to these biologists. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.06" data-time="206.35">[03:26.35]</span>Another example is the <span class="underline">interaction</span> of megafauna with <span class="underline">local</span> <span class="underline">flora</span>, in <span class="underline">particular</span>, plants that <span class="underline">rely</span> on animals to <span class="underline">disperse</span> their seeds. <span class="time" data-times="7.58" data-time="215.41">[03:35.41]</span>Like <span class="underline">Pleistocene</span> rewilding could <span class="underline">spark</span> the re-emergence of large seeded American plants, such as the maclura tree. <span class="time" data-times="8.11" data-time="222.99">[03:42.99]</span>Many types of maclura used to grow in North American, buy today, just one <span class="underline">variety</span> remains and it is found in only two states. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.37" data-time="231.1">[03:51.10]</span>In the <span class="underline">distant</span> past, large herbivores like mastodons dispersed maclura seeds, each the size of an orange in their droppings. <span class="time" data-times="5.95" data-time="239.47">[03:59.47]</span>Well, there aren't any mastodons left, but there are elephants, which descended from mastodons. <span class="time" data-times="6.72" data-time="245.42">[04:05.42]</span>Introduce elephants into that <span class="underline">ecosystem</span> and they might <span class="underline">disperse</span> those large maclura seeds, like their ancestors did. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.16" data-time="252.14">[04:12.14]</span>Get the idea?<span class="time" data-times="3.18" data-time="253.3">[04:13.30]</span> Restoring some of the <span class="underline">former</span> <span class="underline">balance</span> to the <span class="underline">ecosystem</span>? <span class="time" data-times="5.91" data-time="256.48">[04:16.48]</span>But as I alluded to earlier, <span class="underline">Pleistocene</span> rewilding is extremely <span class="underline">controversial</span>.<span class="time" data-times="7.47" data-time="262.39">[04:22.39]</span>A big worry is that these transplanted megafauna might <span class="underline">devastate</span> plants and animals that are native to the western United States.<span class="time" data-times="11.8" data-time="269.86">[04:29.86]</span>In the years since the <span class="underline">Pleistocene</span> <span class="underline">epoch</span>, native <span class="underline">species</span> have adapted to the changing <span class="underline">environmental</span> there, plants, smaller animals, they have been evolving without megafauna for <span class="underline">millennia</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="16.78" data-time="281.66">[04:41.66]</span>Also, animal <span class="underline">species</span> that went <span class="underline">extinct</span> 11,000 years ago, uh, some are quite different <span class="underline">genetically</span> from their modern-day counterparts, like elephants don't have thick coasts like their mastodon ancestors do when they graze the prairies of the America West during the Ice Age. <span class="time" data-times="4.52" data-time="298.44">[04:58.44]</span>Granted, the <span class="underline">climate</span> today is not as cold as it was in the <span class="underline">Pleistocene</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.37" data-time="302.96">[05:02.96]</span>But winters on the <span class="underline">prairie</span> can still get <span class="underline">pretty</span> <span class="underline">harsh</span> today. <span class="time" data-times="2.84" data-time="306.33">[05:06.33]</span>And there are many more considerations. <span class="time" data-times="2.29" data-time="309.17">[05:09.17]</span>Well, you see how <span class="underline">complex</span> this is.<span class="time" data-times="7.63" data-time="311.46">[05:11.46]</span> If you think about it though, the <span class="underline">core</span> problem with this sixth <span class="underline">mass</span> <span class="underline">extinction</span> is human interference. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="319.09">[05:19.09]</span> <span class="underline">Pleistocene</span> rewilding is based on good intentions, but you know, it probably would just be more of the same thing. </p>
