Megafauna include elephants, wild horses, big cats, camels, large animals. Eh, actually, the proposal focuses on a particular subset of megafauna, the kind that lived during the Pleistocene epoch. </p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor,what are the two main goals of Pleistocene rewinding?

The other is to restore some of the evolutionary and ecological potential that has been lost in North America. </p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor,how did the American cheetah influence the pronghorn antelope during the Pleistocene epoch?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The cheetah prevented the antelope's population from growing too large.</p><p>B. The cheetah was a factor in the development of the antelope's speed.</p><p>C. The cheetah dispersed the seeds of plants that the antelope needed to survive.</p><p>D. The cheetah caused the antelope to migrate out of the western United States.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>We believe it played a pivotal role in the evolution of the pronghorn antelope, the antelope's amazing speed, to be exact, because natural selection would prefer those antelope that could outrun a cheetah.</p><p>The professor said let's take the now extinct American cheetah, for example. When it comes to instance, it's time to bring up the 12 points of the spirit. Sure enough, the American cheetah has a crucial role to play in the evolution of PA. Amazing speed.

After the professor asked two questions, he suddenly got a but, and then... Basically asked why the professor wanted to do this, all for the center's service, for the purpose of the service. . This question, why do plants and small animals continue to evolve? It is to illustrate that rewilding is controversial.
