              <span class="time" data-times="3.96" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in a music <span class="underline">history</span> class. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.35" data-time="3.96">[00:03.96]</span>Professor: So, uh, if you are a <span class="underline">musician</span> in the United States in the early twentieth <span class="underline">century</span>, where could you work? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.86" data-time="10.31">[00:10.31]</span>Student: Same as now, I <span class="underline">suppose</span>. <span class="time" data-times="1.17" data-time="12.17">[00:12.17]</span>In an <span class="underline">orchestra</span>, mainly. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.9" data-time="13.34">[00:13.34]</span>Professor: Ok. And where would the <span class="underline">orchestra</span> be playing? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.52" data-time="16.24">[00:16.24]</span>Student: Uh, in a <span class="underline">concert</span> hall or a dance hall? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="0.71" data-time="18.76">[00:18.76]</span>Professor: That's right.<span class="time" data-times="8.24" data-time="19.47">[00:19.47]</span> And smaller groups of musicians were needed in theaters as accompaniment to <span class="underline">visual</span> entertainment, like cabarets and <span class="underline">variety</span> shows.<span class="time" data-times="10.11" data-time="27.71">[00:27.71]</span>But the largest employer for musicians back then was the <span class="underline">film</span> <span class="underline">industry</span>, especially during the silent-film <span class="underline">era</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.3" data-time="37.82">[00:37.82]</span>Student: Really? You mean being a piano player or something? <span class="time" data-times="2.7" data-time="40.12">[00:40.12]</span>I thought movie theaters would have used recorded music. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.24" data-time="42.82">[00:42.82]</span>Professor: Well, no.<span class="time" data-times="1.72" data-time="44.06">[00:44.06]</span> Not during the silent-film <span class="underline">era</span>.<span class="time" data-times="7.83" data-time="45.78">[00:45.78]</span> We are talking a period of maybe thirty years where working in movie theaters was the best job for musicians. <span class="time" data-times="2.22" data-time="53.61">[00:53.61]</span>It was very well-paid.<span class="time" data-times="4.87" data-time="55.83">[00:55.83]</span> The rapid growth of the <span class="underline">film</span> <span class="underline">industry</span> meant movie theaters were popping up everywhere. <span class="time" data-times="3.96" data-time="60.7">[01:00.70]</span>So suddenly there was this huge demand for musicians. <span class="time" data-times="10.24" data-time="64.66">[01:04.66]</span>In fact, over 20,000 jobs for musicians were gone, disappeared at the end of the silent-film <span class="underline">era</span>, 20,000. <span class="time" data-times="7.72" data-time="74.9">[01:14.90]</span>Ok. So from the beginning, music was a big part of <span class="underline">film</span>, <span class="underline">even</span> at the first... </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.34" data-time="82.62">[01:22.62]</span>Student: Excuse me, professor. <span class="time" data-times="6.02" data-time="83.96">[01:23.96]</span>I think I read somewhere that they used music to drown out the <span class="underline">sound</span> of the <span class="underline">film</span> projectors? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.3" data-time="89.98">[01:29.98]</span>Professor: Yeah. That's good story, isn't it? <span class="time" data-times="4.78" data-time="92.28">[01:32.28]</span>Too bad it keeps getting printed as if it were the only <span class="underline">reason</span> music was used. <span class="time" data-times="1.94" data-time="97.06">[01:37.06]</span>Well, think about it.<span class="time" data-times="10.5" data-time="99">[01:39.00]</span> <span class="underline">Even</span> if that were the case, noisy projectors were separated from the main house <span class="underline">pretty</span> quickly, yet music continued to <span class="underline">accompany</span> <span class="underline">film</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.05" data-time="109.5">[01:49.50]</span>So, as I was saying, <span class="underline">even</span> the very first public <span class="underline">projection</span> of a <span class="underline">film</span> had piano accompaniment. <span class="time" data-times="3.05" data-time="117.55">[01:57.55]</span>So music was <span class="underline">pretty</span> much always there. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.52" data-time="120.6">[02:00.60]</span>What's strange to me though, is that at first <span class="underline">film</span> music didn't necessarily <span class="underline"><span class="underline">correspond</span></span> to what was on the <span class="underline">screen</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.61" data-time="128.12">[02:08.12]</span>You know, eh, a fast number for a <span class="underline">chase</span>, deep bass notes for danger, something light and <span class="underline">humorous</span> for <span class="underline">comedy</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.99" data-time="135.73">[02:15.73]</span>And that's <span class="underline">instantly</span> recognizable now, <span class="underline">even</span> expected. <span class="time" data-times="4.92" data-time="139.72">[02:19.72]</span>But in the very early days of <span class="underline">film</span>, any music was played. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.27" data-time="144.64">[02:24.64]</span>A theater owner would just buy a pile of sheet music and musicians will play it, no matter what it was. <span class="time" data-times="5.6" data-time="151.91">[02:31.91]</span> <span class="underline">Pretty</span> quickly though, thankfully, everybody realized the music should suit the <span class="underline">film</span>. <span class="time" data-times="13.13" data-time="157.51">[02:37.51]</span>So <span class="underline">eventually</span>, <span class="underline">film</span> makers tried to get more control over the <span class="underline">musical</span> accompaniment of their films, and <span class="underline">specify</span> what type of music to use and how fast or slow to play it. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.86" data-time="170.64">[02:50.64]</span>Student: Are you saying there was no music written <span class="underline">specifically</span> for a <span class="underline">particular</span> movie? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3" data-time="175.5">[02:55.50]</span>Professor: Yeah. <span class="underline">Original</span> scores weren't <span class="underline">common</span> then.<span class="time" data-times="11.38" data-time="178.5">[02:58.50]</span> <span class="underline">Rarely</span> a filmmaker might send <span class="underline">along</span> an <span class="underline">original</span> <span class="underline">score</span> composed especially for a <span class="underline">film</span>, but usually a compilation of music that already existed would be used. <span class="time" data-times="4.24" data-time="189.88">[03:09.88]</span>Yeah, that was a good time for a lot of musicians.<span class="time" data-times="5.21" data-time="194.12">[03:14.12]</span> But that all changed with the <span class="underline">introduction</span> of <span class="underline">sound</span> on <span class="underline">film</span> technology. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.31" data-time="199.33">[03:19.33]</span>Actually, <span class="underline">even</span> before that, organs could <span class="underline">mimic</span> a number of instruments and also do some <span class="underline">sound</span> effects. <span class="time" data-times="7.84" data-time="206.64">[03:26.64]</span>So they were starting to <span class="underline">replace</span> live orchestras in some movie theaters, and it only takes one person to play an organ. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.61" data-time="214.48">[03:34.48]</span>Student: Ok. But <span class="underline">even</span> after that, someone still had to play the music for the <span class="underline">sound</span> for the <span class="underline">sound</span> recordings, the soundtracks. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.74" data-time="220.09">[03:40.09]</span>Professor: Yeah. But think of all the movie theaters there were, most employing about six to eight musicians, some <span class="underline">even</span> had full orchestras. <span class="time" data-times="5.77" data-time="228.83">[03:48.83]</span>But in the early 1930s, most theater owners installed new <span class="underline">sound</span> systems. <span class="time" data-times="3.77" data-time="234.6">[03:54.60]</span>So suddenly a lot of musicians were looking for work. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.58" data-time="238.37">[03:58.37]</span>Once recording technology took off, <span class="underline">studio</span> jobs working <span class="underline">exclusively</span> for one <span class="underline">film</span> <span class="underline">company</span>, eh, <span class="underline">studio</span> jobs did become <span class="underline">available</span>.<span class="time" data-times="9.73" data-time="247.95">[04:07.95]</span>But the thing is, each <span class="underline">major</span> movie <span class="underline">company</span> <span class="underline">pretty</span> much had only one <span class="underline">orchestra</span> for all their productions, a set number of <span class="underline">regular</span> musicians.<span class="time" data-times="4.29" data-time="257.68">[04:17.68]</span>So if you could get it, <span class="underline">studio</span> <span class="underline">musician</span> was a good job. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.37" data-time="261.97">[04:21.97]</span>If you were cut out for it, musicians had to be able to read music very well, since the producers were very <span class="underline">conscious</span> of how much money they were spending. <span class="time" data-times="2.2" data-time="271.34">[04:31.34]</span>They didn't want to <span class="underline">waste</span> any time. <span class="time" data-times="7.21" data-time="273.54">[04:33.54]</span>So a <span class="underline">musician</span> was expected to play <span class="underline">complicated</span> pieces of music <span class="underline">pretty</span> much without any preparation. <span class="time" data-times="4.56" data-time="280.75">[04:40.75]</span>If one couldn't do it, there were plenty of others waiting to try. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="285.31">[04:45.31]</span>So there was a lot of <span class="underline">pressure</span> to do well. </p>
