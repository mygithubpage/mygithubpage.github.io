          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.35" data-time="3.96">[00:03.96]</span>Professor: So, uh, if you are a <span class="highlight">musician</span> in the United States in the early twentieth <span class="highlight">century</span>, where could you work? </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.86" data-time="10.31">[00:10.31]</span>Student: Same as now, I <span class="highlight">suppose</span>. <span class="time" data-times="1.17" data-time="12.17">[00:12.17]</span>In an <span class="highlight">orchestra</span>, mainly. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.9" data-time="13.34">[00:13.34]</span>Professor: Ok. And where would the <span class="highlight">orchestra</span> be playing? </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.52" data-time="16.24">[00:16.24]</span>Student: Uh, in a <span class="highlight">concert</span> hall or a dance hall? </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="0.71" data-time="18.76">[00:18.76]</span>Professor: That's right.<span class="time" data-times="8.24" data-time="19.47">[00:19.47]</span> And smaller groups of musicians were needed in theaters as accompaniment to <span class="highlight">visual</span> entertainment, like cabarets and <span class="highlight">variety</span> shows.<span class="time" data-times="10.11" data-time="27.71">[00:27.71]</span>But the largest employer for musicians back then was the <span class="highlight">film</span> <span class="highlight">industry</span>, especially during the silent-film <span class="highlight">era</span>. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.3" data-time="37.82">[00:37.82]</span>Student: Really? You mean being a piano player or something? <span class="time" data-times="2.7" data-time="40.12">[00:40.12]</span>I thought movie theaters would have used recorded music. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.24" data-time="42.82">[00:42.82]</span>Professor: Well, no.<span class="time" data-times="1.72" data-time="44.06">[00:44.06]</span> Not during the silent-film <span class="highlight">era</span>.<span class="time" data-times="7.83" data-time="45.78">[00:45.78]</span> We are talking a period of maybe thirty years where working in movie theaters was the best job for musicians. <span class="time" data-times="2.22" data-time="53.61">[00:53.61]</span>It was very well-paid.<span class="time" data-times="4.87" data-time="55.83">[00:55.83]</span> The rapid growth of the <span class="highlight">film</span> <span class="highlight">industry</span> meant movie theaters were popping up everywhere. <span class="time" data-times="3.96" data-time="60.7">[01:00.70]</span>So suddenly there was this huge demand for musicians. <span class="time" data-times="10.24" data-time="64.66">[01:04.66]</span>In fact, over 20,000 jobs for musicians were gone, disappeared at the end of the silent-film <span class="highlight">era</span>, 20,000. <span class="time" data-times="7.72" data-time="74.9">[01:14.90]</span>Ok. So from the beginning, music was a big part of <span class="highlight">film</span>, <span class="highlight">even</span> at the first... </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.34" data-time="82.62">[01:22.62]</span>Student: Excuse me, professor. <span class="time" data-times="6.02" data-time="83.96">[01:23.96]</span>I think I read somewhere that they used music to drown out the <span class="highlight">sound</span> of the <span class="highlight">film</span> projectors? </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.3" data-time="89.98">[01:29.98]</span>Professor: Yeah. That's good story, isn't it? <span class="time" data-times="4.78" data-time="92.28">[01:32.28]</span>Too bad it keeps getting printed as if it were the only <span class="highlight">reason</span> music was used. <span class="time" data-times="1.94" data-time="97.06">[01:37.06]</span>Well, think about it.<span class="time" data-times="10.5" data-time="99">[01:39.00]</span> <span class="highlight">Even</span> if that were the case, noisy projectors were separated from the main house <span class="highlight">pretty</span> quickly, yet music continued to <span class="highlight">accompany</span> <span class="highlight">film</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.05" data-time="109.5">[01:49.50]</span>So, as I was saying, <span class="highlight">even</span> the very first public <span class="highlight">projection</span> of a <span class="highlight">film</span> had piano accompaniment. <span class="time" data-times="3.05" data-time="117.55">[01:57.55]</span>So music was <span class="highlight">pretty</span> much always there. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="7.52" data-time="120.6">[02:00.60]</span>What's strange to me though, is that at first <span class="highlight">film</span> music didn't necessarily <span class="highlight">correspond</span> to what was on the <span class="highlight">screen</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.61" data-time="128.12">[02:08.12]</span>You know, eh, a fast number for a <span class="highlight">chase</span>, deep bass notes for danger, something light and <span class="highlight">humorous</span> for <span class="highlight">comedy</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.99" data-time="135.73">[02:15.73]</span>And that's <span class="highlight">instantly</span> recognizable now, <span class="highlight">even</span> expected. <span class="time" data-times="4.92" data-time="139.72">[02:19.72]</span>But in the very early days of <span class="highlight">film</span>, any music was played. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="7.27" data-time="144.64">[02:24.64]</span>A theater owner would just buy a pile of sheet music and musicians will play it, no matter what it was. <span class="time" data-times="5.6" data-time="151.91">[02:31.91]</span> <span class="highlight">Pretty</span> quickly though, thankfully, everybody realized the music should suit the <span class="highlight">film</span>. <span class="time" data-times="13.13" data-time="157.51">[02:37.51]</span>So <span class="highlight">eventually</span>, <span class="highlight">film</span> makers tried to get more control over the <span class="highlight">musical</span> accompaniment of their films, and <span class="highlight">specify</span> what type of music to use and how fast or slow to play it. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.86" data-time="170.64">[02:50.64]</span>Student: Are you saying there was no music written <span class="highlight">specifically</span> for a <span class="highlight">particular</span> movie? </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3" data-time="175.5">[02:55.50]</span>Professor: Yeah. <span class="highlight">Original</span> scores weren't <span class="highlight">common</span> then.<span class="time" data-times="11.38" data-time="178.5">[02:58.50]</span> <span class="highlight">Rarely</span> a filmmaker might send <span class="highlight">along</span> an <span class="highlight">original</span> <span class="highlight">score</span> composed especially for a <span class="highlight">film</span>, but usually a compilation of music that already existed would be used. <span class="time" data-times="4.24" data-time="189.88">[03:09.88]</span>Yeah, that was a good time for a lot of musicians.<span class="time" data-times="5.21" data-time="194.12">[03:14.12]</span> But that all changed with the <span class="highlight">introduction</span> of <span class="highlight">sound</span> on <span class="highlight">film</span> technology. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="7.31" data-time="199.33">[03:19.33]</span>Actually, <span class="highlight">even</span> before that, organs could <span class="highlight">mimic</span> a number of instruments and also do some <span class="highlight">sound</span> effects. <span class="time" data-times="7.84" data-time="206.64">[03:26.64]</span>So they were starting to <span class="highlight">replace</span> live orchestras in some movie theaters, and it only takes one person to play an organ. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.61" data-time="214.48">[03:34.48]</span>Student: Ok. But <span class="highlight">even</span> after that, someone still had to play the music for the <span class="highlight">sound</span> for the <span class="highlight">sound</span> recordings, the soundtracks. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="8.74" data-time="220.09">[03:40.09]</span>Professor: Yeah. But think of all the movie theaters there were, most employing about six to eight musicians, some <span class="highlight">even</span> had full orchestras. <span class="time" data-times="5.77" data-time="228.83">[03:48.83]</span>But in the early 1930s, most theater owners installed new <span class="highlight">sound</span> systems. <span class="time" data-times="3.77" data-time="234.6">[03:54.60]</span>So suddenly a lot of musicians were looking for work. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="9.58" data-time="238.37">[03:58.37]</span>Once recording technology took off, <span class="highlight">studio</span> jobs working <span class="highlight">exclusively</span> for one <span class="highlight">film</span> <span class="highlight">company</span>, eh, <span class="highlight">studio</span> jobs did become <span class="highlight">available</span>.<span class="time" data-times="9.73" data-time="247.95">[04:07.95]</span>But the thing is, each <span class="highlight">major</span> movie <span class="highlight">company</span> <span class="highlight">pretty</span> much had only one <span class="highlight">orchestra</span> for all their productions, a set number of <span class="highlight">regular</span> musicians.<span class="time" data-times="4.29" data-time="257.68">[04:17.68]</span>So if you could get it, <span class="highlight">studio</span> <span class="highlight">musician</span> was a good job. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="9.37" data-time="261.97">[04:21.97]</span>If you were cut out for it, musicians had to be able to read music very well, since the producers were very <span class="highlight">conscious</span> of how much money they were spending. <span class="time" data-times="2.2" data-time="271.34">[04:31.34]</span>They didn't want to <span class="highlight">waste</span> any time. <span class="time" data-times="7.21" data-time="273.54">[04:33.54]</span>So a <span class="highlight">musician</span> was expected to play <span class="highlight">complicated</span> pieces of music <span class="highlight">pretty</span> much without any preparation. <span class="time" data-times="4.56" data-time="280.75">[04:40.75]</span>If one couldn't do it, there were plenty of others waiting to try. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="285.31">[04:45.31]</span>So there was a lot of <span class="highlight">pressure</span> to do well. </p>

Actually, the professor said in front of him that there was a special emphasis on the But the smallest employer. For the musicians back then was the film industry, especially during the silent-film era. So this 20,000 is to illustrate that previous silent films required many musicians, choose C.</p>

              <p>Yeah. That's good story, isn't it? Too bad it keeps getting printed as if it was the only reason music was used. Well, think about it. Even if that were the case, noisy projectors were separated from the main house pretty Quickly, yet music continued to accompany film.</p>
              <p>This piece is a problem-solving question point, a professor's rhetorical question, and only where prompted. Does the professor say that it is not too bad to use music just to cover up noise? So the professor is skeptical of this point of view, choose D.</p>
