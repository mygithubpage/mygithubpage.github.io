Beginning next semester, however, current students will lead these guided walks around the campus instead. "The staff of the admissions office no longer have time to lead the campus tours. We need to focus our resources on our other responsibilities," explain Christine Tanner, the director of admissions. "Furthermore, we feel that current students will offer unique and valuable insight to our visitors during these campus tours."</p></article><div><audio src="tpo22-speaking3.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></div><article id="listening-passage" class="passage"><h3>Listening Text</h3><p>Now listen to two students discussing the article.</p><p>(man) So, what do you think of this?</p><p>(woman) Well, I think it's a good idea, necessary, too.</p><p>(man) Why is that?</p><p>(woman) Well, you know, I've actually been up to the admissions office a couple of times, like, to pick up some information for a friend, you know, and every time I've ever been there, wow, you can tell they're really busy.</p><p>(man) Oh, really.</p><p>(woman) Yeah, those staff members are running around like crazy, on the phone, doing interviews, dealing with tons of paper work, so I can totally believe what they are saying about the time factor, seems like having one less thing to worry about will be a good thing.</p><p>(man) Sounds like it.</p><p>(woman) Yep, oh, and about the other point,</p><p>(man) The, uh, the different perspective thing?</p><p>(woman) Uh hum, I think people like us will be really good at this. Unlike, you know, I remember when I was first shown around the campus, the guide leading was, well, he was super nice, but there were some questions that he couldn't really answer from experience.</p><p>(man) Like what?</p><p>(woman) Well, practical things, which are the noisier dorms?

Then state her opinion about the plan and explain the reasons she give s for holding that opinion. </p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>Well, according to the university's plan, current students will lead the guided walk around the campus instead of staff members from the admission office. Accordingly, the woman agrees with the plan for two main reasons. First, she agrees that the staff members are indeed crazily busy and just couldn't spare time for the guided walk around campus-they have too many things to do like answering phones, doing interviews, paperwork and so on. Besides, she thinks that the students are really good at the guided walk around the campus because they are more familiar with the campus compared with the staff members, since the students do have first-hand knowledge about their campus life and therefore could offer more practical information. For example they could tell which dorm is noisier and which is quietest, the best student cafe to recommend and so on. So the woman agrees with the plan for the reasons stated.
