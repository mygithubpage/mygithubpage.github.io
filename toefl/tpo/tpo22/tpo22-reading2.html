            <b>The Birth of Photography</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>Unlike most <span class="underline">major</span> inventions, <span class="underline">photography</span> had been long and impatiently awaited. The images produced by the camera obscura, a boxlike <span class="underline">device</span> that used a pinhole or <span class="underline">lens</span> to <span class="underline">throw</span> an <span class="underline">image</span> onto a 
ground-glass <span class="underline">screen</span> or a piece of white paper, were already <span class="underline">familiar</span>-the <span class="underline">device</span> had been much employed by <span class="underline">topographical</span> artists like the Italian painter Canaletto in his detailed views of the 
city of Venice. What was lacking was a way of giving such images <span class="underline">permanent</span> form. This was finally achieved by Louis Daguerre (1787-1851), who perfected a way of fixing them on a silvered <span class="underline">copper</span> <span class="underline">plate</span>. His discovery, the "daguerreotype," was announced in 1839. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span></p>
          <p>A <span class="underline">second</span> and very different <span class="underline">process</span> was patented by the British inventor William Henry Talbot (1800-1877) in 1841. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> Talbot's "calotype" was the first negative-to-positive <span class="underline">process</span> and the 
direct <span class="underline">ancestor</span> of the modern <span class="underline">photograph</span>. The calotype was <span class="underline">revolutionary</span> in its use of chemically treated paper in which areas hit by light became dark in tone, producing a <span class="underline">negative</span> <span class="underline">image</span>.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>This "<span class="underline">negative</span>," as Talbot called it, could then be used to print <span class="underline">multiple</span> <span class="underline">positive</span> images on another piece of treated paper. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p>
          <p>The two processes produced very different results. The daguerreotype was a <span class="underline">unique</span> <span class="underline">image</span> that reproduced what was in front of the camera <span class="underline">lens</span> in <span class="underline">minute</span>, unselective <span class="underline">detail</span> and could not be duplicated. The calotype could be made in <span class="underline">series</span>, and was thus the <span class="underline">equivalent</span> of an etching or an <span class="underline">engraving</span>. Its general effect was <span class="underline">soft</span> edged and <span class="underline">tonal</span>.</p>
          <p>One of the things that most impressed the <span class="underline">original</span> <span class="underline">audience</span> for <span class="underline">photography</span> was the idea of <span class="underline">authenticity</span>. Nature now seemed able to speak for itself, with a <span class="underline">minimum</span> of interference. The title Talbot chose for his book, The Pencil of Nature (the first part of which was published in 1844), reflected this feeling. Artists were fascinated by <span class="underline">photography</span> because it offered a way of examining the world in much greater <span class="underline">detail</span>. They were also afraid of it, because it seemed likely to make their own efforts unnecessary.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="underline">Photography</span> did indeed make certain kinds of painting <span class="underline">obsolete</span>-the daguerreotype <span class="underline">virtually</span> did away with the <span class="underline">portrait</span> miniature. It also made the whole business of making and owning images <span class="underline">democratic</span>. <span class="underline">Portraiture</span>, once a <span class="underline">luxury</span> for the <span class="underline">privileged</span> few, was suddenly well <span class="underline">within</span> the <span class="underline">reach</span> of many more people.</p>
          <p>In the long <span class="underline">term</span>, <span class="underline">photography</span>'s <span class="underline">impact</span> on the <span class="underline">visual</span> arts was far from simple. Because the <span class="underline">medium</span> was so <span class="underline">prolific</span>, in the <span class="underline">sense</span> that it was possible to produce a <span class="underline">multitude</span> of images very cheaply, it was soon treated as the poor relation of fine art, rather than its <span class="underline">destined</span> successor. <span class="underline">Even</span> those artists who were most dependent on <span class="underline">photography</span> became <span class="underline">reluctant</span> to <span class="underline">admit</span> that they made use of it, in case this compromised their <span class="underline">professional</span> standing.</p>
          <p>The rapid <span class="underline">technical</span> <span class="underline">development</span> of <span class="underline">photography</span>-the <span class="underline">introduction</span> of lighter and simpler equipment, and of new emulsions that coated <span class="underline">photographic</span> plates, <span class="underline">film</span>, and paper and enabled images to be made at much faster speeds-had some unanticipated consequences. <span class="underline">Scientific</span> experiments made by photographers such as Eadweard Muybridge (1830-1904) and Etienne-Jules Marey (1830-1904) demonstrated that the movements of both humans and animals differed widely from the way they had been traditionally represented in art. Artists, often <span class="underline">reluctantly</span>, were forced to accept the <span class="underline">evidence</span> provided by the camera. The new <span class="underline">candid</span> <span class="underline">photography</span>-unposed pictures that were made when the subjects were unaware that their pictures were being taken-confirmed these <span class="underline">scientific</span> results, and at the same time, thanks to the <span class="underline">radical</span> cropping (trimming) of images that the camera often imposed, suggested new compositional formats. The accidental effects obtained by <span class="underline">candid</span> photographers were soon being copied by artists such as the French painter Degas.</p>
