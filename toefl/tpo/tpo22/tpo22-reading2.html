The images produced by the camera obscura, a boxlike <span class="highlight">device</span> that used a pinhole or <span class="highlight">lens</span> to <span class="highlight">throw</span> an <span class="highlight">image</span> onto a 
ground-glass <span class="highlight">screen</span> or a piece of white paper, were already <span class="highlight">familiar</span>-the <span class="highlight">device</span> had been much employed by <span class="highlight">topographical</span> artists like the Italian painter Canaletto in his detailed views of the 
city of Venice. What was lacking was a way of giving such images <span class="highlight">permanent</span> form. This was finally achieved by Louis Daguerre (1787-1851), who perfected a way of fixing them on a silvered <span class="highlight">copper</span><span class="highlight">plate</span>. His discovery, the "daguerreotype," was announced in 1839. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span></p><p>A <span class="highlight">second</span> and very different <span class="highlight">process</span> was patented by the British inventor William Henry Talbot (1800-1877) in 1841. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> Talbot's "calotype" was the first negative-to-positive <span class="highlight">process</span> and the 
direct <span class="highlight">ancestor</span> of the modern <span class="highlight">photograph</span>. The calotype was <span class="highlight">revolutionary</span> in its use of chemically treated paper in which areas hit by light became dark in tone, producing a <span class="highlight">negative</span><span class="highlight">image</span>.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>This "<span class="highlight">negative</span>," as Talbot called it, could then be used to print <span class="highlight">multiple</span><span class="highlight">positive</span> images on another piece of treated paper. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p><p>The two processes produced very different results. The daguerreotype was a <span class="highlight">unique</span><span class="highlight">image</span> that reproduced what was in front of the camera <span class="highlight">lens</span> in <span class="highlight">minute</span>, unselective <span class="highlight">detail</span> and could not be <span class="question3">duplicated</span>. The calotype could be made in <span class="highlight">series</span>, and was thus the <span class="highlight">equivalent</span> of an etching or an <span class="highlight">engraving</span>. <span class="question4">Its general effect</span> was <span class="highlight">soft</span> edged and <span class="highlight">tonal</span>.</p><p>One of the things that most impressed the <span class="highlight">original</span><span class="highlight">audience</span> for <span class="highlight">photography</span> was the idea of <span class="highlight"><span class="question5">authenticity</span></span>. Nature now seemed able to speak for itself, with a <span class="highlight">minimum</span> of interference. The title Talbot chose for his book, The Pencil of Nature (the first part of which was published in 1844), reflected this feeling. Artists were fascinated by <span class="highlight">photography</span> because it offered a way of examining the world in much greater <span class="highlight">detail</span>. They were also afraid of it, because it seemed likely to make their own efforts unnecessary.</p><p><span class="highlight">Photography</span> did indeed make certain kinds of painting <span class="highlight">obsolete</span>-the daguerreotype <span class="highlight">virtually</span> did away with the <span class="highlight">portrait</span> miniature. It also made the whole business of making and owning images <span class="highlight">democratic</span>. <span class="highlight">Portraiture</span>, once a <span class="highlight">luxury</span> for the <span class="highlight">privileged</span> few, was suddenly well <span class="highlight">within</span> the <span class="highlight">reach</span> of many more people.</p><p>In the long <span class="highlight">term</span>, <span class="highlight">photography</span>'s <span class="highlight">impact</span> on the <span class="highlight">visual</span> arts was far from simple. <span class="question8">Because the <span class="highlight">medium</span> was so <span class="highlight">prolific</span>, in the <span class="highlight">sense</span> that it was possible to produce a <span class="highlight">multitude</span> of images very cheaply, it was soon treated as the poor relation of fine art, rather than its <span class="highlight">destined</span> successor.</span><span class="highlight">Even</span> those artists who were most dependent on <span class="highlight">photography</span> became <span class="highlight"><span class="question7">reluctant</span></span> to <span class="highlight">admit</span> that they made use of it, in case this compromised their <span class="highlight">professional</span> standing.</p><p>The rapid <span class="highlight">technical</span><span class="highlight">development</span> of <span class="highlight">photography</span>-the <span class="highlight">introduction</span> of lighter and simpler equipment, and of new emulsions that coated <span class="highlight">photographic</span> plates, <span class="highlight">film</span>, and paper and enabled images to be made at much faster speeds-had some <span class="question9">unanticipated</span> consequences. <span class="highlight">Scientific</span> experiments made by photographers such as Eadweard Muybridge (1830-1904) and Etienne-Jules Marey (1830-1904) demonstrated that the movements of both humans and animals differed widely from the way they had been traditionally represented in art. Artists, often <span class="highlight">reluctantly</span>, were forced to accept the <span class="highlight">evidence</span> provided by the camera. The new <span class="highlight">candid</span><span class="highlight">photography</span>-unposed pictures that were made when the subjects were unaware that their pictures were being taken-confirmed these <span class="highlight">scientific</span> results, and at the same time, thanks to the <span class="highlight">radical</span> cropping (trimming) of images that the camera often imposed, suggested new compositional formats. The <span class="question10">accidental</span> effects obtained by <span class="highlight">candid</span> photographers were soon being copied by artists such as the French painter Degas.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What can be inferred from paragraphs 1 and 2 about the effect of photography on nineteenth-century painting?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Photography did not significantly change the way people looked at reality.</p><p>B. Most painters used the images of the camera obscura in preference to those of the daguerreotype.</p><p>C. Painters who were concerned with realistic or naturalistic representation were particularly influenced by photography.</p><p>D. Artists used the long-awaited invention of photography in just the ways they had expected to.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The C nineteenth-century keyword is positioned to the last sentence of the first paragraph. It is said that the painters in the middle and late 19th century were very focused on photography, used, studied, and responded, so the correct answer was c, affected. The a option is contrary to the first sentence of the first paragraph and is not selected; the original comparison of the b option does not say, nor can it be inferred, wrong; d does not mention any relevant information at all, and does not choose</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraphs 2 and 3 which of the following did the daguerreotype and the calotype have in common?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They were equally useful for artists.</p><p>B. They could be reproduced.</p><p>C. They produced a permanent image</p><p>D. They were produced on treated paper.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C Because the content is more, the problem is better with exclusion. A's equaluseful original does not say, wrong; B's reproduce is wrong, according to the second question, Dague can not be copied; C is correct, according to the third sentence of the original paragraph2 of the original text, said that the lack of permanentform, then this question It was solved by Louis D's invention of Dague, so Dague is a permanent form. As for Calo, the second sentence of paragraph 3 is said to be the ancestor of modern photography. Of course, it is a permanent form, so the C option is correct. The paper for D is used for calo. Dague is not. D is wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question3">duplicated</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. copied</p><p>B. replaced</p><p>C. handled</p><p>D. clarified</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" A"><p>A, duplicate copy, so the correct answer is a copy. The original text says that d is a picture that reproduces the things in front of the camera lens in a subtle and complete way. This section says that c and d produce two different results. The next sentence says that the production of c is a series of events. The production of d should be separate, that is, it cannot be copied. So the answer is a. Others do not fly.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The phrase "<span class="highlight"><span class="question4">Its general effect</span></span>" in the passage refers to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. the camera lens</p><p>B. the calotype</p><p>C. the etching</p><p>D. the engraving</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>B refers to the title, refers to the subject of the previous sentence, so the correct answer is b, option c and option d are not selected; a do not fly.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question5">authenticity</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. improvement</p><p>B. practicality</p><p>C. genuineness</p><p>D. repetition</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" C"><p>C <span class="question5">authenticity</span>: <span class="question5">authenticity</span>. A is improvement, progress; B is practical; C is real; D is repeated. So the correct answer is the genuineness of C.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What point does the author make in paragraph 6?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Paintings became less expensive because of competition with photography.</p><p>B. Photography, unlike painting, was a type of portraiture that even ordinary people could afford.</p><p>C. Every style of painting was influenced by the invention of photography.</p><p>D. The daguerreotype was more popular than the calotype.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B This paragraph is very short, sweeping quickly, said two points, one is to make certain paintings abandoned, and the other is to make making and owning images popular, so the correct answer is B, even if the general public can also afford it. The original of A's competition did not say; C's original style did not say, and it was too absolute; D's comparison of the original did not say.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">reluctant</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. unable</p><p>B. embarrassed</p><p>C. unlikely</p><p>D. unwilling</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D reluctant: Reluctant. The A option is not capable; B is embarrassing and embarrassing; the C option is not possible; the D option is unwilling. So the correct answer is D's unwilling.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Photography did not replace other fine arts because people felt the image looked cheap in relation to the other arts.</p><p>B. Photography was not considered a true art because people could use it to create many images cheaply.</p><p>C. Photography was so cheap and readily available that it could be purchased by people who were too poor to purchase fine art.</p><p>D. Photography not only spread quickly but also was a cheap art form and so became true successor of fine arts rather than its poor relation.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The original sentence of B is a causal relationship, so D's turn is wrong; after the sentence between two commas is removed, the structure of this sentence becomes clearer, because it is medium was so prolific, the result is treated as poor relation of fine art, So the correct answer is B. The original of A's fruit did not say that it was wrong; the result of that after C did not say, but it was wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question9">unanticipated</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. indirect</p><p>B. not expected</p><p>C. unquestionable</p><p>D. beneficial</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>B <span class="question10">accidental</span>: Unexpected. A is surprising; B is unintentional and unconscious; C is realistic; D is extraordinary. So the correct answer is B's unintentional.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question10">accidental</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. surprising</p><p>B. unintentional</p><p>C. realistic</p><p>D. unusual</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>Bantianticipated: Unexpected, unexpected. A is indirect, B is not expected, C is no doubt, and D is helpful. So the correct answer is B's not expected.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the following is mentioned in paragraph 8 as a benefit that artists derived from photography?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It inspired artists to use technological themes in their painting.</p><p>B. It lent prestige to those artists who used photographs as models for paintings</p><p>C. It provided artists with new types of equipment to speed up the painting process.</p><p>D. It motivated artists to think about new ways to compose images in their paintings.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D. Positioning the artist as a key word to the second half, saying that the artist has to accept the facts provided by the camera, the new technology confirms these facts, and with new compositional formats, the correct answer is d, and the new method composes their painting. A technological theme, b's prestige and c's speed up are not mentioned in the original text.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>It can be inferred from paragraph 8 that one effect that photography had on painting was that it</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. provided painters with new insights into how humans and animals actually move</p><p>B. showed that representing movement could be as interesting as portrait art</p><p>C. increased the appeal of painted portraiture among the wealthy</p><p>D. influenced artists to improve techniques for painting faster</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>What influence does A ask? This first sentence says that it has an influence, but did not say anything. The second sentence says that the way people and animals move is different from what traditionally thinks, so the correct answer is a. The comparison of b, c's wealthy rich people and d's painting higher text not only did not say, and there is no relevant information, so do not choose</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="r"><div class="question"><p>Look at the four squares HI that indicate where the following sentence could be added to the passage. Where would the sentence best fit?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>Although his process produced permanent images, each was unique and no reproduction of the picture was possible..</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A transition point is enough, the term permanent image, only A before the permanent form, so the correct answer is A. And the latter paragraph said that calo can be copied, and the former paragraph should naturally say that dague can not be copied, and insert the sentence in the no reproduction echo, so this conjunction is also a transition point.</p></div></div><div id="question14" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>The invention of photography had a significant impact on the art of painting in the nineteenth century.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.For a brief time, artists preferred not to paint natural or realistic images that would have to compete with photographs.</p><p>B.The photographic processes of Louis Daguerre and William Henry Talbot both made permanent images, but only Talbot's process allowed making multiple copies.</p><p>C.Photography made accurate images widely and inexpensively available, but this popular success also had the effect of lowering its perceived value in relation to the fine arts.</p><p>D.Before photography, Canaletto had used the camera obscura to project scenes onto a paper or glass plate.</p><p>E.The work of Eadweard Muybridge and Etienne-Jules Marey established photography both as a science and as an art.</p><p>F.Photography eliminated the painted portrait miniature, led artists to accurately represent movement, and affected pictorial composition, but did not replace traditional visual arts.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="BCF"><p>BCF for option did not say the original, not selected.
