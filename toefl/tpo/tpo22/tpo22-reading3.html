            <b>The Allende Meteorite</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>Sometime after midnight on February 8,1969, a large, bright <span class="underline">meteor</span> entered Earth's <span class="underline">atmosphere</span> and broke into thousands of pieces, plummeted to the ground, and <span class="underline">scattered</span> over an area 50 miles long and 10 miles wide in the <span class="underline">state</span> of Chihuahua in Mexico. The first <span class="underline">meteorite</span> from this fall was found in the village of Pueblito de Allende. Altogether, <span class="underline">roughly</span> two tons of <span class="underline">meteorite</span> fragments were recovered, all of which <span class="underline">bear</span> the name Allende for the <span class="light">location</span> of the first discovery.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="underline">Individual</span> specimens of Allende are covered with a black, glassy <span class="underline">crust</span> that formed when their exteriors melted as they were slowed by Earth's <span class="underline">atmosphere</span>. When broken open, Allende stones are revealed to <span class="underline">contain</span> an <span class="underline">assortment</span> of small, <span class="underline">distinctive</span> objects, <span class="underline">spherical</span> or <span class="underline">irregular</span> in <span class="underline">shape</span> and embedded in a dark gray matrix (binding <span class="underline">material</span>), which were once constituents of the <span class="underline">solar</span> <span class="underline">nebula</span>-the <span class="underline">interstellar</span> cloud of gas and dust out of which our <span class="underline">solar</span> system was formed.</p>
          <p>The Allende <span class="underline">meteorite</span> is classified as a chondrite. Chondrites take their name from the Greek word chondros-meaning "seed"-an allusion to their <span class="underline">appearance</span> as rocks containing tiny seeds. These seeds are actually chondrules: millimeter-sized melted droplets of <span class="underline">silicate</span> <span class="underline">material</span> that were cooled into spheres of glass and <span class="underline">crystal</span>. A few chondrules <span class="underline">contain</span> grains that survived the <span class="underline">melting</span> event, so these enigmatic chondrules must have formed when <span class="underline">compact</span> masses of nebular dust were fused at high temperatures-approaching 1,700 degrees Celsius-and then cooled before these surviving grains could <span class="underline">melt</span>. Study of the textures of chondrules confirms that they cooled rather quickly, in times measured in minutes or hours, so the heating events that formed them must have been localized. It seems very <span class="underline">unlikely</span> that large portions of the <span class="underline">nebula</span> were heated to such <span class="underline">extreme</span> temperatures, and huge <span class="underline">nebula</span> areas could not possibly have lost heat so fast. Chondrules must have been melted in small pockets of the <span class="underline">nebula</span> that were able to lose heat rapidly. The <span class="underline">origin</span> of these <span class="underline">peculiar</span> glassy spheres remains an enigma.</p>
          <p>Equally <span class="underline">perplexing</span> constituents of Allende are the refractory inclusions: <span class="underline">irregular</span> white masses that <span class="underline">tend</span> to be larger than chondrules. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>They are composed of minerals uncommon on Earth,
all rich in <span class="underline">calcium</span>, <span class="underline">aluminum</span>, and titanium, the most refractory (<span class="underline">resistant</span> to <span class="underline">melting</span>) of the <span class="underline">major</span> elements in the <span class="underline">nebula</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>The same minerals that <span class="underline">occur</span> in refractory inclusions are believed
to be the earliest-formed substances to have condensed out of the <span class="underline">solar</span> <span class="underline">nebula</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>However, studies of the textures of inclusions <span class="underline">reveal</span> that the order in which the minerals appeared 
in the inclusions varies from <span class="underline">inclusion</span> to <span class="underline">inclusion</span>, and often does not <span class="underline">match</span> the <span class="underline">theoretical</span> <span class="underline">condensation</span> <span class="underline">sequence</span> for those metals. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p>
          <p>Chondrules and inclusions in Allende are held together by the chondrite matrix, a mixture of <span class="underline">fine-grained</span>, mostly <span class="underline">silicate</span> minerals that also includes grains of iron metal and iron <span class="underline">sulfide</span>. At one time it was thought that these matrix grains might be pristine nebular dust, the <span class="underline">sort</span> of <span class="underline">stuff</span> from which chondrules and inclusions were made. However, detailed studies of the chondrite matrix suggest that much of it, too, has been formed by <span class="underline">condensation</span> or <span class="underline">melting</span> in the <span class="underline">nebula</span>, although <span class="underline">minute</span> amounts of surviving <span class="underline">interstellar</span> dust are mixed with the processed materials.</p>
          <p>All these <span class="underline">diverse</span> constituents are aggregated together to form chondritic meteorites, like Allende, that have chemical compositions much like that of the Sun. To <span class="underline">compare</span> the compositions of a <span class="underline">meteorite</span> and the Sun, it is necessary that we use ratios of elements rather than <span class="underline">simply</span> the abundances of atoms. After all, the Sun has many more atoms of any <span class="underline">element</span>, say iron, than does a <span class="underline">meteorite</span> <span class="underline">specimen</span>, but the ratios of iron to <span class="underline">silicon</span> in the two kinds of matter might be <span class="underline">comparable</span>. The compositional similarity is <span class="underline">striking</span>. The <span class="underline">major</span> <span class="underline">difference</span> is that Allende is <span class="underline">depleted</span> in the most <span class="underline">volatile</span> elements, like <span class="underline">hydrogen</span>, <span class="underline">carbon</span>, <span class="underline">oxygen</span>, <span class="underline">nitrogen</span>, and the noble gases, <span class="underline">relative</span> to the Sun. These are the elements that <span class="underline">tend</span> to form gases <span class="underline">even</span> at very low temperatures. We might think of chondrites as samples of distilled Sun, a <span class="underline">sort</span> of <span class="underline">solar</span> <span class="underline">sludge</span> from which only gases have been removed. Since <span class="underline">practically</span> all the <span class="underline">solar</span> system's <span class="underline">mass</span> resides in the Sun, this similarity in chemistry means that chondrites have <span class="underline">average</span> <span class="underline">solar</span> system <span class="underline">composition</span>, except for the most <span class="underline">volatile</span> elements; they are truly lumps of nebular matter, probably <span class="underline">similar</span> in <span class="underline">composition</span> to the matter from which planets were assembled.</p>
