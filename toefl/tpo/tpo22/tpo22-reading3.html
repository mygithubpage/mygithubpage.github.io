The first <span class="highlight">meteorite</span> from this fall was found in the village of Pueblito de Allende. Altogether, <span class="highlight">roughly</span> two tons of <span class="highlight">meteorite</span> fragments were recovered, all of which <span class="highlight">bear</span> the name Allende for the <span class="highlight question1">location</span> of the first discovery.</p><p><span class="highlight">Individual</span> specimens of Allende are covered with a black, glassy <span class="highlight">crust</span> that formed when their exteriors melted as they were slowed by Earth's <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span>. <span class="question3">When broken open, Allende stones are revealed to <span class="highlight">contain</span> an <span class="highlight">assortment</span> of small, <span class="highlight">distinctive</span> objects, <span class="highlight">spherical</span> or <span class="highlight">irregular</span> in <span class="highlight">shape</span> and embedded in a dark gray matrix (binding <span class="highlight">material</span>), which were once constituents of the <span class="highlight">solar</span><span class="highlight">nebula</span>-the <span class="highlight">interstellar</span> cloud of gas and dust out of which our <span class="highlight">solar</span> system was formed.</span></p><p>The Allende <span class="highlight">meteorite</span> is classified as a chondrite. Chondrites take their name from the Greek word chondros-meaning "seed"-an <span class="question4">allusion</span> to their <span class="highlight">appearance</span> as rocks containing tiny seeds. These seeds are actually chondrules: millimeter-sized melted droplets of <span class="highlight">silicate</span><span class="highlight">material</span> that were cooled into spheres of glass and <span class="highlight">crystal</span>. A few chondrules <span class="highlight">contain</span> grains that survived the <span class="highlight">melting</span> event, so these <span class="question5">enigmatic</span> chondrules must have formed when <span class="highlight">compact</span> masses of nebular dust were fused at high temperatures-approaching 1,700 degrees Celsius-and then cooled before these surviving grains could <span class="highlight">melt</span>. Study of the textures of chondrules confirms that they cooled rather quickly, in times measured in minutes or hours, so the heating events that formed them must have been localized. It seems very <span class="highlight">unlikely</span> that large portions of the <span class="highlight">nebula</span> were heated to such <span class="highlight">extreme</span> temperatures, and huge <span class="highlight">nebula</span> areas could not possibly have lost heat so fast. Chondrules must have been melted in small pockets of the <span class="highlight">nebula</span> that were able to lose heat rapidly. The <span class="highlight">origin</span> of these <span class="highlight">peculiar</span> glassy spheres remains an enigma.</p><p>Equally <span class="highlight">perplexing</span> constituents of Allende are the refractory inclusions: <span class="highlight">irregular</span> white masses that <span class="highlight">tend</span> to be larger than chondrules. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>They are composed of minerals uncommon on Earth,
all rich in <span class="highlight">calcium</span>, <span class="highlight">aluminum</span>, and titanium, the most refractory (<span class="highlight">resistant</span> to <span class="highlight">melting</span>) of the <span class="highlight">major</span> elements in the <span class="highlight">nebula</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>The same minerals that <span class="highlight">occur</span> in refractory inclusions are believed
to be the earliest-formed substances to have condensed out of the <span class="highlight">solar</span><span class="highlight">nebula</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>However, studies of the textures of inclusions <span class="highlight">reveal</span> that the order in which the minerals appeared 
in the inclusions varies from <span class="highlight">inclusion</span> to <span class="highlight">inclusion</span>, and often does not <span class="highlight">match</span> the <span class="highlight">theoretical</span><span class="highlight">condensation</span><span class="highlight">sequence</span> for those metals. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p><p>Chondrules and inclusions in Allende are held together by the chondrite matrix, a mixture of <span class="highlight">fine-grained</span>, mostly <span class="highlight">silicate</span> minerals that also includes grains of iron metal and iron <span class="highlight">sulfide</span>. At one time it was thought that these matrix grains might be <span class="question8">pristine</span> nebular dust, the <span class="highlight">sort</span> of <span class="highlight">stuff</span> from which chondrules and inclusions were made. However, detailed studies of the chondrite matrix suggest that much of it, too, has been formed by <span class="highlight">condensation</span> or <span class="highlight">melting</span> in the <span class="highlight">nebula</span>, although <span class="highlight">minute</span> amounts of surviving <span class="highlight">interstellar</span> dust are mixed with the processed materials.</p><p>All these <span class="highlight">diverse</span> constituents are aggregated together to form chondritic meteorites, like Allende, that have chemical compositions much like that of the Sun. To <span class="highlight">compare</span> the compositions of a <span class="highlight">meteorite</span> and the Sun, it is necessary that we use ratios of elements rather than <span class="highlight">simply</span> the abundances of atoms. After all, <span class="question10">the Sun has many more atoms of any <span class="highlight">element</span>, say iron, than does a <span class="highlight">meteorite</span><span class="highlight">specimen</span></span>, but the ratios of iron to <span class="highlight">silicon</span> in the two kinds of matter might be <span class="highlight">comparable</span>. The compositional similarity is <span class="highlight">striking</span>. The <span class="highlight">major</span><span class="highlight">difference</span> is that Allende is <span class="highlight">depleted</span> in the most <span class="highlight">volatile</span> elements, like <span class="highlight">hydrogen</span>, <span class="highlight">carbon</span>, <span class="highlight">oxygen</span>, <span class="highlight">nitrogen</span>, and the noble gases, <span class="highlight">relative</span> to the Sun. These are the elements that <span class="highlight">tend</span> to form gases <span class="highlight">even</span> at very low temperatures. We might think of chondrites as samples of distilled Sun, a <span class="highlight">sort</span> of <span class="highlight">solar</span><span class="highlight">sludge</span> from which only gases have been removed. Since <span class="highlight">practically</span> all the <span class="highlight">solar</span> system's <span class="highlight">mass</span> resides in the Sun, this similarity in chemistry means that chondrites have <span class="highlight">average</span><span class="highlight">solar</span> system <span class="highlight">composition</span>, except for the most <span class="highlight">volatile</span> elements; they are truly lumps of nebular matter, probably <span class="highlight">similar</span> in <span class="highlight">composition</span> to the matter from which planets were assembled.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">location</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. sight</p><p>B. sake</p><p>C. success</p><p>D. place</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D location: Location. A is a sight, an eye; B is the purpose, interest; C is a success; D is a place. So the correct answer is D's place.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the following can be inferred from paragraph 1 about the large meteor that entered Earths atmosphere on February 8, 1969?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It was almost ten miles wide.</p><p>B. It was the biggest meteor ever to hit Mexico.</p><p>C. It weighed more than two tons.</p><p>D. It broke into more pieces than most meteors do.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C. There is no particularly good positioning word. The entire paragraph is describing the relevant content of this piece of meteor, but this paragraph is shorter and can be quickly read. A's ten miles wide appears in the first sentence, the original sentence is not that meteor ten miles wide, is that area, so A wrong; B's biggest did not say and there is no relevant information can be inferred, and too absolute; C correct, the original The second sentence said that about two tons of debris were collected. There are two tons of debris. Naturally, the meteor is more than two tons. Therefore, C is correct. There is no information in D's more letters.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Allende meteorites were formed when constituents of the interstellar cloud of gas and dust got trapped inside small, roughly spherical objects and these objects became bound together in a dark gray matrix.</p><p>B. Inside Allende meteorites is a dark gray matrix that binds together small spherical or irregular objects formed from the interstellar cloud of gas and dust out of which the solar system was made.</p><p>C. By breaking open Allende meteorites, scientists were able to find out what the solar nebula was made of.</p><p>D. Allende meteorites were filled with material formed almost entirelyfrom interstellar gas and dust.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The sentence B looks a bit complicated, but after removing the unused parts, there are not many things left, only when blabla, A contains a variety of objects, behind a lot of things are modified objects , so the correct answer is B. The A form of the A form didn't say so, and the cloud of gas and dust got trapped did not say anything; the trunks of C and D were completely wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question4">allusion</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. addition</p><p>B. modification</p><p>C. resemblance</p><p>D. reference</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" D"><p>D <span class="question4">allusion</span>: Allusions, hints. A is added; B is changed, corrected; C is similar; D is referring to. So the correct answer is D's reference.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question5">enigmatic</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. dangerous</p><p>B. mysterious</p><p>C. interesting</p><p>D. surprising</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>B <span class="question5">enigmatic</span>: Mysterious, mystery, from enigma mystery, so the correct answer is B's mysterious. A is dangerous; C is interesting; D is amazing.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 3, what does the presence of grains inside some of the chondrules indicate?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The chondrules were formed of silicate material.</p><p>B. The chondrules were formed at high temperatures and then cooled rapidly.</p><p>C. The grains were formed in huge areas of the solar nebula</p><p>D. The grains were formed after the chondrules were fused together into chondrites.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B. Position the words with the presence of grains inside some of the chondrules. Go to the fourth sentence, that is, the phrase where the vocabulary question was just now. Say C contains the particles left after melting. These magic particles must be nebular at high temperatures. When the dust were fused, they quickly cooled, so the correct answer is B. A said that it is right, but the question is asked what the grains indicate, A does not answer, and does not choose; C completely did not say; D's after wrong, not selected, the original said when, and fuse into what the original did not say.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, all of the following are true about the minerals found in the refractory inclusions EXCEPT:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. These minerals are among the most resistant to melting of all the major elements in the solar nebula.</p><p>B. These minerals are believed to be some of the first elements to have condensed out of the solar nebula.</p><p>C. These minerals are among the least commonly found elements on Earth.</p><p>D. These elements occur in the order that scientists would have predicted.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D EXCEPT questions, exclusion. A's most resistant to melting keywords and C's listed are located in the second sentence, correct, not selected; B's first elements do keyword positioning to the third sentence, earliest- formed synonymous with first, Correct, do not choose; D's order to keyword positioning to the last sentence, the last sentence says order varies from inclusion to inclusion, so scientists can not predict, D said anti, election.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question8">pristine</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. pure</p><p>B. solid</p><p>C. ordinary</p><p>D. trapped</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" A"><p>A <span class="question8">pristine</span>: original, simple. A is pure and pure; B is solid and solid; C is normal; D is captured and collected. So the correct answer is pure.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 5, which of the following is indicated by studies of the mixture holding the inclusions together?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Large amounts of this material were formed by condensation or melting in the nebula.</p><p>B. This material contains more iron and iron sulfide than had previously been thought.</p><p>C. This material is very similar to the material from which the refractory inclusions are made</p><p>D. The grains in this material are made from the same elements as chondrules are.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A is to use the mixture holding the inclusions together to locate the last sentence. It is said that the matrix is formed by condensation and melting in nebula, so the correct answer is a. b's comparison did not say, did not choose; c did not say; d's same material did not say, do not choose</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>In paragraph 6, why does the author mention that "<span class="highlight">the Sun has many more atoms of any element, say iron, than does a meteorite specimen</span>"?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To show how difficult it is to compare the composition of a meteorite with that of the Sun</p><p>B. To explain why a comparison of the compositions of a meteorite and of the Sun has to be done in terms of ratios of elements</p><p>C. To identify the most common element in both the Sun and meteorite specimens</p><p>D. To emphasize how much largerthe Sun is than any meteorite specimen is</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="the Sun has many more atoms of any element, say iron, than does a meteorite specimen B"><p>B. The topic of rhetoric, first look at the sentence where the example is, but this sentence is an example, so look at the previous sentence. The preceding sentence says that for comparing the components of comets and the sun, the ratio of elements should be applied instead of simply applying the abundance of elements, so the correct answer is b, c, and d are completely unreliable, and the original of a difficult original is not. selected</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 6, the composition of chondritic meteorites differs from the composition of the Sun primarily in</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. containing nebular matter</p><p>B. containing many fewer atoms of iron</p><p>C. the relative amount of volatile elements</p><p>D. the ratio of iron to silicon</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C uses the keyword "differ" to locate the fifth sentence, saying that the main difference is that compared to the sun, a does not have a volatile element, so the correct answer is c, and none of the other answers.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 6, what is the significance of the similarity in composition between chondrites and the Sun?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It indicates what the matter from which planets were formed was probably like.</p><p>B. It may explain howthe Sun originally developed.</p><p>C. It helps scientists estimate the variations in the chemical composition of different meteors.</p><p>D. It suggests that most meteorites may contain large quantities of volatile elements.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A uses the similarity keyword to locate the fourth sentence and the last sentence, but the fourth sentence does not say anything, so the answer is in the last sentence, saying that in addition to c, there are no volatile elements, and other components are the average components of the solar system. The same is the nebular lump, which is the same as the planetary component, so the correct answer is a. b. Wrong, the original text is about the formation of a planet, not the sun; the variation of c is not stated; the volatile elements of d are not similarity, and they are not selected.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>It is therefore still unclear if all inclusions were formed in the same way..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>, D Two transition points, noun inclusion and conjunction therefore. According to the inclusion, it can be determined that A, C, or D are correct, and C's how converge is close and excluded; according to therefore, the previous content should be the reason, the correct answer is D, and the different ingredients of the different inclusions are different. The result is It is not certain that the inclusion is formed in the same way.</p></div></div><div id="question14" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>Studies of the Allende meteorite provided information about the composition of chondritic meteorites and their possible origin.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.When Allende entered Earth's atmosphere, it broke into thousands of pieces called chondrites because they look like glassy, black seeds.</p><p>B.Chondrules are tiny, millimeter-sized drops of silicate materials that probably formed when lumps of nebular dust were fused at extremely high temperatures and then quickly cooled.</p><p>C.The matrix that holds the chondrules and inclusions together in Allende consists mainly of grains of nebular dust that were trapped inside the meteor before they could be melted.</p><p>D.The mineral content of chondrules suggests that they were probably formed in isolated regions of the nebula that remained much hotter than the rest.</p><p>E.Irregularly shaped inclusions in Allende are composed of minerals that are resistant to melting and are believed to be the earlest minerals to have condensed out of the nebula.</p><p>F.Except for being depleted in volatile elements, chondritic meteorites are probably very similar in composition to the matter from which planets were assembled.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="BEF"><p>The BEF when option is the details mentioned in the second and third paragraphs, not selected. The Chondrules option corresponds to the third paragraph of the original text, and is correct. The matrix option is reversed, and the last sentence in the second paragraph says that the matrix was part of the solar nebula. , and this option says matrix is made of solar nebula grain, so do not choose. The mineral option did not say the original, not selected. Irregularly option corresponds to the first two paragraphs of the original paragraph, correct. Except option corresponds to the last paragraph of the text, correct .</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
