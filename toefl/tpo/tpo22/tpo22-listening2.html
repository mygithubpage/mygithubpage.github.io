          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="8.08" data-time="39.58">[00:39.58]</span>And there are four levels in total: bands, tribes, chiefdoms and states. <span class="time" data-times="2.43" data-time="47.66">[00:47.66]</span>But, but back to my <span class="highlight">original</span> question. <span class="time" data-times="2.42" data-time="50.09">[00:50.09]</span>Why did early states form? <span class="time" data-times="3.1" data-time="52.51">[00:52.51]</span>Why not just continue to live in small groups?<span class="time" data-times="2.85" data-time="55.61">[00:55.61]</span> Why become more <span class="highlight">complex</span>? </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="11.02" data-time="58.46">[00:58.46]</span>One <span class="highlight">theory</span> called the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> <span class="highlight">approach</span> hypothesizes that the main force behind <span class="highlight">state</span> <span class="highlight">formation</span> was <span class="highlight">population</span> growth. <span class="time" data-times="11.27" data-time="69.48">[01:09.48]</span>It assumes that <span class="highlight">centralized</span> <span class="highlight">management</span> was <span class="highlight">critical</span> to dealing with issues caused by sudden <span class="highlight">population</span> surges, like a <span class="highlight">strain</span> on limited food supplies. </p>

            <span class="time" data-times="7.65" data-time="80.75">[01:20.75]</span>At the <span class="highlight">least</span> <span class="highlight">complex</span> end of the <span class="highlight">spectrum</span>, the few families living in bands are able to meet their own <span class="highlight">basic</span> needs.<span class="time" data-times="8.15" data-time="88.4">[01:28.40]</span>They usually hunt together and <span class="highlight">forage</span> whatever foods are <span class="highlight">available</span> to them, <span class="highlight">instead</span> of domesticating animals and planting crops. <span class="time" data-times="8.88" data-time="96.55">[01:36.55]</span>In order to efficiently take <span class="highlight">advantage</span> of the wild foods <span class="highlight">available</span>, bands are often <span class="highlight">nomadic</span> and move around following herds of animals. <span class="time" data-times="4.17" data-time="105.43">[01:45.43]</span>This <span class="highlight">strategy</span> is <span class="highlight">feasible</span> when you have a small <span class="highlight">population</span>. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="8.13" data-time="109.6">[01:49.60]</span>But when you have a large <span class="highlight">population</span>, well, the whole <span class="highlight">population</span> can't just get up and move to follow a wild <span class="highlight">herd</span> of animals. <span class="time" data-times="5.36" data-time="117.73">[01:57.73]</span>So you need <span class="highlight">sophisticated</span> technologies to produce enough food for everyone. <span class="time" data-times="7.54" data-time="123.09">[02:03.09]</span>And there is an increase need to <span class="highlight">resolve</span> social problems that arise as people begin to <span class="highlight">compete</span> for resources. <span class="time" data-times="10.46" data-time="130.63">[02:10.63]</span>To <span class="highlight">manage</span> intensified food production, to <span class="highlight">collect</span>, store and <span class="highlight">distribute</span> food, you need <span class="highlight">centralized</span> decision-making, <span class="highlight">centralized</span> decision-makers. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.52" data-time="141.09">[02:21.09]</span>It's the same thing when it comes to maintaining social order.<span class="time" data-times="5.11" data-time="144.61">[02:24.61]</span> You need to create and efficiently <span class="highlight">enforce</span> a <span class="highlight">formal</span> legal <span class="highlight">code</span>.<span class="time" data-times="5.16" data-time="149.72">[02:29.72]</span>It makes <span class="highlight">sense</span> to have a <span class="highlight">centralized</span> <span class="highlight">authority</span> in charge of that, right? <span class="time" data-times="2.36" data-time="154.88">[02:34.88]</span>So a <span class="highlight">hierarchy</span> forms. <span class="time" data-times="4.06" data-time="157.24">[02:37.24]</span>By <span class="highlight">definition</span>, states had at <span class="highlight">least</span> three social levels. <span class="time" data-times="9.62" data-time="161.3">[02:41.30]</span>Usually, an upper class of rulers, a middleclass comprised of managers and merchants, and a <span class="highlight">lower</span> class of crop producers and agricultural laborers. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="12.59" data-time="170.92">[02:50.92]</span>The <span class="highlight">environmental</span> <span class="highlight">approach</span> hypothesizes that states <span class="highlight">appear</span> in certain <span class="highlight">environmental</span> settings, settings which have a <span class="highlight">severe</span> <span class="highlight">population</span> problem or a <span class="highlight">shortage</span> of agricultural land. <span class="time" data-times="3.62" data-time="183.51">[03:03.51]</span>But not everyone agrees with the <span class="highlight">theory</span>.<span class="time" data-times="2.27" data-time="187.13">[03:07.13]</span> It <span class="highlight">definitely</span> has some weaknesses. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="8" data-time="189.4">[03:09.40]</span>For example, states have developed in places like the <span class="highlight">mild</span> lowlands of Mesoamerica and in Egypt's Nile River <span class="highlight">Valley</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.21" data-time="197.4">[03:17.40]</span>Both places had <span class="highlight">vast</span> areas of <span class="highlight">fertile</span> farmland, no <span class="highlight">shortage</span> of agricultural land. <span class="time" data-times="2.42" data-time="203.61">[03:23.61]</span>And what about <span class="highlight">population</span> increase? <span class="time" data-times="6.13" data-time="206.03">[03:26.03]</span>Well, there were some early states that formed where there wasn't any sudden <span class="highlight">population</span> increase. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="212.16">[03:32.16]</span>So it seems that these are <span class="highlight">valid</span> criticisms of the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> <span class="highlight">approach</span>. </p>
