Sudden population increases in early states.</p><p>B. Possible reasons for the formation of early states.</p><p>C. Consequences of agricultural land shortages in ancient Egypt.</p><p>D. Common political problems of chiefdoms.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Why did early state form? Why not just continue to live in small groups? Why become more complex?</p><p>The professor began by saying a big question directly, that is why... so choose possible reasons.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor,what are two typical characteristics of a band?Click on 2 answers.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It is the smallest type of group.</p><p>B. It is the most sociopolitically complex type of group.</p><p>C. It practices intensified agriculture.</p><p>D. It is able to meet its own basic needs.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="AD"><p>At the least complex end of the spectrum, the few families living in bands are able to meet their own basic needs.</p><p>First of all, the classification of professors should be clear, the A option can be selected, and after the professor asks a bunch of questions, he puts forward a theory and then begins to explain that At the least complex end of the spectrum, The emphasis has come. The professor said that the least complicated thing is bands. Their relatively few families can meet their basic needs. D option also became the answer</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor say is a characteristic feature of states?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. States often damage the environment of the area they occupy.</p><p>B. States engage in trade to obtain necessary goods for their population.</p><p>C. States often undergo sudden changes in population.</p><p>D. States manage food production for the entire population.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>To manage intensified food production, to collect, store and distribute food, you need centralized decision-making, traditional decision-makers.</p><p>The former professor said that if there are a large number of people, relying only on wild animals and plants cannot support the entire population, so it is necessary to rely on technology to increase production for sufficient population to eat, and also to address the need to fight resources because of the increased population. Questions (test questions for the next question), therefore, those who need the center to make decisions, choosing D may be tangled up. The text does not mention states, but compared to bands, large population can be understood as states. This question has a certain degree of difficulty</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What reason for prehistoric social problems does the professor mention?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Competition for resources.</p><p>B. Poor decisions by the ruling classes.</p><p>C. The existence of several conflicting legal codes.</p><p>D. Cultural differences between neighboring states.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>And there is an increase need to resolve social problems that arise as people begin to compete for resources. The professor explicitly mentions compete for resources, which directly corresponds to the A option.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor mention upper,middle,and lower classes?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To explain why formal legal codes were developed.</p><p>B. To explain what factors caused the destruction of several early states.</p><p>C. To stress the importance of agricultural workers.</p><p>D. To further describe the organization of states.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>Only by definition, states had at least three social levels. Usually, an upper class of rulers, a middle class comprised of managers and merchants, and a lower class of crop producers and agricultural laborers.</p><p>It is to further explain the structure of states. None of the first three options mentioned</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the professor's opinion about the environmental approach?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It will remain popular for a long time.</p><p>B. It does not help explain how early states formed.</p><p>C. Some evidence supports it,but other evidence contradicts it.</p><p>D. It should be applied when analyzing hierarchies.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Well, there were some early states that formed where there wasn't any sudden population increase. So it seems that these are valid criticisms of the environmental approach.</p><p>The last sentence of the article must be heard clearly. There are usually questions. The professor said there were some countries in the earlier period that did not have sudden population increases. So this theory is used, but there are also many criticisms. The professor's views are still neutral.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
