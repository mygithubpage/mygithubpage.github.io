              <span class="time" data-times="8.08" data-time="39.58">[00:39.58]</span>And there are four levels in total: bands, tribes, chiefdoms and states. <span class="time" data-times="2.43" data-time="47.66">[00:47.66]</span>But, but back to my <span class="underline">original</span> question. <span class="time" data-times="2.42" data-time="50.09">[00:50.09]</span>Why did early states form? <span class="time" data-times="3.1" data-time="52.51">[00:52.51]</span>Why not just continue to live in small groups?<span class="time" data-times="2.85" data-time="55.61">[00:55.61]</span> Why become more <span class="underline">complex</span>? </p>

              <span class="time" data-times="8.13" data-time="109.6">[01:49.60]</span>But when you have a large <span class="underline">population</span>, well, the whole <span class="underline">population</span> can't just get up and move to follow a wild <span class="underline">herd</span> of animals. <span class="time" data-times="5.36" data-time="117.73">[01:57.73]</span>So you need <span class="underline">sophisticated</span> technologies to produce enough food for everyone. <span class="time" data-times="7.54" data-time="123.09">[02:03.09]</span>And there is an increase need to <span class="underline">resolve</span> social problems that arise as people begin to <span class="underline">compete</span> for resources. <span class="time" data-times="10.46" data-time="130.63">[02:10.63]</span>To <span class="underline">manage</span> intensified food production, to <span class="underline">collect</span>, store and <span class="underline">distribute</span> food, you need <span class="underline">centralized</span> decision-making, <span class="underline">centralized</span> decision-makers. </p>

              <span class="time" data-times="3.52" data-time="141.09">[02:21.09]</span>It's the same thing when it comes to maintaining social order.<span class="time" data-times="5.11" data-time="144.61">[02:24.61]</span> You need to create and efficiently <span class="underline">enforce</span> a <span class="underline">formal</span> legal <span class="underline">code</span>.<span class="time" data-times="5.16" data-time="149.72">[02:29.72]</span>It makes <span class="underline">sense</span> to have a <span class="underline">centralized</span> <span class="underline">authority</span> in charge of that, right? <span class="time" data-times="2.36" data-time="154.88">[02:34.88]</span>So a <span class="underline">hierarchy</span> forms. <span class="time" data-times="4.06" data-time="157.24">[02:37.24]</span>By <span class="underline">definition</span>, states had at <span class="underline">least</span> three social levels. <span class="time" data-times="9.62" data-time="161.3">[02:41.30]</span>Usually, an upper class of rulers, a middleclass comprised of managers and merchants, and a <span class="underline">lower</span> class of crop producers and agricultural laborers. </p>

              <span class="time" data-times="8" data-time="189.4">[03:09.40]</span>For example, states have developed in places like the <span class="underline">mild</span> lowlands of Mesoamerica and in Egypt's Nile River <span class="underline">Valley</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.21" data-time="197.4">[03:17.40]</span>Both places had <span class="underline">vast</span> areas of <span class="underline">fertile</span> farmland, no <span class="underline">shortage</span> of agricultural land. <span class="time" data-times="2.42" data-time="203.61">[03:23.61]</span>And what about <span class="underline">population</span> increase? <span class="time" data-times="6.13" data-time="206.03">[03:26.03]</span>Well, there were some early states that formed where there wasn't any sudden <span class="underline">population</span> increase. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="212.16">[03:32.16]</span>So it seems that these are <span class="underline">valid</span> criticisms of the <span class="underline">environmental</span> <span class="underline">approach</span>. </p>
