To discuss evidence for liquid water on young Earth and Mars.</p><p>D. To discuss attempts to solve a puzzle related to the Sun.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>Today, I want to talk about a paradox the ties in with the topic we discuss last time. We were discussing the geological evidence of water, liquid water on Earth and Mars three to four billion years ago.</p><p>The professor also did not like nonsense. This is a sign of the subject sentence. The professor said that I would like to discuss the paradox regarding the issues we discussed last time. Then combine the content, you can choose D. C is very confusing, because after the first sentence, the professor began to say all kinds of evidence, but with the full text, he knows that C is wrong. Sometimes, after the beginning of listening to the subject can not be determined, it is necessary to judge the full text.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why is geological evidence of liquid water on Earth and Mars three to four billion years ago problematic?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It suggests that the solar system is younger than it could possibly be.</p><p>B. It suggests that the young Sun was less bright than it is today.</p><p>C. It challenges the prevailing model of star formation.</p><p>D. It contradicts theories about the beginning of the universe.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>So our standard model of star formation suggests that the Sun wasn't nearly as bright three to four billion years ago as it is today, which means the temperatures on Earth and Mars would have been lower, which in turn suggest...</p><p>This sentence is still very easy to notice, there is a pause in front of the professor, and there are students interrupted, this should be noted. And the word now also suggests the answer. The professor said that this violates the evolutionary model of evidence and stars. So choosing C violates the popular model of star formation.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>Why did the greenhouse-gas solution fail to explain the early presence of liquid water on Earth and Mars?Click on 2 answers.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.
