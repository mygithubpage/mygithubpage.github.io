              <span class="time" data-times="3.78" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in an <span class="underline">astronomy</span> class. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.13" data-time="3.78">[00:03.78]</span>Professor: Today, I want to talk about a paradox the ties in with the topic we discuss last time. <span class="time" data-times="8.57" data-time="9.91">[00:09.91]</span>We were discussing the geological <span class="underline">evidence</span> of water, <span class="underline">liquid</span> water on Earth and Mars three to four billion years ago. <span class="time" data-times="7.76" data-time="18.48">[00:18.48]</span>So, what <span class="underline">evidence</span> of a <span class="underline">liquid</span> water environment did we find in rock samples taking from the oldest rocks on Earth? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.47" data-time="26.24">[00:26.24]</span>Student: Eh... Like pebbles, fossilized <span class="underline">algae</span>? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.77" data-time="30.71">[00:30.71]</span>Professor: Right. And on Mars? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.69" data-time="33.48">[00:33.48]</span>Student: Dry channels? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.97" data-time="35.17">[00:35.17]</span>Professor: Good. All <span class="underline">evidence</span> of water in <span class="underline">liquid</span> form, large quantities of it. <span class="time" data-times="7.47" data-time="40.14">[00:40.14]</span>Now, remember when we talked about star <span class="underline">formation</span>, we said that as a star ages, it becomes brighter, right? <span class="time" data-times="3.67" data-time="47.61">[00:47.61]</span>Hydrogen turns into Helium, which releases energy. <span class="time" data-times="14.69" data-time="51.28">[00:51.28]</span>So our <span class="underline">standard</span> model of star <span class="underline">formation</span> suggests that the Sun wasn't nearly as bright three to four billion years ago as it is today, which means the temperatures on Earth and Mars would have been <span class="underline">lower</span>, which in turn suggests... </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.26" data-time="65.97">[01:05.97]</span>Student: There would have been ice on Earth or Mars? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.4" data-time="69.23">[01:09.23]</span>Professor: Correct. If the young Sun was much fainter and cooler than the Sun today, <span class="underline">liquid</span> water couldn't have existed on either <span class="underline">planet</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9.5" data-time="77.63">[01:17.63]</span>Now, this <span class="underline">apparent</span> <span class="underline">contradiction</span> between geologic <span class="underline">evidence</span> and the <span class="underline">stellar</span> <span class="underline">evolution</span> model became known as the <span class="underline">faint</span> young Sun paradox. <span class="time" data-times="4.48" data-time="87.13">[01:27.13]</span>Now, there have been several attempts to solve this paradox. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.72" data-time="91.61">[01:31.61]</span>First, there was the greenhouse-gas <span class="underline">solution</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.34" data-time="94.33">[01:34.33]</span>Well, you are probably <span class="underline">familiar</span> with the greenhouse gas effect, so I won't go into details now. <span class="time" data-times="11.98" data-time="99.67">[01:39.67]</span>The idea was that trapped greenhouse gases in the atmospheres of Earth and Mars might have caused temperatures to <span class="underline">raise</span> enough to <span class="underline">compensate</span> for the low heat the young Sun provided. <span class="time" data-times="4.74" data-time="111.65">[01:51.65]</span>And so it would have been warm enough on these planets for <span class="underline">liquid</span> water to exist. <span class="time" data-times="5.86" data-time="116.39">[01:56.39]</span>So, what gas do you think was the first <span class="underline">suspect</span> in causing the greenhouse effect? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.95" data-time="122.25">[02:02.25]</span>Student: Um...<span class="underline">carbon</span> <span class="underline">dioxide</span>, I guess. Like today? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.26" data-time="126.2">[02:06.20]</span>Professor: In fact, studies <span class="underline">indicate</span> that four billion years ago, <span class="underline">carbon</span> <span class="underline">dioxide</span> levels in the <span class="underline">atmosphere</span> were much higher than today's levels.<span class="time" data-times="6.9" data-time="135.46">[02:15.46]</span>But the studies also <span class="underline">indicate</span> that they weren't high enough to do the job-make up for a <span class="underline">faint</span> Sun. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.25" data-time="142.36">[02:22.36]</span>Then some astronomers came up with the idea that <span class="underline">atmospheric</span> <span class="underline">ammonia</span> might have acted as a greenhouse gas.<span class="time" data-times="6.17" data-time="149.61">[02:29.61]</span>But <span class="underline">ammonia</span> would have been destroyed by the ultra-violet light coming from the Sun and it had to be ruled out too. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.06" data-time="155.78">[02:35.78]</span>Another <span class="underline">solution</span>, which is proposed much later, was that perhaps the young Sun wasn't <span class="underline">faint</span> at all, perhaps it was bright.<span class="time" data-times="9.61" data-time="164.84">[02:44.84]</span>So it is called the bright-young-Sun <span class="underline">solution</span>, according to which the Sun would have provided enough heat for the water on Earth and Mars to be <span class="underline">liquid</span>.<span class="time" data-times="4.97" data-time="174.45">[02:54.45]</span>But how could the early Sun be brighter and hotter than predicted by the <span class="underline">standard</span> model? <span class="time" data-times="2.81" data-time="179.42">[02:59.42]</span>Well, the answer is <span class="underline">mass</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.96" data-time="182.23">[03:02.23]</span>Student: You mean the Sun had more <span class="underline">mass</span> when it was young? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.32" data-time="185.19">[03:05.19]</span>Professor: Well, if the young Sun was more <span class="underline">massive</span> than today's, it would have been hotter and brighter than the model predicts. <span class="time" data-times="4.42" data-time="191.51">[03:11.51]</span>But this would mean that it had lost <span class="underline">mass</span> over the <span class="underline">course</span> of four billion years. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.07" data-time="195.93">[03:15.93]</span>Student: Is that possible? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.56" data-time="198">[03:18.00]</span>Professor: Actually, the Sun is <span class="underline">constantly</span> losing <span class="underline">mass</span> <span class="underline">through</span> the <span class="underline">solar</span> wind, a <span class="underline">stream</span> of charged particles <span class="underline">constantly</span> blowing off the Sun. <span class="time" data-times="14.5" data-time="206.56">[03:26.56]</span>we know the Sun's <span class="underline">current</span> <span class="underline">rate</span> of <span class="underline">mass</span> loss, but if we <span class="underline">assume</span> that this <span class="underline">rate</span> has been <span class="underline">steady</span> over the last four billion years, the young Sun wouldn't have been <span class="underline">massive</span> enough to have warmed Earth, let alone Mars, not enough to have caused <span class="underline">liquid</span> water. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.71" data-time="221.06">[03:41.06]</span>Student: Maybe the <span class="underline">solar</span> wind was stronger then? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.72" data-time="223.77">[03:43.77]</span>Professor: There is <span class="underline">evidence</span> that the <span class="underline">solar</span> wind was more <span class="underline">intense</span> in the past.<span class="time" data-times="5.4" data-time="227.49">[03:47.49]</span>But we don't know for sure how much <span class="underline">mass</span> our Sun's lost over the last four billion years. <span class="time" data-times="7.65" data-time="232.89">[03:52.89]</span>Astronomers tried to <span class="underline">estimate</span> what <span class="underline">solar</span> <span class="underline">mass</span> could produce the required <span class="underline">luminosity</span> to explain <span class="underline">liquid</span> water on these planets. <span class="time" data-times="6.76" data-time="240.54">[04:00.54]</span>They also took into <span class="underline">account</span> that with a more <span class="underline">massive</span> young Sun, the planets would be closer to the Sun than they are today. <span class="time" data-times="3.93" data-time="247.3">[04:07.30]</span>And they found that about seven percent more <span class="underline">mass</span> would be required. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.03" data-time="251.23">[04:11.23]</span>Student: So the young Sun had seven percent more <span class="underline">mass</span> than our Sun? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.83" data-time="255.26">[04:15.26]</span>Professor: Well, we don't know.<span class="time" data-times="9.32" data-time="257.09">[04:17.09]</span> According to observations of young Sun like stars, our Sun may have lost as much as six percent of its <span class="underline">initial</span> <span class="underline">mass</span>, which doesn't quite make it. <span class="time" data-times="3.9" data-time="266.41">[04:26.41]</span>On the other hand, this <span class="underline">estimate</span> is based on a small <span class="underline">sample</span>.<span class="time" data-times="2.76" data-time="270.31">[04:30.31]</span> And the bright-young-Sun <span class="underline">solution</span> is <span class="underline">appealing</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.06" data-time="273.07">[04:33.07]</span>We <span class="underline">simply</span> need more <span class="underline">data</span> to <span class="underline">determine</span> the <span class="underline">mass</span> loss <span class="underline">rate</span> of stars. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="277.13">[04:37.13]</span>So there's <span class="underline">reason</span> to believe that we will get an answer to that piece of the <span class="underline">puzzle</span> one day. </p>
