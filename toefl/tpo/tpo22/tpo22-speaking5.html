        <h3>Listening Text</h3>
        <article>
          <p>Listen to a conversation between two students.</p>
          <p>(man) Hey, Jane, did you finish your research paper for class?</p>
          <p>(woman) Yeah, I printed it up this morning.</p>
          <p>(man) Why do you look so worried then?</p>
          <p>(woman) Well, I was just in the cafeteria eating lunch and reading it over one last time when I split some soup on it, and the class starts in fifteen minutes.</p>
          <p>(man) How bad is it?</p>
          <p>(woman) It's not huge but you can definitely see it and several of the pages got wet.</p>
          <p>(man) What are you gonna do?</p>
          <p>(woman) I could just go ahead and hand it in like this and explain to the professor what happened, I mean, you can still read the paper, and the pages should dry out a little by the time class begins. But they'll still be sort of sticky and wrinkled.</p>
          <p>(man) Well, not all professors care that much about how the paper looks. At least it'll be in one time.</p>
          <p>(woman) I know, it's just that professor Adams is kind of strict when it comes to handing in research papers, I mean, the format he gave us for putting this paper together was really specific. So the way it looks seems important.</p>
          <p>(man) Yeah, well, how about going to the computer lab to print another copy?</p>
          <p>(woman) I could, then I' d have a clean copy to hand in and I wouldn't have to worry about how the paper looks. (man) You'd better hurry, though, because there's usually a line over there.</p>
          <p>(woman) I know, and b y the time I get there, wait in line for a computer, print the paper out and come back to class, I'd be late for class. And professor Adams is strict about lateness, too.</p>
          <p>(man) I see what you mean.</p>

          <p>The woman's problem is that she split some soup on her paper but the class starts in fifteen minutes. Accordingly, there are two solutions for her problem: she coold just explain to her professor what happened and hand the paper in or she could go to the computer lab and print a fresh clean copy. I bet the woman had better follow the second solution for some reasons. Firstly, a sticky, wrinkled and stained copy of paper is not academically serious, and in some certain occasion it even means disrespect to the professor who will read it carefully. So no matter what it cost, I think the woman should get a clean copy, at least, for the sake of respect. Secondly, fifteen minutes is quite enough for the woman to get a clean copy simply because she could hurry,  and talk to the students before her about her situation, and I guess they will understand. After all it's easier explaining to the students before her than explaining to a pretty strict professor. So I think she should take the second solution. (179 words)</p>
