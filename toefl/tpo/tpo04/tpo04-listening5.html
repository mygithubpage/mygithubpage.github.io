              <span class="time" data-times="5.9" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in a <span class="underline">geology</span> class. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.53" data-time="5.9">[00:05.90]</span>Professor: Now we've got a few minutes before we leave for today. <span class="time" data-times="4.06" data-time="8.43">[00:08.43]</span>So I'll just touch on an interesting <span class="underline">subject</span> that I think makes an important point. <span class="time" data-times="4.81" data-time="12.49">[00:12.49]</span>We've been covering rocks and different types of rocks for the last several weeks. <span class="time" data-times="2.84" data-time="17.3">[00:17.30]</span>But next week we are going to do something a bit different.<span class="time" data-times="8.93" data-time="20.14">[00:20.14]</span> And to get started I thought I'd <span class="underline">mention</span> something that shows how uh...as a <span class="underline">geologist</span>, you need to know about more than just rocks and the structure of <span class="underline">solid</span> matter. <span class="time" data-times="2.82" data-time="29.07">[00:29.07]</span>Moving rocks, you may have heard about them. <span class="time" data-times="2.38" data-time="31.89">[00:31.89]</span>It's quite a mystery. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.05" data-time="34.27">[00:34.27]</span>Death <span class="underline">valley</span> is this <span class="underline">desert</span> <span class="underline">plain</span>, a dry lake bed in California surrounded by mountains and on the <span class="underline">desert</span> floor these huge rocks, some of them hundreds of pounds.<span class="time" data-times="1.11" data-time="44.32">[00:44.32]</span> And they move. <span class="time" data-times="5.65" data-time="45.43">[00:45.43]</span>They leave long trails behind them, tracks you might say as they move from one point to another. <span class="time" data-times="5.53" data-time="51.08">[00:51.08]</span>But nobody has been able to <span class="underline">figure</span> out how they are moving because no one has ever seen it happen. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.8" data-time="56.61">[00:56.61]</span>Now there are a lot of theories, but all we know for sure is that people aren't moving the rocks. <span class="time" data-times="8.32" data-time="62.41">[01:02.41]</span>There are no footprints, no tyre tracks and no heavy <span class="underline">machinery</span> like a <span class="underline">bulldozer</span>...uh, nothing was ever brought in to move these heavy rocks. <span class="time" data-times="3.06" data-time="70.73">[01:10.73]</span>So what's going on? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.67" data-time="73.79">[01:13.79]</span>
              <span class="underline">Theory</span> NO.1 ---Wind. <span class="time" data-times="4.81" data-time="76.46">[01:16.46]</span>Some researchers think powerful uh...windstorms might move the rocks. <span class="time" data-times="6.34" data-time="81.27">[01:21.27]</span>Most of the rocks move in the same direction as the <span class="underline">dominant</span> wind <span class="underline">pattern</span> from southwest to northeast. <span class="time" data-times="7.2" data-time="87.61">[01:27.61]</span>But some, and this is interesting, move straight west while some zigzag or <span class="underline">even</span> move in large circles. <span class="time" data-times="2.52" data-time="94.81">[01:34.81]</span>Hmmm...How can that be? <span class="time" data-times="3.38" data-time="97.33">[01:37.33]</span>How about wind combined with rain? <span class="time" data-times="2.99" data-time="100.71">[01:40.71]</span>The ground of this <span class="underline">desert</span> is made of <span class="underline">clay</span>. <span class="time" data-times="1.99" data-time="103.7">[01:43.70]</span>It's a <span class="underline">desert</span>, so it's dry. <span class="time" data-times="4.76" data-time="105.69">[01:45.69]</span>But when there is the <span class="underline">occasional</span> rain, the <span class="underline">clay</span> ground becomes extremely slippery. <span class="time" data-times="2.96" data-time="110.45">[01:50.45]</span>It's hard for anyone to stand on, walk on. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.31" data-time="113.41">[01:53.41]</span>Some scientists theorized that perhaps when the ground is slippery the high winds can then move the rocks. <span class="time" data-times="2.08" data-time="119.72">[01:59.72]</span>There's a problem with this <span class="underline">theory</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.81" data-time="121.8">[02:01.80]</span>One team of scientists flooded an area of the <span class="underline">desert</span> with water, then try to <span class="underline">establish</span> how much wind force would be necessary to move the rocks. <span class="time" data-times="6.22" data-time="130.61">[02:10.61]</span>And get this: you need winds of at <span class="underline">least</span> five hundred miles an hour to move just the smallest rocks! <span class="time" data-times="3.91" data-time="136.83">[02:16.83]</span>And winds that strong have never been recorded. Ever! <span class="time" data-times="1.45" data-time="140.74">[02:20.74]</span>Not on this <span class="underline">planet</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.86" data-time="142.19">[02:22.19]</span>So I think it's safe to say that that <span class="underline">issue</span>'s been settled. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.03" data-time="146.05">[02:26.05]</span>Here is another possibility – ice. <span class="time" data-times="6.88" data-time="149.08">[02:29.08]</span>It's possible that rain on the <span class="underline">desert</span> floor could turn to thin sheets of ice when temperatures <span class="underline">drop</span> at night. <span class="time" data-times="9.69" data-time="155.96">[02:35.96]</span>So if rocks...uh become embedded in ice, uh ... OK, could a piece of ice with rocks in it be pushed around by the wind? <span class="time" data-times="8.64" data-time="165.65">[02:45.65]</span>But there's a problem with this <span class="underline">theory</span>, too. Rocks trapped in ice together would have moved together when the ice moved. <span class="time" data-times="1.94" data-time="174.29">[02:54.29]</span>But that doesn't always happen. <span class="time" data-times="2.39" data-time="176.23">[02:56.23]</span>The rocks <span class="underline">seem</span> to take <span class="underline">separate</span> routes. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.72" data-time="178.62">[02:58.62]</span>There are a few other theories. <span class="time" data-times="4.86" data-time="181.34">[03:01.34]</span>Maybe the ground vibrates, or maybe the ground itself is shifting, tilting. <span class="time" data-times="3.3" data-time="186.2">[03:06.20]</span>Maybe the rocks are moved by a <span class="underline">magnetic</span> force. <span class="time" data-times="3.96" data-time="189.5">[03:09.50]</span>But sadly all these ideas have been eliminated as possibilities. <span class="time" data-times="1.75" data-time="193.46">[03:13.46]</span>There's just no <span class="underline">evidence</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.11" data-time="195.21">[03:15.21]</span>I <span class="underline">bet</span> you are saying to yourself, "well, why don't scientists just set up video cameras to <span class="underline">record</span> what actually happens?" </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.27" data-time="202.32">[03:22.32]</span>Thing is, this is a protected wilderness area. <span class="time" data-times="2.69" data-time="205.59">[03:25.59]</span>So by law that type of research isn't allowed. <span class="time" data-times="4.93" data-time="208.28">[03:28.28]</span> <span class="underline">Besides</span>, in powerful windstorms, <span class="underline">sensitive</span> camera equipment would be destroyed. <span class="time" data-times="5.29" data-time="213.21">[03:33.21]</span>So why can't researchers just live there for a while until they <span class="underline">observe</span> the rocks' moving? <span class="time" data-times="1.23" data-time="218.5">[03:38.50]</span>Same <span class="underline">reason</span>. <span class="time" data-times="1.92" data-time="219.73">[03:39.73]</span>So where are we now? <span class="time" data-times="3" data-time="221.65">[03:41.65]</span>Well, right now we still don't have any answers. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.61" data-time="224.65">[03:44.65]</span>So all this leads back to my main point – you need to know about more than just rocks as geologists. <span class="time" data-times="2.99" data-time="231.26">[03:51.26]</span>The researchers study in moving rocks. <span class="time" data-times="6.94" data-time="234.25">[03:54.25]</span>Well, they <span class="underline">combine</span> their knowledge of rocks with knowledge of wind, ice and such...uh not successfully, not yet. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.19" data-time="241.19">[04:01.19]</span>But you know, they wouldn't <span class="underline">even</span> have been able to get started without um... earth science understanding – knowledge about wind, storms, you know, <span class="underline">meteorology</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.36" data-time="251.38">[04:11.38]</span>You need to understand physics. <span class="time" data-times="5.09" data-time="253.74">[04:13.74]</span>So for several weeks like I said we'll be addressing <span class="underline">geology</span> from a wider <span class="underline">perspective</span>. <span class="time" data-times="1.85" data-time="258.83">[04:18.83]</span>I guess that's all for today. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="260.68">[04:20.68]</span>See you next time.  </p>
