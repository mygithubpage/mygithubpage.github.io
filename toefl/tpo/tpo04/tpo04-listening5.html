His plans for research involving moving rocks.</p><p>B. A difference between two geological forces that cause rocks to move.</p><p>C. Theories about why desert rocks move.</p><p>D. Reasons why geologists should study moving rocks.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Pro's second sentence reveals that today's theme is the reason why rocks move in the desert. There is no comparison in the two geological forces, so B is wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor, what have the researchers agreed on?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The rocks cannot move after ice storms.</p><p>B. The rocks do not move at night.</p><p>C. The rocks never move in circles.</p><p>D. The rocks are not moved by people.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>Pro has listed a series of facts to prove that people are not able to move these huge rocks. Therefore it is D. Other factors are still in an uncertain state. Only D is completely denied.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The professor mentions experiments on the wind speed necessary to move rocks. What is the professor's attitude toward the experiments?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Their results were decisive.</p><p>B. They were not carried out carefully.</p><p>C. They were not continued long enough to reach a conclusion.</p><p>D. The government should not have allowed the experiments.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>PRO has refuted and is inadvisable for each theory. Whether it is wind or Ice, Pro knows that there is doubt about these theories. Select A.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What important point does the professor make about the area where the rocks are found?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It has been the site of Earth's highest wind speeds.</p><p>B. It is subject to laws that restrict experimentation.</p><p>C. It is accessible to heavy machinery.</p><p>D. It is not subject to significant changes in temperature.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The definition of this area pro only mentions that it is a protective wilderness area. So by law that type of research isn't allowed. So it is known that the test in this area is selected by law.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the professor's purpose in telling the students about moving rocks?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To teach a lesson about the structure of solid matter.</p><p>B. To share a recent advance in geology.</p><p>C. To give an example of how ice can move rocks.</p><p>D. To show how geologists need to combine information from several fields.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>It was learned from Pro's analysis that in order to study moving rocks, researchers must combine knowledge of wind, ice, earth science, and so on, so choose D. In C, it is obvious that the theory of ice move rocks is problematic.</p></div></div><div class="replay" id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor imply when he says this:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The movement pattern of the rocks was misreported by researchers.</p><p>B. The rocs are probably being moved by people.</p><p>C. The movement pattern of the rocks does not support the wind theory.</p><p>D. There must be differences in the rocks' composition.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>From Pro's analysis after this sentence, it can be seen that the movement pattern of the rocks precisely shows that the wind is not able to move as big as a stone. The data in report A is correct and not misreported.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
