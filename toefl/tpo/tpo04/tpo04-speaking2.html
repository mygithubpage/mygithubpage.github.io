        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>I think learning in traditional classrooms is better. The reason why I think so is that there are more interactions in traditional classrooms than in online courses. Students can have discussions and they see each other face to face. It's highly probable that some of them will become friends. While in the online courses, students don't know each other, they miss a chance of making friends. Also, in a traditional classroom, if a student doesn't understand a concept or an idea, he or she can raise hand to ask the teacher directly. While in an online course, there is no chance for students to raise hands or to throw out questions immediately. Students in traditional classrooms not only learn the academic knowledge but also learn basic interpersonal interactions. I prefer to take academic courses on the Internet. Since the courses are offered online, I don't have to live near campus. All I need is a computer and a well-connected Internet. I can study at home and anywhere convenient. Besides, I don't have to worry about my housing, nor do I need to drive back and forth. So it saves me money and time. Also, it's easier to record online courses so I can review the part I don't understand. With the recorded courses, I can have a good review before final examination.</p>
