              <span class="time" data-times="6.22" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in a United States <span class="underline">government</span> class. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.48" data-time="6.22">[00:06.22]</span>Professor: OK, last time we were talking about <span class="underline">government</span> support for the arts. <span class="time" data-times="3.63" data-time="11.7">[00:11.70]</span>Who can <span class="underline">sum</span> up some of the main points? <span class="underline">Frank</span>? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.16" data-time="15.33">[00:15.33]</span>Frank: Well, I guess there wasn't really any, you know, <span class="underline">official</span> <span class="underline">government</span> support for the arts until the twentieth <span class="underline">century</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.4" data-time="22.49">[00:22.49]</span>But the first <span class="underline">attempt</span> the United States <span class="underline">government</span> made to, you know, to support the arts was the <span class="underline">Federal</span> Art <span class="underline">Project</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.14" data-time="28.89">[00:28.89]</span>Professor: Right, so what can you say about the <span class="underline">project</span>? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.61" data-time="32.03">[00:32.03]</span>Frank: Um...it was started during the Depression, um...in the 1930s to <span class="underline">employ</span> out-of-work artists. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.69" data-time="38.64">[00:38.64]</span>Professor: So was it successful? <span class="time" data-times="2.61" data-time="40.33">[00:40.33]</span>Janet? What do you say? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.64" data-time="42.94">[00:42.94]</span>Janet: Yeah, sure, it was successful. <span class="time" data-times="11.82" data-time="47.58">[00:47.58]</span>I mean, for one thing, the <span class="underline">project</span> established a lot of...uh like <span class="underline">community</span> art centers and galleries in places like <span class="underline">rural</span> areas where people hadn't really had <span class="underline">access</span> to the arts. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="0.71" data-time="59.4">[00:59.40]</span>Professor: Right. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="0.65" data-time="60.11">[01:00.11]</span>Frank: Yeah. <span class="time" data-times="4.31" data-time="60.76">[01:00.76]</span>But didn't the <span class="underline">government</span> end up wasting a lot of money for art that wasn't <span class="underline">even</span> very good? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.6" data-time="65.07">[01:05.07]</span>Professor: Uh...some people might say that.<span class="time" data-times="4.97" data-time="67.67">[01:07.67]</span> But wasn't the <span class="underline">primary</span> <span class="underline">objective</span> of the <span class="underline">Federal</span> Art <span class="underline">Project</span> to provide jobs? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.23" data-time="72.64">[01:12.64]</span>Frank: Um, that's true. <span class="time" data-times="3.45" data-time="73.87">[01:13.87]</span>I mean...it did provide jobs for thousands of unemployed artists. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.96" data-time="77.32">[01:17.32]</span>Professor: Right. But then when the United States became involved in the <span class="underline">Second</span> World War, unemployment was down and it seems that these programs weren't really necessary any longer. <span class="time" data-times="19.1" data-time="88.28">[01:28.28]</span>So, moving on, we don't actually see any <span class="underline">govern</span>...well any real <span class="underline">government</span> <span class="underline">involvement</span> in the arts again until the early 1960s, when <span class="underline">President</span> Kennedy and other politicians started to push for <span class="underline">major</span> <span class="underline">funding</span> to support and <span class="underline">promote</span> the arts. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="13.8" data-time="107.38">[01:47.38]</span>It was felt by a number of politicians that ...well that the <span class="underline">government</span> had a responsibility to support the arts as <span class="underline">sort</span> of... oh, what can we say?...the the soul...or spirit of the country. <span class="time" data-times="9.48" data-time="121.18">[02:01.18]</span>The idea was that there be a <span class="underline">federal</span> <span class="underline">subsidy</span>...um...uh...<span class="underline">financial</span> <span class="underline">assistance</span> to artists and <span class="underline">artistic</span> or cultural institutions. <span class="time" data-times="7.3" data-time="130.66">[02:10.66]</span>And for just those reasons, in 1965, the National Endowment for the Arts was created. <span class="time" data-times="10.09" data-time="137.96">[02:17.96]</span>So it was <span class="underline">through</span> the NEA, the National Endowment for the Arts, um...that the arts would develop, would be promoted <span class="underline">throughout</span> the nation. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.52" data-time="148.05">[02:28.05]</span>And then <span class="underline">individual</span> states <span class="underline">throughout</span> the country started to <span class="underline">establish</span> their own <span class="underline">state</span> arts councils to help support the arts. <span class="time" data-times="3.61" data-time="155.57">[02:35.57]</span>There was kind of uh...cultural <span class="underline">explosion</span>. <span class="time" data-times="14.36" data-time="159.18">[02:39.18]</span>And by the mid-1970s, by 1974 I think, all fifty states had their own arts agencies, their own <span class="underline">state</span> arts councils that work with the <span class="underline">federal</span> <span class="underline">government</span> with corporations, artists, performers, you name it. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.81" data-time="173.54">[02:53.54]</span>Frank: Did you just say corporations? <span class="time" data-times="1.5" data-time="176.35">[02:56.35]</span>How are they involved? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.96" data-time="177.85">[02:57.85]</span>Professor: Well, you see, corporations aren't always altruistic. <span class="time" data-times="16.37" data-time="181.81">[03:01.81]</span>They might not support the arts unless...well, unless the <span class="underline">government</span> made it <span class="underline">attractive</span> for them to do so, by offering corporations tax incentives to support the arts, that is, by letting corporations <span class="underline">pay</span> less in taxes if they were patrons of the arts. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.98" data-time="198.18">[03:18.18]</span>Um, the Kennedy <span class="underline">Centre</span> in Washington D.C., you may uh...maybe you've been there, or Lincoln <span class="underline">Centre</span> in New York. <span class="time" data-times="4.29" data-time="206.16">[03:26.16]</span>Both of these were built with <span class="underline">substantial</span> <span class="underline">financial</span> support from corporations. <span class="time" data-times="3.28" data-time="210.45">[03:30.45]</span>And the Kennedy and Lincoln centers aren't the only examples. <span class="time" data-times="9.98" data-time="213.73">[03:33.73]</span>Many of your cultural establishments in the United States will have a <span class="underline">plaque</span> somewhere acknowledging the support – the money they received from whatever corporation. <span class="time" data-times="1.38" data-time="223.71">[03:43.71]</span>Oh, yes, Janet? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.63" data-time="225.09">[03:45.09]</span>Janet: But aren't there a lot of people who don't think it's the <span class="underline">government</span>'s role to support the arts? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="12.9" data-time="229.72">[03:49.72]</span>Professor: Well, as a matter of fact, a lot of politicians who did not believe in <span class="underline">government</span> support for the arts, they <span class="underline">wanted</span> to do away with the <span class="underline">agency</span> <span class="underline">entirely</span>, for that very <span class="underline">reason</span>, to get rid of governmental support. <span class="time" data-times="5.31" data-time="242.62">[04:02.62]</span>But they only succeeded in taking away about half the <span class="underline">annual</span> <span class="underline">budget</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9.22" data-time="247.93">[04:07.93]</span>And as far as the public goes, well...there are about as many individuals who disagree with the <span class="underline">government</span> support as there are those who agree. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.31" data-time="257.15">[04:17.15]</span>In fact, with artists in <span class="underline">particular</span>, you have lots of artists who support and who have benefited from this <span class="underline">agency</span>, <span class="time" data-times="12.14" data-time="265.46">[04:25.46]</span>although it seems that just as many artists <span class="underline">oppose</span> the <span class="underline">government</span> <span class="underline">agency</span> being involved in the arts, for many different reasons, reasons like they don't want the <span class="underline">government</span> to control what they create. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="277.6">[04:37.60]</span>In other words, the arguments both for and against <span class="underline">government</span> <span class="underline">funding</span> of the arts are as many and, and as <span class="underline">varied</span> as the <span class="underline">individual</span> styles of the artists who hold them. </p>
