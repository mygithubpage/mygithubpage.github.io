part of a lecture in a <span class="highlight">literature</span> class.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.1" data-time="10.5">[00:10.50]</span>Professor: All right, so let me close today's class with some thoughts to keep in <span class="highlight">mind</span> while you are doing tonight's <span class="highlight">assignment</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.01" data-time="16.6">[00:16.60]</span>You will be reading one of Ralph Waldo Emerson's best-known essays 'Self-Reliance' and comparing it with his poems and other works. <span class="time" data-times="12.43" data-time="24.61">[00:24.61]</span>I think this <span class="highlight">essay</span> has the <span class="highlight">potential</span> to be quite <span class="highlight">meaningful</span> for all of you as young people who probably <span class="highlight">wonder</span> about things like truth and where your lives are going - all sorts of <span class="highlight">profound</span> questions.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.47" data-time="37.04">[00:37.04]</span>Knowing something about Emerson's philosophies will help you when you read 'Self-Reliance'. <span class="time" data-times="4.44" data-time="42.51">[00:42.51]</span>And basically, one of the main beliefs that he had was about truth. <span class="time" data-times="5.38" data-time="46.95">[00:46.95]</span>Not that it's something that we can be taught, Emerson says it's found <span class="highlight">within</span> ourselves. <span class="time" data-times="9.29" data-time="52.33">[00:52.33]</span>So this truth, the idea that it's in each one of us, is one of the first points that you'll see Emerson making in this <span class="highlight">essay</span>. <span class="time" data-times="12.19" data-time="61.62">[01:01.62]</span>It's a bit <span class="highlight">abstract</span> but he's very into...uh... into each person believing his or her own thought, believing in yourself, the thought or <span class="highlight">conviction</span> that's true for you.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="8.63" data-time="73.81">[01:13.81]</span>But actually, he ties that in with a <span class="highlight">sort</span> of 'universal truth' – something that everyone knows but doesn't realize they know. <span class="time" data-times="7.74" data-time="82.44">[1:22.44]</span>Most of us aren't in touch with ourselves in a way, so we just aren't <span class="highlight">capable</span> of recognizing <span class="highlight">profound</span> truth. <span class="time" data-times="14.65" data-time="90.18">[01:30.18]</span>It takes geniuses, people like, say, Shakespeare, who're <span class="highlight">unique</span> because when they have a <span class="highlight">glimpse</span> of this truth, this universal truth, they <span class="highlight">pay</span><span class="highlight">attention</span> to it and express it and don't just dismiss it like most people do. <span class="time" data-times="6.7" data-time="104.83">[01:44.83]</span>So Emerson is really into each <span class="highlight">individual</span> believing in and trusting him or herself.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.46" data-time="111.53">[01:51.53]</span>You'll see that he writes about, well, first, conformity. <span class="time" data-times="7.89" data-time="115.99">[01:55.99]</span>He criticizes that people of his time for abandoning their own minds and their own wills for the <span class="highlight">sake</span> of conformity and <span class="highlight">consistency</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.62" data-time="123.88">[02:03.88]</span>They try to fit in with the rest of the world <span class="highlight">even</span> though it's at odds with their beliefs and their identities. <span class="time" data-times="7.37" data-time="130.5">[02:10.50]</span><span class="highlight">Therefore</span>, it's best to be a non-conformist – to do your own thing, not worrying about what other people think. <span class="time" data-times="2.08" data-time="137.87">[02:17.87]</span>That's an important point. <span class="time" data-times="2.92" data-time="139.95">[02:19.95]</span>He really drives this <span class="highlight">argument</span> home <span class="highlight">throughout</span> the <span class="highlight">essay</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.01" data-time="142.87">[02:22.87]</span>When you are reading, I want you to think about that and why that kind of thought would be <span class="highlight">relevant</span> to the readers of his time. <span class="time" data-times="11.4" data-time="149.88">[02:29.88]</span>Remember this is 1838, 'Self-Reliance' was a <span class="highlight">novel</span> idea at the time and the United <span class="highlight">State</span>'s citizens were less <span class="highlight">secure</span> about themselves as individuals and as Americans.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.53" data-time="161.28">[02:41.28]</span>The country as a whole was trying to <span class="highlight">define</span> itself. <span class="time" data-times="9.08" data-time="164.81">[02:44.81]</span>Emerson <span class="highlight">wanted</span> to give people something to really think about, help them find their own way and what it meant to be who they were. <span class="time" data-times="16.6" data-time="173.89">[02:53.89]</span>So that's something that I think is <span class="highlight">definitely</span> as <span class="highlight">relevant</span> today as it was then, probably, um, especially among young adults like yourselves, you know, uh, college being a time to <span class="highlight">sort</span> of really think about who you are and where you're going.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.78" data-time="190.49">[03:10.49]</span>Now we already said that Emerson really emphasizes non-conformity, right? <span class="time" data-times="8.86" data-time="196.27">[03:16.27]</span>As a way to <span class="highlight">sort</span> of not lose your own self and <span class="highlight">identity</span> in the world, to have your own truth and not be afraid to listen to it. <span class="time" data-times="2.7" data-time="205.13">[03:25.13]</span>Well, he takes this a step further. <span class="time" data-times="6.46" data-time="207.83">[03:27.83]</span>Not conforming also means, uh, not conforming with yourself or your past.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="1.83" data-time="214.29">[03:34.29]</span>What does that mean? <span class="time" data-times="13.01" data-time="216.12">[03:36.12]</span>Well, if you've always been a certain way or done a certain thing, but it's not working for you any more, or you're not <span class="highlight">content</span>, Emerson says that it'd be <span class="highlight">foolish</span> to be <span class="highlight">consistent</span><span class="highlight">even</span> with our own past. <span class="time" data-times="6.06" data-time="229.13">[03:49.13]</span>"<span class="highlight">Focus</span> on the future," he says, "That's what matters more. Inconsistency is good."</p><p><span class="time" data-times="9.39" data-time="235.19">[03:55.19]</span>He talks about a ship's <span class="highlight">voyage</span> and this is one of the most famous bits of the <span class="highlight">essay</span> - how the best <span class="highlight">voyage</span> is made up of zigzag lines. <span class="time" data-times="9.76" data-time="244.58">[04:04.58]</span>Up close, it seems a little all over the place, but from farther away, the true <span class="highlight">path</span> shows and in the end it justifies all the turns <span class="highlight">along</span> the way. <span class="time" data-times="6.18" data-time="254.34">[04:14.34]</span>So, don't worry if you are not sure where you're headed or what your long-term goals are.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.21" data-time="260.52">[04:20.52]</span>Stay true to yourself and it'll make <span class="highlight">sense</span> in the end. <span class="time" data-times="2.53" data-time="263.73">[04:23.73]</span>I mean, I can <span class="highlight">attest</span> to that. <span class="time" data-times="3.73" data-time="266.26">[04:26.26]</span>Before I was a <span class="highlight">literature</span> professor, I was an accountant. <span class="time" data-times="2.88" data-time="269.99">[04:29.99]</span>Before that, I was a newspaper reporter. <span class="time" data-times="7.12" data-time="272.87">[04:32.87]</span>My life is taking some <span class="highlight">pretty</span> interesting turns and here I am, very happy with my experiences and where they've brought me. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="279.99">[04:39.99]</span>If you <span class="highlight">rely</span> on yourself and trust your own talents, your own <span class="highlight">interest</span>, don't worry, your <span class="highlight">path</span> will make <span class="highlight">sense</span> in the end.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the main purpose of the lecture?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.
