Microscopic organisms <span class="highlight">settle</span> to the seafloor and <span class="highlight question1">accumulate</span> in <span class="highlight">marine</span> mud. The <span class="highlight">organic</span> matter may <span class="highlight">partially</span><span class="highlight">decompose</span>, using up the dissolved <span class="highlight">oxygen</span> in the <span class="highlight">sediment</span>. As soon as the <span class="highlight">oxygen</span> is gone, <span class="highlight">decay</span> stops and the <span class="highlight">remaining</span><span class="highlight">organic</span> matter is preserved.</p><p><span class="question4">Continued <span class="highlight">sedimentation</span>-the <span class="highlight">process</span> of deposits' settling on the sea bottom-buries the <span class="highlight">organic</span> matter and subjects it to higher temperatures and pressures, which <span class="highlight">convert</span> the <span class="highlight">organic</span> matter to oil and gas.</span><span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>As <span class="highlight">muddy</span> sediments are pressed together, the gas and small droplets of oil may be squeezed out of the mud and may move into sandy layers nearby.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>Over long periods of time (millions of years), accumulations of gas and oil can <span class="highlight">collect</span> in the sandy layers. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>Both oil and gas are less <span class="highlight question1">dense</span> than water,
so they generally <span class="highlight">tend</span> to rise upward <span class="highlight">through</span> water-saturated rock and <span class="highlight">sediment</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p><p>Oil pools are <span class="highlight">valuable</span><span class="highlight">underground</span> accumulations of oil, and oil fields are regions underlain by one or more oil pools. When an oil pool or <span class="highlight">field</span> has been discovered, wells are drilled into the ground. <span class="highlight">Permanent</span> towers, called derricks, used to be built to <span class="highlight">handle</span> the long sections of drilling <span class="highlight">pipe</span>. Now <span class="highlight">portable</span> drilling machines are set up and are then dismantled and removed. When the well reaches a pool, oil usually rises up the well because of its <span class="highlight">density</span><span class="highlight">difference</span> with water <span class="highlight">beneath</span> it or because of the <span class="highlight">pressure</span> of expanding gas trapped above it. Although this rise of oil is almost always carefully controlled today, spouts of oil, or gushers, were <span class="highlight">common</span> in the past. Gas <span class="highlight">pressure</span><span class="highlight">gradually</span> dies out, and oil is pumped from the well. Water or steam may be pumped down <span class="highlight"><span class="question5">adjacent</span></span> wells to help push the oil out. At a refinery, the <span class="highlight">crude</span> oil from <span class="highlight">underground</span> is separated into natural gas, <span class="highlight">gasoline</span>, <span class="highlight">kerosene</span>, and various oils. Petrochemicals such as dyes, <span class="highlight">fertilizer</span>, and <span class="highlight">plastic</span> are also manufactured from the <span class="highlight">petroleum</span>.</p><p>As oil becomes increasingly difficult to find, the search for it is extended into more-hostile environments. The <span class="highlight">development</span> of the oil <span class="highlight">field</span> on the North Slope of Alaska and the <span class="highlight">construction</span> of the Alaska pipeline are examples of the great expense and difficulty involved in new oil discoveries. Offshore drilling platforms <span class="highlight">extend</span> the search for oil to the ocean's <span class="highlight">continental</span> shelves-those gently <span class="question9">sloping</span><span class="highlight">submarine</span> regions at the edges of the continents. More than one-quarter of the world's oil and almost one-fifth of the world's natural gas come from offshore, <span class="highlight">even</span> though offshore drilling is six to seven times more expensive than drilling on land. A <span class="highlight">significant</span> part of this oil and gas comes from under the North Sea between Great Britain and Norway.</p><p>Of <span class="highlight">course</span>, there is far more oil <span class="highlight">underground</span> than can be recovered. It may be in a pool too small or too far from a <span class="highlight">potential</span><span class="highlight">market</span> to <span class="highlight">justify</span> the expense of drilling. Some oil lies under regions where drilling is forbidden, such as national parks or other public lands. <span class="highlight">Even</span><span class="highlight">given</span> the best extraction techniques, only about 30 to 40 percent of the oil in a <span class="highlight">given</span> pool can be brought to the surface. The rest is far too difficult to <span class="highlight">extract</span> and has to <span class="highlight">remain</span><span class="highlight">underground</span>.</p><p>Moreover, getting <span class="highlight">petroleum</span> out of the ground and from under the sea and to the consumer can create <span class="highlight">environmental</span> problems anywhere <span class="highlight">along</span> the <span class="highlight">line</span>. Pipelines carrying oil can be broken by faults or landslides, causing serious oil spills. Spillage from huge oil-carrying <span class="highlight">cargo</span> ships, called tankers, involved in collisions or accidental groundings (such as the one off Alaska in 1989) can create oil slicks at sea. Offshore platforms may also lose oil, creating oil slicks that <span class="highlight">drift</span> ashore and <span class="highlight"><span class="question11">foul</span></span> the beaches, harming the environment. Sometimes, the ground at an oil <span class="highlight">field</span> may subside as oil is removed. The Wilmington <span class="highlight">field</span> near Long <span class="highlight">Beach</span>, California, has subsided nine meters in 50 years; protective barriers have had to be built to prevent seawater from flooding the area. Finally, the refining and burning of <span class="highlight">petroleum</span> and its products can cause <span class="highlight">air</span> pollution. Advancing technology and <span class="highlight">strict</span> laws, however, are helping control some of these <span class="highlight">adverse</span><span class="highlight">environmental</span> effects.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">accumulate</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. grow up</p><p>B. build up</p><p>C. spread out</p><p>D. break apart</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B accumulate: Deposition, accumulation, accumulation. A is growth; B is promotion, accumulation; C is unfolding, spreading; D is splitting. So B's build up is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 1, which of the following is true about petroleum formation?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Microscopic organisms that live in mud produce crude oil and natural gas.</p><p>B. Large amounts of oxygen are needed for petroleum formation to begin.</p><p>C. Petroleum is produced when organic material in sediments combines with decaying marine organisms.</p><p>D. Petroleum formation appears to begin in marine sediments where organic matter is present.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D Key words for petroleum formation, no, but petroleum originate from blablabla, said that oil originated in organic matter in marine sediments, exactly the same as the D option, D correct; A wrong, the original did not say live; B wrong, The original did not say that a large amount of oxygen was needed. It was only said that organic matter could be preserved after the oxygen was exhausted; C wrong, the original did not say combine.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>In paragraphs 1 and 2, the author's primary purpose is to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. describe how petroleum is formed</p><p>B. explain why petroleum formation is a slow process</p><p>C. provide evidence that a marine environment is necessary for petroleum formation</p><p>D. show that oil commonly occurs in association with gas</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A, ask two paragraphs and look at the beginning of the two paragraphs respectively. The first paragraph begins with how the oil started. The first sentence of the second paragraph says that the deposition of blabla continues, that is, the continuation of the oil formation process described in the first paragraph. So A is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Higher temperatures and pressures promote sedimentation, which is responsible for petroleum formation.</p><p>B. Deposits of sediments on top of organic matter increase the temperature of and pressure on the matter.</p><p>C.

The remains of microscopic organisms transform into petroleum once they are buried under mud.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C. Remove the insertion in the original sentence. The original sentence has changed into sedimentation bury and subject to blabla, convert to petro. A wrong, the original did not say that temperature and pressure increase segmentation; B missed important information, the original sentence of the oil did not say; C is correct; D completely did not reproduce the original important information, wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question5">adjacent</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. nearby</p><p>B. existing</p><p>C. special</p><p>D. deep</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" A"><p>A <span class="question5">adjacent</span>, <span class="question5">adjacent</span>, answer A, the original sentence from which kind of wells can get water, or oil, press out. According to the U-tube principle of physics, from the end of the U-tube of the water-filled pipe, the liquid level at the other end will rise. Similarly, if water or steam is pushed in from the <span class="question5">adjacent</span> well, the oil will be pressed out. The answer is A, B exists in C special D depth is not right.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the following can be inferred from paragraph 3 about gushers?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They make bringing the oil to the surface easier.</p><p>B. They signal the presence of huge oil reserves.</p><p>C. They waste more oil than they collect.</p><p>D. They are unlikely to occur nowadays.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The term gusher is used to refer to the penultimate sentence of this paragraph: That this rise of oil is almost always carefully controlled today, spouts of oil, or gushers, were common in the past. It is not common now, and the first half of the sentence also says careful control. The result of careful control is no longer happening, and D answers can also be selected.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the following strategies for oil exploration is described in paragraph 4?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Drilling under the ocean's surface</p><p>B. Limiting drilling to accessible locations</p><p>C. Using highly sophisticated drilling equipment</p><p>D. Constructing technologically advanced drilling platforms</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The first sentence of the fourth paragraph of the A said the hostile environment, followed by a large number of words written on the "offshore drilling platform", the first sentence of the fifth paragraph also said that there is more oil in the underground place, so A's Under the ocean's surface is the most reliable; B obviously contradicts the first sentence of the fourth paragraph; C's equipment and D's advanced platform did not say anything.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the development of the Alaskan oil field mentioned in paragraph 4 demonstrate?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.
