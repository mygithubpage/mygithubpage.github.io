We might <span class="highlight">expect</span> that early <span class="highlight">artistic</span> efforts would be <span class="highlight">crude</span>, but the cave paintings of Spain and southern France show a <span class="highlight question1">marked</span><span class="highlight">degree</span> of skill. So do the naturalistic paintings on slabs of stone excavated in southern Africa. Some of those slabs <span class="highlight">appear</span> to have been painted as much as 28,000 years ago, which suggests that painting in Africa is as old as painting in Europe. But painting may be <span class="highlight">even</span> older than that. The early Australians may have painted on the walls of rock shelters and <span class="highlight">cliff</span> faces at <span class="highlight">least</span> 30,000 years ago, and maybe as much as 60,000 years ago.</p><p>The researchers Peter Ucko and Andree Rosenfeld identified three <span class="highlight"><span class="question3">principal</span></span> locations of paintings in the caves of western Europe: (1) in <span class="highlight">obviously</span> inhabited rock shelters and cave entrances; (2) in galleries immediately off the inhabited areas of caves; and (3) in the <span class="highlight">inner</span> reaches of caves, whose difficulty of <span class="highlight">access</span> has been interpreted by some as a sign that magical-religious activities were performed there.</p><p>The subjects of the paintings are mostly animals. The paintings rest on <span class="highlight">bare</span> walls, with no backdrops or <span class="highlight">environmental</span><span class="question5">trappings</span>. <span class="question6">Perhaps, like many <span class="highlight">contemporary</span> peoples, Upper <span class="highlight">Paleolithic</span> men and women believed that the drawing of a human <span class="highlight">image</span> could cause death or injury, and if that were indeed their belief, it might explain why human figures are <span class="highlight">rarely</span> depicted in cave art.</span>
Another explanation for the <span class="highlight">focus</span> on animals might be that these people sought to <span class="highlight">improve</span> their luck at hunting.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>This <span class="highlight">theory</span> is suggested by <span class="highlight">evidence</span> of chips in the painted figures, perhaps made by spears thrown at the drawings.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>But if improving their hunting luck was the <span class="highlight">chief</span><span class="highlight">motivation</span> for the paintings, it is difficult to explain why only a few show signs of having been speared.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>Perhaps the paintings were inspired by the need to increase the <span class="highlight">supply</span> of animals. Cave art seems to have <span class="question8">reached a <span class="highlight">peak</span> toward the end of the Upper <span class="highlight">Paleolithic</span> period, when the herds of game were decreasing.</span><span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p><p>The <span class="highlight">particular</span><span class="highlight">symbolic</span><span class="highlight">significance</span> of the cave paintings in southwestern France is more explicitly revealed, perhaps, by the results of a study conducted by researchers Patricia Rice and Ann Paterson. The <span class="highlight">data</span> they present suggest that the animals portrayed in the cave paintings were mostly the ones that the painters preferred for meat and for materials such as hides. For example, wild <span class="highlight">cattle</span> (bovines) and horses are portrayed more often than we would <span class="highlight">expect</span> by <span class="highlight">chance</span>, probably because they were larger and heavier (meatier) than other animals in the environment. In <span class="highlight">addition</span>, the paintings mostly <span class="highlight">portray</span> animals that the painters may have feared the most because of their size, speed, natural weapons such as tusks and horns, and the unpredictability of their <span class="highlight">behavior</span>. That is, mammoths, bovines, and horses are portrayed more often than deer and reindeer. Thus, the paintings are <span class="highlight">consistent</span> with the idea that the art is related to the importance of hunting in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of Upper <span class="highlight">Paleolithic</span> people. <span class="highlight">Consistent</span> with this idea, according to the investigators, is the fact that the art of the cultural period that followed the Upper <span class="highlight">Paleolithic</span> also seems to <span class="highlight">reflect</span> how people got their food. But in that period, when getting food no longer depended on hunting large game animals (because they were becoming <span class="highlight">extinct</span>), the art ceased to <span class="highlight">focus</span> on portrayals of animals.</p><p>Upper <span class="highlight">Paleolithic</span> art was not confined to cave paintings. Many shafts of spears and <span class="highlight">similar</span> objects were decorated with figures of animals. The <span class="highlight">anthropologist</span> Alexander Marshack has an interesting <span class="highlight">interpretation</span> of some of the engravings made during the Upper <span class="highlight">Paleolithic</span>. He believes that as far back as 30,000 B.C., hunters may have used a system of <span class="highlight">notation</span>, engraved on bone and stone, to mark phases of the Moon. If this is true, it would mean that Upper <span class="highlight">Paleolithic</span> people were <span class="highlight">capable</span> of <span class="highlight">complex</span> thought and were <span class="highlight">consciously</span><span class="highlight">aware</span> of their environment. In <span class="highlight">addition</span> to other artworks, figurines representing the human <span class="highlight">female</span> in exaggerated form have also been found at Upper <span class="highlight">Paleolithic</span> sites. It has been suggested that these figurines were an <span class="highlight">ideal</span> type or an expression of a <span class="highlight">desire</span> for <span class="highlight">fertility</span>.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">marked</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. considerable</p><p>B. surprising</p><p>C. limited</p><p>D. adequate</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>Mark: marked, marked: obvious, significant. Corresponding to the original text: We expect expect that early artistic efforts would be crude, but the cave paintings of Spain and southern France show a marked degree of skill. The first sentence of the sentence says that we think that artistic efforts are rather poor, and the latter comes Turn around and say what kind of tricks they should have, considerable and correct. Limited emotional color, surprise too exaggerated, and surprise is not necessarily good, adequate meaning over.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Paragraph 1 supports which of the following statements about painting in Europe?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It is much older than painting in Australia.</p><p>B. It is as much as 28,000 years old.</p><p>C. It is not as old as painting in southern Africa.</p><p>D. It is much more than 30,000 years old.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B. The keywords in the answer to this question are very easy to find. Therefore, using the exclusion method, it can be inferred from the answers that the question is the age of the painting. The text mentioned the ages of the three local rock paintings. South Africa was 28,000 years ago. Europe and South Africa are the same. Australia was 30,000 years old. So Australia is old, A is wrong, and D is wrong. B said that 28,000 years ago, since it was originally said that Europe and Africa The same, of course, is 28,000 years ago, so B is right; C is just the opposite of the original, wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question3">principal</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. major</p><p>B. likely</p><p>C. well protected</p><p>D. distinct</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" A"><p>Principal: The main one. A is the main; B is possible; C is well protected; D is unique and obvious. So A's major is the answer. Corresponding to the original: The researchers Peter Ucko and Andree Rosenfeld identified three <span class="question3">principal</span> locations of paintings in the caves of western Europe... to say that the researchers found three places where there were rock paintings, and the three wrong answers to this question were all right, so This is by understanding.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 2, what makes some researchers think that certain cave paintings were connected with magical-religious activities?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The paintings were located where many people could easily see them, allowing groups of people to participate in the magical-religious activities.</p><p>B. Upper Paleolithic people shared similar beliefs with contemporary peoples who use paintings of animals in their magical-religious rituals.</p><p>C. Evidence of magical-religious activities has been found in galleries immediately off the inhabited areas of caves.</p><p>D. The paintings were found in hard-to-reach places away from the inhabited parts of the cave.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D is located in the third position with a keyword of magical-religious activities. Both inner reach and difficult to access indicate that D is correct because only D mentions hard-to-reach places.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question5">trappings</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. conditions</p><p>B. problems</p><p>C. influences</p><p>D. decorations</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" D"><p>D <span class="question5">trappings</span>: Decoration. The most common meaning of traps is hunting or trapping, but pay attention to <span class="question5">trappings</span>, and when there are more than one, there is a meaning of decoration.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Upper Paleolithic people, like many contemporary peoples, believed that if they drew a human image in their cave art, it would cause death or injury.</p><p>B. Many contemporary people believe that the drawing of a human image can cause death or injury, so they, like Upper Paleolithic people, rarely depicted human figures in their cave art.</p><p>C. If Upper Paleolithic people, like many contemporary peoples, believed that the drawing of a human image could cause death or injury, this belief might explain why human figures are rarely depicted in cave art.</p><p>D. Although many contemporary peoples believe that the drawing of a human image can cause death or injury, researchers cannot explain why Upper Paleolithic people rarely depicted human figures in their cave art.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The structure of the original text of C is believed by people of the Paleolithic blablabla, and if so, blablabla. A option is missing if it is really that part, missing important information, wrong; B also made the same mistake, and B also stole the original statement object, the original saying how the upper Paleolithic people how, was B replaced by modern How do people get; C is correct; D just said it is not, can not explain, but this is a possible explanation, wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 3, scholars explained chips in the painted figures of animals by proposing that</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Upper Paleolithic artists used marks to record the animals they had seen</p><p>B. the paintings were inspired by the need to increase the supply of animals for hunting</p><p>C. the artists had removed rough spots on the cave walls</p><p>D. Upper Paleolithic people used the paintings to increase their luck at hunting</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>Ask the author to explain why the chips in the painted animal figures are: Look for these explanations on the focus on animals might be that these people seek to improve their luck at hunting. The focus on animals is to improve their luck in hunting, so D is correct. B is mentioned in the penultimate sentence, but this meditation is another point of view. From the previous sentence, But knows that this has formed a turning point with the previous text, so it is not the point that the example wants to support; AC does not mention it in the original.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the author mention that Upper Paleolithic cave art seemed to have "<span class="highlight">reached a peak toward the end of the Upper Paleolithic period, when the herds of game were decreasing</span>"?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To argue that Upper Paleolithic art ceased to include animals when herds of game became scarce</p><p>B. To provide support for the idea that the aim of the paintings was to increase the supply of animals for hunting</p><p>C. To emphasize the continued improvement in the quality of cave art throughout the Upper Paleolithic period</p><p>D. To show the direct connection between the decrease in herds of game and the end of the Upper Paleolithic period</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="reached a peak toward the end of the Upper Paleolithic period, when the herds of game were decreasing B"><p>The title of the function, the sentence in which the example is located, said that when the prey had become less, such rock paintings reached a peak. Looking ahead, the previous sentence stated that people drew such paintings because they wanted more prey, so this sentence It is proof that the painting is intended for more prey. Answer B is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, scholars believe that wild cattle, horses, and mammoths are the animals most frequently portrayed in cave paintings for all of the following reasons EXCEPT:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

The painters admired the beauty of these large animals.</p><p>D. People feared these animals because of their size and speed.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C. Exclusion method, all answers are concentrated in the two or four sentences of this paragraph. The fourth sentence refers to A and D. The second sentence refers to B. The answer only says that the large animals have more paintings than the paintings. The person who painted likes the beauty of a big animal, and C does not say it.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, which of the following may best represent the attitude of hunters toward deer and reindeer in the Upper Paleolithic period?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Hunters did not fear deer and reindeers as much as they did large game animals such as horses and mammoths.</p><p>B. Hunters were not interested in hunting deer and reindeer because of their size and speed.</p><p>C. Hunters preferred the meat and hides of deer and reindeer to those of other animals.</p><p>D. Hunters avoided deer and reindeer because of their natural weapons, such as horns.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A. Use deer and reindeer as the key words to locate in the fifth sentence of the original text, and then follow the above question, saying that larger animals are more likely to appear in petroglyphs than small animals such as deer and reindeer. The former said that it was because of fears of many aspects of the big animals. Painting, so A pair, B mixed the two concepts together, and the original did not say that hunters are not interested in deer, wrong; 9 item B is right, so 10 questions C items wrong; original saying there is a horn of large animals , not deer, D wrong</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, what change is evident in the art of the period following the Upper Paleolithic?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. This new art starts to depict small animals rather than large ones.</p><p>B. This new art ceases to reflect the ways in which people obtained their food.</p><p>C. This new art no longer consists mostly of representations of animals.</p><p>D.

Saying: When the harvesting of food is no longer dependent on the hunting of large animals, this painting art is not focused on displaying animals. C is correct. A mistake, the original did not say that after painting large animals, it turned to small animals; it also reflected life, B Wrong; D never said.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 5, which of the following has been used as evidence to suggest that Upper Paleolithic people were capable of complex thought and conscious awareness of their environment?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They engraved animal figures on the shafts of spears and other objects.</p><p>B. They may have used engraved signs to record the phases of the Moon.</p><p>C. Their figurines represented the human female in exaggerated form.</p><p>D. They may have used figurines to portray an ideal type or to express a desire for fertility.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B. Use the keyword of complex thought and conscious awareness to locate the fourth sentence of this paragraph. Because there is a pronoun it indicates that this sentence is related to the previous sentence. The specific example of the previous sentence is to record the moon phase, and B is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Therefore, if the paintings were connected with hunting, some other explanation is needed..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C three transition points, hunting description D option is not possible to exclude; some other explanation must have other explanations before, but this is useless; the third is the causal relationship represented by therefore; A option after this and The above refers to the obvious relationship, so A excluded; B options spears thrown at drawings, followed by having been speared, transition tight, ruled out, so only C is correct, after the discovery is really another explanation, so C right.</p></div></div><div id="question14" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>Upper Paleolithic cave paintings in Western Europe are among humanity's earliest artistic efforts.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.Researchers have proposed several different explanations for the fact that animals were the most common subjects in the cave paintings.</p><p>B.The art of the cultural period that followed the Upper Paleolithic ceased to portray large game animals and focused instead on the kinds of animals that people of that period preferred to hunt.</p><p>C.Some researchers believe that the paintings found in France provide more explicit evidence of their symbolic significance than those found in Spain, southern Africa, and Australia.</p><p>D.The cave paintings focus on portraying animals without also depicting the natural environments in which these animals are typically found.</p><p>E.Some researchers have argued that the cave paintings mostly portrayed large animals that provided Upper Paleolithic people with meat and materials.</p><p>F.Besides cave paintings, Upper Paleolithic people produced several other kinds of artwork, one of which has been thought to provide evidence of complex thought.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="AEF"><p>The title of the article suggests that there are several directions for development: the characteristics of art (phenomena description) / the development of art (historical narrative) / why these arts are painted (phenomena explanation)</p><p>The first paragraph said that the Paleolithic era has a high level of art.</p><p>The second paragraph enters the topic and says the three positions of art discovery.</p><p>The three paragraphs describe a feature that mainly draws animals and gives explanations.</p><p>The four paragraphs said the two people's views and gave positive support.</p><p>The fifth paragraph was extended from the topic to other arts.</p><p>The quoting sentence summarizes the first paragraph, and the correct answer should summarize the following paragraphs.</p><p>The A(researchers have proposed) option corresponds to the entire third paragraph and proposes the interpretation of the three main painting animals, correct.</p><p>The B (the art) option article did not say, do not choose.</p><p>The C (some sectors believe) option article did not say, do not choose.</p><p>D (the cave) option did not say the original, do not choose.</p><p>The E(some researchers have) option corresponds to the fourth paragraph of the original text, correct.</p><p>The F(besides) option corresponds to the fifth paragraph, correct.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
