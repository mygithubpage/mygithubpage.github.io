We might <span class="highlight">expect</span> that early <span class="highlight">artistic</span> efforts would be <span class="highlight">crude</span>, but the cave paintings of Spain and southern France show a <span class="question1"><span class="highlight">marked</span></span><span class="highlight">degree</span> of skill. So do the naturalistic paintings on slabs of stone excavated in southern Africa. Some of those slabs <span class="highlight">appear</span> to have been painted as much as 28,000 years ago, which suggests that painting in Africa is as old as painting in Europe. But painting may be <span class="highlight">even</span> older than that. The early Australians may have painted on the walls of rock shelters and <span class="highlight">cliff</span> faces at <span class="highlight">least</span> 30,000 years ago, and maybe as much as 60,000 years ago.</p><p>The researchers Peter Ucko and Andree Rosenfeld identified three <span class="highlight"><span class="question3">principal</span></span>locations of paintings in the caves of western Europe: (1) in <span class="highlight">obviously</span> inhabited rock shelters and cave entrances; (2) in galleries immediately off the inhabited areas of caves; and (3) in the <span class="highlight">inner</span> reaches of caves, whose difficulty of <span class="highlight">access</span> has been interpreted by some as a sign that magical-religious activities were performed there.</p><p>The subjects of the paintings are mostly animals. The paintings rest on <span class="highlight">bare</span> walls, with no backdrops or <span class="highlight">environmental</span><span class="question5">trappings. </span>Perhaps, like many <span class="highlight">contemporary</span> peoples, Upper <span class="highlight">Paleolithic</span> men and women believed that the drawing of a human <span class="highlight">image</span> could cause death or injury, and if that were indeed their belief, it might explain why human figures are <span class="highlight">rarely</span> depicted in cave art.
Another explanation for the <span class="highlight">focus</span> on animals might be that these people sought to <span class="highlight">improve</span> their luck at hunting.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>This <span class="highlight">theory</span> is suggested by <span class="highlight">evidence</span> of chips in the painted figures, perhaps made by spears thrown at the drawings.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>But if improving their hunting luck was the <span class="highlight">chief</span><span class="highlight">motivation</span> for the paintings, it is difficult to explain why only a few show signs of having been speared.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>Perhaps the paintings were inspired by the need to increase the <span class="highlight">supply</span> of animals. Cave art seems to have <span class="question8">reached a <span class="highlight">peak</span> toward the end of the Upper <span class="highlight">Paleolithic</span> period, when the herds of game were decreasing. </span><span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p><p>The <span class="highlight">particular</span><span class="highlight">symbolic</span><span class="highlight">significance</span> of the cave paintings in southwestern France is more explicitly revealed, perhaps, by the results of a study conducted by researchers Patricia Rice and Ann Paterson. The <span class="highlight">data</span> they present suggest that the animals portrayed in the cave paintings were mostly the ones that the painters preferred for meat and for materials such as hides. For example, wild <span class="highlight">cattle</span> (bovines) and horses are portrayed more often than we would <span class="highlight">expect</span> by <span class="highlight">chance</span>, probably because they were larger and heavier (meatier) than other animals in the environment. In <span class="highlight">addition</span>, the paintings mostly <span class="highlight">portray</span> animals that the painters may have feared the most because of their size, speed, natural weapons such as tusks and horns, and the unpredictability of their <span class="highlight">behavior</span>. That is, mammoths, bovines, and horses are portrayed more often than deer and reindeer. Thus, the paintings are <span class="highlight">consistent</span> with the idea that the art is related to the importance of hunting in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of Upper <span class="highlight">Paleolithic</span> people. <span class="highlight">Consistent</span> with this idea, according to the investigators, is the fact that the art of the cultural period that followed the Upper <span class="highlight">Paleolithic</span> also seems to <span class="highlight">reflect</span> how people got their food. But in that period, when getting food no longer depended on hunting large game animals (because they were becoming <span class="highlight">extinct</span>), the art ceased to <span class="highlight">focus</span> on portrayals of animals.</p><p>Upper <span class="highlight">Paleolithic</span> art was not confined to cave paintings. Many shafts of spears and <span class="highlight">similar</span> objects were decorated with figures of animals. The <span class="highlight">anthropologist</span> Alexander Marshack has an interesting <span class="highlight">interpretation</span> of some of the engravings made during the Upper <span class="highlight">Paleolithic</span>. He believes that as far back as 30,000 B.C., hunters may have used a system of <span class="highlight">notation</span>, engraved on bone and stone, to mark phases of the Moon. If this is true, it would mean that Upper <span class="highlight">Paleolithic</span> people were <span class="highlight">capable</span> of <span class="highlight">complex</span> thought and were <span class="highlight">consciously</span><span class="highlight">aware</span> of their environment. In <span class="highlight">addition</span> to other artworks, figurines representing the human <span class="highlight">female</span> in exaggerated form have also been found at Upper <span class="highlight">Paleolithic</span> sites. It has been suggested that these figurines were an <span class="highlight">ideal</span> type or an expression of a <span class="highlight">desire</span> for <span class="highlight">fertility</span>.</p></article></div><div id="question"><div id="question1"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">marked</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p><label class="my-label"><span>A. considerable</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><label class="my-label"><span>B. surprising</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><label class="my-label"><span>C. limited</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><label class="my-label"><span>D. adequate</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><p><span>Answer: </span><span class="my-answer">A</span></p></div><div id="question2"><p>Paragraph 1 supports which of the following statements about painting in Europe?</p><label class="my-label"><span>A.
