            <b>Cave Art in Europe</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>The earliest discovered traces of art are beads and carvings, and then paintings, from sites dating back to the Upper <span class="underline">Paleolithic</span> period. We might <span class="underline">expect</span> that early <span class="underline">artistic</span> efforts would be <span class="underline">crude</span>, but the cave paintings of Spain and southern France show a <span class="light"><span class="underline">marked</span></span> <span class="underline">degree</span> of skill. So do the naturalistic paintings on slabs of stone excavated in southern Africa. Some of those slabs <span class="underline">appear</span> to have been painted as much as 28,000 years ago, which suggests that painting in Africa is as old as painting in Europe. But painting may be <span class="underline">even</span> older than that. The early Australians may have painted on the walls of rock shelters and <span class="underline">cliff</span> faces at <span class="underline">least</span> 30,000 years ago, and maybe as much as 60,000 years ago.</p>
          <p>The researchers Peter Ucko and Andree Rosenfeld identified three <span class="underline">principal</span> locations of paintings in the caves of western Europe: (1) in <span class="underline">obviously</span> inhabited rock shelters and cave entrances; (2) in galleries immediately off the inhabited areas of caves; and (3) in the <span class="underline">inner</span> reaches of caves, whose difficulty of <span class="underline">access</span> has been interpreted by some as a sign that magical-religious activities were performed there.</p>
          <p>The subjects of the paintings are mostly animals. The paintings rest on <span class="underline">bare</span> walls, with no backdrops or <span class="underline">environmental</span> trappings. Perhaps, like many <span class="underline">contemporary</span> peoples, Upper <span class="underline">Paleolithic</span> men and women believed that the drawing of a human <span class="underline">image</span> could cause death or injury, and if that were indeed their belief, it might explain why human figures are <span class="underline">rarely</span> depicted in cave art.
Another explanation for the <span class="underline">focus</span> on animals might be that these people sought to <span class="underline">improve</span> their luck at hunting.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>This <span class="underline">theory</span> is suggested by <span class="underline">evidence</span> of chips in the painted figures, perhaps made by spears thrown at the drawings.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>But if improving their hunting luck was the <span class="underline">chief</span> <span class="underline">motivation</span> for the paintings, it is difficult to explain why only a few show signs of having been speared.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>Perhaps the paintings were inspired by the need to increase the <span class="underline">supply</span> of animals. Cave art seems to have reached a <span class="underline">peak</span> toward the end of the Upper <span class="underline">Paleolithic</span> period, when the herds of game were decreasing.  <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p>
          <p>The <span class="underline">particular</span> <span class="underline">symbolic</span> <span class="underline">significance</span> of the cave paintings in southwestern France is more explicitly revealed, perhaps, by the results of a study conducted by researchers Patricia Rice and Ann Paterson. The <span class="underline">data</span> they present suggest that the animals portrayed in the cave paintings were mostly the ones that the painters preferred for meat and for materials such as hides. For example, wild <span class="underline">cattle</span> (bovines) and horses are portrayed more often than we would <span class="underline">expect</span> by <span class="underline">chance</span>, probably because they were larger and heavier (meatier) than other animals in the environment. In <span class="underline">addition</span>, the paintings mostly <span class="underline">portray</span> animals that the painters may have feared the most because of their size, speed, natural weapons such as tusks and horns, and the unpredictability of their <span class="underline">behavior</span>. That is, mammoths, bovines, and horses are portrayed more often than deer and reindeer. Thus, the paintings are <span class="underline">consistent</span> with the idea that the art is related to the importance of hunting in the <span class="underline">economy</span> of Upper <span class="underline">Paleolithic</span> people. <span class="underline">Consistent</span> with this idea, according to the investigators, is the fact that the art of the cultural period that followed the Upper <span class="underline">Paleolithic</span> also seems to <span class="underline">reflect</span> how people got their food. But in that period, when getting food no longer depended on hunting large game animals (because they were becoming <span class="underline">extinct</span>), the art ceased to <span class="underline">focus</span> on portrayals of animals.</p>
          <p>Upper <span class="underline">Paleolithic</span> art was not confined to cave paintings. Many shafts of spears and <span class="underline">similar</span> objects were decorated with figures of animals. The <span class="underline">anthropologist</span> Alexander Marshack has an interesting <span class="underline">interpretation</span> of some of the engravings made during the Upper <span class="underline">Paleolithic</span>. He believes that as far back as 30,000 B.C., hunters may have used a system of <span class="underline">notation</span>, engraved on bone and stone, to mark phases of the Moon. If this is true, it would mean that Upper <span class="underline">Paleolithic</span> people were <span class="underline">capable</span> of <span class="underline">complex</span> thought and were <span class="underline">consciously</span> <span class="underline">aware</span> of their environment. In <span class="underline">addition</span> to other artworks, figurines representing the human <span class="underline">female</span> in exaggerated form have also been found at Upper <span class="underline">Paleolithic</span> sites. It has been suggested that these figurines were an <span class="underline">ideal</span> type or an expression of a <span class="underline">desire</span> for <span class="underline">fertility</span>.</p>
