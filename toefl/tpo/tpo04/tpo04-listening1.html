He does not know the publication date of some reviews he needs.</p><p>B. He does not know the location of the library's videos collection of plays.</p><p>C. He does not know how to find out where the play is currently being performed.</p><p>D. He does not know how to determine which newspaper he should look at.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="AD"><p>There are two direct reasons to draw students from the first set of dialogues. One is to find a review, and the other is not to know which newspaper to start with. BC is an irrelevant option.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the woman imply about critical reaction to the play Happy Strangers?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Negative critical reaction led to its content being revised after it premiered.</p><p>B. The play has always been quite popular among university students.</p><p>C. Reactions to the play are more positive nowadays than they were in the past.</p><p>D. The play is rarely performed nowadays because critics have never liked it.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>From the comparison of the current attitude of the people with the past, it can be known that the attitude of the people is now much more positive than before. B is obviously contrary to the fact that D is somewhat confusing, but it can be seen that the attitude of critics has also changed, so the word Never is wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>What does the woman say about her experience seeing a performance of Happy Strangers when she was younger?Click on 2 answers.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It was the first play she had seen performed professionally.</p><p>B. She saw it against the wishes of her parents.</p><p>C. She was surprised at how traditional the performance was.</p><p>D. She had a variety of emotional reactions to the play.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="AD"><p>My first time corresponds to the A option, while funny, but I remember crying echoes the D option.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the man's attitude toward his current assignment?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. He is not confident that he will find the materials he needs.</p><p>B. He feels that performing in a play is less boring than reading one.</p><p>C. He thinks his review of the play will be more objective than the contemporary reviews were.</p><p>D. He is optimistic that he will learn to appreciate the play he is researching.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>I think from the student that he will have a better Idea, he is still very optimistic. From this sentence you can refute A. And B in the story doesn't progress in any sort of logical matter, doesn't have real ending either, just stops. Honestly, you know, I thought it was kind of slow and boring. .</p></div></div><div class="replay" id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the woman say this?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To ask the man to clarify his request.</p><p>B. To state the man's request more precisely.</p><p>C. To make sure that she heard the man correctly.</p><p>D. To correct a mistake the man has made.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>From the student's answer, we can see that woman wants to narrow down the scope of the search. The specific name is therefore B. She did not correct any problems with this guy, so D was wrong.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
