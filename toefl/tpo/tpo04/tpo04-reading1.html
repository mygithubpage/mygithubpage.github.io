The black-tailed deer, a <span class="highlight">lowland</span>, west-side <span class="highlight">cousin</span> of the mule deer of eastern Washington, is now the most <span class="highlight">common</span>. The other <span class="highlight">species</span>, the Columbian white-tailed deer, in earlier times was <span class="highlight">common</span> in the open <span class="highlight">prairie</span> country; it is now <span class="highlight">restricted</span> to the low, <span class="highlight">marshy</span> islands and flood plains <span class="highlight">along</span> the <span class="highlight">lower</span> Columbia River.</p><p>Nearly any kind of plant of the forest <span class="highlight">understory</span> can be part of a deer's <span class="highlight">diet</span>. Where the forest <span class="question3">inhibits</span> the growth of grass and other <span class="highlight">meadow</span> plants,
 the black-tailed deer browses on huckleberry, salal, dogwood, and almost any other <span class="highlight">shrub</span> or <span class="highlight">herb</span>. But this is fair-weather feeding. What keeps the black-tailed deer alive in the harsher seasons of plant <span class="highlight">decay</span> and <span class="highlight">dormancy</span>? One <span class="highlight">compensation</span> for not hibernating is the built-in <span class="highlight">urge</span> to <span class="highlight">migrate</span>.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>Deer may move from high-elevation <span class="highlight">browse</span> areas in summer down to the <span class="highlight">lowland</span> areas in late fall. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span><span class="highlight">Even</span> with snow on the ground, the high bushy <span class="highlight">understory</span> is <span class="highlight">exposed</span>; 
 also snow and wind bring down leafy branches of cedar, hemlock, red <span class="highlight">alder</span>, and other <span class="highlight">arboreal</span> fodder.</p><p><span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>The numbers of deer have fluctuated <span class="highlight">markedly</span> since the <span class="highlight">entry</span> of Europeans into Puget <span class="highlight">Sound</span> country.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>The early explorers and settlers told of <span class="highlight">abundant</span> deer in the early 1800s and yet almost <span class="question4">in the same breath</span> bemoaned the <span class="highlight">lack</span> of this succulent game animal.
Famous explorers of the north American <span class="highlight">frontier</span>, Lewis and Clark arrived at the mouth of the Columbia River on November 14, 1805, in nearly starved circumstances. They had experienced great difficulty finding game west of the Rockies and not until the <span class="highlight">second</span> of December did they kill their first elk. To keep 40 people alive that winter,
they consumed <span class="highlight">approximately</span> 150 elk and 20 deer. And when game moved out of the lowlands in early <span class="highlight">spring</span>, the <span class="highlight">expedition</span> decided to return east rather than face possible <span class="highlight">starvation</span>. Later on in the early years of the nineteenth <span class="highlight">century</span>, when <span class="highlight">Fort</span> Vancouver became the headquarters of the Hudson's Bay <span class="highlight">Company</span>, deer populations continued to <span class="highlight">fluctuate</span>. David Douglas,
Scottish botanical explorer of the 1830s, found a disturbing change in the animal life around the <span class="highlight">fort</span> during the period between his first visit in 1825 and his final <span class="highlight">contact</span> with the <span class="highlight">fort</span> in 1832. A recent Douglas biographer states:" The deer which once picturesquely dotted the meadows around the <span class="highlight">fort</span> were gone [in 1832], hunted to extermination in order to protect the crops.</p><p><span class="highlight">Reduction</span> in numbers of game should have boded ill for their <span class="highlight">survival</span> in later times. A worsening of the <span class="highlight">plight</span> of deer was to be expected as settlers encroached on the land, logging, burning, and clearing, <span class="highlight">eventually</span> replacing a wilderness <span class="highlight">landscape</span> with roads, cities, towns, and factories. No <span class="highlight">doubt</span> the numbers of deer declined still further. <span class="highlight">Recall</span><span class="question7">the fate of the Columbian white-tailed deer</span>, now in a protected <span class="highlight">status</span>. But for the black-tailed deer, human <span class="highlight">pressure</span> has had just the <span class="highlight">opposite</span> effect. Wildlife zoologist Helmut Buechner(1953), in reviewing the nature of biotic changes in Washington <span class="highlight">through</span> recorded time, says that "since the early 1940s, the <span class="highlight">state</span> has had more deer than at any other time in its <span class="highlight">history</span>, the winter <span class="highlight">population</span> fluctuating around <span class="highlight">approximately</span> 320,000 deer (mule and black-tailed deer), which will <span class="highlight">yield</span> about 65,000 of either sex and any age annually for an <span class="question8">indefinite period.</span>"</p><p>The causes of this <span class="highlight">population</span><span class="question10">rebound</span> are consequences of other human actions. First, the <span class="highlight">major</span> predators of deer-wolves, cougar, and lynx-have been greatly reduced in numbers. <span class="highlight">Second</span>, <span class="highlight">conservation</span> has been insured by limiting times for and types of hunting. But the most <span class="highlight">profound</span><span class="highlight">reason</span> for the <span class="highlight">restoration</span> of high <span class="highlight">population</span> numbers has been the fate of the forests. Great tracts of <span class="highlight">lowland</span> country deforested by logging, fire, or both have become <span class="highlight">ideal</span> feeding grounds of deer. <span class="question11">In <span class="highlight">addition</span> to finding an increase of <span class="highlight">suitable</span><span class="highlight">browse</span>, like huckleberry and <span class="highlight">vine</span> maple, Arthur Einarsen, longtime game biologist in the <span class="highlight">Pacific</span> Northwest, found <span class="highlight">quality</span> of <span class="highlight">browse</span> in the open areas to be <span class="highlight">substantially</span> more nutritive.</span> The <span class="highlight">protein</span><span class="highlight">content</span> of shade-grown <span class="highlight">vegetation</span>, for example, was much <span class="highlight">lower</span> than that for plants grown in clearings.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 1, which of the following is true of the white-tailed deer of Puget Sound?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It is native to lowlands and marshes.</p><p>B. It is more closely related to the mule deer of eastern Washington than to other types of deer.</p><p>C. It has replaced the black-tailed deer in the open prairie.</p><p>D. It no longer lives in a particular type of habitat that it once occupied.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>Keywords white-tailed deer Keyword to the last sentence:The other species, the Columbian white-tailed deer, in earlier times was common in the open prairie country; it is now restricted to the low, marshy islands and flood plains along the Lower Columbia River. Said what the white-tailed deer used to be, what the place is now, that is, their living environment has changed, so D is no longer living in the original place. A said that the white-tailed deer now lives in the lowlands and marshes, rather than the origin of the A; the comparative relationship of B is not mentioned in the original; the replacement of C is not mentioned.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>It can be inferred from the discussion in paragraph 2 that winter conditions</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. cause some deer to hibernate</p><p>B. make food unavailable in the highlands for deer</p><p>C. make it easier for deer to locate understory plants</p><p>D. prevent deer from migrating during the winter</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The second-last sentence of the paragraph "Deer may move from high-elevation browse areas in summer down to the lowland areas in late fall." means that in late autumn, the deer may migrate from high-altitude grazing areas in summer to lowland areas. Late autumn is also approaching winter, because the food in the highlands is not enough, so go to the lowlands. Correspond to B option. Many students mistakenly choose C. This class of students should be positioned to the last sentence: Even with snow on the ground, the high bushy understory is exposed; also snow and wind bring down leafy branches of cedar, hemlock, red alder, and other Arboreal fodder said that even if snow covers the ground, a high understory will be exposed (understory refers to the undergrowth), and the wind will be blown down by the leafy branches. Although C mentioned understory, but the easier to say and the original text does not match, the original said that the high understroy will be exposed, there are some limitations, it does not reflect the simpler than before. A in the original object and; D said that the winter migration conflicts with the last fall, but also wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question3">inhibits</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. consists of</p><p>B. combines</p><p>C. restricts</p><p>D. establishes</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" C"><p>Inhibit: Block, block. A is the composition; B is the binding; C is the restriction, the constraint; D is the establishment. According to the word meaning, C is correct. Corresponding to the original: Where the forest <span class="question3">inhibits</span> the growth of grass and other meadow plants, the black-tailed deer browses on huckleberry, salal, dogwood, and almost any other shrub or herb. The latter part says that the deer is eating something else. Without this kind of grass, that is, this kind of grass did not grow up. It was said that how the forest grows, of course, is to stop it. A composition of B is almost the same, and it is not right. D is completely inflexible.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The phrase "<span class="highlight"><span class="question4">in the same breath</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. impatiently</p><p>B. humorously</p><p>C. continuously</p><p>D. immediately</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" D"><p>In the same breath, from the surface, it means that <span class="question4">in the same breath</span>, it can actually guess that the meaning of the text should be simultaneous or immediate, so D is immediately correct. A is impatient; B is humorous; C is continuous; D is immediate. Corresponding to the original: The early explorers and settlers told of abundant deer in the early 1800s and yet almost <span class="question4">in the same breath</span> bemoaned the lack of this succulent game animal. And because there is no deer and sadness, A has no patience B is not humorous and does not fly, C can not continue to express the feelings of disappointment at that time, and there is no information in the original saying that continued sad, wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The author tells the story of the explorers Lewis and Clark in paragraph 3 in order to illustrate which of the following points?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The number of deer within the Puget Sound region has varied over time.</p><p>B. Most of the explorers who came to the Puget Sound area were primarily interested in hunting game.</p><p>C. There was more game for hunting in the East of the United States than in the West.</p><p>D. Individual explorers were not as successful at locating games as were the trading companies.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>Looking at the functional topics, looking ahead, these two individuals are obviously an example of early explorers. After reading the previous sentence, they said that they knew that there were many deer but they could not find it. Obviously this sentence is not enough to be a point of view. Look forward to it. This paragraph of the central sentence:</p><p>The numbers of deer have fluctuated markedly since the entry of Europeans into Puget Sound country.</p><p>The central sentence in this paragraph says that the number of deer changes greatly and corresponds to the variant of A, so A is correct. None of the BCDs mentioned it.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 3, how had Fort Vancouver changed by the time David Douglas returned in 1832?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The fort had become the headquarters for the Hudson's Bay Company.</p><p>B. Deer had begun populating the meadows around the fort.</p><p>C. Deer populations near the fort had been destroyed.</p><p>D. Crop yields in the area around the fort had decreased.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Keyword to the last sentence by name and time: A recent Douglas biographer states:" The deer which once picturesquely dotted the meadows around the fort were gone in 1832, hunted to extermination in order to protect the crops." There are still hunts, so it should be no deer, B said anti, C right; the author just said that the deer was killed in order to protect the crops, did not say that the output of crops rose, D was wrong; A did not say.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the author ask readers to recall "<span class="highlight"><span class="question7">the fate of the Columbian white-tailed deer</span></span>" in the discussion of changes in the wilderness landscape?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To provide support for the idea that habitat destruction would lead to population decline</p><p>B. To compare how two species of deer caused biotic changes in the wilderness environment</p><p>C. To provide an example of a species of deer that has successfully adapted to human settlement</p><p>D. To argue that some deer species must be given a protected status</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" A"><p>The head of the function, looking ahead, the first sentence saying the numbers of deer worse still further, the number of deer further declines, and then let the readers recall the example of the Colombian white-tailed deer, that is, the white-tailed deer is the destruction of the living environment caused by the deer population A proof of decline, so answer A is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The phrase "<span class="highlight">indefinite period</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to period</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. whose end has not been determined</p><p>B. that does not begin when expected</p><p>C. that lasts only briefly</p><p>D. whose importance remains unknown</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="indefinite period A"><p>A indefinite: uncertain. Indefinite period: There is no limit period. B didn't start on schedule. C was very short. D didn't matter and it didn't matter. It wasn't reliable. A answered that the end of the period had not yet been settled. It contained indefinite meaning and was correct.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the following statements about deer populations is supported by the information in paragraph 4?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Deer populations reached their highest point during the 1940s and then began to decline.</p><p>B. The activities of settlers contributed in unexpected ways to the growth of some deer populations in later times.</p><p>C. The cleaning of wilderness land for construction caused biotic changes from which the black-tailed deer population has never recovered.</p><p>D. Since the 1940s the winter populations of deer have fluctuated more than the summer populations have.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B. Ask the entire fourth paragraph, look at the first sentence, and say in the first sentence that the reduction in numbers coincides with the deer population in the question. The decline in the number of deer predicts that their survival will become difficult, but looking at the options found there is no option to coincide with them. , so you can continue to look down, the following will talk about some deer finished, but at the same time some deer population is prosperous. Among the many answers, only B said that the number of deer increases, so the answer is B. Of course, you can also exclude the law, A option about the 1940s originally said early 1940s, 1940s with the answer is not the same, wrong; C said that the black-tailed deer did not, just the opposite of the original black-tailed deer increase, wrong; the original no contrast between winter and summer, D wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question10">rebound</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. decline</p><p>B. recovery</p><p>C. exchange</p><p>D. movement</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>B rendezvous: <span class="question10">rebound</span>. A is a drop; B is a recovery; C is a swap; D is a move. According to the word meaning, the correct answer is B.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Arthur Einarsen's longtime family with the Pacific Northwest helped him discover areas where deer had an increase in suitable browse.</p><p>B. Arthur Einarsen found that deforested feeding grounds provided deer with more and better food.</p><p>C. Biologist like Einarsen believe it is important to find additional open areas with suitable browse for deer to inhabit.</p><p>D. According to Einarsen, huckleberry and vine maple are examples of vegetation that may someday improve the nutrition of deer in the open areas of the Pacific Northwest.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B: The two examples in addition to the part and the back of the example are all very minor information and can be ignored. The trunk section is abbreviated, and after removing some of the modifications, it becomes: AE found that the browse in open areas is more nutritious. Longtime there is a modification of this person (appositional component). Option B repeats the main content. A wrong attention to arbitrarily tamper with the statement, the original sentence did not mention the family of this person at all; C is wrong at the biologist like E, which changes the subject of the original text, and it is important that the original sentence did not say; D the non-artificial part of the original text The backbone of the sentences that were promoted as rewritten, the structure changed, and the main contents were left out.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the following is NOT mentioned in paragraph 5 as a factor that has increased deer populations?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. A reduction in the number of predators</p><p>B. Restrictions on hunting</p><p>C. The effects of logging and fire</p><p>D. Laws that protected feeding grounds of deer</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D, elimination method, the first sentence of the original text says that this section mainly explains why the number of deer populations increases, and then uses first, second, and but the most to indicate three reasons, corresponding to option A/B/C options, respectively. So D is not saying, choose D.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>There food is available and accessible throughout the winter..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B has three points. First, the adverb there refers to a place, so there must be a place before the correct insertion point. From this point of view, only B and D are possible; the second and third points are two of the sentences to be inserted. The terms food and winter are based on the principle of noun overlapping in the upper and lower sentences, and B-to-D.</p></div></div><div id="question14" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>Deer in the Puget Sound area eat a wide variety of foods and migrate seasonally to find food.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.The balance of deer species in the Puget Sound region has changed over time, with the Columbian white-tailed deer now outnumbering other types of deer.</p><p>B.Deer populations naturally fluctuate, but early settlers in the Puget Sound environment caused an overall decline in the deer populations of the areas at that time.</p><p>C.In the long term, black-tailed deer in the Puget Sound area have benefitted from human activities through the elimination of their natural predators, and more and better food in deforested areas.</p><p>D.Because Puget Sound deer migrate, it was and still remains difficult to determine accurately how many deer are living at any one time in the western United States.</p><p>E.Although it was believed that human settlement of the American West would cause the total number of deer to decrease permanently, the opposite has occurred for certain types of deer.</p><p>F.Wildlife biologists have long been concerned that the loss of forests may create nutritional deficiencies for deer.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="BCE"><p>The first sentence of the balance option is correct, but the latter half of the sentence is contrary to the last two sentences of the first paragraph. It should be more than black and wrong.</p><p>The Deer populations option corresponds to the first sentence of the third paragraph of the original text and the second three sentences of the fourth paragraph, correct. The in the long term option corresponds to the first sentence of the fifth paragraph of the original text, the second sentence and the fourth sentence, correct. Because option is too detailed, don't choose. The although option corresponds to the first sentence and the fifth sentence of the fourth paragraph of the original text, correct. The native option did not mention the original, wrong.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
