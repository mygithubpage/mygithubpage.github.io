            <b>Deer Populations of the Puget Sound</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>Two <span class="underline">species</span> of deer have been <span class="underline">prevalent</span> in the Puget <span class="underline">Sound</span> area of Washington <span class="underline">State</span> in the <span class="underline">Pacific</span> Northwest of the United States. The black-tailed deer, a <span class="underline">lowland</span>, west-side <span class="underline">cousin</span> of the mule deer of eastern Washington, is now the most <span class="underline">common</span>. The other <span class="underline">species</span>, the Columbian white-tailed deer, in earlier times was <span class="underline">common</span> in the open <span class="underline">prairie</span> country; it is now <span class="underline">restricted</span> to the low, <span class="underline">marshy</span> islands and flood plains <span class="underline">along</span> the <span class="underline">lower</span> Columbia River.</p>
          <p>Nearly any kind of plant of the forest <span class="underline">understory</span> can be part of a deer's <span class="underline">diet</span>. Where the forest inhibits the growth of grass and other <span class="underline">meadow</span> plants,
 the black-tailed deer browses on huckleberry, salal, dogwood, and almost any other <span class="underline">shrub</span> or <span class="underline">herb</span>. But this is fair-weather feeding. What keeps the black-tailed deer alive in the harsher seasons of plant <span class="underline">decay</span> and <span class="underline">dormancy</span>? One <span class="underline">compensation</span> for not hibernating is the built-in <span class="underline">urge</span> to <span class="underline">migrate</span>.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>Deer may move from high-elevation <span class="underline">browse</span> areas in summer down to the <span class="underline">lowland</span> areas in late fall. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> <span class="underline">Even</span> with snow on the ground, the high bushy <span class="underline">understory</span> is <span class="underline">exposed</span>; 
 also snow and wind bring down leafy branches of cedar, hemlock, red <span class="underline">alder</span>, and other <span class="underline">arboreal</span> fodder.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C">
            </span>The numbers of deer have fluctuated <span class="underline">markedly</span> since the <span class="underline">entry</span> of Europeans into Puget <span class="underline">Sound</span> country.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>The early explorers and settlers told of <span class="underline">abundant</span> deer in the early 1800s and yet almost in the same breath bemoaned the <span class="underline">lack</span> of this succulent game animal.
Famous explorers of the north American <span class="underline">frontier</span>, Lewis and Clark arrived at the mouth of the Columbia River on November 14, 1805, in nearly starved circumstances. They had experienced great difficulty finding game west of the Rockies and not until the <span class="underline">second</span> of December did they kill their first elk. To keep 40 people alive that winter,
they consumed <span class="underline">approximately</span> 150 elk and 20 deer. And when game moved out of the lowlands in early <span class="underline">spring</span>, the <span class="underline">expedition</span> decided to return east rather than face possible <span class="underline">starvation</span>. Later on in the early years of the nineteenth <span class="underline">century</span>, when <span class="underline">Fort</span> Vancouver became the headquarters of the Hudson's Bay <span class="underline">Company</span>, deer populations continued to <span class="underline">fluctuate</span>. David Douglas,
Scottish botanical explorer of the 1830s, found a disturbing change in the animal life around the <span class="underline">fort</span> during the period between his first visit in 1825 and his final <span class="underline">contact</span> with the <span class="underline">fort</span> in 1832. A recent Douglas biographer states:" The deer which once picturesquely dotted the meadows around the <span class="underline">fort</span> were gone [in 1832], hunted to extermination in order to protect the crops.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="underline">Reduction</span> in numbers of game should have boded ill for their <span class="underline">survival</span> in later times. A worsening of the <span class="underline">plight</span> of deer was to be expected as settlers encroached on the land, logging, burning, and clearing, <span class="underline">eventually</span> replacing a wilderness <span class="underline">landscape</span> with roads, cities, towns, and factories. No <span class="underline">doubt</span> the numbers of deer declined still further. <span class="underline">Recall</span> the fate of the Columbian white-tailed deer, now in a protected <span class="underline">status</span>. But for the black-tailed deer, human <span class="underline">pressure</span> has had just the <span class="underline">opposite</span> effect. Wildlife zoologist Helmut Buechner(1953), in reviewing the nature of biotic changes in Washington <span class="underline">through</span> recorded time, says that "since the early 1940s, the <span class="underline">state</span> has had more deer than at any other time in its <span class="underline">history</span>, the winter <span class="underline">population</span> fluctuating around <span class="underline">approximately</span> 320,000 deer (mule and black-tailed deer), which will <span class="underline">yield</span> about 65,000 of either sex and any age annually for an indefinite period."</p>
          <p>The causes of this <span class="underline">population</span> rebound are consequences of other human actions. First, the <span class="underline">major</span> predators of deer-wolves, cougar, and lynx-have been greatly reduced in numbers. <span class="underline">Second</span>, <span class="underline">conservation</span> has been insured by limiting times for and types of hunting. But the most <span class="underline">profound</span> <span class="underline">reason</span> for the <span class="underline">restoration</span> of high <span class="underline">population</span> numbers has been the fate of the forests. Great tracts of <span class="underline">lowland</span> country deforested by logging, fire, or both have become <span class="underline">ideal</span> feeding grounds of deer. In <span class="underline">addition</span> to finding an increase of <span class="underline">suitable</span> <span class="underline">browse</span>, like huckleberry and <span class="underline">vine</span> maple, Arthur Einarsen, longtime game biologist in the <span class="underline">Pacific</span> Northwest, found <span class="underline">quality</span> of <span class="underline">browse</span> in the open areas to be <span class="underline">substantially</span> more nutritive. The <span class="underline">protein</span> <span class="underline">content</span> of shade-grown <span class="underline">vegetation</span>, for example, was much <span class="underline">lower</span> than that for plants grown in clearings.</p>
