When I was in high school, my father always cooked noodles for me at night. Every day after evening self-study classes, I came home and had the noodles. The noodles were delicious, coz you know, after long-time study, it's easy to be tired and hungry. So the first thing I did when I got home at that time was to eat noodles. Sometimes, my father would add beef to the noodles and beef is kind of my favorite meat. The most important ingredient of the noodles is the specially-made sauce. Sadly, I don't know how exactly my father makes the sauce. But whenever I go back home, I need to have the noodles cooked by my father.</p></article></div></main></body></html>
