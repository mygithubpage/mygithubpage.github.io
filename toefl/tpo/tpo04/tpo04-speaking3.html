The proposal to add the classes is a response to student complaints that daytime computer classes have become increasingly overcrowded and there are no longer enough computers available. The department has decided that despite some added expense, the most cost-effective way of addressing this problem is by adding computer classes in the evening. It is hoped that this change will decrease the number of students enrolled in day classes and thus guarantee individual access to computers for all students in computer classes.</p></article><div><audio src="tpo04-speaking3.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></div><article id="listening-passage" class="passage"><h3>Listening Text</h3><p>Now listen to two students discussing the article.</p><p>(man) I just don't think this will work.</p><p>(woman) Why not?</p><p>(man) Because it's not gonna solve the problem. <b>Students are busy at night, I mean, we have jobs, families, clubs, social events.

Explain the man's opinion of the change and the reasons he gives for holding that opinion. </p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>Well, the man is strongly against the changing plan for two main reasons. First, he insists that most of the students are busy at night with such as jobs, families, clubs and so on, so they won't be able to make good use of the added class anyway. Second, he believes that the idea of hiring more teachers to keep the academic building open later at night would be a bad idea. Since the computer prices have been reduced, it's surely cheaper to invest in more computers. More importantly there is enough space in the building for holding more computers. So the man disagrees with the plan for the reasons stated above. (110 words)</p></article><article class="response"><h4>My Response</h4><p>The man is against the schedule change for two main reasons.
