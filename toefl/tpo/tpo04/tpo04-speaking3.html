The proposal to add the classes is a response to student complaints that daytime computer classes have become increasingly overcrowded and there are no longer enough computers available. The department has decided that despite some added expense, the most cost-effective way of addressing this problem is by adding computer classes in the evening. It is hoped that this change will decrease the number of students enrolled in day classes and thus guarantee individual access to computers for all students in computer classes.</p></article></section><div><audio src="tpo04-speaking3.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></div><section id="listening-text"><h3>Listening Text</h3><article><p>Now listen to two students discussing the article.</p><p>(man) I just don't think this will work.</p><p>(woman) Why not?</p><p>(man) Because it's not gonna solve the problem. Students are busy at night, I mean, we have jobs, families, clubs, social events. Most of us already have something to do every single night of the week.</p><p>(woman) I see your point. I sure couldn't fit anything into my schedule during the week. I've got swimming practice most nights.</p><p>(man) Right! And as far as expense goes, I think they're going about it the wrong way. I mean, it cost money to hire more teachers and keep the academic building open later, which is a lot more expensive than simply just buying more computers.</p><p>(woman) More computers?</p><p>(man) That's right! Computer prices have come way down the past few years. So the department won't have to spend as much now as they did in the past. Besides, the computer department classrooms, you know, the rooms themselves, they are actually very big, there's plenty of space to add more computers.</p></article></section><section id="question"><h4>Question</h4><p>The computer department is considering a scheduling change. Explain the man's opinion of the change and the reasons he gives for holding that opinion. </p></section><section id="sample-response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><article><p>Well, the man is strongly against the changing plan for two main reasons. First, he insists that most of the students are busy at night with such as jobs, families, clubs and so on, so they won't be able to make good use of the added class anyway. Second, he believes that the idea of hiring more teachers to keep the academic building open later at night would be a bad idea. Since the computer prices have been reduced, it's surely cheaper to invest in more computers. More importantly there is enough space in the building for holding more computers. So the man disagrees with the plan for the reasons stated above. (110 words)</p></article></section></main></body></html>
