        <h3>Listening Text</h3>
        <article>
          <p>Now listen to a conversation between two students on campus.</p>
          <p>(man) Hi, good morning. Could you help me with something?</p>
          <p>(woman) Uh, maybe, what's up?(man) Well, I'm a first-year student.</p>
          <p>(woman) Everything going OK?(man) Actually, no. Um, this is a little embarrassing. I think I left my class schedule back at my dorm.</p>
          <p>(woman) Hmmm, not a good thing to do on the first day of classes.</p>
          <p>(man) Yeah, so I'm not sure where my class is, I think I remember it was supposed to be here in Smith Hall.</p>
          <p>(woman) There's a computer for student use in the Student Center. You can go over there, look it up and check the room number. But you'd have to hurry.</p>
          <p>(man) Hmmm, that's not a bad idea. I could check my schedule for the whole rest of the day at the same time. I don't know where any of my other classes are either, but I don't want to be late, make a bad impression with the professor on the first day. It's actually my very first class, Introduction to Psychology.</p>
          <p>(woman) Psychology? Oh, OK, you're definitely in the right building. And if it's Introduction to Psychology, it's gonna be a big class. In which case, it probably meets in a big lecture hall. Ther e are only three lecture halls in the building, one on every floor. Just check each floor till you find yours. There's elevators so you should be able to move fast.</p>
          <p>(man) Yeah, but I don't know what the professor looks like or anything. How would I know it's my class or not? It'd be sort of embarrassing, sticking my head into each lecture hall asking if I was in the right place.</p>
          <p>(woman) Well, you might luck out and find it the first time."</p>

          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>The man's problem is that as a freshman he couldn't find his way to his class because he left his class schedule in his dorm. Accordingly the woman offers two solutions for the man: first he could go to the student center to check the room number for his class on a computer. Second he could try his luck checking every room for his class in this building. Well, in such a dilemma I think the man should go straight to the student center to check his classroom because the student center is not too far from where he stays and he will definitely get precise information on the computer. If he hurries he will just be on time. Secondly, checking each room would be rude and abrupt and more importantly time-wasting, especially for such a huge building: the right room could be the last room he tries in this building and he could probably be late. So I agree that the man should go to the student center to check information up. (174 words)</p>

          <h4>My Response</h4>
          <p>The man left his class schedule in his dorm and he didn't where his class is. there are two solutions. first he could go to the student center to check the room number for his class on a computer. Second he could checking every room for his class in this building. I recommend second solutions. because the class is a big class. so they are probably in the lecture hall, and there are only a few lecture hall in this building. so he can find the class very quickly. besides, if he go to the student center and don't know how to use the computer to find his class, he will end up late for his class. </p>
