The question needs to correspond to the information in the text and the table option. This statement by Professor But that's called 'redirecting' indicates that the animal's act of attacking a plant or animal rather than its enemy is not a displacement activity. The second act echoes the behavior described by the original Carol, and the professor recognizes that this behavior is displacement.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor say about disinhibition?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It can prevent displacement activities from occurring.</p><p>B. It can cause animals to act on more than one drive at a time.</p><p>C. It is not useful for explaining many types of displacement activities.</p><p>D. It is responsible for the appearance of seemingly irrelevant behavior.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>This sentence first mentioned the definition of disinhibition, and later said that this is what we call "Disinhibition". It is easy to listen, but the content before this is the answer. Obviously there is no role of prevent displacement activities, so A is wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the lecture, what is one possible reason that displacement activities are often grooming behaviors?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Grooming may cause an enemy or predator to be confused.</p><p>B. Grooming is a convenient and accessible behavior.</p><p>C. Grooming often occurs before eating and drinking.</p><p>D. Grooming is a common social activity.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>From the grooming is like one of the most accessible things an animal can do, it can be inferred that the grooming is very convenient. From the following contents, it can be judged that it is related to food and has nothing to do with enemy. A mistake.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor mention the wood thrush?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To contrast its displacement activities with those of other animals species.</p><p>B. To explain that some animals display displacement activities other than grooming.</p><p>C. To point out how displacement activities are influenced by the environment.</p><p>D. To give an example of a n animal that does not display displacement activities.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Pro's reference to woodtrash was for the sake of example, and the purpose of the example was to prove that the environment would affect the animal's displacement activities. There is no comparison between displacement activities and gromming. So B is wrong.</p></div></div><div class="replay" id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor mean when she says this?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. She is impressed by how much the student knows about redirecting.</p><p>B. She thinks it is time to move on to the next part of this lectures.</p><p>C. The student's answer is not an example of a displacement activity.</p><p>D. The student should suggest a different animal behavior to discuss next.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Pro finished this sentence and began to introduce it to the next session of this class. Pro said that the purpose of this sentence is to prompt the student that she is about to go to the next session of this class.
