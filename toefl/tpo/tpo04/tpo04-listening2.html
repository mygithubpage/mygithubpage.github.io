              <span class="time" data-times="4.24" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in a <span class="underline">biology</span> class. <span class="time" data-times="3.28" data-time="4.24">[00:04.24]</span>The class is discussing animal <span class="underline">behavior</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.91" data-time="7.52">[00:07.52]</span>Professor: Ok, the next kind of animal <span class="underline">behavior</span> I want to talk about might be <span class="underline">familiar</span> to you. <span class="time" data-times="16.25" data-time="15.43">[00:15.43]</span>You may have seen, for example, a bird that's in the middle of a mating <span class="underline">ritual</span>, and suddenly it stops and preens, you know, takes a few moments to straighten its feathers, and then returns to the mating <span class="underline">ritual</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9.01" data-time="31.68">[00:31.68]</span>This kind of <span class="underline">behavior</span>, this doing something that seems completely out of place, is what we call a '<span class="underline">Displacement</span> <span class="underline">Activity</span>'. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.8" data-time="40.69">[00:40.69]</span>
              <span class="underline">Displacement</span> activities are activities that animal's <span class="underline">engaging</span> in when they have conflicting drives. <span class="time" data-times="6.98" data-time="49.49">[00:49.49]</span>If we take our example from a <span class="underline">minute</span> ago, if the bird is afraid of its <span class="underline">mate</span>, it's conflicted. <span class="time" data-times="5.82" data-time="56.47">[00:56.47]</span>It wants to <span class="underline">mate</span> but it's also afraid and wants to run away. <span class="time" data-times="3.65" data-time="62.29">[01:02.29]</span>So, <span class="underline">instead</span>, it starts grooming itself. <span class="time" data-times="9.73" data-time="65.94">[01:05.94]</span>So, the <span class="underline">displacement</span> <span class="underline">activity</span>, the grooming, the straightening of its feathers, seems to be an irrelevant <span class="underline">behavior</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.96" data-time="75.67">[01:15.67]</span>So, what do you think another example of a <span class="underline">displacement</span> <span class="underline">activity</span> might be? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.6" data-time="82.63">[01:22.63]</span>Karl: How about an animal that, um, <span class="underline">instead</span> of fighting its enemy or running away, it attacks a plant or a <span class="underline">bush</span>? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.33" data-time="90.23">[01:30.23]</span>Professor: That's really good suggestion, Karl. <span class="time" data-times="2.24" data-time="92.56">[01:32.56]</span>But that's called 'redirecting'. <span class="time" data-times="8.17" data-time="94.8">[01:34.80]</span>The animal is redirecting its <span class="underline">behavior</span> to another object, in this case, the plant or the <span class="underline">bush</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.47" data-time="102.97">[01:42.97]</span>But that's not an irrelevant or <span class="underline">inappropriate</span> <span class="underline">behavior</span>. <span class="time" data-times="1.93" data-time="107.44">[01:47.44]</span>The <span class="underline">behavior</span> makes <span class="underline">sense</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.67" data-time="109.37">[01:49.37]</span>It's <span class="underline">appropriate</span> under the circumstances. <span class="time" data-times="4.67" data-time="112.04">[01:52.04]</span>But what doesn't make <span class="underline">sense</span> is the object the <span class="underline">behavior</span>'s directed towards. <span class="time" data-times="3.3" data-time="116.71">[01:56.71]</span>Ok, who else? Carol? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="11.82" data-time="120.01">[02:00.01]</span>Carol: I think I read in another class about an experiment where an object that the animal was afraid of was put next to its food – next to the animal's food. <span class="time" data-times="9.36" data-time="131.83">[02:11.83]</span>And the animal, it was conflicted between confronting the object and eating the food, so <span class="underline">instead</span>, it just fell asleep. <span class="time" data-times="0.92" data-time="141.19">[02:21.19]</span>Like that? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.14" data-time="142.11">[02:22.11]</span>Professor: That's exactly what I mean. <span class="time" data-times="9.92" data-time="144.25">[02:24.25]</span> <span class="underline">Displacement</span> occurs because the animal's got two conflicting drives – two <span class="underline">competing</span> urges, in this case, fear and hunger. <span class="time" data-times="16.03" data-time="154.17">[02:34.17]</span>And what happens is, they <span class="underline">inhibit</span> each other, they <span class="underline">cancel</span> each other out in a way, and a third seemingly irrelevant <span class="underline">behavior</span> surfaces <span class="underline">through</span> a <span class="underline">process</span> that we call 'Disinhibition'. <span class="time" data-times="10.6" data-time="170.2">[02:50.20]</span>Now in disinhibition, the <span class="underline">basic</span> idea is that two drives that <span class="underline">seem</span> to <span class="underline">inhibit</span>, to hold back, a third <span class="underline">drive</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.93" data-time="180.8">[03:00.80]</span>Or, well, they're getting in a way of each other in a... in a <span class="underline">conflict</span> situation and somehow lose control, <span class="time" data-times="11.45" data-time="188.73">[03:08.73]</span>lose their inhibiting effect on that third <span class="underline">behavior</span>, which means that the third <span class="underline">drive</span> surfaces, it's expressed in the animal's <span class="underline">behavior</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9.3" data-time="200.18">[03:20.18]</span>Now, these <span class="underline">displacement</span> activities can include feeding, drinking, grooming, <span class="underline">even</span> sleeping. <span class="time" data-times="2.94" data-time="209.48">[03:29.48]</span>These are what we call 'Comfort <span class="underline">Behavior</span>'. <span class="time" data-times="7.34" data-time="212.42">[03:32.42]</span>So why do you think <span class="underline">displacement</span> activities are so often comfort behaviors, such as grooming? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.01" data-time="219.76">[03:39.76]</span>Karl: Maybe because it's easy for them to do? <span class="time" data-times="5.99" data-time="221.77">[03:41.77]</span>I mean, grooming is like one of the most <span class="underline">accessible</span> things an animal can do. <span class="time" data-times="11.08" data-time="227.76">[03:47.76]</span>It's something they do all the time, and they have the <span class="underline">stimulus</span> right there on the outside of their bodies in order to do the grooming, or if food is right in front of them. <span class="time" data-times="4.18" data-time="238.84">[03:58.84]</span>Basically, they don't have to think very much about those behaviors. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7" data-time="243.02">[04:03.02]</span>Carol: Professor, isn't it possible that animals <span class="underline">groom</span> because they've got messed up a little from fighting or mating? <span class="time" data-times="10.13" data-time="250.02">[04:10.02]</span>I mean if a bird's feathers get ruffled or an animal's <span class="underline">fur</span>, maybe it's not so strange for them to stop and tidy themselves up at that point. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.31" data-time="260.15">[04:20.15]</span>Professor: That's another possible <span class="underline">reason</span> although it doesn't necessarily explain other behaviors such as eating, drinking or sleeping. <span class="time" data-times="10.82" data-time="267.46">[04:27.46]</span> What's interesting is that studies have been done that suggest that the animal's environment may play a part in determining what kind of <span class="underline">behavior</span> it displays. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.28" data-time="278.28">[04:38.28]</span>For example, there's a bird, the 'wood thrush', anyway, when the 'wood thrush' is in an attack-escape <span class="underline">conflict</span>, <span class="time" data-times="12.07" data-time="286.56">[04:46.56]</span>that is, it's caught between the two urges to <span class="underline">escape</span> from or to attack an enemy, if it's sitting on a <span class="underline">horizontal</span> <span class="underline">branch</span>, it'll <span class="underline">wipe</span> its <span class="underline">beak</span> on its <span class="underline">perch</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.15" data-time="298.63">[04:58.63]</span>If it's sitting on a <span class="underline">vertical</span> <span class="underline">branch</span>, it'll <span class="underline">groom</span> its breast feathers. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="303.78">[05:03.78]</span>The <span class="underline">immediate</span> environment of the bird, its <span class="underline">immediate</span>, um, its relationship to its <span class="underline">immediate</span> environment seems to play a part in which <span class="underline">behavior</span> will <span class="underline">display</span>. </p>
