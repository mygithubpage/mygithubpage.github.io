          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="8.52" data-time="16.77">[00:16.77]</span>Well, while there is an element of luck involved, we have an <span class="highlight">array</span> of high-tech tools to help us figure out where to concentrate our efforts.</p>

            <span class="time" data-times="6.76" data-time="25.29">[00:25.29]</span>One of the newer tools actually relies on <span class="highlight">particle</span> physics, talk about inter-disciplinary.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.12" data-time="32.05">[00:32.05]</span>Here is a machine that brings together two very different sciences.<span class="time" data-times="3.33" data-time="37.17">[00:37.17]</span>This machine is called a muon detector.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.27" data-time="40.5">[00:40.50]</span>Muons are subatomic particles that result from <span class="highlight">cosmic</span> rays.</p>

            <span class="time" data-times="3.16" data-time="45.77">[00:45.77]</span>OK, let me start over.<span class="time" data-times="3.16" data-time="48.93">[00:48.93]</span> <span class="highlight">Cosmic</span> rays aren't actually rays.<span class="time" data-times="5.07" data-time="52.09">[00:52.09]</span>They are basically protons zipping through outer space at close to light speed.<span class="time" data-times="7.39" data-time="57.16">[00:57.16]</span>And, when they <span class="highlight">collide</span> with the atoms in earth's atmosphere, they break up into smaller particles -- muons.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="7.17" data-time="64.55">[01:04.55]</span>Now these muons are still highly energized, so they can easily pass on down to the earth's surface.<span class="time" data-times="7.53" data-time="71.72">[01:11.72]</span>In fact, they can pass through solid matter, so they can also <span class="highlight">penetrate</span> deep into the surface.<span class="time" data-times="5.72" data-time="79.25">[01:19.25]</span>And it's this property of muons that archaeologists are taking advantage of.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="10.7" data-time="84.97">[01:24.97]</span>Let me explain, with the right kind of equipment, scientists can use muons to create a kind of picture of the structures they are studying.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.19" data-time="95.67">[01:35.67]</span>Let's say we are studying a Mayan <span class="highlight">pyramid</span> in central America.<span class="time" data-times="6.47" data-time="99.86">[01:39.86]</span>And we are interested in finding out if there are <span class="highlight">burial</span> chambers or other rooms inside.<span class="time" data-times="9.51" data-time="106.33">[01:46.33]</span>Well, a muon detector will show a greater number of muons passing through the less <span class="highlight">dense</span> areas inside the <span class="highlight">pyramid</span>.</p>

            <span class="time" data-times="1.32" data-time="115.84">[01:55.84]</span>Yes, Andrew?</p>

            <span class="time" data-times="4.73" data-time="117.16">[01:57.16]</span>Andrew: Um...I'm not sure I get how this muon detector works exactly.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="8.15" data-time="121.89">[02:01.89]</span>Professor: Well, muons lose energy as they pass through <span class="highlight">dense</span> material, like the stone walls of the Mayan <span class="highlight">pyramid</span>.<span class="time" data-times="6.15" data-time="130.04">[02:10.04]</span>So more muons and more energetic muons will be passing through empty spaces.<span class="time" data-times="13.64" data-time="136.19">[02:16.19]</span>The muon detector can <span class="highlight">differentiate</span> the areas where more muons are passing through -- the empty spaces, as well as where there are fewer muons, the walls and <span class="highlight">dense</span> areas.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="10.48" data-time="149.83">[02:29.83]</span>These empty spaces will show up as darker, so we wind up with a kind of picture of the <span class="highlight">pyramid</span>, and its internal structure.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="0.87" data-time="160.31">[02:40.31]</span>Andrew: A picture?</p>

            <span class="time" data-times="3.02" data-time="161.18">[02:41.18]</span>Professor: Sort of like an X-ray image.</p>

            <span class="time" data-times="7.4" data-time="164.2">[02:44.20]</span>Andrew: Ok, so if we see darker areas inside the <span class="highlight">pyramid</span>, we assume it's an empty space with more muons.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="14.15" data-time="171.6">[02:51.60]</span>Professor: Exactly, with this technology, we can see what's inside the structure before we dig, so we know exactly where to explore and we can minimize the damage excavation can cause.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.29" data-time="185.75">[03:05.75]</span>Even a little damage could result in us losing vital information forever.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="7.85" data-time="190.04">[03:10.04]</span>Now, muon detectors have been around for some time, but they have been improved upon since archaeologists started using them.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="8.21" data-time="197.89">[03:17.89]</span>In 1967 a physicist placed a muon detector beneath the base of one of the Egyptian pyramids of Giza.<span class="time" data-times="2.57" data-time="206.1">[03:26.10]</span>And he was looking for <span class="highlight">burial</span> chambers.<span class="time" data-times="4.01" data-time="208.67">[03:28.67]</span>Now it happened that the muon detector found none.<span class="time" data-times="4.42" data-time="212.68">[03:32.68]</span>But he did demonstrate that the <span class="highlight">technique</span> worked.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="7.54" data-time="217.1">[03:37.10]</span>Unfortunately the machine he used was so big that many archaeologists doubted muon detection could be practical.<span class="time" data-times="5.08" data-time="224.64">[03:44.64]</span>How could they get a massive piece of equipment into, say, the jungle of Belize?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.16" data-time="229.72">[03:49.72]</span>Then there was the issue of range.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.75" data-time="232.88">[03:52.88]</span>The machine used in 1967 could only scan for muons directly above it, not from the sides.<span class="time" data-times="5.37" data-time="239.63">[03:59.63]</span>So it actually had to be put underneath the <span class="highlight">pyramid</span>, so it could look up.<span class="time" data-times="8.21" data-time="245">[04:05.00]</span>That meant if you wanted to find out what was inside an ancient structure, you first had to bury the detector beneath it.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3" data-time="253.21">[04:13.21]</span>There's been a lot of work on these machines since then.<span class="time" data-times="2.99" data-time="256.21">[04:16.21]</span>And these problems have been solved by and large.<span class="time" data-times="7.57" data-time="259.2">[04:19.20]</span>That's not to say the technology is perfect, it would be nice for example, to have a system that didn't take 6 months to produce an image.<span class="time" data-times="5.2" data-time="266.77">[04:26.77]</span>I suppose that's better than the year it took for the 1967 study to get results.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="8.8" data-time="271.97">[04:31.97]</span>But still...well, there is good reason to believe that with better equipment, we're going to see muon detectors used much more frequently.<span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="280.77">[04:40.77]</span>They are already being used in other areas of science, for example Japanese scientists studying the <span class="highlight">interior</span> of volcanoes, and there are plenty of archaeologists who would love to use this technology.</p>

And, when they collide with the atoms in earth's atmosphere, they break up into -- muons. Analysis: This question is the main topic of the content. What do the questions ask about this speech? From the point of view, the article first mentioned the meson detector, and said that archeologists are now using the characteristics of the meson, so this lecture is mainly to tell us the benefits of the meson detector to archeology. The D option is correct. The meaning of the A option is: misunderstanding of the meson detector, item A. Although misunderstandings are mentioned in the article, this misunderstanding is based on the misunderstanding of the nature of the work of the archaeologists. The meaning of the option is: Using a meson detector to study the pyramids in Egypt. The pyramid is just an example of the original text. In fact, a meson detector can be used not only for the study of pyramids but also for the study of tropical rain forests. Therefore, item B is Not comprehensive, excluded. The C option means: In the development of meson detectors, physicists cooperated with archaeologists. Although physicists and archaeologists were mentioned in the article, they did not say that they were developing meson detectors. Cooperation issues.</p>

Analysis: This question is a detailed question. Ask questions for archeologists. What is the most useful aspect of mesons? From the point of view, mesons can easily pass through the surface of the earth and pass through solid matter. Archeologists are now using this feature of mesons, so the C term is correct. The meaning of the A option is: the ability to carry out outer space information. The original mentions that the meson is a proton that is rapidly operating in outer space at a speed close to the speed of light, but does not mention that it carries outer-space information, so it is excluded; the B option means: The ability to smash outer space rays into smaller particles out of nothing, mesons do not have this ability; D option means: the ability to change the surface color, out of nothing, meson does not have this ability.</p>

              <p>The muon detector can differentiate the areas where more muons should correspond to the original: Professor, Well, muons lose energy as they pass through dense material, like the stone walls of the Mayan pyramid. So more muons and more energetic muons will be passing through empty spaces. Are passing through -- the empty spaces, as well as where there are fewer muons, the walls and dense areas. These empty spaces will show up as darker, so we wind up with a kind of picture of the pyramid, and its internal structure Analysis: This question is a detailed question. The question is asked by the professor. What can the meson detector provide to the ancient structure? From the point of view, the meson detector can distinguish between empty places and walls and places with high density, so it is possible to find the position of the room, in addition to the internal structure. It can be seen that the B item is correct. The meaning of the A option is: the temperature inside the building; the meaning of the C option is: the length of time the building exists; the D option means: the material used in the building. The three terms A, B, and D are not mentioned in the original text and are all excluded.</p>

              <p>Corresponding to the original text: Professor: Exactly, with this technology, we can see what's inside the structure before we dig, so we know exactly where to explore and we can minimize the damage excavation can cause. Even a little damage could result in us losing vital information Forever. Analysis: This question is for organizational structure questions. Why does the professor ask about the damage to archaeological excavation sites? The problem points out that in fact, with the development of science and technology, underground structures can be known before excavation, so that the loss caused by archaeological excavations can be reduced, and this ability is due to meson detectors. That is, the professors' discussion of the dangers of the archaeological sites is to imply the benefits of the meson detectors for archeology. Then item A is correct. The meaning of the B option is: In order to describe an accident caused by a meson detector in the process of pyramid mining, out of nothing, wrong; C option means: In order to explain how the meson detector works in rebuilding a damaged place , not to rebuild, but to avoid damage, it is excluded; D option means: In order to explain why in the past the meson detector is not commonly used, error, the problem is not mentioned, just mentioned later in the meson detector because It is too large to be practical, but this problem has since been solved.</p>

              <p>Correspondence: Unfortunately the machine he used was so big that many archaeologists doubted muon detection could be practical. How could they get a massive piece of equipment into, say, the jungle of Belize? Then there was the issue of range. The machine used In 1967 could only scan for muons directly above it, not from the sides. So it actually had to be put underneath the pyramid, so it could look up. That meant if you wanted to find out what was inside an ancient structure, you first Had to bury the detector beneath it. Analysis: This question is a detailed question. What is the difference between the contemporary meson detector and the 1967 meson detector? There are three different points from the problem point. One is not as large as the original, corresponding to C; the second is that the time to generate the image does not need to be as long as six months, corresponding to D; the third can be scanned from all angles, corresponding E. The meaning of the A option is: the contemporary meson detector is cheaper; the B option means: the contemporary meson detector needs less energy; the two professors A and B did not mention it, belonged to nothing, and were excluded.</p>

              <p>Correspondence: There's been a lot of work on these machines since then. And these problems have been solved by and large. That's not to say the technology is perfect, it would be nice for example, to have a system that didn't take 6 months to produce an image. I suppose that's better than the year it took for the 1967 study to get results. But still...well, there is good reason to believe that with better equipment, we're going to see muon detectors Used are more frequently. They are already being used in other areas of science, for example Japanese scientists studying the interior of volcanoes, and there are are plenty of archaeologists who would love to use this technology. What does the professor think of the new meson detector? In the question, the professor mentioned that the new meson detector had better results than the 1967 study, and the time to generate images was shorter. However, there is still reason to believe that if there are better equipment, we will use it more frequently. Meson detector. This shows that the time to generate the image can be further improved. The answer is A. The meaning of the B option is: She is afraid that many scientific archaeologists will not want to learn how to use them, but the source mentions that a large number of archaeologists have fallen in love with the use of this technology, then B is not correct; C options Means: She feels that they have greater potential for use in the scientific community than in the archaeological community. Professors said that the technology has applications in both archeology and science, but the specific application in a wider area, the author There is no comparison; the D option means that they provide more accurate information about the object age than the older generation of meson detectors, and professors do not mention this issue and are therefore excluded.</p>
