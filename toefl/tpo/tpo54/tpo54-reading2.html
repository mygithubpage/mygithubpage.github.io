One <span class="highlight question1">proposed</span> explanation for this event is that when the first Americans migrated over from Asia, they hunted the megafauna to extinction.These people, known as the Clovis society after a site where their <span class="highlight"><span class="question2">distinctive</span></span><span class="highlight">spear</span> points were first found, would have been able to use this food source to expand their population and fill the continent rapidly.Yet many scientists argue against this "<span class="highlight">Pleistocene</span> overkill" <span class="highlight">hypothesis</span>. <span class="question3">Modern humans</span> have certainly been capable of such <span class="highlight">drastic</span> effects on animals, but could ancient people with little more than stone spears similarly have caused the extinction of numerous species of animals?Thirty-five genera or groups of species (and many individual species) suffered extinction in North America around 11,000 B.C., soon after the appearance and expansion of Paleo-lndians throughout the Americas (27 genera disappeared completely, and another 8 became locally extinct, surviving only outside North America). </p><p><span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>Although the climate changed at the end of the <span class="highlight">Pleistocene</span>, warming trends had happened before. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>A period of massive extinction of large mammals like that seen about 11,000 years ago had not occurred during the previous 400,000 years, despite these changes. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>The only apparently significant difference in the Americas 11,000 years ago was the presence of human hunters of these large mammals. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>Was this <span class="question4">coincidence</span> or cause-and-effect?</p><p>  We do not know.Ecologist Paul S. Martin has championed the model that associates the extinction of large mammals at the end of the <span class="highlight">Pleistocene</span> with human <span class="highlight">predation</span>.With researcher J. E. Mosimann, he has co-authored a work in which a computer model showed that in around 300 years, given the right conditions, a small <span class="highlight">influx</span> of hunters into eastern Beringia 12,000 years ago could have spread across North America in a wave and wiped out game animals to feed their <span class="highlight">burgeoning</span> population. </p><p>  The researchers ran the model several ways, always beginning with a population of 100 humans in Edmonton, in Alberta, Canada, at 11,500 years ago.Assuming different initial North American big-game-animal populations (75-150 million animals) and different population growth rates for the human settlers (0.65%-3.5%), and varying kill rates, Mosimann and Martin derived figures of between 279 and 1,157 years from initial contact to big-game extinction. </p><p>  Many scholars continue to support this <span class="highlight">scenario</span>.For example, <span class="highlight">geologist</span> Larry Agenbroad has mapped the locations of dated Clovis sites alongside the <span class="highlight">distribution</span> of dated sites where the remains of wooly mammoths have been found in both archaeological and purely paleontological contexts.These distributions show <span class="highlight">remarkable</span> synchronicity (<span class="highlight">occurrence</span> at the same time). </p><p>  There are, however, many problems with this model.Significantly, though a few sites are quite impressive, there really is very little archaeological evidence to support it.Writing in 1982, Martin himself <span class="question9">admitted</span> the paucity of evidence;for example, at that point, the remains of only 38 individual mammoths had been found at Clovis sites. In the years since, few additional mammoths have been added to the list;there are still fewer than 20 Clovis sites where the remains of one or more mammoths have been recovered, a <span class="highlight">minuscule</span><span class="highlight">proportion</span> of the millions that necessarily would have had to have been slaughtered within the <span class="highlight">overkill</span><span class="highlight">scenario</span>. </p><p>  Though Martin claims the lack of evidence actually supports his model-the evidence is <span class="highlight">sparse</span> because the spread of humans and the extinction of animals occurred so quickly-this argument seems weak. And how could we ever disprove it?As archaeologist Donald Grayson points out, in other cases where extinction resulted from the quick spread of human hunters-for example, the extinction of the <span class="highlight">moa</span>, the large <span class="highlight">flightless</span> bird of New Zealand-archaeological evidence in the form of remains is abundant. Grayson has also shown that the evidence is not so clear that all or even most of the large herbivores in late <span class="highlight">Pleistocene</span> America became extinct after the appearance of Clovis. Of the 35 extinct genera, only 8 can be confidently assigned an extinction date of between 12,000 and 10,000 years ago.Many of the older genera, Grayson argues, may have succumbed before 12,000 B.C., at least half a century before the Clovis showed up in the American West. </p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>1.The word "proposed" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. accepted</p><p>B. obvious</p><p>C. debatable</p><p>D. suggested</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>This question is a vocabulary question.

From the question stem, you can locate the sentence "<span class="question3">Modern humans</span> have certainly been capable of such drastic effects on animals, but but ancient people with little more than stone spears similarly have cause the extinction of numerous species of animals?" Modern people really have such a strong influence on animals, but almost only ancient people with stone spears can also cause the extinction of innumerable kinds of animals?" A option says that in order to explain that modern people have always had a large number of influences on animal species, mistakes The main object of this article is the ancients, with the wrong emphasis. Option B says to reveal how people treat animals differently in different historical periods, which is inconsistent with the meaning of the original sentence. The C option says to express doubts about whether or not the ancients could have hunted large animals and caused extinction. It is in accordance with the meaning of the original sentence and is therefore the correct answer. The D option says that in order to emphasize that modern people are more successful hunters than the ancients, mistakes were misinterpreted.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>4.In using the word "<span class="question4">coincidence</span>" in the passage, the author refers to events that occurred</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. after a period of many years</p><p>B. subsequent to a prediction</p><p>C. from time to time</p><p>D. at the same time and by chance</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>This question is a reasoning question. Coincidence means "<span class="question4">coincidence</span>." To the original "The only apparently significant difference in the Americas 11,000 years ago was the presence of human hunters of these large mammals. Was this <span class="question4">coincidence</span> or cause-and-effect?", meaning "The only significant significant difference was in 11000. In the former Americas, these large mammal hunters existed. Is this a <span class="question4">coincidence</span> or a causal relationship?" The A option states that this incident occurred many years later and does not mean <span class="question4">coincidence</span>. Option B said that this incident was not in accordance with the original intention after the prophecy. The C option says that this happened from time to time, meaning wrong. The D option says that this incident happened at the same time and happened by chance. It is the same as the meaning of <span class="question4">coincidence</span>, so it is the correct answer.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>5.According to paragraph 2, what suggests that human activity played a role in the extinction of mammals about 11,000 years ago?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Climate changes that would have favored human population expansion occurred at the time of the extinctions.</p><p>B. The presence of human hunters had caused animal extinctions in other time periods.</p><p>C. There was a pattern of climate change earlier than 11,000 years ago that had not caused animal extinctions.</p><p>D. Harmful climate changes 11,000 years ago would have required humans to hunt larger numbers of animals for food.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>According to the question asked, what suggests that human activity is the cause of animal extinction. The sentence "Although the climate changed at the end of the Pleistocene, warming situations had happened before. A period of massive extinction of large mammals like that seen about 11,000 years ago had not occurred during the previous 400,000 years, probably these changes." This means that "despite the change in the late Pleistocene climate, the warming trend preceded it. Despite these changes, in the past 400,000 years, about 11,000 years ago, large mammals were mass extinct. The period did not appear." Option A said that climate change was suitable for human population growth and led to extinction at that time. The article did not mention that climate change is suitable for population growth and cannot be inferred. Option B said that the existence of human hunters caused animal extinction and errors in other periods. The article did not mention other periods. The C option says that as early as 11,000 years ago, the pattern of climate change did not lead to the extinction of animals, thus indicating that there was another reason for the extinction of animals, and later stated that the extinction was when human hunters appeared, and it was possible to infer human activity. It is the cause of animal extinction. The D option says that hazardous climate change will cause people to hunt larger numbers of animals as food before 11,000 years ago. It is wrong to predict from the original text that the climate does not encourage people to prey on large numbers of animals.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>6.Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. A computer model was designed to determine how long it would have taken for a small group of hunters to spread across North America.</p><p>B. A computer model showed that it was possible for a small group of hunters to spread across North America and kill off game animals in just 300 years.</p><p>C. According to a computer model, people coming into North America 12,000 years ago had to kill game animals in order to feed their population.</p><p>D. According to a computer model, about 12,000 years ago conditions enabled a small group of hunters to enter and cross North America in about 300 years.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>This question is a sentence simplification question. The original sentence is: With researcher JE Mosimann, he has co-authored a work in which a computer model showed that in around 300 years, given the right conditions, a small influx of hunters into eastern Beringia 12.000 years ago could have spread across North America In a wave and wiped out game animals to feed their burgeoning population. means "The researcher JE Mosimann co-authored a computer model study that took into consideration the correct conditions for about 300 years, 12,000 years ago. A small influx of hunters in the east of Beringia can be transmitted to North America in waves, destroying the beast to feed its newborn population." The A option says that the computer model was designed to determine how long a small group of hunters would take in order to North America is spreading. The focus of the original text was on the spread of North East Beringia to North America over 12,000 years ago, not how long it took, wrong focus, and exclusion. Option B said that a computer model showed that a small group of hunters could spread in North America and kill the beast in as little as 300 years. The important information is complete, the logic is correct, wiped out is a synonym replacement for kill off, so it is the correct answer. The C option says that according to the computer model, people who came to North America before 12000 must kill prey to feed their population. The option logic is inconsistent with the original text, and it lacks 300 years of this key information. The D option says that according to a computer model, conditions of about 12,000 years ago allowed a small group of hunters to enter and cross North America within about 300 years. Errors, missing key information about hunting animals.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>7.Which of the following best describes the results of the research discussed in paragraph 4?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Scientists used mathematical models to show that most of the extinctions occurred in areas where humans had recently arrived.</p><p>B. Scientists established that the main population of North Americans who hunted lived in Canada during the time of the megafauna extinctions.</p><p>C. Scientists used numerical models to confirm that a small population of humans could have caused big-game extinctions in a relatively short period of time.</p><p>D. Scientists used statistics to prove beyond doubt the currently accepted view that human hunters were the main cause of the megafauna extinctions.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Question: Which of the following is the best description of the research results discussed in the fourth paragraph? Look at the options: A: Scientists use mathematical models to show that most of the extinctions occurred in areas that humans have recently arrived at. Errors, the original did not mention that humans "recently arrived" and are therefore excluded. B: Scientists have determined that during the extinction of megafauna, most North Americans who hunted lived in Canada. The mistake was that the researcher only used 100 Canadians for data analysis, and it was not inferring historical facts. C: Scientists use numerical models to confirm that a small group of people may cause extinction in a relatively short period of time. The option "big-game" also means big prey, and this sentence is the closest to the selection. The meaning of it is therefore the correct answer. D: Scientists use statistical data to prove that human hunters are the main cause of extinction of megafauna. There is no doubt that understanding errors. The key time factors mentioned in the text are not mentioned here, and this model is not used. To prove that humans are the main cause of the extinction of megafauna, they are excluded.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>8.Which of the following statements about Larry Agenbroad's work is implied in the discussion in paragraph 5?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Agenbroad showed that Mosimann and Martin's estimates of the amount of time needed to drive big-game to extinction were correct.</p><p>B. Agenbroad's maps were the first to indicate the ages of the Clovis sites.</p><p>C. Agenbroad reinforced the idea that humans could have caused the extinctions.</p><p>D. Agenbroad's studies of wooly mammoths led to his discovery of Clovis sites.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>By Larry Agenbroad's work you can find the geologist Larry Agenbroad has mapped the locations of dated Clovis sites alongside the distribution of dated sites where the remains of wooly mammoths have been found in both archaeological and purely paleontological contexts. These distributions show remarkable synchronicity (occurrence at the same Translation: The geologist Larry Agenbroad has mapped the location of the Clovis site during that period, and the distribution of archaeological sites where woolly mammoth remains have been found, all of which can be found in archeology and pure biology. Learned from the article. These distributions show significant synchronization (simultaneous). The phrase "many scholars continue to support this statement" mentioned in the first sentence of the paragraph refers to the ecologist Paul S. Martin mentioned in the previous paragraphs who proposes that the end of the Pleistocene large breastfeeding The pattern of animal extinction associated with human predation. The A option is: Agenbroad shows that Mossman and Martin are correct in estimating the time required to drive the extinction of large animals. Errors, this is not the result of Mossman and Martin's estimation. Option B: The map of Agebroad shows for the first time the age of the Clovis site. The original did not mention that it was the first time that the C option was displayed: Agenbroad reinforced the idea that humans might cause it to become extinct. It was correct to find out that humans might be the cause of extinction by discovering large animal fossils in cultural relics. Option D: Agenbroad's research on the mammoth beast led to the discovery of the Clovis site. The error was reversed. It was the mammoth body that rediscovered the ruins.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>9.The word "<span class="question9">admitted</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. accepted the truth of</p><p>B. was unaware of</p><p>C. was troubled by</p><p>D. called attention to</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>This question is a vocabulary question.

The D option called attention to means "cause concern" to exclude.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>10.According to paragraph 6, which of the following statements challenges the view that hunting by humans caused the extinctions of North American megafauna?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The Clovis sites that contain the remains of mammoths were settled by humans long after the extinctions occurred.</p><p>B. Only a few of the Clovis sites are located near known mammoth habitats.</p><p>C. No archaeological evidence of extinctions has been found at Clovis sites since 1982.</p><p>D. The number of mammoth remains found at Clovis sites is smaller than would be expected if hunting by humans had caused the extinctions.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The title requires finding a point of view that refutes human hunting that causes the extinction of large animals. Positioning original "at that point, the remains of only 38 individual mammoths had been found at Clovis sites. In the years since, few additional mammoths have been added to the list; there are still more than than 20 Clovis sites where the remains of one or More mammoths have been restored, a minuscule proportion of the millions that already would have had to have been slaughtered within the overkill scenario. Translating to "For example, at that time, only 38 individual mammoths were found at the Clovis site. Widows, but there are still less than 20 Clovis sites, the remains of one or more mammoths have been restored, and some of the millions are bound to be killed in the case of excessive massacre. A: The Clovis site containing the remains of mammoths survived long after the extinction had been settled by humans. It was not mentioned and it can be ruled out. B: Only a few clovis relics are located near known mammoth habitats. Not mentioned, it can be ruled out C: Since 1982, no extinct archaeological evidence has been found in the Clovis region, contradicting the original text, but in fact there are sporadic evidences, but it is not enough to prove it, so it is excluded. The number of behemoths found at the Clovis site is less than expected from the extermination caused by human hunting. It is in accordance with the original text and is the correct answer.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>11.In paragraph 7, why does the author mention that there is abundant archaeological evidence for the extinction of the New Zealand moa?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

Targeting "As archaeologist Donald Grayson points out, in other cases where extinction resulted from the quick spread of human hunters-for example, the extinction of the moa, the large flightless bird of New Zealand-archaeological evidence in the form of remains remains . Grayson has also shown that the evidence is not so clear that all or even most of the large herbivores in late Pleistocene America became extinct after the appearance of Clovis." Previously, other evidence has been proved by archeological form of will, but for the site The evidence of the extinction of megafauna is vague. Option A: The rapid spread of humans explains why extinction also occurs at a rapid rate. The original did not mention the relationship between the two. Option B: Given the speed at which extinction occurs, it is not surprising that lack of humans leads to extinction. The original did not express Donald's "not surprising" statement. Option C: As the method of measurement improves, more evidence may be found. The original did not discuss the method of measurement, error.

About 11,000 years ago, all of North America's megafauna became extinct.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.That the first humans migrated to North America near the same time as the extinctions of the megafauna has led many to believe that hunting by humans was a significant cause of those extinctions.</p><p>B.

We analyze the options in turn to find the correct answer: The hint given means that about 11,000 years ago, all large mammals in North America were extinct. A period of massive extinction of large mammals like that seen about 11,000 years ago had not occurred during the previous 400,000 years, probably these changes. The only apparently significant difference in the Americas 11,000 years ago was the presence The description of human hunters of these large mammals. It is the extinction of large mammals that occurred after humans began their activities. Therefore, A is correct. The B option corresponds to the fourth and fifth paragraphs, which correspond to the Mosimann and Martin studies and the Larry Agenbroad examples. Therefore, B is correct. The C option says there are more examples of human extermination caused by hunting birds than humans have provided evidence for large mammals such as mammoths. The logic is correct, but it is not the main content of the article and therefore it is not selected. D said that the early North Americans, known as the Clovis society, developed spears in order to capture large enough animals to feed their population, as Clovis expanded in vast areas of the African continent.The article did not mention that the development of spears is to capture large enough animals. The E option says that scientists have demonstrated that the number of human hunters of large animals migrating in North America has grown so fast that most of the megafauna have been exterminated within a few hundred years. By mistake, scientists do not have enough evidence that humans are responsible for the extinction of these giant faunas. The F option states that some scholars believe that there is insufficient evidence to leave mammoths in human settlements to prove that human hunting is an important factor in the extinction of megafauna. This is correct and corresponds to the last two paragraphs of the article.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
