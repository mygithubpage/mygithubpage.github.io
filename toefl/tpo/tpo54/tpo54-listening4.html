It can be seen from the question that the woman asked if the boy was looking for some materials for class. The boys said that No, it was because his grandma used to be the waiter of the Chuntian restaurant and met his grandfather there. Now that they are celebrating the 50th anniversary, he wants to find a restaurant menu and print it out as a gift. give them. So the answer is C.

It does not mean that the town has a history of 70 years, and the dialogue is in progress.

              <p>Corresponding to the original: I know some libraries have special rules for handling delicate or old materials. Employee: Well, these aren't particularly old. Just the usual rules apply, no food or drinks. Analysis: This question is a function title, you need to listen to a paragraph The dialogue will answer again. The content of the listening part is: I know that some libraries have some special provisions for dealing with exquisite or old materials. According to Ms. Hou Wenwen, these materials are not old, and the library's regulations only say that they cannot bring food and drinks. Therefore, the purpose of the boys' statement here is to ask the library whether there are any regulations for the inspection of materials. So the B option is correct. A option means: In order for the lady to know that he had previously treated the old material, it was not mentioned in the original text and was ruled out. The C option means: In order to imply that the library needs to strengthen its work in protecting historical documents, it is clear from the context that boys do not mean this, so they are excluded. The D option means: In order to argue that there is no need to be cautious about this matter, boys are not arguing here and are therefore excluded.</p>
