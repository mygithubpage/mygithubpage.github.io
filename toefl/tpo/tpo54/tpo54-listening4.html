My grandmother went to this university, and while she was here, she worked as a waitress. Employee: At the Springfield Eatery? Student: Yes, and that's where she met my grandfather. So, they're celebrating their fiftieth anniversary this year. And I noticed online that you have old menus from some of the restaurants. I was thinking I could find one from the year they Resolve: This question is the subject of the subject. The subject asks "Why do boys go to see women?". It can be seen from the question that the woman asked if the boy was looking for some materials for class. The boys said that No, it was because his grandma used to be the waiter of the Chuntian restaurant and met his grandfather there. Now that they are celebrating the 50th anniversary, he wants to find a restaurant menu and print it out as a gift. give them. So the answer is C.

Last year we had an exhibition that showcase how the town square has changed over the past fifty years. : This question is a detailed question. The subject asks "Why does the lady have to talk about the exhibition held at the library last year?" From the point of view, last year they held an exhibition about the transformation of the town square over the past 50 years. This exhibition helped When it comes to the role of publicity, the answer is B. The meaning of the A option is: In order to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the town, although 70 years have been mentioned in the dialogue, it means that the library collected material from the 1970s. It does not mean that the town has a history of 70 years, and the dialogue is in progress. Nor was it mentioned that it was to celebrate an exhibition that was held only on the anniversary of the town, so it was excluded; the meaning of the C option was: This exhibition was organized by students of history majors. The students who mentioned history in the dialogue were to explain Most students do not know this library collection, but did not mention that this exhibition was organized by history students and therefore excluded; the D option means: The exhibition contains photographs of the 1950s.

There are some gaps, some years we didn't receive any new materials, and sometimes restaurants go a while without changing their menus Student: Oh no, I really want to give them something special. Analyze: This question is an inference question. The subject asks "What does the lady imply for the menu?", which is known from the question point. The woman said, I know we have 20 copies. The menu of the 1950s, but you have to check it yourself, because there has been some time, there are a lot of intervals during this period, and sometimes restaurants will not change their menus for a long time, that is, the implication is that men may not find him For the menu you are looking for, the answer is D. The meaning of the A option is: most of the collected menus come from Springfield Restaurant, but they are not mentioned in the dialogue, so they are excluded; the meaning of the B option is: all the menus in the collection are well-organized in the box, obviously and Contradictions in the original text, when the woman mentioned later in the photo, the only problem was that most of our materials were still in the box. No one had time to sort them out. Then the B option was wrong. The C option means: what the men are looking for. The menu may be in the main library. This statement is wrong. The main library only appeared at the beginning of the dialogue. It has nothing to do with the menu and is therefore excluded.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>4.What does the woman suggest that the man consider doing?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

Employee: Well, these aren't particularly old. Just the usual rules apply, no food or drinks. Analysis: This question is a function title, you need to listen to a paragraph The dialogue will answer again. The content of the listening part is: I know that some libraries have some special provisions for dealing with exquisite or old materials. According to Ms. Hou Wenwen, these materials are not old, and the library's regulations only say that they cannot bring food and drinks. Therefore, the purpose of the boys' statement here is to ask the library whether there are any regulations for the inspection of materials. So the B option is correct. A option means: In order for the lady to know that he had previously treated the old material, it was not mentioned in the original text and was ruled out. The C option means: In order to imply that the library needs to strengthen its work in protecting historical documents, it is clear from the context that boys do not mean this, so they are excluded. The D option means: In order to argue that there is no need to be cautious about this matter, boys are not arguing here and are therefore excluded.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
