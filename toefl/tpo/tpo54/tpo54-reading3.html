Scientists have determined that all chemical elements in the universe besides <span class="highlight">hydrogen</span> and <span class="highlight">helium</span> (and a trace amount of <span class="highlight">lithium</span>) were produced by stars. These are known as heavy elements because they are heavier than <span class="highlight">hydrogen</span> and <span class="highlight">helium</span>. Although all of these heavy elements are quite rare compared to <span class="highlight">hydrogen</span> and <span class="highlight">helium</span>, they are found just about everywhere. </p><p><span class="question3">Heavy elements are continually being manufactured by stars and released into space by <span class="highlight">stellar</span> deaths</span>, so their amount compared to <span class="highlight">hydrogen</span> and <span class="highlight">helium</span> gradually rises with time. Heavy elements make up about 2 percent of the chemical content (by mass) of our solar system, the other 98 percent is <span class="highlight">hydrogen</span> and <span class="highlight">helium</span>. In some very old star systems, which formed before many heavy elements were produced, the heavy-element share may be less than 0.1 percent. <span class="question5">Nevertheless</span>, every star system studied has at least some amount of all the elements used by life.<span class="question7">Moreover, when planetesimals-small, solid objects formed in the early solar system that may <span class="highlight">accumulate</span> to become planets-<span class="highlight">condense</span> within a forming star system, they are <span class="highlight"><span class="question6">inevitably</span></span> made from heavy elements because the more common <span class="highlight">hydrogen</span> and <span class="highlight">helium</span> remain <span class="highlight">gaseous</span></span>.Thus, planetesimals everywhere should contain the elements needed for life, which means that objects built from planetesimals-planets, moons, asteroids, and comets-also contain these elements. The nature of solar-system <span class="highlight">formation</span> explains why Earth contains all the elements needed for life, and it is why we expect these elements to be present on other worlds throughout our solar system, galaxy, and universe. </p><p>  Note that this argument does not change, even if we allow for life very different from life on Earth. Life on Earth is <span class="highlight">carbon</span> based, and most biologists believe that life elsewhere is likely to be <span class="highlight">carbon</span> based as well. However, we cannot absolutely rule out the possibility of life with another chemical basis, such as <span class="highlight">silicon</span> or <span class="highlight">nitrogen</span>. The set of elements (or their relative proportions) used by life based on some other element might be somewhat different from that used by carbon-based life on Earth. But the elements are still products of stars and would still be present in planetesimals everywhere. No matter what kinds of life we are looking for, we are likely to find the necessary elements on almost every planet, moon, <span class="highlight">asteroid</span>, and <span class="highlight">comet</span> in the universe. </p><p>  A somewhat stricter requirement is the presence of these elements in molecules that can be used as ready-made building blocks for life, just as early Earth probably had an organic soup of <span class="highlight">amino</span> acids and other complex molecules. Earth's organic molecules likely came from some combination of three sources: chemical reactions in the atmosphere, chemical reactions near deep-sea vents in the oceans, and molecules carried to Earth by asteroids and comets. The first two sources can occur only on worlds with atmospheres or oceans, <span class="highlight">respectively</span>. But the third source should have brought similar molecules to nearly all worlds in our solar system. </p><p>  Studies of meteorites and comets suggest that organic molecules are <span class="highlight">widespread</span> among both asteroids and comets. Because each body in the solar system was repeatedly struck by asteroids and comets during the period known as the heavy <span class="highlight">bombardment</span> (about 4 billion years ago), each body should have received at least some organic molecules. However, these molecules tend to be destroyed by solar <span class="highlight">radiation</span> on surfaces unprotected by atmospheres. Moreover, while these molecules might stay <span class="highlight"><span class="question10">intact</span></span> beneath the surface (as they evidently do on asteroids and comets), they probably cannot react with each other unless some kind of liquid or gas is available to move them about. Thus, if we limit our search to worlds on which organic molecules are likely to be involved in chemical reactions, we can probably rule out any world that lacks both an atmosphere and a surface or <span class="highlight">subsurface</span> liquid medium, such as water. </p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>1.The word "components" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. parts</p><p>B. bodies</p><p>C. combinations</p><p>D. characteristics</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>This question is a vocabulary question. "Part" means "part, segment, composition". The sentence "The creation of life requires a set of chemical elements for making the components of cells." means "The creation of life requires a set of components for the manufacture of cells. "The chemical element", in which "component" means "component, component", according to synonymous transformation, we can see that the answer is A. The A option "parts" means "parts, sections, and components". It means the most appropriate and correct. The B option "bodies" means "body, subject, and main part". Substituting it into it means that the sentence is inconsistent and excluded. The C option "combinations" means "combination, combination". Substituting it will show that the sentence is inconsistent and excluded. The D option "characteristics" means "characteristics, characteristics". Substituting it into the text means that the sentence is inconsistent and excluded.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>2.According to paragraphs 1 and 2, living cells contain which of the following?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. All chemical elements in the universe except lithium</p><p>B. About 25 different elements</p><p>C. About 96 percent of all known elements</p><p>D. Ninety-two naturally occurring elements</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The subject is a factual information question, and the problem is "The creation of life requires a set of chemical elements for making the components of cells. Life on Earth uses about 25 of the 92 naturally occurring chemical elements," meaning "the creation of life needs A set of chemical elements used to make cell components. "Life on Earth" uses 25 of the 92 natural chemical elements." Earth's life is composed of cells. It can be seen that the components of the cells of life include about 25 different elements. Then item B is correct. The A option means: In addition to the chemical elements other than lithium in the universe, the interference factor of item A comes from "Scientists have determined that all chemical elements in the universe besides hydrogen and helium (and a trace amount of lithium) were produced by stars". This is just to say, "Scientists have determined that all the chemical elements in the universe except the hydrogen and the helium (and traces of lithium) are produced by stars." It is not said that the living cells are made of chemical elements other than lithium. Constituted, the A option is incorrect. The C option means: about 96% of the known elements, the interference factor of the C option comes from "although just 4 of these elements-oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen-make up about 96 percent of the mass of living organisms." It means "though only four of these elements: oxygen, carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen - constitute about 96% of living organisms," emphasizing that the vast majority of organisms are made up of oxygen, carbon, hydrogen and Nitrogen is composed of 4 elements, but it does not mean that all cells are composed of only 96% of the elements we know. Then item C is incorrect.The D option means: 92 types of existing elements. The interference factor for item D comes from "Life on Earth uses about 25 of the 92 most occurring chemical elements". This should be noted that it is 25 out of 92. "of" is not all, and item D is incorrect.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>3.Why does the author provide the information that "Heavy elements are continually being manufactured by stars and released into space by stellar deaths"?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To explain how it is that the elements required for life can be found everywhere.</p><p>B. To provide evidence that our solar system is relatively young.</p><p>C. To argue that some solar systems are more likely to support life than others.</p><p>D. To explain why heavy elements have greater mass than hydrogen and helium.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The question title is "Heavy elements are hollow being produced by stars and released into space by stellar deaths, so their amount compared to hydrogen and helium gradually rises with time," meaning that "heavy elements are constantly made by stars and passed through the stars. Deaths are released into space, so their quantity gradually increases over time as compared to hydrogen and deuterium." This sentence is a sentence with a causal relationship. The first sentence is the reason for the latter part of the sentence. The meaning of item B is: In order to prove that our solar system is very young to provide evidence, in the item B, the center of this paper is the composition of the cells of life in the universe, not the length of the life of the solar system, then the B option is inconsistent with the main purpose of the article. Item B is incorrect. The meaning of item C is: In order to confirm that some solar systems are more likely to exist than other galaxies, in item C, although it can be inferred in the third natural period why there can be life in the solar system, it does not include the solar system and other galaxies. In comparison, there is no comparison, so we can't get such a conclusion. Then item C is incorrect. The meaning of D is: In order to explain why the heavy elements are of higher quality than hydrogen and helium, in the D term, the third natural paragraph does not explain why the heavy elements are of higher quality than hydrogen and helium and belong to the phenomenon of nothing. D The item is incorrect.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>4.Paragraph 3 suggests that which of the following may be a difference between very old star systems and newer star systems?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Older star systems are likely to have fewer planets, moons, asteroids, and comets than newer star systems.</p><p>B. Newer star systems probably contain more hydrogen and helium than older star systems.</p><p>C. Newer star systems probably contain more heavy elements than older star systems.</p><p>D. The process of solar-system formation may have been fundamentally different in older star systems than in newer star systems.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>According to "In some very old star systems, which formed before many heavy elements were produced, the heavy-element share may be less than 0.1 percent," in some very ancient stellar systems, these stellar systems appear in many heavy elements. Before the formation, the share of heavy elements may be less than 0.1%, then we can see that the C option is correct. The A option means that the old galaxy may have fewer planets, moons, asteroids, and comets than the new galaxy. The interference point of the A option comes from "Thus, planetesimals everywhere should contain the elements needed for life, which means that Objects built from planetesimals-planets, moons, asteroids, and comets-also contain these elements, which means "Therefore, stars everywhere should contain the elements that life requires, which means that planets, planets, satellites, and planets Objects such as planets and comets also contain these elements," explains the components of other galaxies, rather than comparing the new galaxy with the old galaxy, item A is incorrect. The B option means: The new galaxy may contain more hydrogen and helium than the old galaxy, option B. This option belongs to the concept of stealing and replacing the "heavy elements" in the correct options with "hydrogen and helium". ", and hydrogen and deuterium do not belong to the category of heavy elements, then the B option is not correct. The C option means that the formation process of the solar system in the old galaxy may be fundamentally different from the formation process of the new galaxy. The D option, the third natural segment does not explain the formation process of the galaxy, nor does it compare the formation process of the new galaxy with the old galaxy. The D term is incorrect.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>5.The word "<span class="question5">Nevertheless</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. additionally</p><p>B. however</p><p>C. in particular</p><p>D. on the contrary</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>"<span class="question5">Nevertheless</span>" means "however, though, though," it means a turning point, which is the closest to the "however" of item B. The table turns, meaning "however, but". The meaning of the A option is: In addition, plus, means to pass; B means: but, however, means turning; C means: in particular, means to emphasize; D means means: otherwise, means to mean the opposite , indicating the opposite. The three items A, C, and D do not meet the requirements.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>6.The word "<span class="question6">inevitably</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. typically</p><p>B. unsurprisingly</p><p>C. necessarily</p><p>D. naturally</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>"<span class="question6">inevitably</span>" means "must be inevitable," appearing in the original "they are <span class="question6">inevitably</span> made from heavy elements", meaning "they are <span class="question6">inevitably</span> made of heavy elements" and "necessarily" in the C options. The meaning is similar, meaning "certainly, must", then the C option is correct. The meaning of the A option is: In general, general; B option means: no doubt; C option means: certain, necessary; D means: naturally. Then, A, B, and D do not meet the requirements.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>7.Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Planetesimals may remain in star systems when hydrogen and helium combine with less common heavier elements.</p><p>B.

After understanding the meaning of the underlined sentence, the B option is the correct answer. The A option means that plane galaxies may remain in the galaxy when hydrogen and helium are combined with the less common heavier elements. The B option means that the galaxy consists of heavy elements because hydrogen and helium exist as gases. The C option means that the galaxy is a small, strong object that condenses within the formed star system and may become a planet; the D option means that when an asteroid accumulates to form a planet, they <span class="question6">inevitably</span> contain gas and heavy element. Comparing the A, B, C, and D options, it was found that A, C, and D did not meet the requirements.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>8.According to paragraph 4, which of the following is true about possible life on other planets?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

It is likely to have carbon as its chemical basis.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>From "Life on Earth is carbon based, and most biologists believe that life elsewhere is likely to be carbon based as well," we can see that "life on earth is based on carbon, and most biologists think that life in other places is also possible." Carbon-based, then the D option is correct. The meaning of the A option is: it cannot be based on silicon or nitrogen; the B option means: it cannot live on the Earth; the C option means: it cannot be made up of elements produced by the planet; the D option means: it may Carbon is its chemical basis. The interference point in item A is "However, we can not perfectly rule out the possibility of life with another chemical basis, such as silicon or nitrogen", which means "However, we cannot completely exclude the use of another chemical basis such as silicon or nitrogen. "The possibility of life", item A is incorrect; item B, the article does not mention whether they can survive on the earth, then item B is incorrect; the interference point in item C is "But the elements are still "Products of stars and would still be present in planetesimals everywhere", meaning "but these elements are still the product of the stars, and still appear in the form of various planets," the C option is incorrect.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>9.According to paragraph 5, all of the following are true of the organic molecules on early Earth EXCEPT:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

"The gas and liquid environment is very important for the synthesis of organic molecules, then the C term is correct." The A option means that the organic molecules must be protected from the sun's rays by the surface of the liquid layer; the B option means that planets that do not have these two characteristics may be too small to be loaded with organic substances. The meteorite and comet struck; the C option means: organic molecules need to have a liquid or gas environment so that they can react with each other; the D option means: for the protection of organic molecules from being destroyed by meteorites or comets, the atmosphere is very important.Although the A option is correct, the question is "Why can't find life on planets lacking the atmosphere and liquid media?" Obviously, answer A is not correct; Option B, the sixth paragraph does not mention The relevant viewpoints belong to nothing, then item B is incorrect; D option, known as "the molecules tend to be destroyed by solar radiation on surfaces unprotected by atmospheres", organic molecules will receive damage to the sun's rays, not meteorites and comets. .

Let's look at the options one by one below. The A option means that depending on the complexity of the organism, some naturally occurring elements between 4 and 25 are necessary for life. The article did not mention this issue. It belongs to nothing and the article mentions "Life on Earth uses about 25 of the 92 most occurring chemical elements". That is to say, "the life on the earth" uses 92 kinds of natural chemical elements. Of the 25 species in the list, the A term is incorrect; the B option means that life is most easily found in the oldest star system, and heavy elements have been continuously generated since those systems were formed. The article says "In some very old star systems, which formed before many heavy elements were produced, the heavy-element share may be less than 0.1 percent", that is, the content of heavy elements on ancient galaxies is very small, and there is no Continuously, Item B is incorrect; Option C means that life is most likely to exist on these planets. They have not been severely bombed by meteorite and comets during the formation of the solar system. From the last paragraph of the article, "Because each body in the solar system was thoroughly struck by asteroids and comets during the period known as the heavy bombardment (about 4 billion years ago), each body should have received at least some organic molecules". The term is incorrect; the D option means: The most common elements used to form life are oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, and helium, which are also the most widely distributed elements in the universe.From "although just 4 of these elements-oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen-make up about 96 percent of the mass of living organisms" we can see that the D term is correct; E option means: planets, satellites, asteroids and comets are all Made up of heavy elements, which means that they contain any form of life, all based on carbon elements or otherwise.
