data-times="3.35" data-time="135.41">[02:15.41]</span>Student: OK, but how did plant life affect rivers?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.56" data-time="138.76">[02:18.76]</span>Professor: Well, in order to answer that question, we need to look at the geological evidence.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.48" data-time="144.32">[02:24.32]</span>You see, as rivers flow, they leave layers

evidence of a process called <span class="highlight">lateral</span><span class="highlight">accretion</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.42" data-time="206.07">[03:26.07]</span><span class="highlight">Lateral</span><span class="highlight">accretion</span> happens when water flows around the <span class="highlight">curve</span> or bend in the riverbed.<span class="time" data-times="7.26" data-time="212.49">[03:32.49]</span>Now the speed of the flow on the outside of the bend is fastest, and slowest on the inside of the bend.<span class="time" data-times="4.49" data-time="219.75">[03:39.75]</span>This sets up what's called the secondary flow across the river bottom.<span class="time" data-times="13.68" data-time="224.24">[03:44.24]</span>The fast flowing water on the outside of the bend digs out material from the riverbank and pushes these material laterally across the bottom, and it gets deposited on the other side of the river,on the inner side of

there is also evidence of plants with underground root systems.<span class="time" data-times="11.77" data-time="263.04">[04:23.04]</span>This suggests that plants promoted the development of modern rivers by creating stable banks, which resulted in the flow of water in single <span class="highlight">meandering</span> channels.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.5"

questions about this <span class="highlight">hypothesis</span> remain.<span class="time" data-times="7.72" data-time="288.97">[04:48.97]</span>For example, it's well-known that on other planets, like

A hypothesis that rivers formed before the rise of plant life</p><p>B. A study of the effects that rivers have on soil formation</p><p>C. A debate surrounding two opposing hypotheses</p><p>D. New evidence in support of a previously proposed hypothesis</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>Original article: Professor: About 30 years ago, a geologist named Edward Cotter, that's COTTER, published a paper that contained a very interesting hypothesis. He was studying ancient rivers in the North American mountain chain. And he noticed that about 450 million years ago , rivers started to behave differently. before then, rivers were wide, shallow and straight. But after that time, they became deeper and had move curves. They just have evolved meandering, and that's actually how rivers behaved till these days. So why might this Change have happened? Analysis: This topic is the subject of the subject, the subject asks the professor to discuss what? From the point of view, Cotter suggested that the change of the river was cosmopolitan, but Cotter did not prove this theory. Looking at the full text, the next part of the article is based on the new argument put forward by Cotter's viewpoint, and then the D option. correct. The A option means that the river is formed before the formation of the plant circle. This is a fact, not a hypothesis, and it is not the subject of the article. Item A is incorrect; the option B means: the effect of the river on soil formation. Research, the river does have an impact on the formation of soil, but this is only a small detail in the article, not the professor wants to explain the problem; C option means: the argument of two opposing hypotheses, the article did not mention The two opposing views, not to mention the arguments on the two points of view, were ruled out.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>2.What limitation of Cotter's research does the professor mention?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Cotter's research findings could not be replicated.</p><p>B. Cotter's research was based on one geographical area.</p><p>C. Cotter's research did not take into account lateral accretion.</p><p>D. Cotter's research did not account for changes in climate.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Source: Student: Was the change worldwide? Or just in that geographical area? Professor: Well Cotter speculated that rivers changed worldwide, but he couldn't prove it. Because he only had evidence from the one North American mountain chain. But his Analyze: This question is a detailed question. What is the limitation of the question asked by the professor to propose Cotter's research? From the point of view, Cotter's research evidence is only from the North American mountains, and the river's transition is a global problem. The limitation of Cotter's research is that it is only in one area, then the B option is correct. The A option means that Cotter's research results cannot be copied. It is obviously wrong because Cotter's discovery is a global problem. It cannot be copied and can be applied to other related research; This means that Cotter's study did not consider the impact of lateral accumulation. The "lateral accretion" in the article is an argument that the professor put forward to support Cotter's argument and it was ruled out; the D option means that Cotter's study did not consider climate change. The climate change is an argument that the professor put forward to support Cotter's argument, so it cannot be said that Cotter's view does not take into account the change of climate.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>3.What did researchers try to confirm about rivers in a recent study?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. That rivers now have the same shape worldwide</p><p>B. That rivers were responsible for the spread of plant life</p><p>C. That a change in the shape of rivers is linked to the spread of plant life</p><p>D. That most rivers emerged during a specific geological time period</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Original report: Their study was specifically designed to identify changes in the shapes of rivers during the time period when vegetation was evolving. And when the fans compared the data about river shapes with data they have collected some plant life from the same period, the data Answer: This question is a detailed question. The question asked in a recent survey and study, what do scholars want to prove? From the point of view, the researchers compared the river-shaped data with the data of their collected plant life at the same time to prove Cotter's hypothesis, so the C option was correct. The meaning of the A option is: Now the rivers in the world have the same shape, which is obviously wrong. On the one hand, it is not logical. On the other hand, there is no mention in the article; the B option means: the development of rivers on vegetation. Play a certain role, although the article mentioned this problem, but it is not the scholars want to prove in the study; D option means: Most of the rivers appear in a specific geographic time, the article does not The issue was mentioned and it was ruled out.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>4.Why does the professor describe the composition of the sediment of the earliest rivers?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To identify the evidence used to determine how the rivers flowed</p><p>B. To explain why the rivers could easily dry out</p><p>C. To suggest that the sediment was once fine sand</p><p>D. To suggest that the geological record might be flawed</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>Original: Student: OK, but how did plant life affect rivers? Professor: Well, in order to answer that question, we need to look at the geological evidence. You see, as rivers flow, they leave layers of sediment in that finally Fossilized. The content, thickness and shape of these fossilized layers and rocks gave us information about how rivers flowed. The earliest records from 500 million years ago show that the sediment in river deposits was segmented quartz grain of sand and gravel. Us that rivers weren't defined, they were very shallow and wide, almost like floods. Analysis: This question is for organizational structure questions. Why does the subject ask the professor to describe the formation of the earliest river sedimentary layer? From the point of view, the professor is to find evidence of how the river flows, then the A option is correct. The meaning of the B option is: In order to explain why the river is easy to dry, the original does not mention it and exclude it; the meaning of the C option is: In order to indicate that the sedimentary layer originally consists of sand, the original is not mentioned, and the exclusion is; the D option means: In order to show that geographical records may be defective, the composition of the sedimentary layer does not have any relation to the defects in the geographical records, and the original does not mention the defects and eliminate them.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>5.According to the professor, what is an effect of lateral accretion on a meandering river?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Bends in the river become gradually straighter.</p><p>B. Material from one riverbank is deposited on the other.</p><p>C. The intensity of the river's flow increases.</p><p>D. The growth of plants on the outer riverbank is enhanced.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Original source: The fast flowing water on the outside of the bend digs out material from the riverbank and pushes these material laterally across the bottom, and it gets deposited on the other side of the river, on the inner side of the bend. When we see in the sediment layers, evidence of lateral accretion, the erosion on one side and deposit on the other, that's an indicator that meandering rivers existed. Analysis: This question is a detailed question, the question asked by the professor, lateral stacking What is the impact of the turbulent river? From the point of view, the rapid flow of water hits the soil on one side of the riverbank to the other side, forming a curved river, and the B option is correct. The meaning of the A option is: the bent river is gradually straightened, the original is not mentioned, so it is excluded; the C option means: the intensity of the water flow is gradually increased, the article did not say that the lateral accumulation can increase the water flow intensity, only mention The speed of flow to the outside of the river bay is the fastest, so it is excluded; the D option means that the growth of the plants outside the river bank has been strengthened, and the original text has not been mentioned, so it is excluded.</p></div></div><div class="replay" id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>6.Why does the professor say this:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To find out what the students know about Mars</p><p>B. To question certain geological studies of other planets</p><p>C. To express a reservation he has about the hypothesis</p><p>D. To indicate that he is going to change the topic</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Original: Source: Professor, Well, there is no denying that the study presents a very strong case. But some questions about this hypothesis. For example, it's well-known that on other planets, like Mars, there is clear evidence of meandering rivers . But it's there any evidence of vegetation on Mars? Analysis: This question is a function title, and you need to re-listen for a paragraph before answering. In the listening part, the professor explicitly mentioned that there are still some problems with this hypothesis, and he should be skeptical. In conjunction with the hard-of-hearing section below, the professor said "I think not" can further confirm that for this hypothesis, the professor's attitude is somewhat reserved, so the correct answer is C. The meaning of the A option is to see if students are learning about Mars, mistakes, and professors do not mean this. The meaning of the B option is: Questioning a geography study on other planets, mistakes, it is really questioned, but the contents of the question are the previous assumptions, did not mention the geography of other planets, so ruled out. The meaning of the D option is: to illustrate that he wants to transfer the topic, but the original text does not have this meaning, exclude.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
