between a student and a professor of her theater class.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.69" data-time="4.93">[00:04.93]</span>Student:So, Professor Baker, about our next <span class="highlight">assignment</span> you talked about in class.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.96" data-time="9.62">[00:09.62]</span>Professor:Yes, this time you'll be in groups of three, each of you will have a chance to direct the other two in a short scene from a play you've chosen yourself.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.63" data-time="17.58">[00:17.58]</span>Student:Right, and, well, I've been reading about story theater, and...</p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.86" data-time="22.21">[00:22.21]</span>Professor:Ah, story theater, tell me about what you've read.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.61" data-time="25.07">[00:25.07]</span>Student:Well, it's a form of theater where folk or fairy tales are acted out.<span class="time" data-times="5.46" data-time="29.68">[00:29.68]</span>It was...eh, introduced, by the director Paul Sills in the 1960s.<span class="time" data-times="4.99" data-time="35.14">[00:35.14]</span>In Sills's approach, an actor both narrates, and acts out a tale.<span class="time" data-times="12.89" data-time="40.13">[00:40.13]</span>So, like someone will appear on stage, and then will start narrating a tale, about...say a king, and then the same person will immediately switch to and start acting out the role of the king, with no props or scenery.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="9.47" data-time="53.02">[00:53.02]</span>Professor:Sills, you know I actually saw his first story theater production in 1968, he did the fairy tale 'the blue light'.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.38" data-time="62.49">[01:02.49]</span>Student:Really, so whatever gave him the idea to produce that?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.59" data-time="65.87">[01:05.87]</span>Professor:Well, as you know, back in the late 1960s, lots of people in the United States were disillusioned with the government.<span class="time" data-times="6.2" data-time="73.46">[01:13.46]</span>Sills was grappling with how to produce theater that was relevant in such times.<span class="time" data-times="5.19" data-time="79.66">[01:19.66]</span>Then he happened to read 'the blue light', and he realized that it had just the message he wanted.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="11.17" data-time="84.85">[01:24.85]</span>See, in the story, a man has lost all hope as a result of the unfortunate events in his life, completely turns his life around, with the help of a magical blue light. <span class="time" data-times="6.55" data-time="96.02">[01:36.02]</span>So,the blue light in the story symbolizes a way out of seemingly unsolvable human problems.<span class="time" data-times="5.78" data-time="102.57">[01:42.57]</span>And for Sills, that light symbolized an answer to the political turmoil in the US.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.97" data-time="108.35">[01:48.35]</span>Student:But weren't you...um, audiences bother that the actors were performing on a bare stage?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="17.54" data-time="115.32">[01:55.32]</span>Professor:Well, story theater is a departure from traditional <span class="highlight">dramatic</span> theater with its realistic <span class="highlight">elaborate</span> props and scenery, but Sills could make us see, say a big tall mountain through the facial expressions and body movements of the actors, and they're telling of the story.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="9.12" data-time="132.86">[02:12.86]</span>We were all swept up, energized by such an innovative approach to theater, even if one or two of the critics weren't as enthusiastic.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.99" data-time="141.98">[02:21.98]</span>Student:Cool, so, anyway.<span class="time" data-times="6.91" data-time="144.97">[02:24.97]</span>What I really wanted to ask, I'd love to try doing story theater for my project instead of just a scene from a traditional play.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.78" data-time="151.88">[02:31.88]</span>Professor:Um, that's possible.<span class="time" data-times="3.44" data-time="154.66">[02:34.66]</span>A short tale can be about the same length as a single thing.<span class="time" data-times="1.68" data-time="158.1">[02:38.10]</span>Which fairy tale would you do?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.33" data-time="159.78">[02:39.78]</span>Student:Actually, I was reading about another director of story theater, Rack Stevenson.<span class="time" data-times="3.23" data-time="165.11">[02:45.11]</span>You know, he produces plays based on folk tales as well.<span class="time" data-times="1.91" data-time="168.34">[02:48.34]</span>Maybe I could direct one of those.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.99" data-time="170.25">[02:50.25]</span>Professor:Okay, yes, Rack Stevenson.<span class="time" data-times="5.25" data-time="174.24">[02:54.24]</span>Now, Stevenson's style's story theater is a little different from Sills's.<span class="time" data-times="7.34" data-time="179.49">[02:59.49]</span>He'll use simple props, a chair will represent a mountain, but the significant difference is with the narrator.<span class="time" data-times="3.03" data-time="186.83">[03:06.83]</span>The narrator will play only that role.<span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="189.86">[03:09.86]</span>Let's talk about why.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>1.Why does the student go to see the
