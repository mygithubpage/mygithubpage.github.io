            <span class="time" data-times="4.23" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Listen to part of a lecture in a theater history class.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="7.12" data-time="4.23">[00:04.23]</span>One of the things New York city is known for is its Broadway theaters，the productions of <span class="highlight">elaborate</span> musicals.<span class="time" data-times="5.27" data-time="11.35">[00:11.35]</span>A lot of money goes into producing a musical with the actors, costumes, scenery and so on.<span class="time" data-times="5.42" data-time="16.62">[00:16.62]</span>The shows are designed to appeal to large audiences, to make the production financially <span class="highlight">viable</span>.<span class="time" data-times="2.99" data-time="22.04">[00:22.04]</span>But theater didn't always appeal to the masses.<span class="time" data-times="10.66" data-time="25.03">[00:25.03]</span>In the middle of the 19th century, with mostly wealthy residents who were going to Broadway, they would see an opera that was probably written and produced in Europe before making its way all over to New York.<span class="time" data-times="10.96" data-time="35.69">[00:35.69]</span>It was a scene for, well, the socially <span class="highlight">prominent</span>, the upper class, who attended these functions, perhaps, because they felt obligated rather than because of a genuine interesting theater.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.49" data-time="46.65">[00:46.65]</span>But, in the 1860s, something else started to occur.<span class="time" data-times="5.69" data-time="51.14">[00:51.14]</span>The middle-class population began to grow, and they were looking for a source of entertainment.<span class="time" data-times="4.31" data-time="56.83">[00:56.83]</span>Keep that in mind while I talk about the theater owner named William Wigley.<span class="time" data-times="9.44" data-time="61.14">[01:01.14]</span>In 1866, Willian Wigley had this show, um, and it was different from most shows on Broadway at the time because it wasn't an opera.<span class="time" data-times="8.27" data-time="70.58">[01:10.58]</span>And, it was developed right here in the United States, in English, unlike the operas which were typically Italian or French.<span class="time" data-times="5.06" data-time="78.85">[01:18.85]</span>Wigley also decided to <span class="highlight">incorporate</span> some fancy production techniques, stage effects.<span class="time" data-times="3.73" data-time="83.91">[01:23.91]</span>The show also included music to make it more entertaining.<span class="time" data-times="7.29" data-time="87.64">[01:27.64]</span>And, through a <span class="highlight">stroke</span> of luck, a world-renown ballet troop became available just as weekly show was about to open.<span class="time" data-times="3.41" data-time="94.93">[01:34.93]</span>So, he didn't hesitate to include the ballet dancers in his production.<span class="time" data-times="7.23" data-time="98.34">[01:38.34]</span>Along the lines of those special affects I mentioned, Wigley redesign the entire stage for the show.<span class="time" data-times="3.96" data-time="105.57">[01:45.57]</span>Every floor board on the stage could be lifted up or pushed down.<span class="time" data-times="1.39" data-time="109.53">[01:49.53]</span>They were all moveable.<span class="time" data-times="3.28" data-time="110.92">[01:50.92]</span>This allowed for trap doors to be placed anywhere on the stage.<span class="time" data-times="5.09" data-time="114.2">[01:54.20]</span>So, pieces of the set, of the scenery, could easily be stored beneath the stage.<span class="time" data-times="6.85" data-time="119.29">[01:59.29]</span>And these trap doors also gave performers another less traditional way to enter in exit of the stage.<span class="time" data-times="8.64" data-time="126.14">[02:06.14]</span>Well, today, we might not think much of it, things like this are standard nowadays，the <span class="highlight">concept</span> was quite novel at the time of Wigley show.<span class="time" data-times="4.63" data-time="134.78">[02:14.78]</span>And was one of the things that made the show a hit with audiences.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="14.06" data-time="139.41">[02:19.41]</span>Another innovative element in the show was a scene called the '<span class="highlight">transformation</span> scene', during this scene, the audience watched in amazement that a setting on stage changed from a moonlit cave to a throne room in a palace.<span class="time" data-times="10.49" data-time="153.47">[02:33.47]</span>Normally to have this type of major scene change, the curtains were closed, the stage crew would remove the previous set and replaced it with the new one, and then, the curtains would open again.<span class="time" data-times="5.7" data-time="163.96">[02:43.96]</span>In this <span class="highlight">instance</span> though, the <span class="highlight">transformation</span> took place in front of the audience using simple <span class="highlight">machinery</span>.<span class="time" data-times="4.83" data-time="169.66">[02:49.66]</span>And this effect would have the lasting impression on everyone who saw Wigley's production.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="9.35" data-time="174.49">[02:54.49]</span>In fact, those people were probably disappointed when they saw another show that didn't contain something is, well, as <span class="highlight">elaborate</span> or exciting.<span class="time" data-times="18.92" data-time="183.84">[03:03.84]</span>So, look, when it premiered, Wigley show took audiences by surprise, it appealed to large crowds including the growing middle-class, the show ran for almost two years straight in New York city, and achievement unheard of at the time when productions typically lasted weeks or months, not years.<span class="time" data-times="5.85" data-time="202.76">[03:22.76]</span>It also went on tour visiting different cities across the United States for over 25 years.<span class="time" data-times="3.11" data-time="208.61">[03:28.61]</span>So, the show was quite a success.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.04" data-time="211.72">[03:31.72]</span>And with all that in mind, some people call Wigley show the first musical on Broadway.<span class="time" data-times="6.09" data-time="217.76">[03:37.76]</span>Now our current definition of a musical is that it tells a story through dialogue and song.<span class="time" data-times="6.08" data-time="223.85">[03:43.85]</span>In Wigley show the musical sections, well, they didn't necessarily <span class="highlight">integrate</span> well with the story.<span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="229.93">[03:49.93]</span>Giving an overall impression of something more like a variety show, yes, everything was loosely focused around the central scene, so maybe it's fair to say then that the show gave audiences a hint of a new form of musical theater， that would ultimately appear on Broadway in the decades to follow.</p>

              <p>Analysis: This topic is the purpose of the subject, the question asked what is the main purpose of this speech? The article begins with a Broadway play and leads to Wheatley's drama. After the discussion on the elements of Wheatley's drama differs from the elements of early drama, the D term is correct. The meaning of the A option is: Describe the impact of Broadway's works on the drama. Although the article mentions Broadway's influence on the dramatic work, it is only a small detail of the article and is not the subject of the article. Item A is incorrect; Option B The meaning is: Explain how new science and technology are promoting Broadway's dramatic works. Although the article mentioned the use of science and technology in the mobile stage. But this is just to illustrate the mobile stage, not the purpose of the article, then item B is not correct; the C option means: the financial decision made by William Wheatley, owner of the evaluation theatre, was not mentioned in the article. So this belongs to nothing.</p>

Why does the subject ask the professor to mention the movable floor on the stage in Wheatley's work? Earlier mentioned that Whitley combined his work with some interesting and novel technologies and stage effects, such as combining music and ballet, and redesigned the stage. The movable floor is one of the innovations of the work. The B option is correct. The meaning of the A option is: In order to explain the reasons for an unexpected technical problem, the article does not mention to explain unexpected technical problems, then the A option is out of nothing; the C option means: In order to point out the United States early and The difference between contemporary dramas, although the article describes the difference between early drama and modern drama from many aspects, but the professor mentioned the purpose of moving the floor is not to prove this difference, then the C option is incorrect; D option means: In order to Give an example of making adjustments for the ballet.

            <div class="explanation">
              <p>Original source: Another innovative element in the show was a scene called the 'transformation scene', during this scene, the audience watched in amazement that a setting on stage changed from a moonlit cave to a throne room in a palace. Normally to have this Type of major scene change, the curtains were closed, the stage crew would remove the previous set and replaced it with the new one, and then, the curtains would open again. In this instance though, the transformation took place in front of the audience Using simple machinery. And this effect, would have the lasting impression on everyone who saw Wheatley's production. Analysis: This question is a detailed question, the title asks, how does the audience react to the moving stage in Wheatley's work? From the point of view, the audience is very surprised at the process of changing the stage, in which "was amazed by" is the conversion of "watched in amazement" and "scene-changing" is the transformation of "transformation scene". Item C is correct. The meaning of the A option is: The audience is very disappointed with the short duration of the stage, contrary to the original text, and excluded; the meaning of the B option is: The audience is very confused about the unfamiliar elements on the stage. The original does not mention confusion and exclusion; The meaning of the D option is: The audience is impressed and wrong with the stage staff's behavior of quickly moving items onto the stage, because the process of changing the scene is not impressive, not the process of props.</p>
