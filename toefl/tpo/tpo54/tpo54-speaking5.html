I've been meaning to talk to you. I'm afraid I have some bad news.</p><p>Jane: What's wrong, Professor Barry?</p><p>Professor: Well, it's the poetry reading we've been organizing. It turns out that the new arts center isn't going to be ready on time. So we won't be able to hold the reading there.</p><p>Jane: But it's scheduled for next week and it was supposed to be the opening event. I mean we've had a lot of local poets coming, and a lot of student poets, too.</p><p>Professor: So it looks like we may have to come up with a different plan.</p><p>Jane: Hum, I wonder if we could postpone the reading and then reschedule it once the center is finished.</p><p>Professor: That's possible, and then the reading would still be the first event there, which would be nice.</p><p>Jane: Right. It's just that we may not be able to get as many poets if we change the date. Several of them might have other plans.</p><p>Professor: Oh, that's a good point.</p><p>Jane: Well, instead of postponing it, we could try having the reading at the auditorium in the library. It's quite small, so, it might actually be better for reading. You know, cozier, less formal.</p><p>Professor: True, of course. Then fewer people can attend because the space is smaller. And I bet a lot of people would want to come. </p></article><section id="question"><h4>Question</h4><p>The student and the professor discuss two possible solutions to the student's problem. Briefly summarize the problem. Then state which solution you recommend and why. </p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>Well, the woman has got a problem that she is supposed to organize the poetry reading next week but the arts center, where the reading will be held, isn't going to be ready on time. There are two solutions for the woman to solve the problem. She could put off the reading and reschedule it once the center is finished or she could hold the reading at the auditorium in the library. I guess the woman should take the second solution for two reasons. First of all, it's not easy to call all these poets together if she choose to reschedule the reading on another day, and having the reading at the auditorium could at least make sure these poets have time to come. Second, an auditorium may be a better choice for holding the reading since it is cozier and less formal, and people may feel more comfortable there. The smaller place wouldn't be a problem because there must be some poets who won't be able to come, so actually the auditorium is large enough for a good number of people. All in all, I agree that the woman should hold the reading in the auditorium instead of rescheduling it on another day.</p></article></div></main></body></html>
