          <h4 class="w3-center">Community Service Requirement</h4>
          <p>A university education should encourage students to engage with the world around them, but I see less and less of that engagement on campus today. I propose, therefore, that the university make community service, such as working with the local children in town, a mandatory activity for all university students before they graduate. Creating a community service requirement is a good idea because it would strengthen the relationship between our school and the town. Additionally, in fulfilling the requirement, many students would discover a love of service that would inspire them to a lifetime of volunteer work in their future communities.
Sincerely,
Sarah Brown</p>

          <p>Woman: So what do you think about letter?</p>
          <p>Man: Well, it might sound like a good idea, but I really don't think it's going to have any of the benefits that the letter writer says it will.</p>
          <p>Woman: So you don't agree with it?</p>
          <p>Man: No, if anything, it's going to hurt our relationship with our town, I mean forcing students to volunteer, it's gonna make them see it as a chore, a nuisance, and so they are not going to put their hearts into it, which is going to make the university look bad.</p>
          <p>Woman: You are saying that students doing volunteer work in town will be unenthusiastic? And...</p>
          <p>Man: Right, it would be obvious they don't want to be there. That should not going to make things better, you know, in terms of how we are regarded by people in the local community.</p>
          <p>Woman: But maybe students would learn to like it.</p>
          <p>Man: I really doubt it. The whole idea that this is going to encourage students to do more volunteering in the future is just ridiculous. A lot of students are likely to come away from the experience with negative feelings about it.</p>
          <p>Woman：Yeah, especially if their studies suffer from being forced to spend time away from them.</p>
          <p>Man：All the students I know already complain about not having enough time as it is. So this extra work is going to be a bad experience, the hardly inspiration for them to pursue more volunteer work after they graduate. </p>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>Well, the man disagrees with the reasons and points made in the letter for two reasons. First of all, he believes that school-town relationship will be hurt by forcing students to do volunteer service since students won't put their hearts into the work and will just regard it as a nuisance. Second, he believes that the idea of creating community service requirement to encourage students to do more volunteering in the future is just ridiculous, since students do not have extra time for doing such things. As a result, it will only leave students negative feelings about it, let alone inspiring them to do more volunteering in the future. In a word, the man disagrees with the letter for the reasons stated above.</p>
