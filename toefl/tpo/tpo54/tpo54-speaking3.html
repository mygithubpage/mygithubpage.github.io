I propose, therefore, that the university make community service, such as working with the local children in town, a mandatory activity for all university students before they graduate. Creating a community service requirement is a good idea because it would strengthen the relationship between our school and the town. Additionally, in fulfilling the requirement, many students would discover a love of service that would inspire them to a lifetime of volunteer work in their future communities.

And...</p><p>Man: Right, it would be obvious they don't want to be there. That should not going to make things better, you know, in terms of how we are regarded by people in the local community.</p><p>Woman: But maybe students would learn to like it.</p><p>Man: I really doubt it. The whole idea that this is going to encourage students to do more volunteering in the future is just ridiculous. A lot of students are likely to come away from the experience with negative feelings about it.</p><p>Woman：Yeah, especially if their studies suffer from being forced to spend time away from them.</p><p>Man：All the students I know already complain about not having enough time as it is. So this extra work is going to be a bad experience, the hardly inspiration for them to pursue more volunteer work after they graduate. </p></article><section id="question"><h4>Question</h4><p>The man expresses his opinion of the student's proposal in the letter. State the man's opinion and explain the reasons he gives for holding that opinion </p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>Well, the man disagrees with the reasons and points made in the letter for two reasons. First of all, he believes that school-town relationship will be hurt by forcing students to do volunteer service since students won't put their hearts into the work and will just regard it as a nuisance. Second, he believes that the idea of creating community service requirement to encourage students to do more volunteering in the future is just ridiculous, since students do not have extra time for doing such things. As a result, it will only leave students negative feelings about it, let alone inspiring them to do more volunteering in the future. In a word, the man disagrees with the letter for the reasons stated above.</p></article></div></main></body></html>
