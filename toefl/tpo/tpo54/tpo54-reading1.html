Over the next 30 years, lumbering became a <span class="highlight">full-fledged</span> enterprise in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. Newly formed lumbering corporations bought up huge tracts of pineland and set about <span class="highlight">systematically</span> cutting the trees. Both the colonists and the later industrialists saw <span class="highlight">timber</span> as a <span class="highlight"><span class="question3">commodity</span></span>, but the latter group adopted a far more thorough and calculating approach to removing trees. In this sense, what happened between 1860 and 1890 represented a significant break with the past. No longer were farmers in search of extra income the main source for shingles, firewood, and other wood products. By the 1870s, farmers and city dwellers alike purchased forest products from large manufacturing companies located in the Great Lakes states rather than chopping wood themselves or buying it locally. </p><p>   The <span class="highlight">commercialization</span> of lumbering was in part the product of technological change. The early, thick saw blades tended to waste a large quantity of wood, with perhaps as much as a third of the log left behind on the floor as <span class="highlight">sawdust</span> or scrap. In the 1870s, however, the <span class="question5">British-invented band saw</span>, with its thinner <span class="highlight">blade</span>, became standard issue in the Great Lakes states' <span class="highlight">lumber</span> factories.Meanwhile, the rise of steam-powered mills <span class="highlight">streamlined</span> production by <span class="question6">allowing for</span> the more efficient, <span class="highlight">centralized</span>, and <span class="highlight">continuous</span> cutting of <span class="highlight">lumber</span>. Steam helped to automate a variety of tasks, from cutting to the carrying away of waste. Mills also employed steam to heat log ponds, preventing them from freezing and making possible year-round <span class="highlight">lumber</span> production. </p><p>   For industrial lumbering to succeed, a way had to be found to neutralize the effects of the seasons on production. Traditionally, cutting took place in the winter, when snow and ice made it easier to drag logs on sleds or sleighs to the banks of streams. Once the streams and lakes thawed, workers rafted the logs to mills, where they were cut into <span class="highlight">lumber</span> in the summer. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>If nature did not cooperate-if the winter proved dry and warm, if the spring <span class="highlight">thaw</span> was delayed-production would suffer. To <span class="highlight">counter</span> the effects of climate on <span class="highlight">lumber</span> production, loggers experimented with a variety of techniques for transporting trees out of the woods. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>In the 1870s, loggers in the Great Lakes states began sprinkling water on sleigh roads, giving them an <span class="highlight">artificial</span> ice <span class="highlight">coating</span> to <span class="highlight"><span class="question8">facilitate</span></span> travel. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>The ice reduced the <span class="highlight">friction</span> and allowed workers to move larger and heavier loads. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p><p>  But all the sprinkling in the world would not save a logger from the threat of a warm winter. Without snow the sleigh roads turned to mud. In the 1870s, a set of snowless winters left <span class="highlight">lumber</span> companies to <span class="highlight">ponder</span> ways of liberating themselves from the seasons. Railroads were one possibility.At first, the <span class="question10">remoteness</span> of the <span class="highlight">pine</span> forests discouraged common carriers from laying track.But increasing <span class="highlight">lumber</span> prices in the late 1870s combined with <span class="highlight">periodic</span> warm, dry winters compelled loggers to turn to iron rails. By 1887, 89 logging railroads crisscrossed Michigan, transforming logging from a winter activity into a year-round one. </p><p>  Once the logs arrived at a river, the trip downstream to a <span class="highlight">mill</span> could be a long and tortuous one.Logjams (buildups of logs that prevent logs from moving downstream) were common-at times stretching for 10 miles-and became even more frequent as pressure on the northern Midwest pinelands increased in the 1860s. To help keep the logs moving efficiently, barriers called booms (essentially a chain of floating logs) were constructed to control the direction of the <span class="highlight">timber</span>. By the 1870s, <span class="highlight">lumber</span> companies existed in all the major logging areas of the northern Midwest. </p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>1.The word "durable" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. readily available</p><p>B. long lasting</p><p>C. dense</p><p>D. flexible</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>This question is a vocabulary question.

The focus can not be missed EXCEPT, the election is not mentioned in the article. According to the positioning word "desirable" in the stem, we locate the sentence "Pin was always attractive for building purposes." The content after this sentence implies that it is the key information of this topic. "It is durable and strong, yet Soft enough to be easily worked with even the simplest of hand tools. It also floats nicely on water, which allowed it to be transported to distant markets across the nation." Exclude options from the information mentioned in the sentence. A option: It was long lasting, corresponding to durable, so exclude B option: It was relatively easy to transport, corresponds to floats nicely on water, can be learned by the waterway transport is relatively convenient, so also excluding C options: Its softness made it easy to Work with, corresponding to easily worked, excluded D option: It produced buildings that were were attractive, meaning "buildings made of pine wood are very attractive." The same attractive word confused the original "pinewood is very subject to architectural uses. "Welcome" misinterprets the original meaning, so D is the answer.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>3.The word "<span class="question3">commodity</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. product</p><p>B. problem</p><p>C. opportunity</p><p>D. advantage</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>This question is a vocabulary question.

Timber was much more expensive before the year 1860 because it was less readily available.</p><p>D. Timber came primarily from large manufacturing companies in the East.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>This question is a reasoning question. According to the stem is difficult to accurately locate, so from the options to the original to find if there is a corresponding sentence. The A option keyword "farmers' income" is targeted to "No longer were farmers in search of extra income the main source for shingles, firewood, and other wood products. ". It can be seen that farmers need to rely on wood products to increase revenue before 1860, Did not mention newly arrived settlers, more information than the original text, so ruled out. Option B: Timber came preposing from farmers who wished to supplement their income. Still can correspond to the original sentence A, translated as "by the 1870s, farmers no longer look for additional income, which is the main source of shingles, firewood and other wood products. "It can be inferred that wood was mainly derived from farmers who wanted to increase their income before 1870. Therefore, B is the correct option. The C option: Timber was much more expensive before the year 1860 because it was less readily available. The original did not mention the price of wood before the 1860s, nor did it say that it was not available. It is excluded. The D option: Timber came primarily from large manufacturing companies in the East. There was no mention in the original and conflicted with the option B, because it can be inferred that the timber mainly came from the farmers before 1870 and they wanted to increase their income, so D was wrong. of.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>5.Why does the author discuss the "<span class="question5">British-invented band saw</span>"?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

The saw had a thinner blade and became the standard at the factory at the time. Now look at the options. A: To give an example of how steam power led to technological advancements, the steam power in the option is not that of the <span class="question5">British-invented band saw</span>. It is characterized by a thinner blade, and the factory mentioned later in the meanwhile. With the nature of steam power, this option is an error message and is therefore excluded. B: To help explain how the thickness of a saw blade determines how much wood is wasted, the original saw that this saw is not to explain that the rough saw will waste wood. The beginning sentence of the paragraph states that "the commercialization of the logging industry is a technological change. The main reason why this paragraph was intended to show is that technology has made progress in the logging industry. This kind of saw was also invented through technological advancement. Later, it became a factory standard, indicating the importance of technology, so this option was wrong. C: To explain how competition with other countries benefited the American lumber industry Understanding is wrong, but the focus is not on British but on this kind of thinner blade, which misinterprets the meaning of the original text and has nothing to do with the main purpose of the paragraph "Technology to change the logging industry". . D: To illustrate the impact of new technology on the lumber industry The "science and technology change logging industry" at the center of the paragraph corresponds to the option "importance of new technology to the logging industry", so D is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>6.The phrase "<span class="question6">allowing for</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. encouraging</p><p>B. introducing</p><p>C. making possible</p><p>D. emphasizing</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="allowing for C"><p>This question is a vocabulary question.

Waste materials could be re-used as fuel to power the lumber mills.</p><p>D. Lumber production could continue throughout the cold winter months.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>According to "resulting from the use of steam in lumber," this can be navigated to: streamlined production by <span class="question6">allowing for</span> the more efficient, centralized, and continuous cutting of lumber. Steam helped to automate a variety of tasks, from cutting to the carrying away of Waste. Mills also employed steam to heat log ponds, preventing them from freezing and making possible year-round lumber production. The A option corresponds to both centralized and automated. The B option corresponds to the "efficient" and "makes the logging a year-round system," meaning that on a larger scale, it is excluded. The C option says that the discarded material can be referred to as the factory fuel. There is no mention of this information, so C is the answer. The D option corresponds to heat log ponds and prevent from freezing, so it is excluded.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>8.The word "<span class="question8">facilitate</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. expand</p><p>B. ease</p><p>C. transform</p><p>D. permit</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Question type: vocabulary questions Analysis: This title is vocabulary.

It would be more difficult to transport logs to streams and lakes.</p><p>D. Rivers would not be full enough in the spring to power mills.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The title is factual information. From "warm, dry winter interference" to "If nature did not cooperate-if the winter guaranteed dry and warm, if the spring thaw was delayed-production would suffer. To counter the effects of climate on lumber production, loggers experimented with a "The variety of techniques for transporting trees out of the woods." indicates that the main impact is transporting trees out of the woods, corresponding to the "difficult transport" of the C option. The original A option did not say that the trees had dried out. The B option was wrong. Winter is transported on a sled, not water. The wrong D option, mill is not powered by river, the original did not mention.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>10.The word "<span class="question10">remoteness</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. decline</p><p>B. density</p><p>C. size</p><p>D. isolation</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>This question is a vocabulary question.

". The A option decline means "decrease" and exclude. B option density means "density", exclude. C option size means "size" to exclude. The D option isolation means "isolation", which is close to the original meaning, so it is the answer.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>11.In paragraph 5, why does the author include the information that 89 logging railroads crisscrossed Michigan by 1887?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To argue that Michigan had replaced other Great Lakes states as the center of the lumbering industry</p><p>B. To provide evidence of the growing importance of logging railroads to the lumbering industry</p><p>C. To support the claim that Michigan winters had become more severe in the late 1800s than they had been earlier</p><p>D. To challenge the idea that climate discouraged the laying of track</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The author asked the author about the reasons for the log transport of railways. The whole section described the fact that due to the influence of warm dry winter, people finally forced the establishment of such a railway due to climatic reasons, indicating that the railway is indispensable, otherwise it would be impossible to transport logs. Option A said that in order to prove that Michigan replaced the Great Lakes as a logging industry center, the destination of transportation is the Great Lakes. The railway was built because it could not be transported and it was not intended to replace the Great Lakes. Option B stated that it proved to be more important for the logging industry and that the meaning of the original text was similar to that of the original text, so it was correct. The C option says that the winter in Michigan is more serious, wrong, and wrong in the center. The D option refuted the climatic obstacles in the distribution of railways. The logic was wrong because it was because of climate that it was necessary to build railways.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>12.According to paragraph 6, the construction of booms benefited the logging industry by</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. reducing the pressures placed on the northern Midwest pinelands in the 1860s</p><p>B. reducing the length of the downstream trip to a mill by as much as 10 miles</p><p>C. increasing the number of logs that could be floated down a river at a single time</p><p>D. allowing logs to move downstream more quickly and easily</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>From "booms benefit" to "To help keep the logs moving efficiently, barriers called booms (essentially a chain of floating logs) were constructed to control the direction of the timber. : A option: Reducing the pressure on the wood, wrong B. Options: Decrease the length of the plant by 10 km, error C. Option: Increase the amount of logs that can float in the river at one time, error D. Option: Allow the logs to run downstream It is faster and corresponds to the selection "moving efficiently", so it is the correct answer.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Some sleighs were capable of carrying over 100 tons worth of timber..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>This question is a sentence insertion question. First of all, from the perspective of lexical clues, the sentence "some sleighs" in this sentence indicates that the previous paragraph should mention sleighs, ice, weight, etc. This sentence translates as "Some sleds can carry more than 100 tons worth of wood." So we went back to the text to find the relevant sentence. First of all, the meaning of a block is "Once the stream lake is hydrolyzed..." Obviously it has nothing to do with sleighs. At this time, it should be directly transported by floating logs. The two squares say what will happen if the weather is not good, mentioning that the lumberjack used many methods to transport, and the saw given by the title did not match here. The third box said that workers tried to make artificial ice with water. There was no mention of transportation and sleigh. The fourth box said that these ices allow more weight to be carried, mentioning the keyword "weight" and thus filling the saw into the fourth, which is the D option, expressing the artificial ice before and after, so that the sleighs can carry more weight, Even more than 100 tons.</p></div></div><div id="question14" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>Increasing demands for timber in nineteenth-century America transformed lumbering in the Great Lakes region.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.During the nineteenth century, lumbering became a large-scale industry controlled by manufacturing companies rather than a local enterprise controlled by farmers.</p><p>B.Technological advances, including the use of steam power, led to increased productivity, efficiency, and commercialization of the lumbering industry.</p><p>C.Seasonal changes and severe winters made the development and laying of track for logging railroads slow and difficult.</p><p>D.After 1860 farmers continued to be the main suppliers of new timber, but lumbering companies took over its transport and manufacture into wood products.</p><p>E.The invention of new technology, such as band saws, allowed American lumbering companies to make a profit by exporting surplus lumber to Britain and other countries.</p><p>F.New methods for transporting logs to mills helped transform lumbering from a seasonal activity to a year-round activity.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="ABF"><p>This article is a concluding question. We in turn analyzed the options to find the correct answer: The hint given means: The demand for timber transport increased in the 19th century. The A option corresponds to the second paragraph of the article and states that "farmers and city dwellers alike purchased forest products from large manufacturing companies located in the Great Lakes states rather than chopping wood themselves or buying it locally." indicate that the manufacturing companies have replaced local The A option is correct. The B option corresponds to paragraph 3 of the article. The article mentions "streamlined production by <span class="question6">allowing for</span> the more efficient, centralized, and continuous cutting of lumber." and mentions steam plants, new saws, etc., which conform to the B option. The C option says that seasonal changes and severe winters make it difficult and slow to develop and train railways. In fact, it is a logistic error because it is not cold enough to cause railroads. It is therefore not selected. The D option says that after 1860 the peasants were still the main suppliers of new timber, but it was actually wrong. The original text says "No longer were farmers in search of extra income the main source for shingles, firewood, and other wood products. By the 1870s, farmers and city dwellers alike purchased forest products from large manufacturing companies located in the Great Lakes states rather than chopping wood themselves or buying it locally." Explain that the farmers are no longer the suppliers, but have given full ownership to the company, so D is wrong. The original E option did not mention timber trade with foreign countries. It was based on new scientific and technological tools from other countries. It was wrong. The F option corresponds to the fifth paragraph. Corresponding to the original "By 1887, 89 logging railroads crisscrossed Michigan, transforming logging from a winter activity into a year-round one." indicates that this new mode of transport no longer causes the logging to receive season restrictions. According to the original text, F is correct.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
