For over a century now, researchers have been trying to solve the mystery about zooplankton. You see some species of zooplankton migrate are... Um...... not the way birds do when the seasons change. But daily, in the phenomenon we call Diel Vertical Migration or DVM, in the Diel Vertical Migration, sole plankton swim up near the surface of the water during the night and swim down to Deeper water during the day. Depending on the species and region, this can be a round trip of between 100 and 400 meters. Analysis: This question is the main topic of the content. What are the main questions discussed by the teacher? At the beginning of the lecture, the definition of plankton was given, and it was mentioned that plankton migrated vertically every day. At night, microorganisms would swim to the surface of the water, and during the day they would swim to deeper waters. Scientists are trying to uncover This mystery, and later articles are all about scientists' conjecture on this phenomenon. The meaning of the A option is: The importance of zooplankton in the marine food chain is mentioned only at the beginning, not the subject, so it is excluded; the option B means: the mutual connection between the two tiny marine microbes, no mention of the connection, Excluded; the meaning of the C option: a physical characteristics of the zooplankton good at swimming, the original did not mention, it is excluded;</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>2.Why does the professor conclude that zooplankton must derive an important benefit from diel vertical migration?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Diel vertical migration uses up a lot of energy.</p><p>B. Diel vertical migration exposes zooplankton to predators.</p><p>C. Diel vertical migration prevents zooplankton from being able to digest phytoplankton.</p><p>D. Diel vertical migration forces zooplankton populations to live permanently in cold water.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>Corresponding to the original: For a tiny microscopic organism, that's a huge distance. Remember now, zooplankton can't swim very well and DVM requires a lot of energy. So there must be an important benefit to these daily up-and-down commuting. : This question is a detailed question. Why does the professor ask that the professor can draw conclusions that plankton can benefit in the process of moving up and down every day? In the subject, the professor mentioned that for a microbe, 100-400 meters is a huge distance, but zooplankton is not good at swimming, and vertical migration requires a lot of energy, so it consumes so much energy for the zooplankton. It must be because of the many benefits of daily up and down kinetic energy. The B option means: Longitudinal migration of day and night will cause zooplankton to be exposed in front of predators, contradicting the original. The original said that zooplankton migrated to avoid predators, so it was wrong; the C option means: the vertical migration of day and night would prevent Zooplankton to digest phytoplankton. The third theory of the original mentions that zooplankton swims into the cold water to digest and absorb, so the migration should be to promote absorption, so it is wrong; the D option means: the longitudinal migration of day and night makes the plankton population Can live permanently in cold water, the original did not mention it, so ruled out.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>3.What does the professor imply about bioluminescent zooplankton?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Their food source is different from that of other zooplankton.</p><p>B. They probably do not rely on diel vertical migration to avoid predation.</p><p>C. They migrate deeper than other zooplankton species do.</p><p>D. Most species are found in very cold water.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Corresponding to the original: But what do we do with the data showing that many kinds of zooplankton don't dive deep enough during the day to become invisible to predators or that others dive deeper than it's necessary to escape hunters' eyes. And some zooplankton are bioluminescent Which means that they have special organs that light up and make them visible even at great depth. Analysis: This question is an inference question. Why does the professor ask about fluorescent microorganisms? From the point of view, the professor explained that some zooplankton are luminous, which means that they have special devices that emit light so that they can be seen even in deep oceans. Therefore, they do not migrate to avoid predators. , then B is correct. The A option means that their food sources are different from other zooplankton and are not mentioned in the original text, so they are excluded. The C option means that they are deeper than other plankton migrating waters, and the original text does not mention it, so it is excluded; The meaning of the D option is: Most of the species were found in the cold water area, and the original was not mentioned, so it was excluded.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>4.Why does the professor mention fish that live in freshwater lakes?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To point out that many aquatic species exhibit diel vertical migration</p><p>B. To give an example of a species of fish that feeds on bioluminescent zooplankton</p><p>C. To make a comparison between fish and zooplankton</p><p>D. To support one of the theories explaining why zooplankton migrate</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>Corresponding to the original: Well, despite all these, we believe predator avoidance is a possible explanation because of studies done in fresh water lakes. It turns out there is a correlation between the presence or absence of vertical migration, and the presence or absence of fish that Find their prey by sight. Analysis: This question is for organizational structure questions. Why does the professor ask to mention freshwater fish? From the point of view, the professor mentioned the fish in the freshwater lake to explain the theory of migration of planktonic microorganisms and provided experimental support, so the D option was correct. The meaning of the A option is: In order to point out that many species of aquatic organisms will migrate vertically, but the example given by professors is not to illustrate this point, so it is excluded; the option B means: In order to give examples of species that use fluorescent microorganisms as food. However, this is not the purpose of the experiment, so it is excluded; the meaning of the C option is: In order to compare the fish with plankton, there is no comparison relationship and it is excluded.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>5.Avoiding predators is one possible explanation for why zooplankton dive so deeply in the ocean. What two other explanations for this phenomenon does the professor offer?Click on 2 answers</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To avoid ultraviolet light</p><p>B. To avoid strong ocean currents</p><p>C. To digest in colder waters</p><p>D. To find abundant food sources</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="AC"><p>Corresponding to the original: Some articles suggest that zooplankton migrate to avoid the sun's ultra-violet light. That would explain why some zooplankton are found at such great depth. Visible light may not penetrate very far down, but ultra-violet light can. And we know That some zooplankton have special pigments that protect them from the damage ultra-violet light can cause. if it takes a lot of energy for the zooplankton to migrate, they conserve energy while floating in deeper colder water. So while they're not feeding, They are quietly digesting in cooler water. Analysis: This question is a detailed question. The question asked by the professor asked, besides avoiding being preyed, what other explanations can be used to explain why plankton should infiltrate deeper into the sea? According to the information from the questions, the first explanation is to avoid ultraviolet radiation, and the second explanation is to digest and absorb in cold water. Then items A and C are correct. The meaning of the B option is: In order to avoid a strong current, the original is not mentioned, so it is excluded; the meaning of the D option is: In order to find a sufficient food source, the original is not mentioned, so it is excluded.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>6.What does the professor imply about the reasons for diel vertical migration in zooplankton?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. No single explanation for all species can account for this phenomenon.</p><p>B. Researchers have not been able to propose plausible theories to explain this phenomenon.</p><p>C. All individual organisms have several reasons for migrating.</p><p>D. Researchers were able to agree on an explanation for this phenomenon after many years of investigation.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>Corresponding author: But remember, zooplankton consist of any number of different organisms. From microscopic worms to crab larvae to tiny fish, and they are found in a large range of marine habitats, cold water, warm water, shallow water, deep water. So Parse: This question is an inference question. Ask questions about vertical migration. What does the professor imply? From the point of view, the professor emphasized the diversity and widespread distribution of zooplankton. Therefore, the vertical migration reasons for diverse zooplankton species are diverse. The A option is correct. The meaning of the B option is: research scholars can not give a reasonable explanation of this phenomenon, the original text has given a lot of reasonable explanations, it is contradictory with the original, exclude; C option means: every reason for the biological migration is good Several kinds, errors, and texts mean that each species may have its own reason for migration. Different species have different reasons for their migration. Therefore, the D option means: Researchers can agree with this phenomenon after studying for many years. Errors, research scholars have concluded that it is obviously wrong for many years.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
