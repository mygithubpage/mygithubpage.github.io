Explain why. </p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>In my eyes, childhood is indeed the best period of time in one's life. Being a kid is probably the most care-free phase throughout one's life. On the one hand, you are taken good care of by both your parents and grandparents, so you don't have to worry about how to make a living. You are free from stress or anxiety. After all, you are not the breadwinner. On the other hand, you enjoy your pure and sincere friendship with your little buddies who perhaps live just next door to you. There is much less competition, comparison or peer pressure among little kids. So you are loved, cherished, or even pampered. Childhood really seems like a peaceful and joyful time where you are not bothered by the trivial or mundane things that keeps bugging adolescents and adults.</p></article></div></main></body></html>
