Explain to your friend why this is or is not a good idea.</p></section><section id="sample-response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><article><p>I think it is a good idea for my friend to take one year off to work before go to college. My first reason is working for one year can help him know more about the society and some occupation. He will know more about the present situation of labor market and have a clear direction about which kind of courses he will choose in college time. Second, we all know that university tutoring fee keeps increasing. One year's job can help him save some money for college education and this will also lessen his parents' burden. This is why I support his decision.</p></article></section></main></body></html>
