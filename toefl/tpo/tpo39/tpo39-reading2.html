            <b>The Extinction of Moa</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>Between 80 and 85 million years ago, <span class="underline">Gondwanaland</span>, a <span class="underline">giant</span> <span class="underline">continent</span> made up of what today is Africa, <span class="underline">Antarctica</span>, Australia, and South America, broke up, thus causing what is now New Zealand to become separated from the larger <span class="underline">landmass</span>. After the separation, any creature unable to cross a <span class="underline">considerable</span> distance of ocean could not <span class="underline">migrate</span> to New Zealand. Snakes and most mammals evolved after the separation. Thus there are no New Zealand snakes, and bats, which flew there, and seals, which swam there, were the only mammals on New Zealand when <span class="underline">Polynesian</span> settlers (the Maori) arrived there about a thousand years ago.</p>
          <p>When the Maori arrived in New Zealand, they encountered birds that had been evolving for 80 million years without the presence of <span class="underline">mammalian</span> predators. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> The most <span class="underline">striking</span> of these animals must have been <span class="underline">moa</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> Now <span class="underline">extinct</span>, <span class="underline">moa</span> were <span class="underline">gigantic</span> wingless birds that stood as much as 10 feet (3 meters) tall and weighed as much as 550 pounds (250 kilograms). <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span> They are known from a <span class="underline">diverse</span> <span class="underline">array</span> of remains including eggshells, eggs, a few mummified carcasses, <span class="underline">vast</span> numbers of bones, and some older fossilized bone. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span> The <span class="underline">species</span> of <span class="underline">moa</span> that are currently recognized occupied <span class="underline">ecological</span> niches customarily filled elsewhere by large <span class="underline">mammalian</span> browsing herbivores. They may have had <span class="underline">relatively</span> low <span class="underline">reproductive</span> rates; apparently, they usually laid only one egg at a time.</p>
          <p>It seems possible that when Captain James Cook first visited New Zealand in 1769, <span class="underline">moa</span> (or at <span class="underline">least</span> one of the <span class="underline">moa</span> <span class="underline">species</span>) may have still survived in the <span class="underline">remote</span> areas in the western part of New Zealand's South Island. If so, these individuals would have been the last of their kind. <span class="underline">Climatic</span> conditions in New Zealand <span class="underline">appear</span> to have been <span class="underline">relatively</span> <span class="underline">stable</span> over the period during which <span class="underline">moa</span> became <span class="underline">extinct</span>. Different factors could have worked in <span class="underline">concert</span> to <span class="underline">account</span> for their <span class="underline">abrupt</span> disappearance.</p>
          <p>Vegetation was <span class="underline">considerably</span> altered by the Maori occupation of New Zealand, a change not easily explained by <span class="underline">climate</span> <span class="underline">variation</span> or other possible factors. Forest and shrubland burning appears to have reduced the <span class="underline">prime</span> <span class="underline">habitat</span> of many <span class="underline">moa</span> <span class="underline">species</span>. However, the main forest burning started around 700 years ago, after what <span class="underline">current</span> <span class="underline">archaeological</span> <span class="underline">evidence</span> indicates was the most <span class="underline">intensive</span> <span class="underline">stage</span> of <span class="underline">moa</span> hunting. While there appears to have been <span class="underline">extensive</span> burning on the east side of New Zealand's South Island, large forest tracts remained in the most southern part of the island. Because <span class="underline">major</span> <span class="underline">habitat</span> <span class="underline">destruction</span> seems to have occurred after <span class="underline">moa</span> populations already were <span class="underline">depleted</span>, and because some <span class="underline">habitat</span> that could have <span class="underline">sheltered</span> <span class="underline">moa</span> populations remained, it would <span class="underline">seem</span> that other factors were also at work in the <span class="underline">extinction</span> of these birds.</p>
          <p>For South Island, human <span class="underline">predation</span> appears to have been a <span class="underline">significant</span> <span class="underline">factor</span> in the depletion of the <span class="underline">population</span> of <span class="underline">moa</span>. At one excavated Maori site, <span class="underline">moa</span> remains filled six railway cars. The <span class="underline">density</span> of Maori settlements and artifacts increased <span class="underline">substantially</span> at the time of the most <span class="underline">intensive</span> <span class="underline">moa</span> hunting (900 to 600 years ago). This period was followed by a time of <span class="underline">decline</span> in the Maori <span class="underline">population</span> and a societal <span class="underline">transition</span> to smaller, less <span class="underline">numerous</span> settlements. The <span class="underline">apparent</span> <span class="underline">decline</span> fits the <span class="underline">pattern</span> expected as a <span class="underline">consequence</span> of the Maori's overexploitation of <span class="underline">moa</span>.</p>
          <p>Finally, the Maori introduced the <span class="underline">Polynesian</span> rat and the dog to New Zealand. The actions of these <span class="underline">potential</span> <span class="underline">nest</span> predators could have reduced <span class="underline">moa</span> populations without leaving much direct <span class="underline">evidence</span>. The Maori may have also <span class="underline">inadvertently</span> brought pests and <span class="underline">disease</span> organisms in fowls, which could have crossed over to <span class="underline">eradicate</span> <span class="underline">moa</span> populations. The possibility of analyzing <span class="underline">ancient</span> DNA to <span class="underline">identify</span> past diseases of <span class="underline">extinct</span> animals is being explored. However, <span class="underline">evidence</span> of such diseases is difficult to <span class="underline">determine</span> directly from paleoecological or <span class="underline">archaeological</span> remains. For these reasons, it is hard to <span class="underline">determine</span> the likelihood that introduced <span class="underline">disease</span> organisms were a cause of the <span class="underline">decline</span> of <span class="underline">moa</span>, but they are potentially <span class="underline">significant</span>.</p>
          <p>While the last of these possible causes remains speculative, <span class="underline">define</span> clues exist for the <span class="underline">action</span> of the first two causes. The story of <span class="underline">moa</span> <span class="underline">species</span> and their <span class="underline">demise</span> raises <span class="underline">ecological</span> issues on the <span class="underline">vulnerability</span> of <span class="underline">species</span> to human-caused changes - including altered <span class="underline">vegetative</span> cover of the <span class="underline">landscape</span>, change in the <span class="underline">physical</span> environment, and <span class="underline">modification</span> of the <span class="underline">flora</span> and <span class="underline">fauna</span> of a <span class="underline">region</span> by eliminating some <span class="underline">species</span> and introducing others.</p>
