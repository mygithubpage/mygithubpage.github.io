After the separation, any creature unable to cross a <span class="highlight">considerable</span> distance of ocean could not <span class="highlight">migrate</span> to New Zealand. Snakes and most mammals evolved after the separation. Thus there are no New Zealand snakes, and bats, which flew there, and seals, which swam there, were the only mammals on New Zealand when <span class="highlight">Polynesian</span> settlers (the Maori) arrived there about a thousand years ago.</p><p>When the Maori arrived in New Zealand, they encountered birds that had been evolving for 80 million years without the presence of <span class="highlight">mammalian</span> predators. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> The most <span class="highlight"><span class="question2">striking</span></span> of these animals must have been <span class="highlight">moa</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> Now <span class="highlight">extinct</span>, <span class="highlight">moa</span> were <span class="highlight">gigantic</span> wingless birds that stood as much as 10 feet (3 meters) tall and weighed as much as 550 pounds (250 kilograms). <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span> They are known from a <span class="highlight">diverse</span><span class="highlight">array</span> of remains including eggshells, eggs, a few mummified carcasses, <span class="highlight">vast</span> numbers of bones, and some older fossilized bone. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span> The <span class="highlight">species</span> of <span class="highlight">moa</span> that are <span class="question3">currently</span> recognized occupied <span class="highlight">ecological</span> niches customarily filled elsewhere by large <span class="highlight">mammalian</span> browsing herbivores. They may have had <span class="highlight">relatively</span> low <span class="highlight">reproductive</span> rates; apparently, they usually laid only one egg at a time.</p><p>It seems possible that when Captain James Cook first visited New Zealand in 1769, <span class="highlight">moa</span> (or at <span class="highlight">least</span> one of the <span class="highlight">moa</span><span class="highlight">species</span>) may have still survived in the <span class="highlight">remote</span> areas in the western part of New Zealand's South Island. If so, these individuals would have been the last of their kind. <span class="question5"><span class="highlight">Climatic</span> conditions in New Zealand <span class="highlight">appear</span> to have been <span class="highlight">relatively</span><span class="highlight">stable</span> over the period during which <span class="highlight">moa</span> became <span class="highlight">extinct</span>.</span> Different factors could have worked in <span class="highlight">concert</span> to <span class="highlight">account</span> for their <span class="highlight"><span class="question6">abrupt</span></span> disappearance.</p><p>Vegetation was <span class="highlight">considerably</span> altered by the Maori occupation of New Zealand, a change not easily explained by <span class="highlight">climate</span><span class="highlight">variation</span> or other possible factors. Forest and shrubland burning appears to have reduced the <span class="highlight">prime</span><span class="highlight">habitat</span> of many <span class="highlight">moa</span><span class="highlight">species</span>. However, the main forest burning started around 700 years ago, after what <span class="highlight">current</span><span class="highlight">archaeological</span><span class="highlight">evidence</span> indicates was the most <span class="highlight">intensive</span><span class="highlight">stage</span> of <span class="highlight">moa</span> hunting. While there appears to have been <span class="highlight">extensive</span> burning on the east side of New Zealand's South Island, large forest tracts remained in the most southern part of the island. Because <span class="highlight">major</span><span class="highlight">habitat</span><span class="highlight">destruction</span> seems to have occurred after <span class="highlight">moa</span> populations already were <span class="highlight">depleted</span>, and because some <span class="highlight">habitat</span> that could have <span class="highlight">sheltered</span><span class="highlight">moa</span> populations remained, it would <span class="highlight">seem</span> that other factors were also at work in the <span class="highlight">extinction</span> of these birds.</p><p>For South Island, human <span class="highlight">predation</span> appears to have been a <span class="highlight">significant</span><span class="highlight">factor</span> in the depletion of the <span class="highlight">population</span> of <span class="highlight">moa</span>. <span class="question8">At one excavated Maori site, <span class="highlight">moa</span> remains filled six railway cars.</span> The <span class="highlight">density</span> of Maori settlements and artifacts increased <span class="highlight">substantially</span> at the time of the most <span class="highlight">intensive</span><span class="highlight">moa</span> hunting (900 to 600 years ago). This period was followed by a time of <span class="highlight">decline</span> in the Maori <span class="highlight">population</span> and a societal <span class="highlight">transition</span> to smaller, less <span class="highlight">numerous</span> settlements. The <span class="highlight">apparent</span><span class="highlight">decline</span> fits the <span class="highlight">pattern</span> expected as a <span class="highlight">consequence</span> of the Maori's overexploitation of <span class="highlight">moa</span>.</p><p>Finally, the Maori introduced the <span class="highlight">Polynesian</span> rat and the dog to New Zealand. The actions of these <span class="highlight">potential</span><span class="highlight">nest</span> predators could have reduced <span class="highlight">moa</span> populations without leaving much direct <span class="highlight">evidence</span>. The Maori may have also <span class="highlight">inadvertently</span> brought pests and <span class="highlight">disease</span> organisms in fowls, which could have crossed over to <span class="highlight">eradicate</span><span class="highlight">moa</span> populations. The possibility of analyzing <span class="highlight">ancient</span> DNA to <span class="highlight">identify</span> past diseases of <span class="highlight">extinct</span> animals is being explored. However, <span class="highlight">evidence</span> of such diseases is difficult to <span class="highlight">determine</span> directly from paleoecological or <span class="highlight">archaeological</span> remains. For these reasons, it is hard to <span class="highlight">determine</span> the likelihood that introduced <span class="highlight">disease</span> organisms were a cause of the <span class="highlight">decline</span> of <span class="highlight">moa</span>, but they are <span class="question11">potentially</span><span class="highlight">significant</span>.</p><p>While the last of these possible causes remains speculative, <span class="highlight">define</span> clues exist for the <span class="highlight">action</span> of the first two causes. <span class="question12">The story of <span class="highlight">moa</span><span class="highlight">species</span> and their <span class="highlight">demise</span> raises <span class="highlight">ecological</span> issues on the <span class="highlight">vulnerability</span> of <span class="highlight">species</span> to human-caused changes - including altered <span class="highlight">vegetative</span> cover of the <span class="highlight">landscape</span>, change in the <span class="highlight">physical</span> environment, and <span class="highlight">modification</span> of the <span class="highlight">flora</span> and <span class="highlight">fauna</span> of a <span class="highlight">region</span> by eliminating some <span class="highlight">species</span> and introducing others.</span></p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Paragraph 1 supports which of the following inferences about mammal evolution?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

Most mammal species were already present in Gondwanaland before it broke up, between 80 to 85 million years ago.</p><p>C. No mammals that evolved after New Zealand separated from Gondwanaland were able to migrate to New Zealand.</p><p>D. No mammals evolved from the animals that originally inhabited New Zealand.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>According to the keyword mammal revolution given in the title, this topic is located in the first paragraph. After the separation, the general meaning of this part is that New Zealand is split from other continents. Any species that cannot cross the ocean cannot be migrated. To New Zealand. Snakes and mammals have only evolved since the division of New Zealand. So when a Maori arrived a thousand years ago, New Zealand's mammals had only migrated past bats and seals. So New Zealand's mammals are not native, and Option D is consistent with the question. The other three options do not meet the meaning of this paragraph.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question2">striking</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. abundant</p><p>B. attention getting</p><p>C. familiar</p><p>D. important</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>This question is based on the words in question to locate this sentence: The most <span class="question2">striking</span> of these animals must have been moa. The sentence is: The most shocking species in these must be terror. The meaning of <span class="question2">striking</span> here is shocking.

The general meaning of this sentence is that New Zealand's climate has been maintained during the period when the relatively stable. There are many factors that contribute to the sudden extinction of the terror bird, but given that climate conditions have not changed so much, climate factors can be ruled out. Meets Option A. Option B says that more species are also extinct. Option C explains why Terror Birds still survived in remote areas of New Zealand in the late 18th century. Option D says that changing weather conditions do not fit the question.

Forest burning was far less intense on New Zealand's South Island, where the majority of moa habitats were located.</p><p>B. Moa populations had already been significantly reduced before most of the forest burning started.</p><p>C. Moa became extinct long after the Maori had stopped the practice of forest burning.</p><p>D. Moa gradually adapted to changes that resulted from forest burning.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The title of this question lies in the following two words: Forest and shrubland appears reduced the prime habitat of many moa species. However, the main ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½, after the main currentaeological evidencedict was the most intensive stage of Moa hunting. The general meaning of these two sentences is that the burning of forests and shrubs has reduced the habitat of many terror species, but the most important forest fires occurred earlier than the most rapid extinction of terror birds. So the fear of bird extinction is not entirely due to the forest fire, Option B is consistent with the question. The other three options misinterpret the meaning of the original text.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the author say that "<span class="highlight">At one excavated Maori site, moa remains filled six railway cars</span>"?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

To suggest that moa hunting was largely limited to New Zealand's South Island.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="At one excavated Maori site, moa remains filled six railway cars C"><p>The sentence given in this question can be located in the fifth paragraph: At one excavated Maori site, moa remains filled six railway cars. The sentence is: At every evacuated Maori colony, the body of a tattered bird can be filled with six trains. . It can be seen that the Maori people are strong about hunting and killing birds. Option C meets. Option A said that in order to confirm how large the number of terror birds, too one-sided; Option B that proves that scientists like to study the details of terror birds, mistakes; Option D said that the hunting of terror birds is only limited to New Zealand, nor is it right. Select C.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Paragraph 5 presents which of the following as evidence that hunting was one of the factors responsible for the decline of moa?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The length of the period during which moa were intensively hunted.</p><p>B. The decline in the size of the Maori population in the period after moa were intensively hunted.</p><p>C. The large number of Maori living today in areas that were moa habitats.</p><p>D. The large number of hunting weapons that archaeologists have excavated.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The problem lies in the following: The density of Maori settlements and artifacts increased substantially at the time of the most intensive moa hunting (900 to 600 years ago). This period was followed by a time of decline in the Maori population and a societal. The two sentences are mainly about the Maori people's habitat is gradually increasing, accompanied by a strong hunting for the terror bird. After this, the Maori population was reduced in population density and began to move to building small, small-scale colonies. So after the mob was culled, the Maori's population has decreased and Option B is correct. Option A means that the evidence is the length of time it took to kill a terror bird, Option C means that a large number of Maori people live in a terror bird habitat, and Option D means that there are a large number of weapons to be killed. Select B.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 6, scientists may never know if diseases contributed to the extinction of moa because</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. previous research to establish the role of diseases in the extinction of animals did not yield any significant findings.</p><p>B. scientists have difficulty identifying past diseases from paleoecological and archaeological data.</p><p>C. moa's fossilized remains contain no DNA.</p><p>D. conducting such research is time-consuming and expensive.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>According to the problem, the problem is located in the original text: However, evidence of such diseases is difficult to determine directly from paleoecological or archaeological remains. The meaning of this sentence is: However, it is difficult to find these diseases in ancient ecology or in anthropology. evidence. Option B meets the meaning of this sentence. Option A means that there has been no significant result in the previous study on the role of disease in the extinction of the Terrorist bird. Option C means that there are no DNA in the Terrorist fossils. Option D means that these surveys are time consuming and expensive and do not meet the original text.
