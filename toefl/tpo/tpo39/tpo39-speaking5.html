        <h3>Listening Text</h3>
        <article>
          <p>Listen to a conversation between two students.</p>
          <p>W: How's it going Tom?</p>
          <p>M: So so. I've got a problem.</p>
          <p>W: What's up?</p>
          <p>M: Well, the theater club's going to be doing this play I really want to try out for. A production of Hamlet. It's my favorite Shakespeare play.</p>
          <p>W: OK.</p>
          <p>M: And I thought the auditions were next week but it turns out they are tomorrow morning. So I haven't prepared at all.</p>
          <p>W: Prepared what?</p>
          <p>M: Well, to audition, you have to perform a monologue. You choose a small part of the play, like two or three minutes, and you perform it for the director. And based on that, the director chooses which actors will get parts in the play.</p>
          <p>W: Oh OK. But you still have tonight to prepare.</p>
          <p>M: Well the problem is, I promised a friend I'd help him study for a big physics test tonight. He's not doing well in the class, and I got an A in that class last semester.</p>
          <p>W: OK.</p>
          <p>M: I mean I could just cancel, you know, just tell him sorry I can't help you tonight.</p>
          <p>W: Could he find someone else to study with?M: Yeah, he probably could, but I did promise him.</p>
          <p>W: Hmm.</p>
          <p>M: Another option would be, I can help my friend study for his exam, and then after we finish, I can just stay up late. All night if necessary, and prepare for the audition.</p>
          <p>W: That will still leave you enough time to prepare?</p>
          <p>M: Yes, I think so. I mean, it'll definitely be better to have more time, but...</p>
          <p>W: And you might not perform very well if you are tired.</p>
          <p>M: Yeah, hmm.</p>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>In the conversation, the man is facing a problem. He wants to act in a play which needs him to memorize a monologue. However, the date of the play is changed to tomorrow so he only has one night to prepare. Unfortunately, he has already promised his friend to help him with physics. It will cost lots of time tonight, too. The man has two solutions now. First solution is he could ask his friend to study with someone else. Second solution is he could first tutor his friend then stay up late to prepare his monologue. If so, he probably won't perform well because he will be too tired. I suppose the latter solution is better because a person should stick to his promise. And it may be difficult for his friend to find another A student in that course.</p>
