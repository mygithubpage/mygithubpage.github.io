of the lecture in a <span class="highlight">geology</span> class.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="17.66" data-time="3.71">[00:03.71]</span>Professor: Since Earth formed some four and a half billion years ago, the number of minerals here has increased <span class="highlight">dramatically</span>, from a few <span class="highlight">dozen</span><span class="highlight">relatively</span> simple minerals early on to over 4,300 kinds of minerals we can <span class="highlight">identify</span> today, many of them wonderfully <span class="highlight">complex</span>.<span class="time" data-times="5.35" data-time="21.37">[00:21.37]</span> A <span class="highlight">basic</span> question of <span class="highlight">geology</span> is how all these new minerals came into being. <span class="time" data-times="5.51" data-time="26.72">[00:26.72]</span>Well, recent studies have turned to <span class="highlight">biology</span> to try to explain how this happens.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.18" data-time="32.23">[00:32.23]</span>Now, much of <span class="highlight">biology</span> is studied <span class="highlight">through</span> the <span class="highlight">lens</span> of <span class="highlight">evolution</span>. <span class="time" data-times="16.51" data-time="36.41">[00:36.41]</span>And the <span class="highlight">theory</span> of <span class="highlight">evolution</span> suggests that as environments change, and <span class="highlight">inevitably</span> they do, some organisms will have characteristics that allow them to <span class="highlight">adapt</span> to those changes successfully, characteristics that help these organisms develop and <span class="highlight">survive</span>, and <span class="highlight">reproduce</span>. <span class="time" data-times="16.67" data-time="52.92">[00:52.92]</span>And when environments become more <span class="highlight">complex</span>, as tends to happen over time, those earlier adaptations, those variations, become the basis of yet other combinations and variations, and <span class="highlight">lead</span> to ever more <span class="highlight">diverse</span> and <span class="highlight">complex</span> forms of life.<span class="time" data-times="10.97" data-time="69.59">[01:09.59]</span> So from fewer, simpler and <span class="highlight">relatively</span><span class="highlight">similar</span> forms of life billions of years ago, life on Earth has now become a dazzling <span class="highlight">array</span> of <span class="highlight">diversity</span> and <span class="highlight">complexity</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.21" data-time="80.56">[01:20.56]</span>Well, some geologists now want to <span class="highlight">apply</span> this <span class="highlight">concept</span> to explain <span class="highlight">mineral</span><span class="highlight">diversity</span> too. <span class="time" data-times="8.25" data-time="87.77">[01:27.77]</span>The conditions that minerals are under are not <span class="highlight">constant</span>, conditions like <span class="highlight">temperature</span>, or <span class="highlight">pressure</span>, or chemical surroundings. <span class="time" data-times="5.86" data-time="96.02">[01:36.02]</span>These change, often in cycles, increasing and decreasing slowly over time.<span class="time" data-times="4.91" data-time="101.88">[01:41.88]</span> And as conditions change, minerals sometimes <span class="highlight">break</span> down.<span class="time" data-times="7.52" data-time="106.79">[01:46.79]</span> And their atoms recombine into totally new compounds as part of a <span class="highlight">process</span> some called <span class="highlight">mineral</span><span class="highlight">evolution</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="11.6" data-time="114.31">[01:54.31]</span>Now, minerals are not alive of <span class="highlight">course</span>, so this is not <span class="highlight">evolution</span> in quite the same <span class="highlight">sense</span> you'd have in living organisms, but there do <span class="highlight">appear</span> to be some parallels.<span class="time" data-times="9.87" data-time="125.91">[02:05.91]</span> Living organisms not only <span class="highlight">adapt</span> to their environment, but also <span class="highlight">affect</span> it, change the environment <span class="highlight">within</span> which other organisms may then develop.<span class="time" data-times="9.93" data-time="135.78">[02:15.78]</span> Likewise each new <span class="highlight">mineral</span> also enriches the chemical environment from which lots of other <span class="highlight">even</span> more <span class="highlight">complex</span> new minerals may be formed in the future.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="11.18" data-time="145.71">[02:25.71]</span>Beyond these similarities though, what's really <span class="highlight">fascinating</span> about <span class="highlight">mineral</span><span class="highlight">evolution</span> is the way minerals apparently coevolve with living organisms.<span class="time" data-times="2.51" data-time="156.89">[02:36.89]</span> Uh, what do I mean by that?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.12" data-time="159.4">[02:39.40]</span>Well, it's maybe a billion years after Earth's <span class="highlight">formation</span> that we first see <span class="highlight">evidence</span> of life.<span class="time" data-times="8.25" data-time="165.52">[02:45.52]</span> Of <span class="highlight">course</span> early life forms were <span class="highlight">primitive</span>, just tiny, single-celled microbes, but <span class="highlight">overtime</span>, they had a <span class="highlight">profound</span> effect. <span class="time" data-times="20.66" data-time="173.77">[02:53.77]</span>Huge numbers of these microbes began producing food by <span class="highlight">photosynthesis</span>, which of <span class="highlight">course</span> also freed up <span class="highlight">enormous</span> amounts of <span class="highlight">oxygen</span> and lots of that <span class="highlight">oxygen</span> interacted with the atoms of existing minerals, creating <span class="highlight">rust</span> out of iron for <span class="highlight">instance</span>, reacting with a whole <span class="highlight">range</span> of different metals to create lots of new minerals. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="16.61" data-time="194.43">[03:14.43]</span>Now, living organisms <span class="highlight">rely</span> on minerals, but they not only take in some minerals as nutrients, they also excrete others as <span class="highlight">waste</span> products, including what we call bio minerals, minerals that form with the help of biological life.<span class="time" data-times="6.54" data-time="211.04">[03:31.04]</span> We can see geologic <span class="highlight">evidence</span> of bio <span class="highlight">mineral</span> production in what are called stromatolites.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="10.78" data-time="217.58">[03:37.58]</span>Stromatolites look like wavy layers of <span class="highlight">sedimentary</span> rock, but they are really fossils, fossils of the <span class="highlight">waste</span> from microbial masts. <span class="time" data-times="7.63" data-time="228.36">[03:48.36]</span>Microbial masts are <span class="highlight">vast</span> colonies of one-celled organisms that were once the most <span class="highlight">prevalent</span> form of life on Earth.<span class="time" data-times="11.23" data-time="235.99">[03:55.99]</span> And the study of stromatolites indicates that these <span class="highlight">ancient</span> microbial masts interacted with minerals in the environment and left behind new compounds as <span class="highlight">waste</span> products. <span class="time" data-times="3.69" data-time="247.22">[04:07.22]</span>Bio minerals like carbonates, phosphates, and <span class="highlight">silica</span>.<span class="time" data-times="3.6" data-time="250.91">[04:10.91]</span> In fact, we've grown microbial masts in the <span class="highlight">laboratory</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.38" data-time="254.51">[04:14.51]</span>And over time, they too have produced some of the same sorts of minerals found in stromatolites. <span class="time" data-times="3.91" data-time="260.89">[04:20.89]</span>Uh, you don't need to know the details of the <span class="highlight">process</span> right now. <span class="time" data-times="3.14" data-time="264.8">[04:24.80]</span>We are still figuring out just how it works ourselves.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="11.02" data-time="267.94">[04:27.94]</span>But you might be interested to know that this <span class="highlight">concept</span> of <span class="highlight">mineral</span><span class="highlight">evolution</span> is being used in the search for <span class="highlight">evidence</span> of life on other planets. <span class="time" data-times="15.96" data-time="278.96">[04:38.96]</span>The thinking is that if certain minerals <span class="highlight">occur</span> here on Earth, as a result of a biological <span class="highlight">process</span>, and if we also find those same minerals on another <span class="highlight">planet</span>, this would suggest that life may have once existed there!</p><p><span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="294.92">[04:54.92]</span>But just because a <span class="highlight">particular</span><span class="highlight">mineral</span> is found on, say Mars or <span class="highlight">Venus</span>, we really shouldn't <span class="highlight">assume</span> that whatever caused it to turn up there, must be the same <span class="highlight">process</span> that formed that <span class="highlight">mineral</span> here on Earth.</p></article><div

They were comparatively few of them.</p><p>B. They were more complex than minerals formed on other planets.</p><p>C. Most were not affected by temperature and pressure changes on early earth.</p><p>D. Some of them are no longer being formed naturally on Earth.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The problem of this question is:</p><p>Since Earth formed some four and a half billion years ago, the number of minerals here has increased shortcut, a a few dozen relatively simple minerals early on to over 4,300 kinds of minerals we can identify today, many of them wonderfully complex In the process of the formation of the earth, the amount of minerals increased drastically, from merely practically simple minerals to more than 4,300 today, and many of today's minerals are complex in composition. Therefore, the previous amount of minerals was relatively small. Option A is correct. The remaining three options have no basis.
