              <span class="time" data-times="3.71" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of the lecture in a <span class="underline">geology</span> class.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="17.66" data-time="3.71">[00:03.71]</span>Professor: Since Earth formed some four and a half billion years ago, the number of minerals here has increased <span class="underline">dramatically</span>, from a few <span class="underline">dozen</span> <span class="underline">relatively</span> simple minerals early on to over 4,300 kinds of minerals we can <span class="underline">identify</span> today, many of them wonderfully <span class="underline">complex</span>.<span class="time" data-times="5.35" data-time="21.37">[00:21.37]</span> A <span class="underline">basic</span> question of <span class="underline">geology</span> is how all these new minerals came into being. <span class="time" data-times="5.51" data-time="26.72">[00:26.72]</span>Well, recent studies have turned to <span class="underline">biology</span> to try to explain how this happens.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.18" data-time="32.23">[00:32.23]</span>Now, much of <span class="underline">biology</span> is studied <span class="underline">through</span> the <span class="underline">lens</span> of <span class="underline">evolution</span>. <span class="time" data-times="16.51" data-time="36.41">[00:36.41]</span>And the <span class="underline">theory</span> of <span class="underline">evolution</span> suggests that as environments change, and <span class="underline">inevitably</span> they do, some organisms will have characteristics that allow them to <span class="underline">adapt</span> to those changes successfully, characteristics that help these organisms develop and <span class="underline">survive</span>, and <span class="underline">reproduce</span>. <span class="time" data-times="16.67" data-time="52.92">[00:52.92]</span>And when environments become more <span class="underline">complex</span>, as tends to happen over time, those earlier adaptations, those variations, become the basis of yet other combinations and variations, and <span class="underline">lead</span> to ever more <span class="underline">diverse</span> and <span class="underline">complex</span> forms of life.<span class="time" data-times="10.97" data-time="69.59">[01:09.59]</span> So from fewer, simpler and <span class="underline">relatively</span> <span class="underline">similar</span> forms of life billions of years ago, life on Earth has now become a dazzling <span class="underline">array</span> of <span class="underline">diversity</span> and <span class="underline">complexity</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.21" data-time="80.56">[01:20.56]</span>Well, some geologists now want to <span class="underline">apply</span> this <span class="underline">concept</span> to explain <span class="underline">mineral</span> <span class="underline">diversity</span> too. <span class="time" data-times="8.25" data-time="87.77">[01:27.77]</span>The conditions that minerals are under are not <span class="underline">constant</span>, conditions like <span class="underline">temperature</span>, or <span class="underline">pressure</span>, or chemical surroundings. <span class="time" data-times="5.86" data-time="96.02">[01:36.02]</span>These change, often in cycles, increasing and decreasing slowly over time.<span class="time" data-times="4.91" data-time="101.88">[01:41.88]</span> And as conditions change, minerals sometimes <span class="underline">break</span> down.<span class="time" data-times="7.52" data-time="106.79">[01:46.79]</span> And their atoms recombine into totally new compounds as part of a <span class="underline">process</span> some called <span class="underline">mineral</span> <span class="underline">evolution</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="11.6" data-time="114.31">[01:54.31]</span>Now, minerals are not alive of <span class="underline">course</span>, so this is not <span class="underline">evolution</span> in quite the same <span class="underline">sense</span> you'd have in living organisms, but there do <span class="underline">appear</span> to be some parallels.<span class="time" data-times="9.87" data-time="125.91">[02:05.91]</span> Living organisms not only <span class="underline">adapt</span> to their environment, but also <span class="underline">affect</span> it, change the environment <span class="underline">within</span> which other organisms may then develop.<span class="time" data-times="9.93" data-time="135.78">[02:15.78]</span> Likewise each new <span class="underline">mineral</span> also enriches the chemical environment from which lots of other <span class="underline">even</span> more <span class="underline">complex</span> new minerals may be formed in the future.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="11.18" data-time="145.71">[02:25.71]</span>Beyond these similarities though, what's really <span class="underline">fascinating</span> about <span class="underline">mineral</span> <span class="underline">evolution</span> is the way minerals apparently coevolve with living organisms.<span class="time" data-times="2.51" data-time="156.89">[02:36.89]</span> Uh, what do I mean by that?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.12" data-time="159.4">[02:39.40]</span>Well, it's maybe a billion years after Earth's <span class="underline">formation</span> that we first see <span class="underline">evidence</span> of life.<span class="time" data-times="8.25" data-time="165.52">[02:45.52]</span> Of <span class="underline">course</span> early life forms were <span class="underline">primitive</span>, just tiny, single-celled microbes, but <span class="underline">overtime</span>, they had a <span class="underline">profound</span> effect. <span class="time" data-times="20.66" data-time="173.77">[02:53.77]</span>Huge numbers of these microbes began producing food by <span class="underline">photosynthesis</span>, which of <span class="underline">course</span> also freed up <span class="underline">enormous</span> amounts of <span class="underline">oxygen</span> and lots of that <span class="underline">oxygen</span> interacted with the atoms of existing minerals, creating <span class="underline">rust</span> out of iron for <span class="underline">instance</span>, reacting with a whole <span class="underline">range</span> of different metals to create lots of new minerals. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="16.61" data-time="194.43">[03:14.43]</span>Now, living organisms <span class="underline">rely</span> on minerals, but they not only take in some minerals as nutrients, they also excrete others as <span class="underline">waste</span> products, including what we call bio minerals, minerals that form with the help of biological life.<span class="time" data-times="6.54" data-time="211.04">[03:31.04]</span> We can see geologic <span class="underline">evidence</span> of bio <span class="underline">mineral</span> production in what are called stromatolites.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.78" data-time="217.58">[03:37.58]</span>Stromatolites look like wavy layers of <span class="underline">sedimentary</span> rock, but they are really fossils, fossils of the <span class="underline">waste</span> from microbial masts. <span class="time" data-times="7.63" data-time="228.36">[03:48.36]</span>Microbial masts are <span class="underline">vast</span> colonies of one-celled organisms that were once the most <span class="underline">prevalent</span> form of life on Earth.<span class="time" data-times="11.23" data-time="235.99">[03:55.99]</span> And the study of stromatolites indicates that these <span class="underline">ancient</span> microbial masts interacted with minerals in the environment and left behind new compounds as <span class="underline">waste</span> products. <span class="time" data-times="3.69" data-time="247.22">[04:07.22]</span>Bio minerals like carbonates, phosphates, and <span class="underline">silica</span>.<span class="time" data-times="3.6" data-time="250.91">[04:10.91]</span> In fact, we've grown microbial masts in the <span class="underline">laboratory</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.38" data-time="254.51">[04:14.51]</span>And over time, they too have produced some of the same sorts of minerals found in stromatolites. <span class="time" data-times="3.91" data-time="260.89">[04:20.89]</span>Uh, you don't need to know the details of the <span class="underline">process</span> right now. <span class="time" data-times="3.14" data-time="264.8">[04:24.80]</span>We are still figuring out just how it works ourselves.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="11.02" data-time="267.94">[04:27.94]</span>But you might be interested to know that this <span class="underline">concept</span> of <span class="underline">mineral</span> <span class="underline">evolution</span> is being used in the search for <span class="underline">evidence</span> of life on other planets. <span class="time" data-times="15.96" data-time="278.96">[04:38.96]</span>The thinking is that if certain minerals <span class="underline">occur</span> here on Earth, as a result of a biological <span class="underline">process</span>, and if we also find those same minerals on another <span class="underline">planet</span>, this would suggest that life may have once existed there!</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="294.92">[04:54.92]</span>But just because a <span class="underline">particular</span> <span class="underline">mineral</span> is found on, say Mars or <span class="underline">Venus</span>, we really shouldn't <span class="underline">assume</span> that whatever caused it to turn up there, must be the same <span class="underline">process</span> that formed that <span class="underline">mineral</span> here on Earth.</p>
