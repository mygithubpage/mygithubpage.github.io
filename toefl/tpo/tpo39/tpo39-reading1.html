It is from the great libraries and word-hoards of these <span class="highlight">ancient</span> lands that the first texts emerged. They were written on <span class="highlight">damp</span><span class="highlight">clay</span> tablets with a wedged (or V-shaped) <span class="highlight">stick</span>; since the <span class="highlight">Latin</span> word for <span class="highlight">wedge</span> is cunea, the texts are called <span class="highlight">cuneiform</span>. The <span class="highlight">clay</span> tablets usually were not fired; sun drying was probably reckoned enough to <span class="highlight">preserve</span> the text for as long as it was being used. Fortunately, however, many tablets survived because they were accidentally fired when the buildings they were stored in burned.</p><p><span class="highlight">Cuneiform</span> writing lasted for some 3,000 years, in a <span class="highlight">vast</span><span class="highlight">line</span> of <span class="highlight">succession</span> that ran <span class="highlight">through</span> Sumer, Akkad, Assyria, Nineveh, and Babylon, and preserved for us fifteen languages in an area represented by modern-day Iraq, Syria, and western Iran. The oldest <span class="highlight">cuneiform</span> texts recorded the transactions of tax collectors and merchants, the receipts and bills of sale of an <span class="highlight">urban</span> society. They had to do with things like <span class="highlight">grain</span>, goats, and real <span class="highlight">estate</span>. Later, <span class="highlight">Babylonian</span> scribes recorded the laws and kept other kinds of records. Knowledge conferred power. As a result, the scribes were assigned their own goddess, Nisaba, later replaced by the god Nabu of Borsippa, whose <span class="highlight">symbol</span> is neither weapon nor dragon but something far more fearsome, the <span class="highlight">cuneiform</span><span class="highlight">stick</span>.</p><p><span class="highlight">Cuneiform</span> texts on science, <span class="highlight">astronomy</span>, medicine, and <span class="highlight">mathematics</span><span class="highlight"><span class="question5">abound</span>, </span>some offering <span class="question6">astoundingly <span class="highlight"></span>precise</span><span class="highlight">data</span>. One tablet records the speed of the Moon over 248 days; another documents <span class="question7">an early sighting of Halley's Cornet, from September 22 to September 28, 164 B.C.E. </span>More esoteric texts <span class="highlight">attempt</span> to explain old <span class="highlight">Babylonian</span> customs, such as the <span class="highlight">procedure</span> for curing someone who is ill, which included rubbing tar and gypsum on the sick person's door and drawing a design at the foot of the person's bed. What is <span class="highlight">clear</span> from the <span class="highlight">vast</span> body of texts (some 20,000 tablets were found in King Ashurbanipal's library at Nineveh) is that scribes took pride in their writing and knowledge.</p><p>The <span class="highlight"><span class="question8">foremost</span><span class="highlight"></span>cuneiform</span> text, the <span class="highlight">Babylonian</span><span class="highlight">Epic</span> of Gilgamesh, deals with humankind's attempts to <span class="highlight">conquer</span> time. In it, Gilgamesh, king and warrior, is crushed by the death of his best friend and so sets out on adventures that prefigure <span class="highlight">mythical</span> heroes of <span class="highlight">ancient</span> Greek legends such as Hercules. His goal is not just to <span class="highlight">survive</span> his ordeals but to make <span class="highlight">sense</span> of this life. Remarkably, versions of Gilgamesh <span class="highlight">span</span> 1,500 years, between 2100 B.C.E and 600 B.C.E., making the story the <span class="highlight">epic</span> of an entire <span class="highlight">civilization</span>.</p><p>The <span class="highlight">ancient</span> Egyptians invented a different way of writing and a new <span class="highlight">substance</span> to write on - <span class="highlight">papyrus</span>, a <span class="highlight">precursor</span> of paper, made from a wetland plant. The Greeks had a <span class="highlight">special</span> name for this writing: hiero glyphic, <span class="highlight">literally</span> "<span class="highlight">sacred</span> writing". This, they thought, was language fit for the gods, which explains why it was carved on walls of pyramids and other <span class="highlight">religious</span> structures. Perhaps hieroglyphics are Egypt's great <span class="highlight">contribution</span> to the <span class="highlight">history</span> of writing: hieroglyphic wiring, in use from 3100 B.C.E. until 394 C.E., resulted in the creation of texts that were fine art as well as communication. Egypt gave us the tradition of the scribe not just as <span class="highlight">educated</span> person but as artist and calligrapher.</p><p>Scholars have <span class="question10">detected </span>some 6,000 <span class="highlight">separate</span> hieroglyphic characters in use over the <span class="highlight">history</span> of Egyptian writing, but it appears that never more than a thousand were in use during any one period. It still seems a lot to <span class="highlight">recall</span>, but what was lost in <span class="highlight">efficiency</span> was more than made up for in the beauty and richness of the texts. Writing was meant to impress the eye with the vastness of creating itself. Each <span class="highlight">symbol</span> or glyph - the flowering reed (<span class="highlight">pronounced</span> like V), the <span class="highlight">owl</span> ("m"), the quail chick ("w"), etcetera - was a tiny work of art. Manuscripts were compiled with an eye to the <span class="highlight">overall</span> design. <span class="question11">Egyptologists have noticed that the glyphs that <span class="highlight">constitute</span><span class="highlight">individual</span> words were sometimes shuffled to make the text more <span class="highlight">pleasing</span> to the eye with little regard for <span class="highlight">sound</span> or <span class="highlight">sense</span>.</span></p></article></div><div id="question"><div id="question1"><p>Paragraph 1 supports which of the following ideas about the method of preserving cuneiform texts by sun drying them?</p><label class="my-label"><span>A.
