It is from the great libraries and word-hoards of these <span class="highlight">ancient</span> lands that the first texts emerged. They were written on <span class="highlight">damp</span><span class="highlight">clay</span> tablets with a wedged (or V-shaped) <span class="highlight">stick</span>; since the <span class="highlight">Latin</span> word for <span class="highlight">wedge</span> is cunea, the texts are called <span class="highlight">cuneiform</span>. The <span class="highlight">clay</span> tablets usually were not fired; sun drying was probably reckoned enough to <span class="highlight">preserve</span> the text for as long as it was being used. Fortunately, however, many tablets survived because they were accidentally fired when the buildings they were stored in burned.</p><p><span class="highlight">Cuneiform</span> writing lasted for some 3,000 years, in a <span class="highlight">vast</span><span class="highlight">line</span> of <span class="highlight">succession</span> that ran <span class="highlight">through</span> Sumer, Akkad, Assyria, Nineveh, and Babylon, and preserved for us fifteen languages in an area represented by modern-day Iraq, Syria, and western Iran. The oldest <span class="highlight">cuneiform</span> texts recorded the transactions of tax collectors and merchants, the receipts and bills of sale of an <span class="highlight">urban</span> society. They had to do with things like <span class="highlight">grain</span>, goats, and real <span class="highlight">estate</span>. Later, <span class="highlight">Babylonian</span> scribes recorded the laws and kept other kinds of records. Knowledge conferred power. As a result, the scribes were assigned their own goddess, Nisaba, later replaced by the god Nabu of Borsippa, whose <span class="highlight">symbol</span> is neither weapon nor dragon but something far more fearsome, the <span class="highlight">cuneiform</span><span class="highlight">stick</span>.</p><p><span class="highlight">Cuneiform</span> texts on science, <span class="highlight">astronomy</span>, medicine, and <span class="highlight">mathematics</span><span class="highlight"><span class="question5">abound</span></span>, some offering <span class="question6">astoundingly</span><span class="highlight">precise</span><span class="highlight">data</span>. One tablet records the speed of the Moon over 248 days; another documents <span class="question7">an early sighting of Halley's Cornet, from September 22 to September 28, 164 B.C.E.</span> More esoteric texts <span class="highlight">attempt</span> to explain old <span class="highlight">Babylonian</span> customs, such as the <span class="highlight">procedure</span> for curing someone who is ill, which included rubbing tar and gypsum on the sick person's door and drawing a design at the foot of the person's bed. What is <span class="highlight">clear</span> from the <span class="highlight">vast</span> body of texts (some 20,000 tablets were found in King Ashurbanipal's library at Nineveh) is that scribes took pride in their writing and knowledge.</p><p>The <span class="highlight"><span class="question8">foremost</span></span><span class="highlight">cuneiform</span> text, the <span class="highlight">Babylonian</span><span class="highlight">Epic</span> of Gilgamesh, deals with humankind's attempts to <span class="highlight">conquer</span> time. In it, Gilgamesh, king and warrior, is crushed by the death of his best friend and so sets out on adventures that prefigure <span class="highlight">mythical</span> heroes of <span class="highlight">ancient</span> Greek legends such as Hercules. His goal is not just to <span class="highlight">survive</span> his ordeals but to make <span class="highlight">sense</span> of this life. Remarkably, versions of Gilgamesh <span class="highlight">span</span> 1,500 years, between 2100 B.C.E and 600 B.C.E., making the story the <span class="highlight">epic</span> of an entire <span class="highlight">civilization</span>.</p><p>The <span class="highlight">ancient</span> Egyptians invented a different way of writing and a new <span class="highlight">substance</span> to write on - <span class="highlight">papyrus</span>, a <span class="highlight">precursor</span> of paper, made from a wetland plant. The Greeks had a <span class="highlight">special</span> name for this writing: hiero glyphic, <span class="highlight">literally</span> "<span class="highlight">sacred</span> writing". This, they thought, was language fit for the gods, which explains why it was carved on walls of pyramids and other <span class="highlight">religious</span> structures. Perhaps hieroglyphics are Egypt's great <span class="highlight">contribution</span> to the <span class="highlight">history</span> of writing: hieroglyphic wiring, in use from 3100 B.C.E. until 394 C.E., resulted in the creation of texts that were fine art as well as communication. Egypt gave us the tradition of the scribe not just as <span class="highlight">educated</span> person but as artist and calligrapher.</p><p>Scholars have <span class="question10">detected</span> some 6,000 <span class="highlight">separate</span> hieroglyphic characters in use over the <span class="highlight">history</span> of Egyptian writing, but it appears that never more than a thousand were in use during any one period. It still seems a lot to <span class="highlight">recall</span>, but what was lost in <span class="highlight">efficiency</span> was more than made up for in the beauty and richness of the texts. Writing was meant to impress the eye with the vastness of creating itself. Each <span class="highlight">symbol</span> or glyph - the flowering reed (<span class="highlight">pronounced</span> like V), the <span class="highlight">owl</span> ("m"), the quail chick ("w"), etcetera - was a tiny work of art. Manuscripts were compiled with an eye to the <span class="highlight">overall</span> design. <span class="question11">Egyptologists have noticed that the glyphs that <span class="highlight">constitute</span><span class="highlight">individual</span> words were sometimes shuffled to make the text more <span class="highlight">pleasing</span> to the eye with little regard for <span class="highlight">sound</span> or <span class="highlight">sense</span>.</span></p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Paragraph 1 supports which of the following ideas about the method of preserving cuneiform texts by sun drying them?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It was regarded as unnecessary for texts that were actively being used.</p><p>B. It was discovered accidentally.</p><p>C. It was used for texts intended for libraries but not for other texts.</p><p>D. It did not provide enough protection for texts to survive into modern times.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>According to the keywords preserved and sun drying given in this question, the sun drying was probably reckoned enough to preserve the text for as long as it was being used. And Fortunately, however, many tablets survived because they were accidentally Fired when the buildings they were stored in burned. The general idea of these two sentences is: At that time, people thought that relying on the sun to dry is only possible to save the cuneiform clay tablets, but the future cuneiform characters survived because they Inadvertently burned with the building where they were stored. So just relying on the sun to dry is not enough to save the text. Option D is consistent with the question. Option A says that this approach does not need to. Option B says that this approach was discovered by chance. Option C says that this approach is only used in the text stored in the library, and no basis was found in the original text. Select D.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 1, the name of the earliest form of writing reflects the fact that this writing was</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. inscribed on damp materials</p><p>B. preserved by accidental firing</p><p>C. made with a wedge-shaped stick</p><p>D. kept in libraries and word-hoards</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>This question is based on the keywords given in the title name and reflect to the original sentence. They were written on damp clay tablets with a wedged (or V-shaped) stick; since the Latin word for wedge is cunea, the texts are called cuneiform The general idea of this sentence is that the text is engraved on a moist clay slab with a V-shaped wedge-shaped stick, because the wedge-shaped word in Latin is cunea, so the text is called cuneiform. So we learned that the name of this text reflects that it was carved with a wedge-shaped stick. Option C is correct. Option A says that they are engraved on a moist clay plate. Option B says that they were saved by accidental fire. Option D says that they are kept in the library and the place where the text is stored. Select C.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>Select the TWO answer choices that, according to paragraph 2, indicate why cuneiform writing was important in societies of the Middle East.

It was used to record the established boundaries of the areas occupied by each society.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="BC"><p>This question needs to be read through the second paragraph. According to the questions, the important and socioeconomic texts recorded by the transactions and tax of the Middle East can be specifically targeted to the second paragraph: The oldest cuneiform texts recorded the transactions of tax collectors and merchants, the receipts and bills of sale of An urban society. They had to do with things like grain, goats, and real estate. Later, Babylonian scribes recorded the laws and kept other kinds of records. Knowledge conferred power. This paragraph mainly talked about the role of cuneiform writing in the Middle East. One is to record taxation and business activities, and later adds a record law. The last sentence points out: Knowledge empowers power and points out the importance of cuneiform writing. Options B and C correspond to tax business and law respectively. Double-select BC. Option A said to increase the exchange of people from different groups, and Option D said that the record boundaries were not mentioned.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>In paragraph 2, why does the author point out that Babylonian scribes were assigned their own goddess?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To explain why scribes in Babylonia were given the responsibility of writing laws.</p><p>B. To indicate a consequence of the fact that scribes were powerful in Babylonian society.</p><p>C. To explain why over time Babylonian scribes no longer recorded business transactions.</p><p>D. To explain how Babylonian scribes came to be associated with symbols of warfare.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>This question is based on the titles given by Babylonian scribes and assigned their own goddess: Nisaba, later replaced by the god Nabu of Borsippa, whose symbol is neither weapon nor dragon but something far more fearsome, the cuneiform stick. The general meaning is that people's goddess has been changing, and the goddess's hand is also changing things, from weapons to dragons, and finally replaced by wedge-shaped slate. In fact reflects the increasing importance of cuneiform writing. Option B is correct. Option A is meant to explain why cuneiform is responsible for writing the law. The meaning of Option C is to explain why cuneiforms no longer record commercial transactions. Option D is meant to explain why cuneiform writing has started to be associated with war.
