            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.6" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in a <span class="underline">biology</span> class.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.07" data-time="3.6">[00:03.60]</span>Professor: Your reading for today's class was about <span class="underline">potential</span> <span class="underline">alternative</span> sources of energy. <span class="time" data-times="6.64" data-time="8.67">[00:08.67]</span>So one thing I want to do today is <span class="underline">consider</span> one of those <span class="underline">potential</span> energy sources: <span class="underline">cellulose</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.58" data-time="15.31">[00:15.31]</span>Who can tell us what <span class="underline">cellulose</span> is? Alan?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.81" data-time="19.89">[00:19.89]</span>Student: <span class="underline">Cellulose</span>. Yeah. It's a <span class="underline">tough</span> <span class="underline">organic</span> <span class="underline">molecule</span> made of simple sugars. <span class="time" data-times="5.17" data-time="24.7">[00:24.70]</span>It's found in the walls of all plant cells, in grass, trees, all plants. <span class="time" data-times="5.03" data-time="29.87">[00:29.87]</span>And well, there's more <span class="underline">cellulose</span> than any other <span class="underline">organic</span> <span class="underline">molecule</span> on Earth.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.79" data-time="34.9">[00:34.90]</span>Professor: Good. It's also a <span class="underline">potential</span> <span class="underline">tremendous</span> <span class="underline">source</span> of energy in part because there's so much of it.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.21" data-time="41.69">[00:41.69]</span>Now, many organisms live on the energy they <span class="underline">derive</span> from consuming <span class="underline">cellulose</span>, like many <span class="underline">species</span> of <span class="underline">bacteria</span> or cows and goats. <span class="time" data-times="6.62" data-time="50.9">[00:50.90]</span>Cows and goats have evolved highly <span class="underline">specialized</span> <span class="underline">digestive</span> systems that allow them to metabolize <span class="underline">cellulose</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.07" data-time="57.52">[00:57.52]</span>Student: But it's hard for most <span class="underline">species</span> to <span class="underline">process</span> <span class="underline">cellulose</span>?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.54" data-time="60.59">[01:00.59]</span>Professor: Yes. And it's been very hard to develop a controlled way to <span class="underline">process</span> <span class="underline">cellulose</span> in a lab so that we can use the energy that's stored in it. <span class="time" data-times="2.92" data-time="69.13">[01:09.13]</span>It needs to be <span class="underline">converted</span> into <span class="underline">ethanol</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.51" data-time="72.05">[01:12.05]</span>Let me explain. <span class="time" data-times="7.05" data-time="73.56">[01:13.56]</span> <span class="underline">Ethanol</span> is a <span class="underline">liquid</span>, a kind of <span class="underline">alcohol</span> that's derived from processing sugars from plants, often corn. <span class="time" data-times="2.09" data-time="80.61">[01:20.61]</span>And it can be used as <span class="underline">fuel</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.02" data-time="82.7">[01:22.70]</span>Many researchers believe it is the key to ending the <span class="underline">reliance</span> on <span class="underline">gasoline</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.83" data-time="87.72">[01:27.72]</span>The problem is that the <span class="underline">amount</span> of energy we get from corn-based <span class="underline">ethanol</span> isn't much more than the <span class="underline">amount</span> of energy that gets put into making it. <span class="time" data-times="3.13" data-time="96.55">[01:36.55]</span>So it's not really <span class="underline">worth</span> it. Tina?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.45" data-time="99.68">[01:39.68]</span>Student: But <span class="underline">ethanol</span> made from <span class="underline">cellulose</span> is different?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.7" data-time="104.13">[01:44.13]</span>Professor: Yes. It's possible to get a vastly better energy <span class="underline">yield</span> on cellulose-based or cellulosic <span class="underline">ethanol</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.26" data-time="111.83">[01:51.83]</span>Student: Okay. So why don't we just use cellulosic <span class="underline">ethanol</span>?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.78" data-time="116.09">[01:56.09]</span>Professor: Well, the problem is that the <span class="underline">current</span> <span class="underline">method</span> for processing <span class="underline">cellulose</span> into <span class="underline">ethanol</span> is very expensive and can't be done on a large <span class="underline">scale</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.34" data-time="124.87">[02:04.87]</span>See? Currently there are two key steps in the <span class="underline">process</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.7" data-time="129.21">[02:09.21]</span>The first is breaking the <span class="underline">cellulose</span> down into sugars. <span class="time" data-times="4.22" data-time="132.91">[02:12.91]</span>This is done with an <span class="underline">enzyme</span>, a <span class="underline">specific</span> type of <span class="underline">protein</span>.<span class="time" data-times="11.29" data-time="137.13">[02:17.13]</span> And <span class="underline">second</span>, after the <span class="underline">enzyme</span> has broken down the <span class="underline">cellulose</span>, <span class="underline">yeast</span> and other microorganisms, microbes are added to <span class="underline">ferment</span> those sugars into cellulosic <span class="underline">ethanol</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6" data-time="148.42">[02:28.42]</span>Thing is, though, we are not too good at producing the enzymes that <span class="underline">break</span> down <span class="underline">cellulose</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.4" data-time="154.42">[02:34.42]</span>Those proteins are very difficult to make, to just <span class="underline">assemble</span> in a lab. <span class="time" data-times="5.54" data-time="158.82">[02:38.82]</span>So usually we <span class="underline">extract</span> enzymes from microorganisms that produce them naturally. <span class="time" data-times="5.56" data-time="164.36">[02:44.36]</span> <span class="underline">Unfortunately</span>, this is slow, expensive, and just not very <span class="underline">efficient</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.95" data-time="169.92">[02:49.92]</span>Student: So are they trying to develop a better way to make enzymes?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.62" data-time="173.87">[02:53.87]</span>Professor: Actually there's a <span class="underline">company</span> that thinks they can do better than that. <span class="time" data-times="5.73" data-time="177.49">[02:57.49]</span>It'd be more <span class="underline">efficient</span> and <span class="underline">therefore</span> cheaper to <span class="underline">combine</span> the two steps I mentioned into one. <span class="time" data-times="5.89" data-time="183.22">[03:03.22]</span>That is, have a single <span class="underline">organism</span> that breaks down <span class="underline">cellulose</span> and then produces <span class="underline">ethanol</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.96" data-time="189.11">[03:09.11]</span>So what this <span class="underline">company</span> is doing is searching around the world and gathering naturally occurring microorganisms that do both things.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.4" data-time="197.07">[03:17.07]</span>I mean, the best key to unlocking the power of <span class="underline">cellulose</span> may well lie in a <span class="underline">rare</span> <span class="underline">species</span> of <span class="underline">bacteria</span> or <span class="underline">yeast</span> in a jungle somewhere.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.08" data-time="205.47">[03:25.47]</span>So researchers at this <span class="underline">company</span> have discovered some microorganisms that <span class="underline">process</span> <span class="underline">cellulose</span> and produce <span class="underline">ethanol</span>. <span class="time" data-times="12.42" data-time="212.55">[03:32.55]</span>Now they are working on enhancing, improving certain natural characteristics of these microorganisms, manipulating them with <span class="underline">sophisticated</span> technology to make them work <span class="underline">even</span> more efficiently. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="224.97">[03:44.97]</span>The goal, which seems to <span class="underline">definitely</span> be <span class="underline">within</span> <span class="underline">reach</span>, is to design an engineer, a superbug, a <span class="underline">specific</span> kind of <span class="underline">microbe</span>, that makes cheap, <span class="underline">commercial</span> production of cellulosic <span class="underline">ethanol</span> a really possibility.</p>
