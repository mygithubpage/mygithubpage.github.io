So one thing I want to do today is consider one of those potential energy sources: cellulose.</p><p>The beginning of the lecture clearly shows what this lecture is about: a potential energy source - cellulose. Combining the latter, we know that cellulose has great potential to produce ethanol, but the conversion is very expensive, and temporarily it can not be put into use. Option D meets. The other three options do not match. Select D.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the speakers, why is cellulose such a significant potential source of energy?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Because it is so abundant in nature.</p><p>B. Because it is so easily created in a lab.</p><p>C. Because its enzymes have so many uses.</p><p>D. Because it can be processed in just a few steps.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The problem of this question is:</p><p>Professor:</p><p>Good. It's also a potential tremendous source of energy in part because there's so much of it.</p><p>Here it is clear why cellulose has great potential for generating energy, because it is very productive.

She thinks it will eventually become cheaper to produce.</p><p>D. She thinks researchers should invest more in its development.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The problem of this question is:</p><p>The problem is that the amount of energy we get from corn-based ethanol isn't much more than the amount of energy that gets put into making it. So it's not really worth it.</p><p>The professor here pointed out that cellulose can make ethanol, but the energy that needs to be put into is similar to the energy that the produced ethanol can provide.

And second, after the enzyme has broken down the cellulose, yeast and other microorganisms, microbes are added to ferment those sugars into cellulosic ethanol .</p><p>There are clear hints in the original text here. There are two steps to making ethanol. Cellulose is first broken down into sugars by enzymes, and yeast and other microorganisms are added to ferment these sugars into ethanol.

The professor then went on to talk about a company's approach. The company is trying to reform an enzyme and trying to adapt its properties to meet production.
