How to register for an upcoming job fair.</p><p>B. The woman's career goals.</p><p>C. How the woman should prepare for an upcoming event.</p><p>D. Possibilities for summer jobs on campus.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>This question requires listening to the dialogue. The beginning student mentioned that one of her sociology professors suggested that she come to the teacher in the conversation because her teacher knew there was a job fair soon and she might get a summer job. The subsequent conversations centered around the teacher's suggestion to ask for a girl's job, such as preparing a resume. So Option C is more in line with the original text. The remaining three are not well summarized. Select C.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the woman think she will prefer the smaller job fair?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. She will have more time to prepare for it.</p><p>B. The jobs available there are more suited to her interests.</p><p>C. One of her sociology professors helped organize it.</p><p>D. Fewer people will be looking for positions there.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The problem of this question is:</p><p>Student:</p><p>Well, I'm mainly interested in working with people, in human services.</p><p>Employee:</p><p>Well, in that case, we do have a smaller fair coming up, with smaller companies and some public service organizations. This one might be a better fit for you.</p><p>Student:</p><p>Yeah. I think that was the one my professor was talking about.</p><p>Here, the teacher told the girls that there was a small job fair, which was a small company and a social public service organization. The girls said this suits her major. Option B meets. The other three options do not meet. Select B.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Initially, what was the woman's attitude toward preparing a resume?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. She was concerned that it would take too much time.</p><p>B. She did not think it was necessary.</p><p>C. She did not think she could do it by herself.</p><p>D. She was certain that it would help her find a summer job.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The problem of this question is:</p><p>Employee:</p><p>You should dress professionally and have copies of your resume with you.</p><p>Student:</p><p>Copies of my resume? Do I really need that?</p><p>Here the teacher told the girls to bring their resume to the job fair. The girls were surprised and asked if they really needed them. So she first thought that a resume was not necessarily required. Option B meets. The other three options do not match. Select B.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the man mention that the career fairs are now open to job applicants from the community?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To show that the number of available jobs in the community has increased.</p><p>B. To indicate that the woman will be able to talk to people who have job experience.</p><p>C. To indicate that the career services center is funded by the local government.</p><p>D. To hint competition for the available jobs may be high.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The problem of this question is:</p><p>Employee:</p><p>Well, it's not a requirement, but a lot of students come to our career fairs. Plus, we've opened up these fairs to the public, to people in the neighboring communities. So anything you can do to make yourself look more.. .well...look more professional. That's gonna set you apart from the other job applicants.</p><p>Here is after the girls asked whether the resume is not necessary, the teacher told her that it is not necessary to ask, but because many students and the community also come back to the job fair, the competition is fierce, so if you want to apply for a larger success rate, the girls are better to make their own Professionalism. In this way, you can stand out from many candidates. Telling girls that there are many members of the community to apply for her to understand that the competition is fierce. Option D meets. The other three options do not meet. Select D.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>What does the man say the woman will be able to do on the career services center's Website?

Like we'll have a list of the companies that are going to be at the career fair by the end of the week. You should check it out and then maybe do Some research on the companies. That should help you when you talk to them too.</p><p>These two paragraphs are two suggestions given by the teacher to the girls. One is to make the resume a good one. The other is to advance the recruitment of the company on the Internet and prepare in advance. Corresponds to Option A and Option C respectively. The other two options are not based on the original text. Double-select AC.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
