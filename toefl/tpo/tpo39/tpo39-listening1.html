The main phases in Grotowski's career as a director.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The problem of this question is:</p><p>Professor:</p><p>Grotowski. Yeah, that's a little out of the mainstream. Pretty experimental.</p><p>Student:</p><p>That's what I wanted to talk to you about. I had a question about our essay and presentation.</p><p>.........</p><p>Student:</p><p>Yeah. Some of these ideas, uh, Grotowski's ideas are really hard to understand. They are very abstract, philosophical. And, well, I thought the class would get more out of it if I acted out some of it to demonstration.</p><p>This tells us at the beginning that boys think that Grotowski's view is rather difficult to understand because of too abstract philosophy, so he wants to perform for the classmates. Option B follows the original meaning. The other three do not meet. Select B.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the student imply when he talks about the play he recently attended?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

I was impressed with the performance. There sure are some talented people here. What did you think?</p><p>Student:</p><p>You know, Beth Henley is an okay playwright. She has written some decent stuff, but it was a little too traditional, a little too ordinary, specifically pondering the research I'm doing.</p><p>Here boys refer to a show they went to see a few days ago. He felt that the performance was OK, and the author wrote the rules, but it was ordinary and it was a bit unusual. He may want to see something more practical. Option B is for boys. The other three options do not match. Select B.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>What are two characteristics of Grotowski's theater that the speakers mention?

You really threw me for a loop. You know, you are used to just watching a play, sitting back, but this performance, borrowing Grotowski's principles, was really confrontational, a little uncomfortable. The actors looked right in our eyes, even moved us around, involved us in the action.</p><p>The two paragraphs talk about two characteristics of the students' performances: one is that the stage props are very simple, not many lights or beautiful costumes; the second is the professor, who saw a similar performance a few years ago. The audience is not just sitting in the back of the audience, but the actor will perform around the audience and let the audience feel close. These two points correspond to Option A and Option D, respectively. The other two options are not in line with the original text. Double-select AD.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor mention a play she attended several years ago?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To compare it to the play she saw the previous evening.</p><p>B. To suggest that Grotowski's principles do not necessarily lead to effective theater.</p><p>C. To show how different it was from Poor theater.</p><p>D. To provide an example of one of the ideas the student wants to research.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The problem of this question is:</p><p>Professor:</p><p>You know, you saw a performance several years ago.

The actors looked right in our eyes, even moved us around, involved us in the action.</p><p>Student:</p><p>Yeah. I hope I can do the same when I perform for the class. I'm a bit worried since the acting is so physical. That there's so much physical- inviting.</p><p>The professor here mentioned a show he had watched a few years ago. He thought that the performers of the show would go to the audience and let the audience perform in depth to demonstrate that the students wanted to do the same. Option D is in accordance with the original meaning. The other three options do not meet. Select D.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor imply about the acting the student wants to do?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Audiences are no longer surprised by that type of acting.</p><p>B. The acting requires less physical preparation than he thinks.</p><p>C. He will not be able to master that style of acting easily.</p><p>D. He should spend less time acting for the class and more time on class discussion.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The problem of this question is:</p><p>Professor:</p><p>Well, some actors spend their whole lives working on this, so don't expect to get very far in a few weeks, but I'm sure you can bring a couple of points across. And if you need some extra class time, let Me know.</p><p>The teacher here stated that many actors spend a lifetime studying the show and investing so much energy that students do not expect to make much progress in just a few weeks. Still reminding students that this style of performance is still not easy to grasp. Option C is appropriate. The other three options are not suitable. Select C.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
