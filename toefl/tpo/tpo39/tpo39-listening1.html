              <span class="time" data-times="5.85" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to a <span class="underline">conversation</span> between a student and a theater professor.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.61" data-time="5.85">[00:05.85]</span>Student: Hi, Professor Johns.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.82" data-time="7.46">[00:07.46]</span>Professor: Hey, didn't I see you at the performance of Crimes of the Heart last night?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.9" data-time="11.28">[00:11.28]</span>Student: Yeah. Actually my roommate had a small part in it.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.98" data-time="14.18">[00:14.18]</span>Professor: Really? I was impressed with the performance. <span class="time" data-times="2" data-time="17.16">[00:17.16]</span>There sure are some talented people here.<span class="time" data-times="1.33" data-time="19.16">[00:19.16]</span> What did you think?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.63" data-time="20.49">[00:20.49]</span>Student: You know, Beth Henley is an okay <span class="underline">playwright</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7" data-time="23.12">[00:23.12]</span>She has written some <span class="underline">decent</span> <span class="underline">stuff</span>, but it was a little too <span class="underline">traditional</span>, a little too ordinary, especially considering the research I'm doing.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.46" data-time="30.12">[00:30.12]</span>Professor: Oh, what's that?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.03" data-time="31.58">[00:31.58]</span>Student: On the Polish theater <span class="underline">director</span> Jerzy Grotowski.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.81" data-time="34.61">[00:34.61]</span>Professor: Grotowski. Yeah, that's a little out of the mainstream. <span class="time" data-times="1.41" data-time="39.42">[00:39.42]</span> <span class="underline">Pretty</span> <span class="underline">experimental</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.88" data-time="40.83">[00:40.83]</span>Student: That's what I <span class="underline">wanted</span> to talk to you about. <span class="time" data-times="2.51" data-time="42.71">[00:42.71]</span>I had a question about our <span class="underline">essay</span> and <span class="underline">presentation</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.09" data-time="45.22">[00:45.22]</span>Professor: Okay.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.58" data-time="46.31">[00:46.31]</span>Student: Yeah. Some of these ideas, uh, Grotowski's ideas are really hard to understand.<span class="time" data-times="2.4" data-time="50.89">[00:50.89]</span> They are very <span class="underline">abstract</span>, philosophical. <span class="time" data-times="5.76" data-time="53.29">[00:53.29]</span>And, well, I thought the class would get more out of it if I acted out some of it to <span class="underline">demonstrate</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.89" data-time="59.05">[00:59.05]</span>Professor: Interesting idea. <span class="time" data-times="3.11" data-time="60.94">[01:00.94]</span>And what happens to the <span class="underline">essay</span>?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.57" data-time="64.05">[01:04.05]</span>Student: Well, I will do the best I can with that, but <span class="underline">supplement</span> it with a performance. <span class="time" data-times="1.78" data-time="68.62">[01:08.62]</span>You know, bring it to life.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.74" data-time="70.4">[01:10.40]</span>Professor: Alright. But what exactly are we talking about here? <span class="time" data-times="4.2" data-time="74.14">[01:14.14]</span>Grotowski, as I'm sure you know, had several phases in his <span class="underline">career</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.54" data-time="78.34">[01:18.34]</span>Student: I'm mainly interested in his idea from the late 1960's: poor theater. <span class="time" data-times="4.62" data-time="83.88">[01:23.88]</span>You know, a <span class="underline">reaction</span> against a lot of props, light, <span class="underline">fancy</span> costumes, and all that. <span class="time" data-times="2.27" data-time="88.5">[01:28.50]</span>So it would be good for the classroom. <span class="time" data-times="1.74" data-time="90.77">[01:30.77]</span>I wouldn't need anything <span class="underline">special</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.19" data-time="92.51">[01:32.51]</span>Professor: Yes. I'm sure a lot of your classmates are unfamiliar with Grotowski. <span class="time" data-times="1.49" data-time="97.7">[01:37.70]</span>This would be good for them.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.56" data-time="99.19">[01:39.19]</span>Student: Right. And this leads...I think there's <span class="underline">overlap</span> between his poor theater <span class="underline">phase</span> and another <span class="underline">phase</span> of his, when he was concerned with the relationship between performers and the <span class="underline">audience</span>.<span class="time" data-times="2.87" data-time="108.75">[01:48.75]</span> I also want to read more and write about that.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.71" data-time="111.62">[01:51.62]</span>Professor: You know, I saw a performance several years ago. <span class="time" data-times="2.14" data-time="115.33">[01:55.33]</span>It really threw me for a loop. <span class="time" data-times="11.81" data-time="117.47">[01:57.47]</span>You know, you are used to just watching a play, sitting back, but this performance, borrowing Grotowski's principles, was really confrontational, a little uncomfortable. <span class="time" data-times="6.03" data-time="129.28">[02:09.28]</span>The actors looked right in our eyes, <span class="underline">even</span> moved us around, involved us in the <span class="underline">action</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.22" data-time="135.31">[02:15.31]</span>Student: Yeah. I hope I can do the same when I <span class="underline">perform</span> for the class. <span class="time" data-times="2.58" data-time="138.53">[02:18.53]</span>I'm a bit worried since the <span class="underline">acting</span> is so <span class="underline">physical</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.62" data-time="141.11">[02:21.11]</span>That there's so much <span class="underline">physical</span> preparation involved.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.69" data-time="143.73">[02:23.73]</span>Professor: Well, some actors spend their whole lives working on this, so don't <span class="underline">expect</span> to get very far in a few weeks, but I'm sure you can bring a <span class="underline">couple</span> of points <span class="underline">across</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.26" data-time="153.42">[02:33.42]</span>And if you need some <span class="underline">extra</span> class time, let me know.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.51" data-time="156.68">[02:36.68]</span>Student: No. I think I can fit it into the <span class="underline">regular</span> time for the <span class="underline">presentation</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="160.19">[02:40.19]</span>Professor: Okay. I think this will provide for some good discussion about these ideas and other aspects of the <span class="underline">audience</span> and their relationship to theatrical productions.</p>
