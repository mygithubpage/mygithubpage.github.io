The Forest Service's announced goal became "<span class="question5">Put out every forest fire by 10:00 A. M. on the morning after the day when it is first reported.</span>" <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> Firefighters became much more successful at achieving that goal after 1945, thanks to improved firefighting technology. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> For a few decades the <span class="highlight">amount</span> of land burnt annually decreased by 80 percent. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span> That happy situation began to change in the 1980s, <span class="highlight">due</span> to the increasing <span class="highlight">frequency</span> of large forest fires that were <span class="highlight">essentially</span> impossible to extinguish unless rain and low winds combined to help. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span> People began to realize that the United States <span class="highlight">federal</span><span class="highlight">government</span>'s fire-suppression <span class="highlight">policy</span> was contributing to those big fires and that natural fires caused by <span class="highlight">lightning</span> had <span class="highlight">previously</span> played an important role in maintaining forest structure.</p><p>The natural role of fire varies with <span class="highlight">altitude</span>, tree <span class="highlight">species</span>, and forest type. To make Montana's low-altitude ponderosa <span class="highlight">pine</span> forest as an example, historical records, plus counts of <span class="highlight">annual</span> tree rings and datable fire scars on tree stumps, demonstrated that a ponderosa <span class="highlight">pine</span> forest experiences a lightning-lit fire about once a <span class="highlight">decade</span> under natural conditions (i.e.., before fire <span class="highlight">suppression</span> began around 1910 and became <span class="highlight">effective</span> after 1945). The <span class="highlight">mature</span> ponderosa trees have <span class="highlight">bark</span> two inches thick and are <span class="highlight">relatively</span><span class="highlight">resistant</span> to fire, which <span class="highlight">instead</span> burns out the <span class="highlight">understory</span> - the <span class="highlight">lower</span><span class="highlight">layer</span> - of fire-sensitive Douglas fir seedlings that have grown up since the <span class="highlight">previous</span> fire. But after only a <span class="highlight">decade</span>'s growth until the next fire, those young <span class="highlight">seedling</span> plants are still too low for fire to <span class="highlight">spread</span> from them into the crowns of the ponderosa <span class="highlight">pine</span> trees. <span class="question7">Hence</span> the fire remains confined to ground and <span class="highlight">understory</span>. As a result, many natural ponderosa <span class="highlight">pine</span> forests have a parklike <span class="highlight">appearance</span>, with low <span class="highlight">fuel</span> loads, big trees spaced apart, and a <span class="highlight">relatively</span><span class="highlight">clear</span><span class="highlight">understory</span>.</p><p>However, loggers concentrated on removing those big, old, <span class="highlight">valuable</span>, fire-resistant ponderosa pines, while fire <span class="highlight">suppression</span> for decades let the <span class="highlight">understory</span> fill up with Douglas fir saplings that would in turn become <span class="highlight">valuable</span> when full-grown. Tree densities increased from 30 to 200 trees per <span class="highlight">acre</span>, the forest's <span class="highlight">fuel</span><span class="highlight">load</span> increased by a <span class="highlight">factor</span> of 6, and the <span class="highlight">government</span> repeatedly failed to <span class="highlight">appropriate</span> money to thin out the saplings. When a fire finally does start in a sapling-choked forest, whether <span class="highlight">due</span> to <span class="highlight">lightning</span> or human carelessness or (<span class="question10">regrettably</span> often) <span class="highlight">intentional</span> arson, the <span class="highlight"><span class="highlight">dense</span></span>, tall saplings (young trees) may become a ladder that allows the fire to jump into the crowns of the trees. The <span class="highlight">outcome</span> is sometimes an unstoppable inferno.</p><p>Foresters now <span class="highlight">identify</span> the biggest problem in managing Western forests as what to do with those increased <span class="highlight">fuel</span> loads that built up during the <span class="highlight">previous</span> half <span class="highlight">century</span> of <span class="highlight">effective</span> fire <span class="highlight">suppression</span>. In the wetter eastern United States, dead trees rot away more quickly than in the drier West, where more dead trees <span class="highlight">persist</span> like <span class="highlight">giant</span> matchsticks. In an <span class="highlight">ideal</span> world, the Forest Service would <span class="highlight">manage</span> and <span class="highlight">restore</span> the forests, thin them out, and remove the <span class="highlight"><span class="highlight">dense</span></span><span class="highlight">understory</span> by cutting or by controlled small fires. But no <span class="highlight">politician</span> or voter wants to spend what it would <span class="highlight">cost</span> to do that.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage?

To emphasize the importance of replanting seedlings after a forest fire.</p><p>B. To argue for increasing the effectiveness of laws to suppress forest fires.</p><p>C. To describe how fire affects a typical ponderosa pine forest in the absence of human intervention.</p><p>D. To explain the long-lasting damage that once occurred in the ponderosa pine forests of Montana before fires were controlled.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>This question is based on the keyword natural cycle given in the title and is located in the second half of the third paragraph. This paragraph mainly talks about the fire cycle of ponderosa trees. Every time a new fire comes up, because the tree is too short and does not burn the trunk of the tree, the flame is controlled on the ground and destructiveness is controlled. The author described this process as a way to explain to us the situation of the ponderosa tree when it was on fire, and of course without any intervention. Option C meets the meaning. The other three options do not meet the original meaning.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, why is the human preservation of Douglas fir sapling trees a threat to the ponderosa pine forest?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The presence of many sapling trees makes it more difficult for firefighters to reach the source of a forest fire.</p><p>B. Douglas fir saplings are expensive to maintain, leaving little government money for forest-fire suppression.</p><p>C. Saplings compete for space with the larger and more valuable fire-resistant trees.</p><p>D. Dense areas of tall sapling trees can spread fire to the crowns of larger, fire-resistant trees.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>This question is based on Douglas fir sapling trees and is located here: When a fire finally does start in a sapling-choked forest, whether due to lightning or human carelessness or (<span class="question10">regrettably</span> often) intentional arson, the dense, tall saplings young trees) may become a sentence that allows the fire to jump into the crowns of the trees. The general meaning of this sentence is that the new species of trees is prone to catch fire. Once the fire burns up, the tree is high enough in size and the oil is high enough. It is easy. Bring the fire to the canopy of the big tree, which leads to a forest fire. Option D meets the meaning of these few sentences. The remaining three options are misinterpreted.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question10">regrettably</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. unfortunately</p><p>B. surprisingly</p><p>C. probably</p><p>D. extremely</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" A"><p>This question is based on the words in question and is located in the original sentence: When a fire finally does start in a sapling-choked forest, whether due to lightning or human carelessness or (<span class="question10">regrettably</span> often) intentional arson, the dense, tall saplings (young trees) May become a ladder that allows the fire to jump into the crowns of the trees. The sentence is: When a fire finally burns down in a forest, either because of lightning or human carelessness or (unfortunately often Occurrence of intentional arson, the tall, dense branches of trees will become ladders of fire to the canopy. The meaning of <span class="question10">regrettably</span> in this sentence is unfortunate. Option A is unfortunate, Option B is surprising, Option C is possible, and Option D is extreme. Option A best fits <span class="question10">regrettably</span>.

The careful management of forests to reduce the buildup of fuel loads.</p><p>B. The preservation of a dense understory.</p><p>C. The occasional flooding of western forests to make them as wet as those in the East.</p><p>D. A return to the effective methods of fire suppression of the previous half century.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>This question is based on the keyword keyword solution to locate this sentence: In an ideal world, the Forest Service would manage and restore the forests, thin them out, and remove the dense understory by cutting or controlled small fires. Yes: An ideal solution is to thin or cut down the density of these highly oily trees and to closely control the occurrence of small fires. Option A meets the above statement. The other three options are not in accordance with the original meaning.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 5, people in the United States would probably not support the described forest-management and restoration techniques because they</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. think that the use of small, controlled fires may be too dangerous.</p><p>B. do not want to spend money on the expensive process of managing forest understory.</p><p>C. distrust the Forest Service due to the harmful fire-suppression techniques of the past.</p><p>D. do not want politicians involved in forest management.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The question is based on the following sentence in the previous question: But no politician or voter wants to spend what it would cost to do that. The sentence is: There is no politician or voter willing to spend the money needed for this solution . So the key is this method is costly. Option B meets. The other three options do not involve the meaning of this sentence.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Such a reduction seemed to demonstrate that the program of fire suppression was having its desired effect..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>This question first analyzes the sentence that needs to be inserted: Such a reduction seemed to demonstrate that the program of fire suppression was having its desired effect. Such a reduction in this sentence implies that the previous article also mentioned a kind of reduction. With this kind of presupposition, we tried each insertable position one by one, and found that the third insertion point was appropriate. The precedent sentence was matched with reduction and formed a logical relationship. Select C.</p></div></div><div id="question14" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>For several reasons, forest fires have increased in number and intensity in the western United States.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.Fire suppression, which was initially thought to be beneficial, and logging are two human activities that have caused an increase in large forest fires.</p><p>B.Because forest fires are dangerous to people's property and a waste of valuable resources, the Forest Service currently has a policy to suppress all fires within a day.</p><p>C.The Forest Scientists has not yet discovered exactly why the climate of western United States causes some types of trees but not others to catch fire.</p><p>D.Logging is much less likely than other human activities to have effects that contribute to large forest fires.</p><p>E.The biggest problem in Western forest management is the increased amount of fire fuel available in forests as a result of human activity.</p><p>F.The United States government and the public are unwilling to cover the costs required to reduce the increased fuel loads in Western forests.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="AEF"><p>This question needs to analyze each option in turn. Option A talks about the original intention of the forest fire extinguishing and the reasons for the forest fire. It summarizes the contents of the first paragraph. It is correct. Option B says that the reason for forest firefighting is the fear of wasting forest resources. The second paragraph of the original text does not mention it. ; Option C says that forestry scientists have not yet determined the impact of climate on the fires of different types of forests, and they have not mentioned them in the original text; they are wrong; Option D says that logging is unlikely to cause forest fires, errors, and logging will encourage forest fires; E spoke about the impact of the introduction of high oil content trees on the forest fires, summed up the contents of the fourth paragraph, and right; Option F talked about the situation of the U.S. government and people on spending huge sums of money to remediate forest trees, and summarized the contents of the sixth paragraph. ,correct.
