            <b>Forest Fire Suppression</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>Forest fires have recently increased in intensity and <span class="highlight">extent</span> in some forest types <span class="highlight">throughout</span> the western United States. <span class="question1">This recent increase in fires has resulted <span class="highlight">partly</span> from <span class="highlight">climate</span> change the recent <span class="highlight">trend</span> toward hot, dry summers and <span class="highlight">partly</span> from human activities, for <span class="highlight">complicated</span> reasons that foresters came increasingly to understand about 30 years ago but whose <span class="highlight">relative</span> importance is still debated.</span> One <span class="highlight">factor</span> is the direct effect of logging, which often turns a forest into something <span class="highlight"><span class="question2">approximating</span> </span>a huge pile of kindling (wood for burning): the ground in a logged forest may <span class="highlight">remain</span> covered with branches and treetops, left behind when the <span class="highlight">valuable</span> trunks are carted away; a <span class="highlight"><span class="highlight">dense</span></span> growth of new <span class="highlight">vegetation</span> springs up, further increasing the forest's <span class="highlight">fuel</span> loads; and the trees logged and removed are of <span class="highlight">course</span> the biggest and most fire-resistant individuals, leaving behind smaller and more <span class="highlight">flammable</span> trees.</p>
          <p>Another <span class="highlight">factor</span> is that the United States Forest Service in the first <span class="highlight">decade</span> of the 1900s adopted the <span class="highlight">policy</span> of fire <span class="highlight">suppression</span> (attempting to put out forest fires) for the <span class="highlight">obvious</span> <span class="highlight">reason</span> that it did not want <span class="highlight">valuable</span> <span class="highlight">timber</span> to go up in smoke, or people's homes and lives to be threatened. The Forest Service's announced goal became "<span class="question5">Put out every forest fire by 10:00 A. M. on the morning after the day when it is first reported." </span><span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> Firefighters became much more successful at achieving that goal after 1945, thanks to improved firefighting technology. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> For a few decades the <span class="highlight">amount</span> of land burnt annually decreased by 80 percent. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span> That happy situation began to change in the 1980s, <span class="highlight">due</span> to the increasing <span class="highlight">frequency</span> of large forest fires that were <span class="highlight">essentially</span> impossible to extinguish unless rain and low winds combined to help. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span> People began to realize that the United States <span class="highlight">federal</span> <span class="highlight">government</span>'s fire-suppression <span class="highlight">policy</span> was contributing to those big fires and that natural fires caused by <span class="highlight">lightning</span> had <span class="highlight">previously</span> played an important role in maintaining forest structure.</p>
          <p>The natural role of fire varies with <span class="highlight">altitude</span>, tree <span class="highlight">species</span>, and forest type. To make Montana's low-altitude ponderosa <span class="highlight">pine</span> forest as an example, historical records, plus counts of <span class="highlight">annual</span> tree rings and datable fire scars on tree stumps, demonstrated that a ponderosa <span class="highlight">pine</span> forest experiences a lightning-lit fire about once a <span class="highlight">decade</span> under natural conditions (i.e.., before fire <span class="highlight">suppression</span> began around 1910 and became <span class="highlight">effective</span> after 1945). The <span class="highlight">mature</span> ponderosa trees have <span class="highlight">bark</span> two inches thick and are <span class="highlight">relatively</span> <span class="highlight">resistant</span> to fire, which <span class="highlight">instead</span> burns out the <span class="highlight">understory</span> - the <span class="highlight">lower</span> <span class="highlight">layer</span> - of fire-sensitive Douglas fir seedlings that have grown up since the <span class="highlight">previous</span> fire. But after only a <span class="highlight">decade</span>'s growth until the next fire, those young <span class="highlight">seedling</span> plants are still too low for fire to <span class="highlight">spread</span> from them into the crowns of the ponderosa <span class="highlight">pine</span> trees. <span class="question7">Hence </span>the fire remains confined to ground and <span class="highlight">understory</span>. As a result, many natural ponderosa <span class="highlight">pine</span> forests have a parklike <span class="highlight">appearance</span>, with low <span class="highlight">fuel</span> loads, big trees spaced apart, and a <span class="highlight">relatively</span> <span class="highlight">clear</span> <span class="highlight">understory</span>.</p>
          <p>However, loggers concentrated on removing those big, old, <span class="highlight">valuable</span>, fire-resistant ponderosa pines, while fire <span class="highlight">suppression</span> for decades let the <span class="highlight">understory</span> fill up with Douglas fir saplings that would in turn become <span class="highlight">valuable</span> when full-grown. Tree densities increased from 30 to 200 trees per <span class="highlight">acre</span>, the forest's <span class="highlight">fuel</span> <span class="highlight">load</span> increased by a <span class="highlight">factor</span> of 6, and the <span class="highlight">government</span> repeatedly failed to <span class="highlight">appropriate</span> money to thin out the saplings. When a fire finally does start in a sapling-choked forest, whether <span class="highlight">due</span> to <span class="highlight">lightning</span> or human carelessness or (<span class="question10">regrettably </span>often) <span class="highlight">intentional</span> arson, the <span class="highlight"><span class="highlight">dense</span></span>, tall saplings (young trees) may become a ladder that allows the fire to jump into the crowns of the trees. The <span class="highlight">outcome</span> is sometimes an unstoppable inferno.</p>
          <p>Foresters now <span class="highlight">identify</span> the biggest problem in managing Western forests as what to do with those increased <span class="highlight">fuel</span> loads that built up during the <span class="highlight">previous</span> half <span class="highlight">century</span> of <span class="highlight">effective</span> fire <span class="highlight">suppression</span>. In the wetter eastern United States, dead trees rot away more quickly than in the drier West, where more dead trees <span class="highlight">persist</span> like <span class="highlight">giant</span> matchsticks. In an <span class="highlight">ideal</span> world, the Forest Service would <span class="highlight">manage</span> and <span class="highlight">restore</span> the forests, thin them out, and remove the <span class="highlight"><span class="highlight">dense</span></span> <span class="highlight">understory</span> by cutting or by controlled small fires. But no <span class="highlight">politician</span> or voter wants to spend what it would <span class="highlight">cost</span> to do that.</p>
