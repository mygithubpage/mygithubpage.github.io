to part of a lecture in an <span class="highlight">anthropology</span> class. <span class="time" data-times="3.32" data-time="3.03">[00:03.03]</span>The professor is discussing ethnography.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="10.16" data-time="6.35">[00:06.35]</span>Professor: Since ethnography is all about the <span class="highlight">descriptive</span> study of an <span class="highlight">individual</span><span class="highlight">culture</span>, <span class="highlight">film</span> has proved to have great value as a tool for anthropologists in their research.<span class="time" data-times="7.34" data-time="16.51">[00:16.51]</span> Let's look at a particularly <span class="highlight">effective</span><span class="highlight">approach</span> to ethnographic film-making, which was developed in the 1970s.<span class="time" data-times="6.5" data-time="23.85">[00:23.85]</span> This <span class="highlight">particular</span> style of ethnographic filmmaking is called the community-determined <span class="highlight">approach</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.85" data-time="30.35">[00:30.35]</span>The <span class="highlight">intent</span> of the community-determined <span class="highlight">approach</span> is to achieve a kind of, uh... shared authorship. <span class="time" data-times="11.69" data-time="38.2">[00:38.20]</span>See... in this <span class="highlight">approach</span>, the goals of the <span class="highlight">project</span> and how the information will be used are discussed ahead of time, and so a <span class="highlight">culture</span>, uh... <span class="highlight">community</span> is not just the <span class="highlight">focus</span> of the <span class="highlight">film</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.02" data-time="49.89">[00:49.89]</span>They are actually <span class="highlight">equal</span> participants in the whole ethnographic <span class="highlight">process</span>.<span class="time" data-times="12.07" data-time="54.91">[00:54.91]</span> In this way the <span class="highlight">film</span> revolves around the actual values and concerns of the individuals in the <span class="highlight">community</span>, and it honors an <span class="highlight">individual</span>'s <span class="highlight">ethical</span> right to control how he or she is presented in the <span class="highlight">media</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.82" data-time="66.98">[01:06.98]</span>Several of these films were made in Alaskan communities in the 1970's.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.42" data-time="71.8">[01:11.80]</span>Student: So how does it work, you know, the community-determined part?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.35" data-time="77.22">[01:17.22]</span>Professor: Well, it takes a lot of preparation.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="9.3" data-time="79.57">[01:19.57]</span>First, way before filming begins, the filmmakers visit the <span class="highlight">community</span> and meet with the village <span class="highlight">council</span> who are the decision-makers of the <span class="highlight">community</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.26" data-time="88.87">[01:28.87]</span>A <span class="highlight">film</span> if <span class="highlight">available</span> is shown to the village <span class="highlight">council</span> so that they get an idea of the experience of another <span class="highlight">community</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.87" data-time="96.13">[01:36.13]</span>After the meeting, the filmmakers leave and the village <span class="highlight">council</span> is <span class="highlight">given</span> all the time they need to think about what was discussed. <span class="time" data-times="5.22" data-time="104">[01:44.00]</span>Later, if the village <span class="highlight">council</span> members are interested, they send a letter or call.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="1.46" data-time="109.22">[01:49.22]</span>Student: There's no follow-up meeting?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="1.54" data-time="110.68">[01:50.68]</span>Professor: Not unless they want one. <span class="time" data-times="3.29" data-time="112.22">[01:52.22]</span>See, this helps remove any <span class="highlight">pressure</span> to say yes. <span class="time" data-times="2.65" data-time="115.51">[01:55.51]</span>The social <span class="highlight">pressure</span> from the filmmakers' presence.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.63" data-time="118.16">[01:58.16]</span>Student: So, if they agree, then what?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.87" data-time="120.79">[02:00.79]</span>Professor: Then the filmmakers start living in the <span class="highlight">community</span>. <span class="time" data-times="12.28" data-time="123.66">[02:03.66]</span>See, another <span class="highlight">major</span> point in the community-determined <span class="highlight">approach</span>... it's very important that the filmmakers plan to stay in the <span class="highlight">community</span> for an extended period of time, not weeks, but months.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.08" data-time="135.94">[02:15.94]</span>And really, there are several reasons for this. <span class="time" data-times="1.36" data-time="139.02">[02:19.02]</span>Any ideas?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.14" data-time="140.38">[02:20.38]</span>Student: The filmmakers could get a more <span class="highlight">realistic</span><span class="highlight">sense</span> of the pace of life in that <span class="highlight">community</span>? <span class="time" data-times="1.48" data-time="146.52">[02:26.52]</span>Uh, its daily <span class="highlight">rhythm</span>?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.25" data-time="148">[02:28.00]</span>Professor: Correct, and it allows the filmmakers to <span class="highlight">shed</span> some of their assumptions so that they better <span class="highlight">interpret</span> what they see.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.57" data-time="155.25">[02:35.25]</span>Student: I <span class="highlight">bet</span> it also takes the mystery out of the filmmaking <span class="highlight">process</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.63" data-time="158.82">[02:38.82]</span>You know, everyone has time to get used to the filmmakers and their equipment.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.6" data-time="162.45">[02:42.45]</span>Professor: Exactly, trust is established and relationships are built first.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.43" data-time="167.05">[02:47.05]</span>Student: Wow, this seems like a long <span class="highlight">process</span>. <span class="time" data-times="1.7" data-time="169.48">[02:49.48]</span>It must <span class="highlight">cost</span> a <span class="highlight">fortune</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="1.01" data-time="171.18">[02:51.18]</span>Professor: It does. <span class="time" data-times="5.42" data-time="172.19">[02:52.19]</span><span class="highlight">Even</span> with a small <span class="highlight">film</span><span class="highlight">crew</span> any <span class="highlight">project</span> as involved as this is <span class="highlight">bound</span> to.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.35" data-time="177.61">[02:57.61]</span>Student: OK, so who decides what goes into the <span class="highlight">film</span>?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.54" data-time="180.96">[03:00.96]</span>Professor: Well, such decisions are made by general <span class="highlight">consensus</span><span class="highlight">within</span> the <span class="highlight">community</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.47" data-time="185.5">[03:05.50]</span>So, for <span class="highlight">instance</span>, the <span class="highlight">community</span>, not the filmmakers, decide who is to be interviewed for the films.<span class="time" data-times="3.16" data-time="192.97">[03:12.97]</span> Control of the interview is in the interviewee's hands.<span class="time" data-times="5.46" data-time="196.13">[03:16.13]</span> If the person being interviewed says to stop at any time, the recording stops. <span class="time" data-times="6.37" data-time="201.59">[03:21.59]</span>He or she states where they wish to be filmed and when and what topic they wish to speak about. <span class="time" data-times="5.46" data-time="207.96">[03:27.96]</span>The <span class="highlight">community</span> members <span class="highlight">review</span> the footage both midway and at the end of the filming. <span class="time" data-times="3.27" data-time="213.42">[03:33.42]</span>And if they want any <span class="highlight">scene</span> deleted, it gets removed. <span class="time" data-times="7.26" data-time="216.69">[03:36.69]</span>That's the <span class="highlight">level</span> of <span class="highlight">respect</span> and regard for the interviewee's preferences and those of the <span class="highlight">community</span> in general.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.96" data-time="223.95">[03:43.95]</span>Student: So then what language is everything filmed in?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="1.57" data-time="228.91">[03:48.91]</span>Professor: Excellent question!</p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.25" data-time="230.48">[03:50.48]</span>Language is <span class="highlight">culture</span>, isn't it? <span class="time" data-times="7.62" data-time="232.73">[03:52.73]</span>So the native language, rather than a dubbed voiceover in the filmmakers language, is the <span class="highlight">primary</span> language of the <span class="highlight">film</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.16" data-time="240.35">[04:00.35]</span>This way a speaker's emotions and <span class="highlight">manner</span> of expression really come <span class="highlight">through</span>, <span class="highlight">even</span> if we don't know their language. <span class="time" data-times="4.91" data-time="247.51">[04:07.51]</span>Subtitles are placed in a secondary <span class="highlight">position</span> at the bottom of the <span class="highlight">screen</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.49" data-time="252.42">[04:12.42]</span>Student: And the subtitles probably give only the gist of what's actually being said.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="256.91">[04:16.91]</span>Professor: Yeah, a word for word translation could become too <span class="highlight">complicated</span> or it'd go by too fast on the <span class="highlight">screen</span>.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What are the speakers mainly

They are generally not involved in the filmmaking process.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The problem of this question is:</p><p>After the meeting, the filmmakers leave and the village council is given all the time they need to think about what was discussed. Later, if the village council members are interested, they send a letter or call. In the village, the right to choose was handed over to the village's parliament, and they could discuss as much as they could. If they decide to participate, they call the filmmakers or write letters. The village committee decided whether or not to shoot such a movie. Option A is correct.
