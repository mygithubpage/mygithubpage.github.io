              <span class="time" data-times="3.03" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in an <span class="highlight">anthropology</span> class. <span class="time" data-times="3.32" data-time="3.03">[00:03.03]</span>The professor is discussing ethnography.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.16" data-time="6.35">[00:06.35]</span>Professor: Since ethnography is all about the <span class="highlight">descriptive</span> study of an <span class="highlight">individual</span> <span class="highlight">culture</span>, <span class="highlight">film</span> has proved to have great value as a tool for anthropologists in their research.<span class="time" data-times="7.34" data-time="16.51">[00:16.51]</span> Let's look at a particularly <span class="highlight">effective</span> <span class="highlight">approach</span> to ethnographic film-making, which was developed in the 1970s.<span class="time" data-times="6.5" data-time="23.85">[00:23.85]</span> This <span class="highlight">particular</span> style of ethnographic filmmaking is called the community-determined <span class="highlight">approach</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.85" data-time="30.35">[00:30.35]</span>The <span class="highlight">intent</span> of the community-determined <span class="highlight">approach</span> is to achieve a kind of, uh... shared authorship. <span class="time" data-times="11.69" data-time="38.2">[00:38.20]</span>See... in this <span class="highlight">approach</span>, the goals of the <span class="highlight">project</span> and how the information will be used are discussed ahead of time, and so a <span class="highlight">culture</span>, uh... <span class="highlight">community</span> is not just the <span class="highlight">focus</span> of the <span class="highlight">film</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.02" data-time="49.89">[00:49.89]</span>They are actually <span class="highlight">equal</span> participants in the whole ethnographic <span class="highlight">process</span>.<span class="time" data-times="12.07" data-time="54.91">[00:54.91]</span> In this way the <span class="highlight">film</span> revolves around the actual values and concerns of the individuals in the <span class="highlight">community</span>, and it honors an <span class="highlight">individual</span>'s <span class="highlight">ethical</span> right to control how he or she is presented in the <span class="highlight">media</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.82" data-time="66.98">[01:06.98]</span>Several of these films were made in Alaskan communities in the 1970's.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.42" data-time="71.8">[01:11.80]</span>Student: So how does it work, you know, the community-determined part?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.35" data-time="77.22">[01:17.22]</span>Professor: Well, it takes a lot of preparation.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.3" data-time="79.57">[01:19.57]</span>First, way before filming begins, the filmmakers visit the <span class="highlight">community</span> and meet with the village <span class="highlight">council</span> who are the decision-makers of the <span class="highlight">community</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.26" data-time="88.87">[01:28.87]</span>A <span class="highlight">film</span> if <span class="highlight">available</span> is shown to the village <span class="highlight">council</span> so that they get an idea of the experience of another <span class="highlight">community</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.87" data-time="96.13">[01:36.13]</span>After the meeting, the filmmakers leave and the village <span class="highlight">council</span> is <span class="highlight">given</span> all the time they need to think about what was discussed. <span class="time" data-times="5.22" data-time="104">[01:44.00]</span>Later, if the village <span class="highlight">council</span> members are interested, they send a letter or call.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.46" data-time="109.22">[01:49.22]</span>Student: There's no follow-up meeting?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.54" data-time="110.68">[01:50.68]</span>Professor: Not unless they want one. <span class="time" data-times="3.29" data-time="112.22">[01:52.22]</span>See, this helps remove any <span class="highlight">pressure</span> to say yes. <span class="time" data-times="2.65" data-time="115.51">[01:55.51]</span>The social <span class="highlight">pressure</span> from the filmmakers' presence.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.63" data-time="118.16">[01:58.16]</span>Student: So, if they agree, then what?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.87" data-time="120.79">[02:00.79]</span>Professor: Then the filmmakers start living in the <span class="highlight">community</span>. <span class="time" data-times="12.28" data-time="123.66">[02:03.66]</span>See, another <span class="highlight">major</span> point in the community-determined <span class="highlight">approach</span>... it's very important that the filmmakers plan to stay in the <span class="highlight">community</span> for an extended period of time, not weeks, but months.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.08" data-time="135.94">[02:15.94]</span>And really, there are several reasons for this. <span class="time" data-times="1.36" data-time="139.02">[02:19.02]</span>Any ideas?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.14" data-time="140.38">[02:20.38]</span>Student: The filmmakers could get a more <span class="highlight">realistic</span> <span class="highlight">sense</span> of the pace of life in that <span class="highlight">community</span>? <span class="time" data-times="1.48" data-time="146.52">[02:26.52]</span>Uh, its daily <span class="highlight">rhythm</span>?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.25" data-time="148">[02:28.00]</span>Professor: Correct, and it allows the filmmakers to <span class="highlight">shed</span> some of their assumptions so that they better <span class="highlight">interpret</span> what they see.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.57" data-time="155.25">[02:35.25]</span>Student: I <span class="highlight">bet</span> it also takes the mystery out of the filmmaking <span class="highlight">process</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.63" data-time="158.82">[02:38.82]</span>You know, everyone has time to get used to the filmmakers and their equipment.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.6" data-time="162.45">[02:42.45]</span>Professor: Exactly, trust is established and relationships are built first.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.43" data-time="167.05">[02:47.05]</span>Student: Wow, this seems like a long <span class="highlight">process</span>. <span class="time" data-times="1.7" data-time="169.48">[02:49.48]</span>It must <span class="highlight">cost</span> a <span class="highlight">fortune</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.01" data-time="171.18">[02:51.18]</span>Professor: It does. <span class="time" data-times="5.42" data-time="172.19">[02:52.19]</span> <span class="highlight">Even</span> with a small <span class="highlight">film</span> <span class="highlight">crew</span> any <span class="highlight">project</span> as involved as this is <span class="highlight">bound</span> to.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.35" data-time="177.61">[02:57.61]</span>Student: OK, so who decides what goes into the <span class="highlight">film</span>?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.54" data-time="180.96">[03:00.96]</span>Professor: Well, such decisions are made by general <span class="highlight">consensus</span> <span class="highlight">within</span> the <span class="highlight">community</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.47" data-time="185.5">[03:05.50]</span>So, for <span class="highlight">instance</span>, the <span class="highlight">community</span>, not the filmmakers, decide who is to be interviewed for the films.<span class="time" data-times="3.16" data-time="192.97">[03:12.97]</span> Control of the interview is in the interviewee's hands.<span class="time" data-times="5.46" data-time="196.13">[03:16.13]</span> If the person being interviewed says to stop at any time, the recording stops. <span class="time" data-times="6.37" data-time="201.59">[03:21.59]</span>He or she states where they wish to be filmed and when and what topic they wish to speak about. <span class="time" data-times="5.46" data-time="207.96">[03:27.96]</span>The <span class="highlight">community</span> members <span class="highlight">review</span> the footage both midway and at the end of the filming. <span class="time" data-times="3.27" data-time="213.42">[03:33.42]</span>And if they want any <span class="highlight">scene</span> deleted, it gets removed. <span class="time" data-times="7.26" data-time="216.69">[03:36.69]</span>That's the <span class="highlight">level</span> of <span class="highlight">respect</span> and regard for the interviewee's preferences and those of the <span class="highlight">community</span> in general.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.96" data-time="223.95">[03:43.95]</span>Student: So then what language is everything filmed in?</p>

              <span class="time" data-times="1.57" data-time="228.91">[03:48.91]</span>Professor: Excellent question!</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.25" data-time="230.48">[03:50.48]</span>Language is <span class="highlight">culture</span>, isn't it? <span class="time" data-times="7.62" data-time="232.73">[03:52.73]</span>So the native language, rather than a dubbed voiceover in the filmmakers language, is the <span class="highlight">primary</span> language of the <span class="highlight">film</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.16" data-time="240.35">[04:00.35]</span>This way a speaker's emotions and <span class="highlight">manner</span> of expression really come <span class="highlight">through</span>, <span class="highlight">even</span> if we don't know their language. <span class="time" data-times="4.91" data-time="247.51">[04:07.51]</span>Subtitles are placed in a secondary <span class="highlight">position</span> at the bottom of the <span class="highlight">screen</span>.</p>

              <span class="time" data-times="4.49" data-time="252.42">[04:12.42]</span>Student: And the subtitles probably give only the gist of what's actually being said.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="256.91">[04:16.91]</span>Professor: Yeah, a word for word translation could become too <span class="highlight">complicated</span> or it'd go by too fast on the <span class="highlight">screen</span>.</p>
