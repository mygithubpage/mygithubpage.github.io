        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>I would rather to choose the long report rather than a speech. One reason is as for me, I don't like speak in public. Speaking in public means I have to recite my words lots of time and practice repeatedly for I'm afraid to forget what I want to say when I'm standing on the stage. Second reason is I think writing a long report will help me learn more knowledge than just prepare a speech. To finish a report I need to research a lot and carefully organize my paper. So I will choose a long report as my assignment. </p>
