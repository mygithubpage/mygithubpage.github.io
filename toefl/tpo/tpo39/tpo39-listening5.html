              <span class="time" data-times="2.84" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of the lecture in a <span class="highlight">literature</span> class. <span class="time" data-times="2.91" data-time="2.84">[00:02.84]</span>The professor is discussing Henry David Thoreau.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="13.95" data-time="5.75">[00:05.75]</span>Professor: Nowadays, trains are <span class="highlight">pretty</span> much taken for granted, but in the United States in the first part of the nineteenth <span class="highlight">century</span>, when Thoreau lived, the <span class="highlight">railroad</span> was a big <span class="highlight">deal</span>, a <span class="highlight">technological</span> <span class="highlight">revolution</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.8" data-time="19.7">[00:19.70]</span>It was kind of earth-shattering to ride in a <span class="highlight">mechanical</span> conveyance at fifty kilometers an hour in the 1830's.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.34" data-time="27.5">[00:27.50]</span>The train, or "iron horse" as people called it, unlocked all <span class="highlight">sort</span> of new experiences of time and <span class="highlight">space</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.9" data-time="35.84">[00:35.84]</span>Thoreau himself praised trains for changing the way people experience their own bodies, for stirring the imagination in new ways. <span class="time" data-times="17.43" data-time="44.74">[00:44.74]</span>So, in Thoreau's famous book, Walden, as you know, Walden is one of the central <span class="highlight">literary</span> texts of the United States from that time period, and in it, Thoreau offers both praise and criticisms of trains.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.48" data-time="62.17">[01:02.17]</span>Um. . .Thoreau is sometimes seen as being anti-modern, but he's not. <span class="time" data-times="11.81" data-time="68.65">[01:08.65]</span>He uses poetic language, <span class="highlight">descriptive</span> metaphors to <span class="highlight">inspire</span>, to awe his readers, to <span class="highlight">communicate</span> the fact that the <span class="highlight">railroad</span> was a <span class="highlight">feat</span> of human <span class="highlight">ingenuity</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.49" data-time="80.46">[01:20.46]</span>Thoreau also associates trains with <span class="highlight">commerce</span> and <span class="highlight">trade</span>. <span class="time" data-times="11.19" data-time="84.95">[01:24.95]</span>Though his attitudes toward <span class="highlight">commerce</span> are <span class="highlight">complicated</span>, he credits trains for delivering goods that feed and clothe society, things that <span class="highlight">improve</span> human life.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.55" data-time="96.14">[01:36.14]</span>But Thoreau also critiques trains on what we could call philosophical grounds. <span class="time" data-times="6.46" data-time="102.69">[01:42.69]</span>He points out that riding on trains distorts people's experiences of the natural world. <span class="time" data-times="8.09" data-time="109.15">[01:49.15]</span>Trees, wild life, landscapes just zip right past you and this is a real problem for him. <span class="time" data-times="6.37" data-time="117.24">[01:57.24]</span>Thoreau also worries that trains had become an institution regulating the whole country.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="14.17" data-time="123.61">[02:03.61]</span>He worries about people doing things in "<span class="highlight">railroad</span> fashion", conforming to the train's timetable, letting their lives be governed by this <span class="highlight">mechanical</span> <span class="highlight">device</span> that is making its way into the <span class="highlight">fabric</span> of society. <span class="time" data-times="10.57" data-time="137.78">[02:17.78]</span>And he extends this <span class="highlight">critique</span> to other inventions of the day, like the penny <span class="highlight">press</span>, this very fast steam-driven <span class="highlight">press</span>.<span class="time" data-times="9.21" data-time="148.35">[02:28.35]</span> He talks about <span class="highlight">popular</span> <span class="highlight">literary</span> genres, like penny newspapers and dime novels, which were being published in <span class="highlight">mass</span> quantities.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="11.5" data-time="157.56">[02:37.56]</span>He worries about people no longer thinking for themselves and uncritically accepting all this cheap <span class="highlight">popular</span> <span class="highlight">literature</span> and the <span class="highlight">trivial</span> details of the news. <span class="time" data-times="10.49" data-time="169.06">[02:49.06]</span>So Thoreau is offering here a <span class="highlight">critique</span> of technology that might be <span class="highlight">relevant</span> for our own times, and I think it's important to take it seriously. <span class="time" data-times="16.59" data-time="179.55">[02:59.55]</span>When there is a new invention, a new computer or a <span class="highlight">mobile</span> phone technology, some new gadget, there is a <span class="highlight">tendency</span> to think that we need to have that thing, just as people were doing in the nineteenth <span class="highlight">century</span> with <span class="highlight">respect</span> to railroads. <span class="time" data-times="10.05" data-time="196.14">[03:16.14]</span>Accepting them as a necessity without considering the possible <span class="highlight">negative</span> consequences or trade-offs that can flow from them. <span class="time" data-times="6.26" data-time="206.19">[03:26.19]</span>Okay. Can anybody <span class="highlight">offer</span> an example of what I'm talking about? Deborah?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="21.35" data-time="212.45">[03:32.45]</span>Student: Yeah, there was this new computer game that my brother just had to have, so he saved his money and bought it, which was good, I guess that he saved his money and all, but now he spends like all his <span class="highlight">spare</span> time playing that game <span class="highlight">instead</span> of riding bikes with his friends or reading books like he used to do, and it's causing some <span class="highlight">friction</span> between him and our parents.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.77" data-time="233.8">[03:53.80]</span>Professor: <span class="highlight">Perfect</span> example! Deborah. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="235.57">[03:55.57]</span>So this is one way to think about Thoreau's text, not just as an important book in its time, for what it tells us about the nineteenth <span class="highlight">century</span>, but also as a text that can teach us certain things about ourselves in <span class="highlight">contemporary</span> society.</p>
