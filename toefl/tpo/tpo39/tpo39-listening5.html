to part of the lecture in a <span class="highlight">literature</span> class. <span class="time" data-times="2.91" data-time="2.84">[00:02.84]</span>The professor is discussing Henry David Thoreau.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="13.95" data-time="5.75">[00:05.75]</span>Professor: Nowadays, trains are <span class="highlight">pretty</span> much taken for granted, but in the United States in the first part of the nineteenth <span class="highlight">century</span>, when Thoreau lived, the <span class="highlight">railroad</span> was a big <span class="highlight">deal</span>, a <span class="highlight">technological</span><span class="highlight">revolution</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.8" data-time="19.7">[00:19.70]</span>It was kind of earth-shattering to ride in a <span class="highlight">mechanical</span> conveyance at fifty kilometers an hour in the 1830's.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="8.34" data-time="27.5">[00:27.50]</span>The train, or "iron horse" as people called it, unlocked all <span class="highlight">sort</span> of new experiences of time and <span class="highlight">space</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.9" data-time="35.84">[00:35.84]</span>Thoreau himself praised trains for changing the way people experience their own bodies, for stirring the imagination in new ways. <span class="time" data-times="17.43" data-time="44.74">[00:44.74]</span>So, in Thoreau's famous book, Walden, as you know, Walden is one of the central <span class="highlight">literary</span> texts of the United States from that time period, and in it, Thoreau offers both praise and criticisms of trains.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.48" data-time="62.17">[01:02.17]</span>Um. . .Thoreau is sometimes seen as being anti-modern, but he's not. <span class="time" data-times="11.81" data-time="68.65">[01:08.65]</span>He uses poetic language, <span class="highlight">descriptive</span> metaphors to <span class="highlight">inspire</span>, to awe his readers, to <span class="highlight">communicate</span> the fact that the <span class="highlight">railroad</span> was a <span class="highlight">feat</span> of human <span class="highlight">ingenuity</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.49" data-time="80.46">[01:20.46]</span>Thoreau also associates trains with <span class="highlight">commerce</span> and <span class="highlight">trade</span>. <span class="time" data-times="11.19" data-time="84.95">[01:24.95]</span>Though his attitudes toward <span class="highlight">commerce</span> are <span class="highlight">complicated</span>, he credits trains for delivering goods that feed and clothe society, things that <span class="highlight">improve</span> human life.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.55" data-time="96.14">[01:36.14]</span>But Thoreau also critiques trains on what we could call philosophical grounds. <span class="time" data-times="6.46" data-time="102.69">[01:42.69]</span>He points out that riding on trains distorts people's experiences of the natural world. <span class="time" data-times="8.09" data-time="109.15">[01:49.15]</span>Trees, wild life, landscapes just zip right past you and this is a real problem for him. <span class="time" data-times="6.37" data-time="117.24">[01:57.24]</span>Thoreau also worries that trains had become an institution regulating the whole country.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="14.17" data-time="123.61">[02:03.61]</span>He worries about people doing things in "<span class="highlight">railroad</span> fashion", conforming to the train's timetable, letting their lives be governed by this <span class="highlight">mechanical</span><span class="highlight">device</span> that is making its way into the <span class="highlight">fabric</span> of society. <span class="time" data-times="10.57" data-time="137.78">[02:17.78]</span>And he extends this <span class="highlight">critique</span> to other inventions of the day, like the penny <span class="highlight">press</span>, this very fast steam-driven <span class="highlight">press</span>.<span class="time" data-times="9.21" data-time="148.35">[02:28.35]</span> He talks about <span class="highlight">popular</span><span class="highlight">literary</span> genres, like penny newspapers and dime novels, which were being published in <span class="highlight">mass</span> quantities.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="11.5" data-time="157.56">[02:37.56]</span>He worries about people no longer thinking for themselves and uncritically accepting all this cheap <span class="highlight">popular</span><span class="highlight">literature</span> and the <span class="highlight">trivial</span> details of the news. <span class="time" data-times="10.49" data-time="169.06">[02:49.06]</span>So Thoreau is offering here a <span class="highlight">critique</span> of technology that might be <span class="highlight">relevant</span> for our own times, and I think it's important to take it seriously. <span class="time" data-times="16.59" data-time="179.55">[02:59.55]</span>When there is a new invention, a new computer or a <span class="highlight">mobile</span> phone technology, some new gadget, there is a <span class="highlight">tendency</span> to think that we need to have that thing, just as people were doing in the nineteenth <span class="highlight">century</span> with <span class="highlight">respect</span> to railroads. <span class="time" data-times="10.05" data-time="196.14">[03:16.14]</span>Accepting them as a necessity without considering the possible <span class="highlight">negative</span> consequences or trade-offs that can flow from them. <span class="time" data-times="6.26" data-time="206.19">[03:26.19]</span>Okay. Can anybody <span class="highlight">offer</span> an example of what I'm talking about? Deborah?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="21.35" data-time="212.45">[03:32.45]</span>Student: Yeah, there was this new computer game that my brother just had to have, so he saved his money and bought it, which was good, I guess that he saved his money and all, but now he spends like all his <span class="highlight">spare</span> time playing that game <span class="highlight">instead</span> of riding bikes with his friends or reading books like he used to do, and it's causing some <span class="highlight">friction</span> between him and our parents.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="1.77" data-time="233.8">[03:53.80]</span>Professor: <span class="highlight">Perfect</span> example! Deborah. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="235.57">[03:55.57]</span>So this is one way to think about Thoreau's text, not just as an important book in its time, for what it tells us about the nineteenth <span class="highlight">century</span>, but also as a text that can teach us certain things about ourselves in <span class="highlight">contemporary</span> society.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor mainly discuss?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

Listen to part of the lecture in a literature class.</p><p>The subject of this lecture is a bit difficult to summarize, but at the beginning of Narrator's words, we clearly tell us that we are talking about Thoreau. In conjunction with all the lectures we can see that this lecture is about this person's various viewpoints on the train. Option B is correct. The remaining three options do not meet the original meaning. Select B.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>In Walden, Thoreau describes some benefits of trains. What benefits does the professor mention? Click on 2 answers</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Trains helped people feel more connected to their national culture.</p><p>B. Trains made life more convenient for many people.</p><p>C. Trains stimulated the imagination in new ways.</p><p>D. Trains cost less to use than other modes of transportation.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="BC"><p>The problem of this question is:</p><p>Thoreau himself praised trains for changing the way people experience their own bodies, for stirring the imagination in new ways.</p><p>Thoreau also associates trains with commerce and trade. Though his attitudes toward commerce are complicated, he credits trains for delivering goods that feed and clothe society, things that improve human life.</p><p>Here are two advantages that the Thoreau man has for the train. One is to stimulate people's imagination, and it is to promote business development because trains can transport various materials to improve people's lives. Options B and C correspond to these two advantages respectively. The other two are not based on the original text. Double-select BC.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to Thoreau, what is the relationship between trains and nature?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Trains can distort passengers' perceptions of nature.</p><p>B. Trains make the landscape more visually interesting.</p><p>C. Trains can transport people to natural settings.</p><p>D.

He thought that sitting on the train, the flying trees, wild animals and scenery would quickly skip people, which would cause him trouble. Option A meets. The other three options do not match. Select A.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the lecture, what point does Thoreau emphasize about trains and the penny press?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Penny-press publications were read by average citizens, but trains were used mainly by the wealthy</p><p>B. Trains delivered penny-press publications to a broad national audience.</p><p>C. Both trains and the penny press threatened people's individualism.</p><p>D. Both trains and the penny press enhanced people's understanding of the world.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The problem of this question is:</p><p>Thoreau believes that people will determine their rhythm of life based on these modern inventions after the appearance of trains and penny press in the future. Then Thoreau thinks about people no longer thinking for themselves and uncritically accepting all this cheap popular literature and the trivial details of the news. Lose yourself. Option C is consistent with the question. The other three options are not suitable. Select C.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor imply when he discusses modern technology?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It is better to wait until a new technology is perfected before adopting it.</p><p>B. A new technology that has more disadvantages than advantages is unlikely to succeed.</p><p>C. People are more skeptical of new technology now than in Thoreau's time.</p><p>D. People should consider possible negative consequences of a new technology before adopting it.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The problem of this question is:</p><p>When there is a new invention, a new computer or a mobile phone technology, some new gadget, there is a tendency to think that we need to have that thing, just as people were doing in the nineteenth century with respect to railroads. Accepting them As a necessity without considering the possible negative consequences or trade-offs that can flow from them.</p><p>The professor here talked about his attitude towards modern inventions. He thought that when new inventions emerged, we would feel very urgently and uncritically to feel that they are in need of and have one and accept these new inventions without considering the negative impact they would bring. Professors hold a negative attitude toward this. Option D is correct. The other three options do not match the original text. Select D.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the professor's opinion about Walden as it relates to the world today?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Walden is of interest mainly for its descriptions of nineteenth-century life.</p><p>B. The issues that Walden addresses remain relevant today.</p><p>C. Mass transportation has changed too much for Walden to be relevant today.</p><p>D. Walden correctly predicted that trains would be replaced by other technologies.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The problem of this question is:</p><p>This is one way to think about Thoreau's text, not just as an important book in its time, for what it tells us about the nineteenth century, but also as a text that can teach us certain things about ourselves in contemporary society. Here we say that we should not only treat Thoreau's book as a book at the time, but also draw lessons from it and apply it to contemporary society. So this book is still related to some of the current problems. Option B meets. The other three options are not suitable. Select B.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
