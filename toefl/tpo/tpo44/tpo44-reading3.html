            <b>Seagrasses</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>Many areas of the <span class="underline">shallow</span> sea bottom are covered with a <span class="underline">lush</span> growth of <span class="underline">aquatic</span> flowering plants adapted to live submerged in seawater. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> These plants are <span class="underline">collectively</span> called seagrasses. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> Seagrass beds are strongly influenced by several <span class="underline">physical</span> factors. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span> The most <span class="underline">significant</span> is water motion: currents and waves. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span> Since seagrass systems exist in both <span class="underline">sheltered</span> and <span class="underline">relatively</span> open areas, they are <span class="underline">subject</span> to differing amounts of water <span class="underline">motion</span>. For any <span class="underline">given</span> seagrass system, however, the water <span class="underline">motion</span> is <span class="underline">relatively</span> <span class="underline">constant</span>. Seagrass meadows in <span class="underline">relatively</span> <span class="underline">turbulent</span> waters <span class="underline">tend</span> to form a <span class="underline">mosaic</span> of <span class="underline">individual</span> mounds, whereas meadows in <span class="underline">relatively</span> <span class="underline">calm</span> waters <span class="underline">tend</span> to form <span class="underline">flat</span>, <span class="underline">extensive</span> carpets. The seagrass beds, in turn, dampen wave <span class="underline">action</span>, particularly if the blades <span class="underline">reach</span> the water surface. This damping effect can be <span class="underline">significant</span> to the point where just one meter into a seagrass bed the wave <span class="underline">motion</span> can be reduced to zero. Currents are also slowed as they move into the bed.</p>
          <p>The slowing of wave <span class="underline">action</span> and currents means that seagrass beds <span class="underline">tend</span> to <span class="underline">accumulate</span> <span class="underline">sediment</span>. However, this is not universal and depends on the currents under which the bed exists. Seagrass beds under the influence of strong currents <span class="underline">tend</span> to have many of the lighter particles, including seagrass <span class="underline">debris</span>, moved out, whereas beds in weak <span class="underline">current</span> areas <span class="underline">accumulate</span> lighter detrital <span class="underline">material</span>. It is interesting that <span class="underline">temperate</span> seagrass beds <span class="underline">accumulate</span> sediments from sources outside the beds, whereas <span class="underline">tropical</span> seagrass beds <span class="underline">derive</span> most of their sediments from <span class="underline">within</span>.</p>
          <p>Since most seagrass systems are depositional environments, they <span class="underline">eventually</span> <span class="underline">accumulate</span> <span class="underline">organic</span> <span class="underline">material</span> that leads to the creation of <span class="underline">fine-grained</span> sediments with a much higher <span class="underline">organic</span> <span class="underline">content</span> than that of the surrounding unvegetated areas. This <span class="underline">accumulation</span>, in turn, reduces the water movement and the <span class="underline">oxygen</span> <span class="underline">supply</span>. The high <span class="underline">rate</span> of <span class="underline">metabolism</span> (the processing of energy for <span class="underline">survival</span>) of the microorganisms in the sediments causes sediments to be <span class="underline">anaerobic</span> (without <span class="underline">oxygen</span>) below the first few millimeters. According to ecologist J. W. Kenworthy, <span class="underline">anaerobic</span> processes of the microorganisms in the <span class="underline">sediment</span> are an important <span class="underline">mechanism</span> for regenerating and recycling nutrients and <span class="underline">carbon</span>, ensuring the high rates of <span class="underline">productivity</span>-that is, the <span class="underline">amount</span> of <span class="underline">organic</span> <span class="underline">material</span> produced-that are measured in those beds. In <span class="underline">contrast</span> to other <span class="underline">productivity</span> in the ocean, which is confined to various <span class="underline">species</span> of <span class="underline">algae</span> and <span class="underline">bacteria</span> dependent on <span class="underline">nutrient</span> concentrations in the water <span class="underline">column</span>, seagrasses are rooted plants that <span class="underline">absorb</span> nutrients from the <span class="underline">sediment</span> or <span class="underline">substrate</span>. They are, <span class="underline">therefore</span>, <span class="underline">capable</span> of recycling nutrients into the <span class="underline">ecosystem</span> that would <span class="underline">otherwise</span> be trapped in the bottom and rendered unavailable.</p>
          <p>Other <span class="underline">physical</span> factors that have an effect on seagrass beds include light, <span class="underline">temperature</span>, and <span class="underline">desiccation</span> (drying out). For example, water depth and turbidity (<span class="underline">density</span> of particles in the water) together or separately control the <span class="underline">amount</span> of light <span class="underline">available</span> to the plants and the depth to which the seagrasses may <span class="underline">extend</span>. Although <span class="underline">marine</span> botanist W. A. Setchell suggested early on that <span class="underline">temperature</span> was <span class="underline">critical</span> to the growth and <span class="underline">reproduction</span> of eelgrass, it has since been shown that this particularly <span class="underline">widespread</span> seagrass grows and reproduces at temperatures between 2 and 4 degrees Celsius in the <span class="underline">Arctic</span> and at temperatures up to 28 degrees Celsius on the northeastern <span class="underline">coast</span> of the United States. Still, <span class="underline">extreme</span> temperatures, in <span class="underline">combination</span> with other factors, may have <span class="underline">dramatic</span> <span class="underline">detrimental</span> effects. For example, in areas of the cold North Atlantic, ice may form in winter. Researchers Robertson and Mann note that when the ice begins to <span class="underline">break</span> up, the wind and tides may move the ice around, scouring the bottom and uprooting the eelgrass. In <span class="underline">contrast</span>, at the southern end of the eelgrass <span class="underline">range</span>, on the southeastern <span class="underline">coast</span> of the United States, temperatures over 30 degrees Celsius in summer cause <span class="underline">excessive</span> <span class="underline">mortality</span>. Seagrass beds also <span class="underline">decline</span> if they are subjected to too much <span class="underline">exposure</span> to the <span class="underline">air</span>. The effect of <span class="underline">desiccation</span> is often difficult to <span class="underline">separate</span> from the effect of <span class="underline">temperature</span>. Most seagrass beds <span class="underline">seem</span> <span class="underline">tolerant</span> of <span class="underline">considerable</span> changes in <span class="underline">salinity</span> (salt levels) and can be found in <span class="underline">brackish</span> (<span class="underline">somewhat</span> salty) waters as well as in full- strength seawater.</p>
