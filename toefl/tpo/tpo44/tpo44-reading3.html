          <h4 class="w3-center">Seagrasses</h4>
          <p>Many areas of the <span class="highlight">shallow</span> sea bottom are covered with a <span class="highlight">lush</span> growth of <span class="highlight">aquatic</span> flowering plants adapted to live submerged in seawater. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> These plants are <span class="highlight">collectively</span> called seagrasses. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> Seagrass beds are strongly influenced by several <span class="highlight">physical</span> factors. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span> The most <span class="highlight">significant</span> is water motion: currents and waves. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span> Since seagrass systems exist in both <span class="highlight">sheltered</span> and <span class="highlight">relatively</span> open areas, they are <span class="highlight">subject</span> to differing amounts of water <span class="highlight">motion</span>. For any <span class="highlight">given</span> seagrass system, however, the water <span class="highlight">motion</span> is <span class="highlight">relatively</span> <span class="highlight">constant</span>. Seagrass meadows in <span class="highlight">relatively</span> <span class="highlight">turbulent</span> waters <span class="highlight">tend</span> to form a <span class="highlight">mosaic</span> of <span class="highlight">individual</span> mounds, whereas meadows in <span class="highlight">relatively</span> <span class="highlight">calm</span> waters <span class="highlight">tend</span> to form <span class="highlight">flat</span>, <span class="highlight">extensive</span> carpets. The seagrass beds, in turn, dampen wave <span class="highlight">action</span>, particularly if the blades <span class="highlight">reach</span> the water surface. This damping effect can be <span class="highlight">significant</span> to the point where just one meter into a seagrass bed the wave <span class="highlight">motion</span> can be reduced to zero. Currents are also slowed as they move into the bed.</p>
          <p>The slowing of wave <span class="highlight">action</span> and currents means that seagrass beds <span class="highlight">tend</span> to <span class="highlight">accumulate</span> <span class="highlight">sediment</span>. However, this is not universal and depends on the currents under which the bed exists. <span class="question3">Seagrass beds under the influence of strong currents <span class="highlight">tend</span> to have many of the lighter particles, including seagrass <span class="highlight">debris</span>, moved out, whereas beds in weak <span class="highlight">current</span> areas <span class="highlight">accumulate</span> lighter detrital <span class="highlight">material</span>.</span> It is interesting that <span class="highlight">temperate</span> seagrass beds <span class="highlight">accumulate</span> sediments from sources outside the beds, whereas <span class="highlight">tropical</span> seagrass beds <span class="highlight"><span class="question4">derive</span></span> most of their sediments from <span class="highlight">within</span>.</p>
          <p>Since most seagrass systems are depositional environments, they <span class="highlight">eventually</span> <span class="highlight">accumulate</span> <span class="highlight">organic</span> <span class="highlight">material</span> that leads to the creation of <span class="highlight">fine-grained</span> sediments with a much higher <span class="highlight">organic</span> <span class="highlight">content</span> than that of the surrounding unvegetated areas. This <span class="highlight">accumulation</span>, in turn, reduces the water movement and the <span class="highlight">oxygen</span> <span class="highlight">supply</span>. The high <span class="highlight">rate</span> of <span class="highlight">metabolism</span> (the processing of energy for <span class="highlight">survival</span>) of the microorganisms in the sediments causes sediments to be <span class="highlight">anaerobic</span> (without <span class="highlight">oxygen</span>) below the first few millimeters. According to ecologist J. W. Kenworthy, <span class="highlight">anaerobic</span> processes of the microorganisms in the <span class="highlight">sediment</span> are an important <span class="highlight">mechanism</span> for regenerating and recycling nutrients and <span class="highlight">carbon</span>, ensuring the high rates of <span class="highlight">productivity</span>-that is, the <span class="highlight">amount</span> of <span class="highlight">organic</span> <span class="highlight">material</span> produced-that are measured in those beds. In <span class="highlight">contrast</span> to other <span class="highlight">productivity</span> in the ocean, which is <span class="question6">confined</span> to various <span class="highlight">species</span> of <span class="highlight">algae</span> and <span class="highlight">bacteria</span> dependent on <span class="highlight">nutrient</span> concentrations in the water <span class="highlight">column</span>, seagrasses are rooted plants that <span class="highlight">absorb</span> nutrients from the <span class="highlight">sediment</span> or <span class="highlight">substrate</span>. They are, <span class="highlight">therefore</span>, <span class="highlight">capable</span> of recycling nutrients into the <span class="highlight">ecosystem</span> that would <span class="highlight">otherwise</span> be trapped in the bottom and rendered unavailable.</p>
          <p>Other <span class="highlight">physical</span> factors that have an effect on seagrass beds include light, <span class="highlight">temperature</span>, and <span class="highlight">desiccation</span> (drying out). For example, water depth and turbidity (<span class="highlight">density</span> of particles in the water) together or separately control the <span class="highlight">amount</span> of light <span class="highlight">available</span> to the plants and the depth to which the seagrasses may <span class="highlight">extend</span>. Although <span class="highlight">marine</span> botanist W. A. Setchell suggested early on that <span class="highlight">temperature</span> was <span class="highlight">critical</span> to the growth and <span class="highlight">reproduction</span> of eelgrass, it has since been shown that this particularly <span class="highlight">widespread</span> seagrass grows and reproduces at temperatures between 2 and 4 degrees Celsius in the <span class="highlight">Arctic</span> and at temperatures up to 28 degrees Celsius on the northeastern <span class="highlight">coast</span> of the United States. Still, <span class="highlight">extreme</span> temperatures, in <span class="highlight">combination</span> with other factors, may have <span class="highlight">dramatic</span> <span class="highlight"><span class="question10">detrimental</span></span> effects. For example, in areas of the cold North Atlantic, ice may form in winter. Researchers Robertson and Mann note that when the ice begins to <span class="highlight">break</span> up, the wind and tides may move the ice around, scouring the bottom and uprooting the eelgrass. In <span class="highlight">contrast</span>, at the southern end of the eelgrass <span class="highlight">range</span>, on the southeastern <span class="highlight">coast</span> of the United States, temperatures over 30 degrees Celsius in summer cause <span class="highlight">excessive</span> <span class="highlight">mortality</span>. Seagrass beds also <span class="highlight">decline</span> if they are subjected to too much <span class="highlight">exposure</span> to the <span class="highlight">air</span>. The effect of <span class="highlight">desiccation</span> is often difficult to <span class="highlight">separate</span> from the effect of <span class="highlight">temperature</span>. Most seagrass beds <span class="highlight">seem</span> <span class="question12"><span class="highlight">tolerant</span> of</span> <span class="highlight">considerable</span> changes in <span class="highlight">salinity</span> (salt levels) and can be found in <span class="highlight">brackish</span> (<span class="highlight">somewhat</span> salty) waters as well as in full- strength seawater.</p>
