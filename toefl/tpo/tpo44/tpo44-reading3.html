For any <span class="highlight">given</span> seagrass system, however, the water <span class="highlight">motion</span> is <span class="highlight">relatively</span><span class="highlight">constant</span>. Seagrass meadows in <span class="highlight">relatively</span><span class="highlight">turbulent</span> waters <span class="highlight">tend</span> to form a <span class="highlight">mosaic</span> of <span class="highlight">individual</span> mounds, whereas meadows in <span class="highlight">relatively</span><span class="highlight">calm</span> waters <span class="highlight">tend</span> to form <span class="highlight">flat</span>, <span class="highlight">extensive</span> carpets. The seagrass beds, in turn, dampen wave <span class="highlight">action</span>, particularly if the blades <span class="highlight">reach</span> the water surface. This damping effect can be <span class="highlight">significant</span> to the point where just one meter into a seagrass bed the wave <span class="highlight">motion</span> can be reduced to zero. Currents are also slowed as they move into the bed.</p><p>The slowing of wave <span class="highlight">action</span> and currents means that seagrass beds <span class="highlight">tend</span> to <span class="highlight">accumulate</span><span class="highlight">sediment</span>. However, this is not universal and depends on the currents under which the bed exists. <span class="question3">Seagrass beds under the influence of strong currents <span class="highlight">tend</span> to have many of the lighter particles, including seagrass <span class="highlight">debris</span>, moved out, whereas beds in weak <span class="highlight">current</span> areas <span class="highlight">accumulate</span> lighter detrital <span class="highlight">material</span>.</span> It is interesting that <span class="highlight">temperate</span> seagrass beds <span class="highlight">accumulate</span> sediments from sources outside the beds, whereas <span class="highlight">tropical</span> seagrass beds <span class="highlight"><span class="question4">derive</span></span> most of their sediments from <span class="highlight">within</span>.</p><p>Since most seagrass systems are depositional environments, they <span class="highlight">eventually</span><span class="highlight">accumulate</span><span class="highlight">organic</span><span class="highlight">material</span> that leads to the creation of <span class="highlight">fine-grained</span> sediments with a much higher <span class="highlight">organic</span><span class="highlight">content</span> than that of the surrounding unvegetated areas. This <span class="highlight">accumulation</span>, in turn, reduces the water movement and the <span class="highlight">oxygen</span><span class="highlight">supply</span>. The high <span class="highlight">rate</span> of <span class="highlight">metabolism</span> (the processing of energy for <span class="highlight">survival</span>) of the microorganisms in the sediments causes sediments to be <span class="highlight">anaerobic</span> (without <span class="highlight">oxygen</span>) below the first few millimeters. According to ecologist J. W. Kenworthy, <span class="highlight">anaerobic</span> processes of the microorganisms in the <span class="highlight">sediment</span> are an important <span class="highlight">mechanism</span> for regenerating and recycling nutrients and <span class="highlight">carbon</span>, ensuring the high rates of <span class="highlight">productivity</span>-that is, the <span class="highlight">amount</span> of <span class="highlight">organic</span><span class="highlight">material</span> produced-that are measured in those beds. In <span class="highlight">contrast</span> to other <span class="highlight">productivity</span> in the ocean, which is <span class="question6">confined</span> to various <span class="highlight">species</span> of <span class="highlight">algae</span> and <span class="highlight">bacteria</span> dependent on <span class="highlight">nutrient</span> concentrations in the water <span class="highlight">column</span>, seagrasses are rooted plants that <span class="highlight">absorb</span> nutrients from the <span class="highlight">sediment</span> or <span class="highlight">substrate</span>. They are, <span class="highlight">therefore</span>, <span class="highlight">capable</span> of recycling nutrients into the <span class="highlight">ecosystem</span> that would <span class="highlight">otherwise</span> be trapped in the bottom and rendered unavailable.</p><p>Other <span class="highlight">physical</span> factors that have an effect on seagrass beds include light, <span class="highlight">temperature</span>, and <span class="highlight">desiccation</span> (drying out). For example, water depth and turbidity (<span class="highlight">density</span> of particles in the water) together or separately control the <span class="highlight">amount</span> of light <span class="highlight">available</span> to the plants and the depth to which the seagrasses may <span class="highlight">extend</span>. Although <span class="highlight">marine</span> botanist W. A. Setchell suggested early on that <span class="highlight">temperature</span> was <span class="highlight">critical</span> to the growth and <span class="highlight">reproduction</span> of eelgrass, it has since been shown that this particularly <span class="highlight">widespread</span> seagrass grows and reproduces at temperatures between 2 and 4 degrees Celsius in the <span class="highlight">Arctic</span> and at temperatures up to 28 degrees Celsius on the northeastern <span class="highlight">coast</span> of the United States. Still, <span class="highlight">extreme</span> temperatures, in <span class="highlight">combination</span> with other factors, may have <span class="highlight">dramatic</span><span class="highlight"><span class="question10">detrimental</span></span> effects. For example, in areas of the cold North Atlantic, ice may form in winter. Researchers Robertson and Mann note that when the ice begins to <span class="highlight">break</span> up, the wind and tides may move the ice around, scouring the bottom and uprooting the eelgrass. In <span class="highlight">contrast</span>, at the southern end of the eelgrass <span class="highlight">range</span>, on the southeastern <span class="highlight">coast</span> of the United States, temperatures over 30 degrees Celsius in summer cause <span class="highlight">excessive</span><span class="highlight">mortality</span>. Seagrass beds also <span class="highlight">decline</span> if they are subjected to too much <span class="highlight">exposure</span> to the <span class="highlight">air</span>. The effect of <span class="highlight">desiccation</span> is often difficult to <span class="highlight">separate</span> from the effect of <span class="highlight">temperature</span>. Most seagrass beds <span class="highlight">seem</span><span class="question12"><span class="highlight">tolerant</span> of</span><span class="highlight">considerable</span> changes in <span class="highlight">salinity</span> (salt levels) and can be found in <span class="highlight">brackish</span> (<span class="highlight">somewhat</span> salty) waters as well as in full- strength seawater.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 1, which of the following is true about seagrasses in calm ocean waters?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They will not survive for very long without the nutrients brought In by fast-moving waters.</p><p>B. They tend to form beds covering large areas along the ocean floor.</p><p>C. They usually are arranged in separate mounds.</p><p>D. They grow more slowly than do seagrasses in fast-moving waters.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Option A does not have the nutrients that the rapid flow of water brings, and seagrass will not survive for a long time. There was no mention of this information in the original text; option B would form a seagrass bed covering most of the sea floor, consistent with the original text; separate mounds in option C was just a detail of the original text; option D was slower than seagrass In the fast-flowing stream, the original text does not compare this detail.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 1, which of the following is MOST likely to describe a bed in which seagrasses reach the surface of the water?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The water is almost completely still.</p><p>B. The bed often has major damage from strong waves or currents.</p><p>C. The bed is generally no more than one square meter in size.</p><p>D. Grasses form a mosaic of individual mounds.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>Using reach the surface of the water, locate the penultimate sentence, which emphasizes that when the leaves reach the surface of the water, the plants will have a constant wave effect. So the A option is more correct. If inhibition occurs, the waves will become smaller or not (as described below). A is the correct answer.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Light particles and debris collect in some seagrass beds, but are washed out of those affected by strong currents.</p><p>B. Seagrass beds under the influence of strong currents tend to accumulate many of the lighter particles from other beds.</p><p>C. The strength of the currents determines how quickly accumulated seagrass debris is moved out of the beds.</p><p>D. Seagrass debris and other light particles are often moved from areas of strong currents to areas of weak currents.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>There is a turning point between this and whereas. The first part says that under strong current conditions, there will be a lot of lighter particles removed from the seagrass beds, and the latter part will say that lighter debris will accumulate in the weak currents bed. A expresses the logic of transition and the meaning of logic.</p><p>The B option contradicts the original sentence.</p><p>The C option how quickly was not involved in the original sentence, wrong.</p><p>The logic of move out from...to in the D option completely falsifies the original sentence, wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question4">derive</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. maintain</p><p>B. expel</p><p>C. obtain</p><p>D. enrich</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" C"><p>Derive gets, option A stays; option B excludes; option C has; option D is rich. So Option C is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 3, which of the following does NOT accurately describe the sediments that collect in seagrass beds?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Fine-grained</p><p>B. Only a few millimeters deep</p><p>C. Low in oxygen</p><p>D. Rich in organic matter</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Is accumulational environments, they eventually accumulate organic material that leads to the creation of fine-grained sediments with a much higher organic content than that of the surrounding unvegetated areas. This accumulation, in turn, reduces the water movement and the Oxygen supply. Option A fine-grained; option C hypoxic; option D rich organic, consistent with the original details of the information. Option B is only a few millimeters deep and does not match the original textual information.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question6">confined</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. related</p><p>B. limited</p><p>C. relevant</p><p>D. helpful</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>Confined is restricted, option A is related; option B is restricted; option C is related; option D is helpful. So Option B is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 3, how do seagrasses affect the nutrient supply in the ecosystem?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Because of their high rate of metabolism, they consume a large percentage of the available nutrients.</p><p>B. They attract various species of algae and bacteria that produce high nutrient concentrations in the water column.</p><p>C. They take up carbon and other nutrients trapped on the sea bottom and bring them back into use.</p><p>D. Through anaerobic processes at their roots, they produce a very nutrient-rich sediment.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Anaerobic processes of the microorganisms in the sediment are an important mechanism for regenerating and recycling nutrients and carbon, ensuring the high rates of productivity-that is, the amount of organic materials produced-that are measured in those beds. They back to use are consistent with the regenerating and recycling meaning in the original text.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>It can be inferred from paragraph 4 that the reason seagrasses do not grow in very deep water is that</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. they cannot handle intense water pressure</p><p>B. deep water is too cold</p><p>C. they would not get enough light</p><p>D. deep water is too salty</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Water depth and turbidity together or separately control the amount of light available to the plants and the depth to which the seagrasses may extend. The intensity of light, and the depth of these seaweeds may be prolonged. Obviously in option C, seagrass will not get enough light, which is consistent with the original information.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>In paragraph 4, why does the author mention that eelgrass thrives in both the Arctic and in the northeastern United States?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To show that environments with extreme temperatures rarely have any effect on eelgrass</p><p>B. To identify the northern and southern limits of the range where eelgrass is found</p><p>C. To support the author's statement that eelgrass is a particularly widespread kind of seagrass</p><p>D. To cite evidence tending to disprove one view about the importance of temperature to the growth of eelgrass</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>Two examples The purpose of Arctic and northeastern United States is to support the idea that temperature is critical to the growth and reproduction of eelgrass.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question10">detrimental</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. harmful</p><p>B. significant</p><p>C. unexpected</p><p>D. distinct</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" A"><p>Detrimental unfavorable, Option A harmful; Option B significant; Option C unexpected; Option D obvious.
