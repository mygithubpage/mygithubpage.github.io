      <h3>Reading Text</h3>
      <p>In 1957 a European silver coin dating to the eleventh century was discovered at a Native American archaeological site in the state of Maine in the United States. Many people believed the coin had been originally brought to North America by European explorers known as the Norse, who traveled across the Atlantic Ocean and came into contact with Native Americans almost a thousand years ago.</p>
      <p>However, some archaeologists believe that the coin is not a genuine piece of historical evidence but a historical fake; they think that the coin was placed at the site recently by someone who wanted to mislead the public. There are three main reasons why some archaeologists believe that the coin is not genuine historical evidence. </p>
      <p>Great Distance from Norse Settlements</p>
      <p>First, the Native American site in Maine where the coin was discovered is located very far from other sites documenting a Norse presence in North America. Remains of Norse settlements have been discovered in far eastern Canada. The distance between the Maine site and the Norse settlements in Canada is more than a thousand kilometers, suggesting the coin has no real connection with the settlements.</p>
      <p>No Other Coins Found</p>
      <p>A second problem is that no other coins have been found at the Canadian sites that were inhabited by the Norse. This suggests that the Norse did not bring any silver coins with them to their North American settlements.</p>
      <p>Third, the Norse who traveled to North America would have understood that silver coins would most likely be useless to them. Silver coins may have been in wide use in Europe at the time, but the Norse, as experienced explorers, would have known that native North Americans did not recognize silver coins as money. </p>

      <h3>Listening Text</h3>
      <p>ProfessorActually many archaeologists believe that the coin discussed in the reading is not a fake. They believe it represents genuine evidence that the Norse came into contact with Native Americans a thousand years ago. </p>
      <p>First, the great distance of the Maine site from the Norse settlements in Canada. Well, many other objects found at that same Native American site had come from faraway places. Not just the coin. There's a perfectly reasonable historical explanation for these objects. The Native Americans who lived at the Maine site traveled great distances within North America. They were interested in obtaining objects from faraway places. The Native Americans could have reached the Norse settlements during their travels and brought the silver coin back to Maine. </p>
      <p>Second, does the fact that we found no other coins at Norse settlements mean that the Norse didn't bring any coins with them? Not necessarily. The Norse didn't create permanent settlements in North America. At some point, they went back to Europe. When they packed for their return voyage, they packed up all their valuable possessions. They would have packed up all silver coins they had as well. So it's completely possible that the Norse had originally brought the coins with them to North America, but when they returned to Europe, they took the coins back with them. </p>
      <p>Third, it's true that Native Americans wouldn't have viewed coins as money in the same way we do today or the way the Norse did in Europe. But the Norse probably knew that the Native Americans valued attractive or unusual objects. Silver coins might have been very appealing because of their beauty. For example, they could have been used in necklaces or other types of jewelry. As long as Native Americans found the coins interesting and beautiful, the Norse could have used the coins to trade with them. </p>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <p><b>The reading mainly presents that there are three evidences to prove</b> the coin was not brought by Norse to America. However, the listening challenges what are stated in the passage by providing three strong evidences.</p>
        <p>Firstly, <b>in the reading, it is said that</b> the location of Marine was so far from Norse sites in Canada. They had no relation with each other. <b>In contrast, the listening holds an opposed view</b> that Native Americans travelled over a thousand kilometers to Norse's settlement and brought back the coin.</p>
        <p>Secondly, the passage asserts that there are no other kind of coins found in the Norse's site. That means that Norse has no coins in the Native America. However, the professor also maintains an opposite opinion that Norse didn't stayed at a place forever. When they returned back to Europe, they took away the valuable silver coins.</p>
        <p>Finally, the author of reading passage believes that the North understand that the coin is not the most widely accepted form of Native American's currency. <b>On the other hand, the lecturer disagrees it with the point</b> that Native Americans prefer the valuable or unique items. So the Norse can utilize the coin trade with the Native Americans. </p>

        <h4>My Version</h4>
        <p>In the reading, many archaeologist suggest that the coin found in the state of Maine was not brought to US, by the European explorers Norse. The professor in the lecture claims the coin is actually not a historical fake and she support her point by using the following idea</p>
        <p>First, the reading states that the distance between the Main site and the Orese settlements is too far, which suggest that the coin has no connection with settlements. on the contrary, the professor contradict this idea by saying that Americans travel a very long distance and he might reach Norse Settlement. therefore, he could bring the coin with them when they are back to Maine.</p>
        <p>Second, professor refute the evident present in the reading that no other coins have been found at the Norse settlement which means Norse did not bring any coins with him to american. However the professor do not agree with this idea, she says Norse pack everything valuable to him, including the silver coins, when he return Eurpoe, This explains why no coin left in NOrse seetlements.</p>
        <p>Third, according in the reading passage, Norse didn't bring any coins with them since he had known tha nactive NOrth American did not recognize silver cons as money. but the professor thinks native north amercan wer attract ot unsual shiny object like siver coind, they might use as necklace or the jervery, os Norse could trade the coin with them because they found the coin amazing.</p>
