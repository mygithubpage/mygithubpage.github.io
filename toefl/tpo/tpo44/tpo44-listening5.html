              <span class="time" data-times="7.27" data-time="4.43">[00:04.43]</span>Professor:So, we've been talking about early civilizations, how they developed, and early <span class="highlight">agriculture</span>. <span class="time" data-times="10.87" data-time="11.7">[00:11.70]</span>And it's believed that <span class="highlight">agriculture</span> arose independently in a few areas of the world about ten thousand years ago, and then <span class="highlight">spread</span> from those areas to the rest of the world. <span class="time" data-times="8.07" data-time="22.57">[00:22.57]</span>Those cradles of <span class="highlight">agriculture</span> include the Middle East, China and Southeast Asia, and parts of the Americas. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="13.53" data-time="30.64">[00:30.64]</span>Now, for many years archaeologists have speculated that <span class="highlight">agriculture</span> also arose independently in another center, too - New <span class="highlight">Guinea</span>, which is just north of Australia, in the South <span class="highlight">Pacific</span> Ocean. <span class="time" data-times="2.53" data-time="44.17">[00:44.17]</span>You can see it on this map. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="18.3" data-time="46.7">[00:46.70]</span>So, it had been assumed for a long time that New <span class="highlight">Guinea</span>, that <span class="highlight">domesticated</span> plants and animals, the practice of <span class="highlight">agriculture</span>, generally, had been introduced from Southeast Asia about 3500 years ago, had come south <span class="highlight">essentially</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.43" data-time="65">[01:05.00]</span>Then in the 1960s and 70s, research was conducted at sites in New <span class="highlight">Guinea</span> to <span class="highlight">explore</span> the possibility of <span class="highlight">independent</span> agricultural <span class="highlight">development</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.59" data-time="75.43">[01:15.43]</span>But <span class="highlight">unfortunately</span>, the <span class="highlight">evidence</span> gathered at that time was <span class="highlight">inconclusive</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="11.99" data-time="80.02">[01:20.02]</span>For <span class="highlight">instance</span>, although <span class="highlight">evidence</span> was found of <span class="highlight">deforestation</span>, you know, cutting down trees, from at <span class="highlight">least</span> 7,000 years ago, that is long before we'd thought <span class="highlight">previously</span>. <span class="time" data-times="10.24" data-time="92.01">[01:32.01]</span>It was unclear whether the forest had been cleared by farmers to plant fields, or by hunter-gatherers, so they could hunt more easily. <span class="time" data-times="9.11" data-time="102.25">[01:42.25]</span>And many plant remains like seeds and fruits don't <span class="highlight">preserve</span> well in swampy soils, in <span class="highlight">humid</span> environments like you often find in New <span class="highlight">Guinea</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.27" data-time="111.36">[01:51.36]</span>So really, the <span class="highlight">proof</span> was limited. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.28" data-time="113.63">[01:53.63]</span>But, recent research has turned up some <span class="highlight">pretty</span> convincing support. <span class="time" data-times="11.17" data-time="118.91">[01:58.91]</span>A group of archaeologists returned to a site that had been <span class="highlight">previously</span> examined, Kuk Swamp, which is in a mountain <span class="highlight">valley</span> in the highlands of what is now Papua, New <span class="highlight">Guinea</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="17.43" data-time="130.08">[02:10.08]</span>Based on their findings, they identified a <span class="highlight">succession</span> of phases of agricultural <span class="highlight">development</span> in the wetlands there, with several of these phases predating the earliest known agricultural influence from Southeast Asia. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.49" data-time="147.51">[02:27.51]</span>At the site in Kuk, they used an <span class="highlight">array</span> of modern <span class="highlight">archaeological</span> methods to <span class="highlight">analyze</span> <span class="highlight">sediment</span> samples from the soil. <span class="time" data-times="10.01" data-time="155">[02:35.00]</span>From the oldest soil <span class="highlight">layer</span> dating back 10,000 years, they found <span class="highlight">evidence</span> of pits, <span class="highlight">stake</span> holes and ditches. <span class="time" data-times="4.24" data-time="165.01">[02:45.01]</span>Now, these all <span class="highlight">indicate</span> that crops were being planted. <span class="time" data-times="10.08" data-time="169.25">[02:49.25]</span>Plants are tied to stakes, and ditches are for..for <span class="highlight">drainage</span>, a <span class="highlight">proof</span> of a very early, first <span class="highlight">phase</span> of agricultural <span class="highlight">development</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.13" data-time="179.33">[02:59.33]</span>The <span class="highlight">second</span> <span class="highlight">phase</span>, which they <span class="highlight">identify</span> from a higher <span class="highlight">layer</span> of soil, featured regularly distributed mounds. <span class="time" data-times="12.98" data-time="187.46">[03:07.46]</span>Mounds were constructed to plant crops that can't <span class="highlight">tolerate</span> very wet soil, such as bananas, because remember Kuk is a swampy wetland, and bananas wouldn't ordinarily grow well there. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="14.16" data-time="200.44">[03:20.44]</span>And in the layers from Kuk's third <span class="highlight">phase</span>, they found <span class="highlight">evidence</span> of an <span class="highlight">extensive</span> network of ditches and <span class="highlight">drainage</span> channels, indicating a further <span class="highlight">refinement</span> of wetland <span class="highlight">cultivation</span>. <span class="time" data-times="22.3" data-time="214.6">[03:34.60]</span>Because they had more <span class="highlight">advanced</span> techniques than were <span class="highlight">available</span> to earlier researchers, the archaeologists also were able to <span class="highlight">identify</span> actual plant remains - micro-fossils in the soil from banana plants, and...and also grains of <span class="highlight">starch</span> from taro, on the edges of stone tools that <span class="highlight">date</span> from about 10,000 years ago. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="11.37" data-time="236.9">[03:56.90]</span>Finding the taro remains were very important, because it meant that it must have been planted there, brought from the lowlands, because taro doesn't grow naturally in the highlands. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="21.63" data-time="248.27">[04:08.27]</span>And as for the bananas, researchers also found a high percentage of fossils from banana plants in <span class="highlight">sediment</span> samples dating from about 7,000 years ago, <span class="highlight">proof</span> the bananas were <span class="highlight">deliberately</span> planted, because where bananas grow naturally the <span class="highlight">concentration</span> of the plant fossils is <span class="highlight">lower</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.73" data-time="269.9">[04:29.90]</span>Bananas don't naturally grow so densely. <span class="time" data-times="14.51" data-time="272.63">[04:32.63]</span>As a matter of fact, recent <span class="highlight">genetic</span> research, <span class="highlight">genetic</span> comparisons of banana <span class="highlight">species</span>, suggests that the type of banana grown in New <span class="highlight">Guinea</span> was <span class="highlight">domesticated</span> there and then brought to Southeast Asia. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.94" data-time="287.14">[04:47.14]</span>So, not sure where I'm going with this? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="14.73" data-time="290.08">[04:50.08]</span>Well, usually, we <span class="highlight">expect</span> to see that certain social changes are brought about by the <span class="highlight">development</span> of <span class="highlight">agriculture</span>, <span class="highlight">structural</span> changes in the society like rapid <span class="highlight">population</span> growth, different social classes. <span class="time" data-times="4" data-time="304.81">[05:04.81]</span>But New <span class="highlight">Guinea</span>, it's largely unchanged. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="308.81">[05:08.81]</span>It's remained an egalitarian and <span class="highlight">rural</span> society, so what does that tell us about the usual <span class="highlight">assumption</span>? </p>
