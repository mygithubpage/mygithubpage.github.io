<span class="highlight">anthropology</span> class. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.27" data-time="4.43">[00:04.43]</span>Professor:So, we've been talking about early civilizations, how they developed, and early <span class="highlight">agriculture</span>. <span class="time" data-times="10.87" data-time="11.7">[00:11.70]</span>And it's believed that <span class="highlight">agriculture</span> arose independently in a few areas of the world about ten thousand years ago, and then <span class="highlight">spread</span> from those areas to the rest of the world. <span class="time" data-times="8.07" data-time="22.57">[00:22.57]</span>Those cradles of <span class="highlight">agriculture</span> include the Middle East, China and Southeast Asia, and parts of the Americas. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="13.53" data-time="30.64">[00:30.64]</span>Now, for many years archaeologists have speculated that <span class="highlight">agriculture</span> also arose independently in another center, too - New <span class="highlight">Guinea</span>, which is just north of Australia, in the South <span class="highlight">Pacific</span> Ocean. <span class="time" data-times="2.53" data-time="44.17">[00:44.17]</span>You can see it on this map. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="18.3" data-time="46.7">[00:46.70]</span>So, it had been assumed for a long time that New <span class="highlight">Guinea</span>, that <span class="highlight">domesticated</span> plants and animals, the practice of <span class="highlight">agriculture</span>, generally, had been introduced from Southeast Asia about 3500 years ago, had come south <span class="highlight">essentially</span>. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="10.43" data-time="65">[01:05.00]</span>Then in the 1960s and 70s, research was conducted at sites in New <span class="highlight">Guinea</span> to <span class="highlight">explore</span> the possibility of <span class="highlight">independent</span> agricultural <span class="highlight">development</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.59" data-time="75.43">[01:15.43]</span>But <span class="highlight">unfortunately</span>, the <span class="highlight">evidence</span> gathered at that time was <span class="highlight">inconclusive</span>. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="11.99" data-time="80.02">[01:20.02]</span>For <span class="highlight">instance</span>, although <span class="highlight">evidence</span> was found of <span class="highlight">deforestation</span>, you know, cutting down trees, from at <span class="highlight">least</span> 7,000 years ago, that is long before we'd thought <span class="highlight">previously</span>. <span class="time" data-times="10.24" data-time="92.01">[01:32.01]</span>It was unclear whether the forest had been cleared by farmers to plant fields, or by hunter-gatherers, so they could hunt more easily. <span class="time" data-times="9.11" data-time="102.25">[01:42.25]</span>And many plant remains like seeds and fruits don't <span class="highlight">preserve</span> well in swampy soils, in <span class="highlight">humid</span> environments like you often find in New <span class="highlight">Guinea</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.27" data-time="111.36">[01:51.36]</span>So really, the <span class="highlight">proof</span> was limited. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.28" data-time="113.63">[01:53.63]</span>But, recent research has turned up some <span class="highlight">pretty</span> convincing support. <span class="time" data-times="11.17" data-time="118.91">[01:58.91]</span>A group of archaeologists returned to a site that had been <span class="highlight">previously</span> examined, Kuk Swamp, which is in a mountain <span class="highlight">valley</span> in the highlands of what is now Papua, New <span class="highlight">Guinea</span>. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="17.43" data-time="130.08">[02:10.08]</span>Based on their findings, they identified a <span class="highlight">succession</span> of phases of agricultural <span class="highlight">development</span> in the wetlands there, with several of these phases predating the earliest known agricultural influence from Southeast Asia. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.49" data-time="147.51">[02:27.51]</span>At the site in Kuk, they used an <span class="highlight">array</span> of modern <span class="highlight">archaeological</span> methods to <span class="highlight">analyze</span><span class="highlight">sediment</span> samples from the soil. <span class="time" data-times="10.01" data-time="155">[02:35.00]</span>From the oldest soil <span class="highlight">layer</span> dating back 10,000 years, they found <span class="highlight">evidence</span> of pits, <span class="highlight">stake</span> holes and ditches. <span class="time" data-times="4.24" data-time="165.01">[02:45.01]</span>Now, these all <span class="highlight">indicate</span> that crops were being planted. <span class="time" data-times="10.08" data-time="169.25">[02:49.25]</span>Plants are tied to stakes, and ditches are for..for <span class="highlight">drainage</span>, a <span class="highlight">proof</span> of a very early, first <span class="highlight">phase</span> of agricultural <span class="highlight">development</span>. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="8.13" data-time="179.33">[02:59.33]</span>The <span class="highlight">second</span><span class="highlight">phase</span>, which they <span class="highlight">identify</span> from a higher <span class="highlight">layer</span> of soil, featured regularly distributed mounds. <span class="time" data-times="12.98" data-time="187.46">[03:07.46]</span>Mounds were constructed to plant crops that can't <span class="highlight">tolerate</span> very wet soil, such as bananas, because remember Kuk is a swampy wetland, and bananas wouldn't ordinarily grow well there. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="14.16" data-time="200.44">[03:20.44]</span>And in the layers from Kuk's third <span class="highlight">phase</span>, they found <span class="highlight">evidence</span> of an <span class="highlight">extensive</span> network of ditches and <span class="highlight">drainage</span> channels, indicating a further <span class="highlight">refinement</span> of wetland <span class="highlight">cultivation</span>. <span class="time" data-times="22.3" data-time="214.6">[03:34.60]</span>Because they had more <span class="highlight">advanced</span> techniques than were <span class="highlight">available</span> to earlier researchers, the archaeologists also were able to <span class="highlight">identify</span> actual plant remains - micro-fossils in the soil from banana plants, and...and also grains of <span class="highlight">starch</span> from taro, on the edges of stone tools that <span class="highlight">date</span> from about 10,000 years ago. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="11.37" data-time="236.9">[03:56.90]</span>Finding the taro remains were very important, because it meant that it must have been planted there, brought from the lowlands, because taro doesn't grow naturally in the highlands. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="21.63" data-time="248.27">[04:08.27]</span>And as for the bananas, researchers also found a high percentage of fossils from banana plants in <span class="highlight">sediment</span> samples dating from about 7,000 years ago, <span class="highlight">proof</span> the bananas were <span class="highlight">deliberately</span> planted, because where bananas grow naturally the <span class="highlight">concentration</span> of the plant fossils is <span class="highlight">lower</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.73" data-time="269.9">[04:29.90]</span>Bananas don't naturally grow so densely. <span class="time" data-times="14.51" data-time="272.63">[04:32.63]</span>As a matter of fact, recent <span class="highlight">genetic</span> research, <span class="highlight">genetic</span> comparisons of banana <span class="highlight">species</span>, suggests that the type of banana grown in New <span class="highlight">Guinea</span> was <span class="highlight">domesticated</span> there and then brought to Southeast Asia. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.94" data-time="287.14">[04:47.14]</span>So, not sure where I'm going with this? </p><p><span class="time" data-times="14.73" data-time="290.08">[04:50.08]</span>Well, usually, we <span class="highlight">expect</span> to see that certain social changes are brought about by the <span class="highlight">development</span> of <span class="highlight">agriculture</span>, <span class="highlight">structural</span> changes in the society like rapid <span class="highlight">population</span> growth, different social classes. <span class="time" data-times="4" data-time="304.81">[05:04.81]</span>But New <span class="highlight">Guinea</span>, it's largely unchanged. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="308.81">[05:08.81]</span>It's remained an egalitarian and <span class="highlight">rural</span> society, so what does that tell us about the usual <span class="highlight">assumption</span>? </p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the lecture mainly about?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The spread of early agricultural methods from New Guinea to other cultures.</p><p>B. Differences in the types of crops grown in early centers of agriculture.</p><p>C. Evidence supporting the theory that agriculture developed independently in New Guinea.</p><p>D. Techniques used by researchers to identify farming methods in the earliest centers of agriculture.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The professor began by pointing out how the earlier civilization was developed. He then proposed that archaeologists speculated that agriculture was also emerging in New Guinea independently. In the northern part of Australia and the South Pacific, the following were all based on this view. Early farming methods were previously discussed in Option A; the differences in the way Plant B was grown were not mentioned in the original text; Option C used the evidence to prove that the theory of agricultural independence in New Guinea was consistent with the original meaning; The farming methods in option D are not mentioned in the original text.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor, why was the archaeological evidence found in New Guinea during the 1960s and 1970s inconclusive? Click on 2 answers.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Construction of agricultural drainage ditches had damaged much of the archaeological evidence.</p><p>B. Plant remains were not well preserved in the climate of New Guinea.</p><p>C. Ancient types of domestic plants were no longer grown by modern farmers.</p><p>D. It was unclear whether evidence of early deforestation suggested planting or hunting.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="BD"><p>It is easy to locate the location of the answer by keyword. Through For instance, it can be seen that the early forest was degraded, and it was not clear whether it was cleared by farmers or hunters, and many preserved seeds and fruits could not be well preserved in the wetland. The drainage ditches in option A are not mentioned in the original text; option B is not well preserved due to climate crops in New Guinea; the species of ancient domestic plants in option C is not Being planted by today's farmers, the details are not mentioned in the original text; Option D is not sure if early forest degradation will show planting or hunting, consistent with the original details.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor talk about layers of soil?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To show how phases of agricultural development were linked to evidence of population growth.</p><p>B. To describe how researchers identified several phases of agricultural development in New Guinea.</p><p>C. To illustrate how swampy conditions cause archaeological remains to deteriorate.</p><p>D. To describe one of the methods of farming used at Kuk.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The professor first elaborated on the point of view, using examples of substances contained in three different levels of soil. The population growth population in Option A does not mention the related information in the original text; Option B is used to describe how the researcher demonstrated the different stages of agricultural development in New Guinea, and what the professor discovered with three different levels of soil. The information demonstrated by the material is consistent; the swampy conditions in Option C are only details of one layer of soil; Option D is a farming method used by Kuk, but it is only one of the details.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why did researchers conclude that the taro remains found near Kuk were a result of farming?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Taro does not grow wild in highland areas.</p><p>B. Taro is a native plant of China.</p><p>C. Taro was only found in a very small area near Kuk.</p><p>D. Taro normally does not grow in wet climates.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The original mention of the taro was very important because it meant that it had been planted and came from low-lying because taro could not naturally grow on the high ground. In option A, taro cannot grow wildly in the highland areas, consistent with the original text; China mentioned in option B is not mentioned in the original text; in option C, taro is found only in a small area near Kuk, but not in the original text. It was mentioned; the moist climate of wet climate in option D was not mentioned in the original text, and the original discussion was about high or low places.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>What evidence indicated that bananas were being cultivated in New Guinea during an earlier period than was previously thought? Click on 3 answers.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. High concentrations of fossil remains of bananas.</p><p>B. The discovery of stone tools designed to harvest bananas.</p><p>C. The presence of regularly distributed mounds.</p><p>D. Indications that Kuk did not become a swampy wetland until approximately 7,000 years ago.</p><p>E. Genetic analyses of banana remains in New Guinea and Southeast Asia.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="ACE"><p>The source mentioned that the researchers found that most of the fossils from bananas date back 7,000 years ago. It can be proved that the bananas were intentionally planted, and the natural fossils of bananas formed are relatively low. Bananas do not grow so intensively. In fact, genetic comparison of banana species can prove that bananas in New Guinea are real estate and are transmitted to Southeast Asia. The bananas saved in the fossils in option A are consistent with the original information; the banana tools in option B are harvested from the bananas and are not mentioned in the original text; the periodic growth in option C will form a heap, consistent with the original information; Kuk in option D Whether or not swampy wetland was different from the original textual information 7000 years ago; the genetic analysis of bananas in New Guinea and Southeast Asia mentioned in option E is in accordance with the original textual information.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What point does the professor make about the theory that agriculture brings about social change?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Recent research has yielded unexpected evidence supporting the theory.</p><p>B. The theory seems to be contradicted by the development of society in New Guinea.</p><p>C. Future discoveries in Kuk are likely to provide definitive proof for the theory.</p><p>D. The theory explains why New Guinea has become an egalitarian society.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The professor said that usually we expect to see certain social changes caused by rapidly growing populations and different social classes. However, New Guinea has remained largely unchanged. It still maintains an equal and primitive society. The unexpected evidence in Option A is not reflected in the original text; Option B mentions that New Guinea's social development is contrary to the usual theory, which is consistent with the original textual information.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
