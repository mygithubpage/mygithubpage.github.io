Students should also be in charge of how much money each organization receives. A special committee made up of students could be created to make these decisions. Currently, these funding decisions are made by university administrators, but a student committee would know better than the administrators which organizations are most important to students and most deserving of the university's financial support. I'm sure a lot of students would be interested in serving on the committee, and those who do serve will gain valuable leadership experience.</p></article><div><audio src="tpo44-speaking3.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></div><article id="listening-passage" class="passage"><h3>Listening Text</h3><p>Now listen to two students discussing the letter.</p><p>Woman:So what do you think of the proposal?</p><p>Man:I don't like it.</p><p>Woman:Why not?</p><p>Man:Actually, I don't think students are the right people to be making these decisions. They are too close to the situation.</p><p>Woman:What do you mean?</p><p>Man:Well, because students are directly involved in the groups, they can't be as objective, as fair as administrators. I mean, what will prevent students on the committee from just giving money to their friends' groups or favoring the groups they're in themselves. I think having the university administrators make the decisions is more fair.</p><p>Woman:Well, at least it would be good experience for the students who serve on the committee.</p><p>Man:Well, that's another thing. I think they'd have a hard time finding students to serve on it. I mean, there are already a number of leadership positions open in various campus groups, but most students just aren't interested in them.</p><p>Woman:That's true. The Student Council doesn't even have a vice president.</p><p>Man:Right. Most students are just too busy. There's no way you are gonna find enough students who are willing to volunteer their time for this committee. It's too big of a time commitment.</p></article><section id="question"><h4>Question</h4><p>The man expresses his opinion of the letter writer's proposal. State his opinion and explain the reasons he gives for holding that opinion. </p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>According to the reading, the university is planning to establish student committee. The man disagrees with the decision. His first reason is, students aren't as fair as university administrators to make decisions. Students in the special committee have the chance to provide financial support to their friends or themselves. Also he argues that most students aren't interested in the leadership positions. A number of students are too busy to do volunteer work on the serving organization.</p></article></div></main></body></html>
