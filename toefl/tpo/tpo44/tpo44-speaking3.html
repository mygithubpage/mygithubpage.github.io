          <h4 class="w3-center">Create Student Committee to Decide Funding for Student Organizations</h4>
          <p>I think students should be in charge of deciding which student organizations (for example, the jazz band or the hiking club) receive money from the university. Students should also be in charge of how much money each organization receives. A special committee made up of students could be created to make these decisions. Currently, these funding decisions are made by university administrators, but a student committee would know better than the administrators which organizations are most important to students and most deserving of the university's financial support. I'm sure a lot of students would be interested in serving on the committee, and those who do serve will gain valuable leadership experience.</p>

        <article>
          <p>Now listen to two students discussing the letter.</p>
          <p>Woman: So what do you think of the proposal?</p>
          <p>Man: I don't like it.</p>
          <p>Woman: Why not?</p>
          <p>Man: Actually, I don't think students are the right people to be making these decisions.Â They are too close to the situation.</p>
          <p>Woman: What do you mean?</p>
          <p>Man: Well, because the students are draggly involved in the groups, they can't be as objective, as fair as administrators.Â I mean what would prevents students from the committee from just giving the money to their friend's groups?Â Or favoring the groups they in themselves?Â I think having the university administrators make decisions is more fair.</p>
          <p>Woman: Well, at least that would be good experience for the students who serve on the committee.</p>
          <p>Man: Well, that's another thing.Â I think they'd have hard time finding students to serve on it.Â I mean there already a number of leadership position is open in various campus group, but most students aren't interested in them.</p>
          <p>Woman: That's true.Â The student council doesn't even have a vice president</p>
          <p>Man: Right.Â Most Students are just too busy.Â There is no way you are gonna find enough students who are willing volunteer their time for this committee.Â It's too big a time commitment.</p>
          <p>Â </p>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>According to the reading, the university is planning to establish student committee. The man disagrees with the decision. His first reason is, students aren't as fair as university administrators to make decisions. Students in the special committee have the chance to provide financial support to their friends or themselves. Also he argues that most students aren't interested in the leadership positions. A number of students are too busy to do volunteer work on the serving organization.</p>
