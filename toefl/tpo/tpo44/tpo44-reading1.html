          <h4 class="w3-center">From Fish to Terrestrial Vertebrates</h4>
          <p>One of the most <span class="highlight">significant</span> <span class="highlight">evolutionary</span> events that occurred on Earth was the <span class="highlight">transition</span> of water-dwelling fish to <span class="highlight">terrestrial</span> tetrapods (four-limbed organisms with backbones). Fish probably originated in the oceans, and our first records of them are in <span class="highlight">marine</span> rocks. However, by the <span class="highlight">Devonian</span> Period (408 million to 362 million years ago), they had radiated into almost all <span class="highlight">available</span> <span class="highlight">aquatic</span> habitats, including freshwater settings. One of the groups whose fossils are especially <span class="highlight">common</span> in rocks deposited in fresh water is the lobe-finned fish.</p>
          <p>The freshwater <span class="highlight">Devonian</span> lobe-finned fish rhipidistian crossopterygian is of <span class="highlight">particular</span> <span class="highlight">interest</span> to biologists studying <span class="highlight">tetrapod</span> <span class="highlight">evolution</span>. These fish lived in river channels and lakes on large deltas. The <span class="highlight">delta</span> rocks in which these fossils are found are commonly red <span class="highlight">due</span> to oxidized iron minerals, indicating that the deltas formed in a <span class="highlight">climate</span> that had <span class="highlight">alternate</span> wet and dry periods. If there were periods of <span class="highlight">drought</span>, any adaptations allowing the fish to <span class="highlight">survive</span> the dry conditions would have been <span class="highlight"><span class="question3">advantageous</span></span>. In these rhipidistians,several such adaptations existed. It is known that they had lungs as well as gills for <span class="highlight">breathing</span>. Cross sections cut <span class="highlight">through</span> some of the fossils <span class="highlight">reveal</span> that the mud filling the <span class="highlight">interior</span> of the <span class="highlight">carcass</span> differed in <span class="highlight">consistency</span> and <span class="highlight">texture</span> depending on its location inside the fish. These differences suggest a <span class="highlight">saclike</span> <span class="highlight">cavity</span> below the front end of the <span class="highlight">gut</span> that can only be interpreted as a lung. <span class="question5">Gills were undoubtedly the main <span class="highlight">source</span> of <span class="highlight">oxygen</span> for these fish, but the lungs served as an <span class="highlight">auxiliary</span> <span class="highlight">breathing</span> <span class="highlight">device</span> for gulping <span class="highlight">air</span> when the water became <span class="highlight">oxygen</span> <span class="highlight">depleted</span>, such as during extended periods of <span class="highlight">drought</span>.</span> So, these fish had already evolved one of the <span class="highlight">prime</span> requisites for living on land: the <span class="highlight">ability</span> to use <span class="highlight">air</span> as a <span class="highlight">source</span> of <span class="highlight">oxygen</span>.</p>
          <p>A <span class="highlight">second</span> <span class="highlight">adaptation</span> of these fish was in the structure of the lobe fins. The fins were thick, <span class="highlight">fleshy</span>, and quite <span class="highlight">sturdy</span>, with a median <span class="highlight">axis</span> of bone down the center. They could have been used as <span class="highlight">feeble</span> locomotor devices on land, perhaps good enough to allow a fish to flop its way from one pool of water that was almost dry to an <span class="highlight"><span class="question7">adjacent</span></span> pond that had enough water and <span class="highlight">oxygen</span> for <span class="highlight">survival</span>. These fins <span class="highlight">eventually</span> changed into short, <span class="highlight">stubby</span> legs. The bones of the fins of a <span class="highlight">Devonian</span> rhipidistian exactly <span class="highlight">match</span> in number and <span class="highlight">position</span> the <span class="highlight">limb</span> bones of the earliest known tetrapods, the amphibians. It should be emphasized that the <span class="highlight">evolution</span> of lungs and limbs was in no <span class="highlight">sense</span> an anticipation of future life on land. These adaptations developed because they helped fish to <span class="highlight">survive</span> in their existing <span class="highlight">aquatic</span> environment.</p>
          <p>What <span class="highlight">ecological</span> pressures might have caused fishes to <span class="highlight">gradually</span> <span class="highlight">abandon</span> their watery <span class="highlight">habitat</span> and become increasingly land-dwelling creatures? Changes in <span class="highlight">climate</span> during the <span class="highlight">Devonian</span> may have had something to do with this if freshwater areas became <span class="question8">progressively</span> more <span class="highlight">restricted</span>. Another <span class="highlight">impetus</span> may have been new sources of food. The edges of ponds and streams surely had <span class="highlight">scattered</span> dead fish and other water-dwelling. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> In <span class="highlight">addition</span>, plants had emerged into <span class="highlight">terrestrial</span> habitats in areas near streams and ponds, and crabs and other arthropods were also members of this earliest <span class="highlight">terrestrial</span> <span class="highlight">community</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> Thus, by the <span class="highlight">Devonian</span> the land <span class="highlight">habitat</span> marginal to freshwater was probably a rich <span class="highlight">source</span> of <span class="highlight">protein</span> that could be exploited by an animal that could easily climb out of water. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span> <span class="highlight">Evidence</span> from teeth suggests that these earliest tetrapods did not <span class="highlight">utilize</span> land plants as food; they were <span class="highlight">presumably</span> <span class="highlight">carnivorous</span> and had not developed the <span class="highlight">ability</span> to feed on plants. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p>
          <p>How did the first tetrapods make the <span class="highlight">transition</span> to a <span class="highlight">terrestrial</span> <span class="highlight">habitat</span>? Like early land plants such as rhyniophytes, they made only a <span class="highlight">partial</span> <span class="highlight">transition</span>; they were still quite tied to water. However, many problems that faced early land plants were not <span class="highlight">applicable</span> to the first tetrapods.The ancestors of these animals already had a <span class="highlight">circulation</span> system, and they were <span class="highlight">mobile</span>, so that they could move to water to drink. Furthermore, they already had lungs, which rhipidistians <span class="highlight">presumably</span> used for <span class="highlight">auxiliary</span> <span class="highlight">breathing</span>. The <span class="highlight">principal</span> changes for the earliest tetrapods were in the <span class="highlight">skeletal</span> system-changes in the bones of the fins, the <span class="highlight">vertebral</span> <span class="highlight">column</span>, <span class="highlight">pelvic</span> girdle, and <span class="highlight">pectoral</span> girdle.</p>

              <p>The first paragraph mainly states that one of the most important evolutions on earth is the transformation of fish from aquatic to terrestrial. The fish may have originated in the ocean. Our earliest evidence was in the rocks of the ocean.

Lobe-finned fish in option A is obviously not the earliest fish; Option B is consistent with the order of the appearance of the fish in the source; the lobe-finned fish in option C is just one; the lobe-finned fish in option D is It is more common in the ocean than in fresh water.
