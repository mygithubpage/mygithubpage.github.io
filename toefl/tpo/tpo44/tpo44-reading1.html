Fish probably originated in the oceans, and our first records of them are in <span class="highlight">marine</span> rocks. However, by the <span class="highlight">Devonian</span> Period (408 million to 362 million years ago), they had radiated into almost all <span class="highlight">available</span><span class="highlight">aquatic</span> habitats, including freshwater settings. One of the groups whose fossils are especially <span class="highlight">common</span> in rocks deposited in fresh water is the lobe-finned fish.</p><p>The freshwater <span class="highlight">Devonian</span> lobe-finned fish rhipidistian crossopterygian is of <span class="highlight">particular</span><span class="highlight">interest</span> to biologists studying <span class="highlight">tetrapod</span><span class="highlight">evolution</span>. These fish lived in river channels and lakes on large deltas. The <span class="highlight">delta</span> rocks in which these fossils are found are commonly red <span class="highlight">due</span> to oxidized iron minerals, indicating that the deltas formed in a <span class="highlight">climate</span> that had <span class="highlight">alternate</span> wet and dry periods. If there were periods of <span class="highlight">drought</span>, any adaptations allowing the fish to <span class="highlight">survive</span> the dry conditions would have been <span class="highlight"><span class="question3">advantageous</span></span>. In these rhipidistians,several such adaptations existed. It is known that they had lungs as well as gills for <span class="highlight">breathing</span>. Cross sections cut <span class="highlight">through</span> some of the fossils <span class="highlight">reveal</span> that the mud filling the <span class="highlight">interior</span> of the <span class="highlight">carcass</span> differed in <span class="highlight">consistency</span> and <span class="highlight">texture</span> depending on its location inside the fish. These differences suggest a <span class="highlight">saclike</span><span class="highlight">cavity</span> below the front end of the <span class="highlight">gut</span> that can only be interpreted as a lung. <span class="question5">Gills were undoubtedly the main <span class="highlight">source</span> of <span class="highlight">oxygen</span> for these fish, but the lungs served as an <span class="highlight">auxiliary</span><span class="highlight">breathing</span><span class="highlight">device</span> for gulping <span class="highlight">air</span> when the water became <span class="highlight">oxygen</span><span class="highlight">depleted</span>, such as during extended periods of <span class="highlight">drought</span>.</span> So, these fish had already evolved one of the <span class="highlight">prime</span> requisites for living on land: the <span class="highlight">ability</span> to use <span class="highlight">air</span> as a <span class="highlight">source</span> of <span class="highlight">oxygen</span>.</p><p>A <span class="highlight">second</span><span class="highlight">adaptation</span> of these fish was in the structure of the lobe fins. The fins were thick, <span class="highlight">fleshy</span>, and quite <span class="highlight">sturdy</span>, with a median <span class="highlight">axis</span> of bone down the center. They could have been used as <span class="highlight">feeble</span> locomotor devices on land, perhaps good enough to allow a fish to flop its way from one pool of water that was almost dry to an <span class="highlight"><span class="question7">adjacent</span></span> pond that had enough water and <span class="highlight">oxygen</span> for <span class="highlight">survival</span>. These fins <span class="highlight">eventually</span> changed into short, <span class="highlight">stubby</span> legs. The bones of the fins of a <span class="highlight">Devonian</span> rhipidistian exactly <span class="highlight">match</span> in number and <span class="highlight">position</span> the <span class="highlight">limb</span> bones of the earliest known tetrapods, the amphibians. It should be emphasized that the <span class="highlight">evolution</span> of lungs and limbs was in no <span class="highlight">sense</span> an anticipation of future life on land. These adaptations developed because they helped fish to <span class="highlight">survive</span> in their existing <span class="highlight">aquatic</span> environment.</p><p>What <span class="highlight">ecological</span> pressures might have caused fishes to <span class="highlight">gradually</span><span class="highlight">abandon</span> their watery <span class="highlight">habitat</span> and become increasingly land-dwelling creatures? Changes in <span class="highlight">climate</span> during the <span class="highlight">Devonian</span> may have had something to do with this if freshwater areas became <span class="question8">progressively</span> more <span class="highlight">restricted</span>. Another <span class="highlight">impetus</span> may have been new sources of food. The edges of ponds and streams surely had <span class="highlight">scattered</span> dead fish and other water-dwelling. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> In <span class="highlight">addition</span>, plants had emerged into <span class="highlight">terrestrial</span> habitats in areas near streams and ponds, and crabs and other arthropods were also members of this earliest <span class="highlight">terrestrial</span><span class="highlight">community</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> Thus, by the <span class="highlight">Devonian</span> the land <span class="highlight">habitat</span> marginal to freshwater was probably a rich <span class="highlight">source</span> of <span class="highlight">protein</span> that could be exploited by an animal that could easily climb out of water. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span><span class="highlight">Evidence</span> from teeth suggests that these earliest tetrapods did not <span class="highlight">utilize</span> land plants as food; they were <span class="highlight">presumably</span><span class="highlight">carnivorous</span> and had not developed the <span class="highlight">ability</span> to feed on plants. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p><p>How did the first tetrapods make the <span class="highlight">transition</span> to a <span class="highlight">terrestrial</span><span class="highlight">habitat</span>? Like early land plants such as rhyniophytes, they made only a <span class="highlight">partial</span><span class="highlight">transition</span>; they were still quite tied to water. However, many problems that faced early land plants were not <span class="highlight">applicable</span> to the first tetrapods.The ancestors of these animals already had a <span class="highlight">circulation</span> system, and they were <span class="highlight">mobile</span>, so that they could move to water to drink. Furthermore, they already had lungs, which rhipidistians <span class="highlight">presumably</span> used for <span class="highlight">auxiliary</span><span class="highlight">breathing</span>. The <span class="highlight">principal</span> changes for the earliest tetrapods were in the <span class="highlight">skeletal</span> system-changes in the bones of the fins, the <span class="highlight">vertebral</span><span class="highlight">column</span>, <span class="highlight">pelvic</span> girdle, and <span class="highlight">pectoral</span> girdle.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Paragraph 1 supports which of the following statements about fish evolution?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Lobe-finned fish were among the earliest types of fish to appear.</p><p>B. Fish began living in freshwater habitats only after originating elsewhere.</p><p>C. Lobe-finned fish radiated into almost all available aquatic habitats.</p><p>D. During the Devonian, lobe-finned fish were more common in marine than in freshwater habitats.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The first paragraph mainly states that one of the most important evolutions on earth is the transformation of fish from aquatic to terrestrial. The fish may have originated in the ocean. Our earliest evidence was in the rocks of the ocean. But during the Devonian period, fish began to appear in aquatic forms, including fresh water, and one of the fossils was particularly lobe-finned fish in freshwater rocks. Lobe-finned fish in option A is obviously not the earliest fish; Option B is consistent with the order of the appearance of the fish in the source; the lobe-finned fish in option C is just one; the lobe-finned fish in option D is It is more common in the ocean than in fresh water. There is no comparison in the original text.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 2, what do the minerals in the delta rocks containing rhipidistian crossopterygian fossils reveal?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

Most rhipidistian crossopterygian fish died when the climate became dry.</p><p>D. Rhipidistian crossopterygian fish lived in areas that experienced alternate dry and wet periods.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The second phrase is the delta rocks in which these fossils are found are commonly red due to oxidized iron minerals, indicating that the deltas formed in a climate that had alternate wet and dry periods. The minerals in the rhipidistian crossopterygian fossil in the delta The material reveals that the area in which it lived experienced a period of alternating drought and moisture, and Option D is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question3">advantageous</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. beneficial</p><p>B. necessary</p><p>C. remarkable</p><p>D. common</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" A"><p>Advantages are <span class="question3">advantageous</span>, Option A is useful, Option B is necessary, Option C is extraordinary, Option D is normal, so Option A is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>In paragraph 2, why does the author include the information that mud inside rhipidistian crossopterygian fossils differed in consistency and texture depending on where the mud was located?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To provide evidence that rhipidistian crossopterygian lived in river channels and lakes on large deltas.</p><p>B. To identify an effect of the oxidation of iron minerals on the evolution of rhipidistian crossopterygian.</p><p>C.

These differences suggest a The obvious answer is C, in order to explain why scientists got rhipidistian crossopterygians who might have lung lungs.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Because the lungs of these fish were able to provide only a small amount of oxygen, these fish obtained most of their oxygen through their gills during periods of drought.</p><p>B. During periods of extended drought, these fish used their lungs to increase their intake of oxygen beyond the levels absorbed by the gills in normal times.</p><p>C. Although these fish primarily used their gills to obtain oxygen, they used their lungs to obtain oxygen from the air when there was not enough in the water.</p><p>D. During periods of extended drought, the gills became an auxiliary breathing device and the lungs became the main source of oxygen for these fish.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Gills were undoubtedly the main source of oxygen for these fish, but the lungs served as an auxiliary breathing device for gulping air when the water became oxygen depleted, such as during became periods of drought. Concerned about the logical word but. Translate to, For these fish In other words, baboons are undoubtedly the main source of oxygen, but the lungs are auxiliary respiratory devices for breathing air, when the oxygen in the water is depleted, especially when drying is prolonged.</p><p>A. wrong. The exchange of features between lungs and gills gives the most false top level.</p><p>B. Wrong. There is no comparison between gills and lungs in normal times.</p><p>C. Correct. Although=but The logic is correct. The fish rely mainly on the gills to get oxygen. When there is not enough water, the lungs get oxygen. This sentence is the correct rewriting of the article.</p><p>D. Wrong. Gills exchanged features with the lungs and an error occurred.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 3, the structure of the fins of rhipidistian crossopterygian may have allowed these fish to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. reduce the amount of oxygen needed for survival</p><p>B. develop thick, sturdy bones</p><p>C. move more efficiently in water</p><p>D. move short distances over areas that were mostly dry</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The topics are clearly pointed to the specifics, with the questions asked to return to the article positioning, The fins were thick, fleshy, and quite sturdy, with a median axis of bone down the center. They could have been used as feeble locomotor devices on land , perhaps good enough to allow a fish to flop its way from one pool of water that was almost dry to an <span class="question7">adjacent</span> pond that had enough water and oxygen for survival.

Changes in... Another impetus... In addition, plants had emerged into terrestrial habitats in areas near streams and ponds, and That is illustrated by the following three points: Crabs and other arthropods are justified by one of the additions. Option D is consistent with the original text in order to prove why certain fish is became a possible cause of terrestrial organisms.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, teeth of the earliest tetrapods suggest that these tetrapods</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. competed with other animals for protein</p><p>B. were probably carnivores</p><p>C. could easily climb out of water</p><p>D. were able to eat plants</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>By the keyword teeth of the earliest tetrapods, the fourth tetrapods tetrapods are positioned to the fourth segment Evidence from teeth suggests that these earliest tetrapods did not utilize land plants as food; they were presumably carnivorous and had not developed the ability to feed on plants. Instead of using land plants as food, they are probably still carnivores and have not yet been able to develop to feed on plants. Option B may be the same as the original meaning of carnivorous animals.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 5, which of the following was true of the first tetrapods?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.
