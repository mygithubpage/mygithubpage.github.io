            <b>From Fish to Terrestrial Vertebrates</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>One of the most <span class="underline">significant</span> <span class="underline">evolutionary</span> events that occurred on Earth was the <span class="underline">transition</span> of water-dwelling fish to <span class="underline">terrestrial</span> tetrapods (four-limbed organisms with backbones). Fish probably originated in the oceans, and our first records of them are in <span class="underline">marine</span> rocks. However, by the <span class="underline">Devonian</span> Period (408 million to 362 million years ago), they had radiated into almost all <span class="underline">available</span> <span class="underline">aquatic</span> habitats, including freshwater settings. One of the groups whose fossils are especially <span class="underline">common</span> in rocks deposited in fresh water is the lobe-finned fish.</p>
          <p>The freshwater <span class="underline">Devonian</span> lobe-finned fish rhipidistian crossopterygian is of <span class="underline">particular</span> <span class="underline">interest</span> to biologists studying <span class="underline">tetrapod</span> <span class="underline">evolution</span>. These fish lived in river channels and lakes on large deltas. The <span class="underline">delta</span> rocks in which these fossils are found are commonly red <span class="underline">due</span> to oxidized iron minerals, indicating that the deltas formed in a <span class="underline">climate</span> that had <span class="underline">alternate</span> wet and dry periods. If there were periods of <span class="underline">drought</span>, any adaptations allowing the fish to <span class="underline">survive</span> the dry conditions would have been <span class="underline">advantageous</span>. In these rhipidistians,several such adaptations existed. It is known that they had lungs as well as gills for <span class="underline">breathing</span>. Cross sections cut <span class="underline">through</span> some of the fossils <span class="underline">reveal</span> that the mud filling the <span class="underline">interior</span> of the <span class="underline">carcass</span> differed in <span class="underline">consistency</span> and <span class="underline">texture</span> depending on its location inside the fish. These differences suggest a <span class="underline">saclike</span> <span class="underline">cavity</span> below the front end of the <span class="underline">gut</span> that can only be interpreted as a lung. Gills were undoubtedly the main <span class="underline">source</span> of <span class="underline">oxygen</span> for these fish, but the lungs served as an <span class="underline">auxiliary</span> <span class="underline">breathing</span> <span class="underline">device</span> for gulping <span class="underline">air</span> when the water became <span class="underline">oxygen</span> <span class="underline">depleted</span>, such as during extended periods of <span class="underline">drought</span>. So, these fish had already evolved one of the <span class="underline">prime</span> requisites for living on land: the <span class="underline">ability</span> to use <span class="underline">air</span> as a <span class="underline">source</span> of <span class="underline">oxygen</span>.</p>
          <p>A <span class="underline">second</span> <span class="underline">adaptation</span> of these fish was in the structure of the lobe fins. The fins were thick, <span class="underline">fleshy</span>, and quite <span class="underline">sturdy</span>, with a median <span class="underline">axis</span> of bone down the center. They could have been used as <span class="underline">feeble</span> locomotor devices on land, perhaps good enough to allow a fish to flop its way from one pool of water that was almost dry to an <span class="underline">adjacent</span> pond that had enough water and <span class="underline">oxygen</span> for <span class="underline">survival</span>. These fins <span class="underline">eventually</span> changed into short, <span class="underline">stubby</span> legs. The bones of the fins of a <span class="underline">Devonian</span> rhipidistian exactly <span class="underline">match</span> in number and <span class="underline">position</span> the <span class="underline">limb</span> bones of the earliest known tetrapods, the amphibians. It should be emphasized that the <span class="underline">evolution</span> of lungs and limbs was in no <span class="underline">sense</span> an anticipation of future life on land. These adaptations developed because they helped fish to <span class="underline">survive</span> in their existing <span class="underline">aquatic</span> environment.</p>
          <p>What <span class="underline">ecological</span> pressures might have caused fishes to <span class="underline">gradually</span> <span class="underline">abandon</span> their watery <span class="underline">habitat</span> and become increasingly land-dwelling creatures? Changes in <span class="underline">climate</span> during the <span class="underline">Devonian</span> may have had something to do with this if freshwater areas became progressively more <span class="underline">restricted</span>. Another <span class="underline">impetus</span> may have been new sources of food. The edges of ponds and streams surely had <span class="underline">scattered</span> dead fish and other water-dwelling. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> In <span class="underline">addition</span>, plants had emerged into <span class="underline">terrestrial</span> habitats in areas near streams and ponds, and crabs and other arthropods were also members of this earliest <span class="underline">terrestrial</span> <span class="underline">community</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> Thus, by the <span class="underline">Devonian</span> the land <span class="underline">habitat</span> marginal to freshwater was probably a rich <span class="underline">source</span> of <span class="underline">protein</span> that could be exploited by an animal that could easily climb out of water. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span> <span class="underline">Evidence</span> from teeth suggests that these earliest tetrapods did not <span class="underline">utilize</span> land plants as food; they were <span class="underline">presumably</span> <span class="underline">carnivorous</span> and had not developed the <span class="underline">ability</span> to feed on plants. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p>
          <p>How did the first tetrapods make the <span class="underline">transition</span> to a <span class="underline">terrestrial</span> <span class="underline">habitat</span>? Like early land plants such as rhyniophytes, they made only a <span class="underline">partial</span> <span class="underline">transition</span>; they were still quite tied to water. However, many problems that faced early land plants were not <span class="underline">applicable</span> to the first tetrapods.The ancestors of these animals already had a <span class="underline">circulation</span> system, and they were <span class="underline">mobile</span>, so that they could move to water to drink. Furthermore, they already had lungs, which rhipidistians <span class="underline">presumably</span> used for <span class="underline">auxiliary</span> <span class="underline">breathing</span>. The <span class="underline">principal</span> changes for the earliest tetrapods were in the <span class="underline">skeletal</span> system-changes in the bones of the fins, the <span class="underline">vertebral</span> <span class="underline">column</span>, <span class="underline">pelvic</span> girdle, and <span class="underline">pectoral</span> girdle.</p>
