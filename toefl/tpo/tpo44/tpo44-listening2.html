Last time we finished going over some of the <span class="highlight">fundamental</span> concepts of nanotechnology, the multi-disciplinary science of manipulating or controlling extremely small units of matter on the <span class="highlight">scale</span> of molecules or <span class="highlight">even</span> atoms.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.97" data-time="20.06">[00:20.06]</span>So, I want to talk about how nanotechnology is being used today. <span class="time" data-times="4.97" data-time="25.03">[00:25.03]</span>And just to give you an idea, we'll look at one <span class="highlight">particular</span><span class="highlight">application</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="15.03" data-time="30">[00:30.00]</span>A team of <span class="highlight">material</span> scientists in Massachusetts has been working on a new ultra-thin <span class="highlight">coating</span>, a <span class="highlight">nano</span><span class="highlight">coating</span> that might be applied to objects like bathroom mirrors, car windows, and eye glasses to prevent fogging. <span class="time" data-times="9.17" data-time="45.03">[00:45.03]</span>And the <span class="highlight">coating</span> has the <span class="highlight">potential</span> to be a <span class="highlight">permanent</span><span class="highlight">solution</span>, unlike the kinds of anti-fogging spray-on liquids that are on the <span class="highlight">market</span> today.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="12.2" data-time="54.2">[00:54.20]</span>Now, fogging often occurs when a cold surface comes into <span class="highlight">contact</span> with warm <span class="highlight">moist</span><span class="highlight">air</span>, such as when a glass <span class="highlight">shower</span> door or <span class="highlight">mirror</span> fogs up during a warm <span class="highlight">shower</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="10.62" data-time="66.4">[01:06.40]</span>Now, what's actually happening is, what the fog is, is thousands of tiny <span class="highlight">spherical</span> water droplets condensing on the surface of the glass. <span class="time" data-times="7.09" data-time="77.02">[01:17.02]</span>Light hits the water droplets and is <span class="highlight">scattered</span> in <span class="highlight">random</span> directions, causing the fogging effect.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.44" data-time="84.11">[01:24.11]</span>Now, the kind of spray-on treatments I mentioned. <span class="time" data-times="2.39" data-time="87.55">[01:27.55]</span>Well, they <span class="highlight">wear</span> off. <span class="time" data-times="11.75" data-time="89.94">[01:29.94]</span>What happens is they cause the tiny water droplets to <span class="highlight">flatten</span> when they <span class="highlight">condense</span> on the surface of the <span class="highlight">shower</span> door or bathroom <span class="highlight">mirror</span> or whatever object it is, it's been applied to.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.38" data-time="101.69">[01:41.69]</span>Because the droplets are flattened, when light hits them, the light doesn't <span class="highlight">scatter</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.64" data-time="108.07">[01:48.07]</span>But, as I said, those kinds of treatments don't last very long.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.9" data-time="112.71">[01:52.71]</span>The new <span class="highlight">coating</span> has two important components. <span class="time" data-times="7.52" data-time="116.61">[01:56.61]</span>One, negatively charged <span class="highlight">silicon</span><span class="highlight">nano</span> particles, these are basically tiny particles of glass. <span class="time" data-times="7.6" data-time="124.13">[02:04.13]</span>And two, a positively charged polymer, which you already know, a polymer is a chemical <span class="highlight">compound</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.11" data-time="131.73">[02:11.73]</span>They're layered over each other. <span class="time" data-times="7.01" data-time="133.84">[02:13.84]</span>The polymer, then the <span class="highlight">silicon</span><span class="highlight">nano</span> particles, the polymer, then the <span class="highlight">silicon</span><span class="highlight">nano</span> particles, you see. <span class="time" data-times="6.38" data-time="140.85">[02:20.85]</span>They're layered in such a way that the <span class="highlight">silicon</span><span class="highlight">nano</span> particles don't <span class="highlight">pack</span> together tightly. <span class="time" data-times="6.84" data-time="147.23">[02:27.23]</span>In other words, the structure has pores, or holes, little tiny pockets <span class="highlight">throughout</span> it.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.83" data-time="154.07">[02:34.07]</span>The <span class="highlight">coating</span> prevents fog from developing, because it loves water. <span class="time" data-times="4.1" data-time="158.9">[02:38.90]</span>It attracts the water droplets, sucking them into the tiny pores. <span class="time" data-times="2.85" data-time="163">[02:43.00]</span>And that alters the <span class="highlight">shape</span> of the droplets. <span class="time" data-times="13.23" data-time="165.85">[02:45.85]</span>The droplets are forced to <span class="highlight">flatten</span> and to join together into a single sheet of water, rather than <span class="highlight">remaining</span> as single droplets, each of which is a <span class="highlight">sphere</span> that scatters light in different directions.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.68" data-time="179.08">[02:59.08]</span>Ok, so, <span class="highlight">instead</span> of being <span class="highlight">scattered</span>, the light passes <span class="highlight">through</span> the thin sheet of water. <span class="time" data-times="2.94" data-time="185.76">[03:05.76]</span>So, there's no fogging effect.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="11.52" data-time="188.7">[03:08.70]</span>The ultra-thin <span class="highlight">coating</span> can be made more <span class="highlight">durable</span> by heating it, and of <span class="highlight">course</span> the object it's applied to, to an extremely hot <span class="highlight">temperature</span>, 500 <span class="highlight">degree</span> Celsius. <span class="time" data-times="9.18" data-time="200.22">[03:20.22]</span>What that does, is burn the polymer away, and <span class="highlight">fuse</span> the <span class="highlight">silicon</span><span class="highlight">nano</span> particles together, while maintaining the structure of pores.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.84" data-time="209.4">[03:29.40]</span>But that's possible only on materials that can <span class="highlight">withstand</span> high heat. <span class="time" data-times="1.95" data-time="214.24">[03:34.24]</span>Glass? Yes. <span class="time" data-times="2.26" data-time="216.19">[03:36.19]</span>Plastics? No. <span class="time" data-times="8.57" data-time="218.45">[03:38.45]</span>But they're working on solving that problem, trying to come up with a way to coat plastics and other materials, durably and effectively.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.89" data-time="227.02">[03:47.02]</span>Interestingly, it was a plant, the lotus plant that inspired this work. <span class="time" data-times="3.93" data-time="232.91">[03:52.91]</span>I guess you could say inspired it in an indirect <span class="highlight">sort</span> of way. <span class="time" data-times="5.49" data-time="236.84">[03:56.84]</span>The leaves of this plant are what we call superhydrophobic. <span class="time" data-times="5.26" data-time="242.33">[04:02.33]</span>Lotus leaves, being superhydrophobic, don't <span class="highlight">attract</span> water. <span class="time" data-times="3.23" data-time="247.59">[04:07.59]</span>They <span class="highlight">repel</span> it, in a big way. <span class="time" data-times="4.24" data-time="250.82">[04:10.82]</span>When raindrops fall on lotus leaves, they <span class="highlight">remain</span><span class="highlight">spherical</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.24" data-time="255.06">[04:15.06]</span>They <span class="highlight">roll</span> right off.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="11.31" data-time="257.3">[04:17.30]</span>So for a long time, the Massachusetts scientists tried to create a <span class="highlight">coating</span> that acted like these lotus leaves, a <span class="highlight">coating</span> that was superhydrophobic. <span class="time" data-times="4.2" data-time="268.61">[04:28.61]</span>But then they began to think about the <span class="highlight">opposite</span><span class="highlight">extreme</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9.23" data-time="272.81">[04:32.81]</span>Could they <span class="highlight">accomplish</span> their goal by making a <span class="highlight">coating</span> that, <span class="highlight">instead</span> of repelling water, actually, attracted water?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.69" data-time="282.04">[04:42.04]</span>Well, they <span class="highlight">seem</span> to have gotten quite far with this <span class="highlight">approach</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.32" data-time="285.73">[04:45.73]</span>It's really strong work, with a <span class="highlight">range</span> of interesting consumer applications. <span class="time" data-times="2.65" data-time="291.05">[04:51.05]</span>It's not costly to <span class="highlight">manufacture</span> the <span class="highlight">coating</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.64" data-time="293.7">[04:53.70]</span>Some car-makers are interested in applying it to their wind shields. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="297.34">[04:57.34]</span>Looks like we'll probably see it on the markets in everyday products in the next few years.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the main purpose of the lecture?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.
