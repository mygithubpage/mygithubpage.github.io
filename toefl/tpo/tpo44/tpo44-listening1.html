            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.97" data-time="13.08">[00:13.08]</span>Woman:They are actually at the library. <span class="time" data-times="3.93" data-time="15.05">[00:15.05]</span>They have a <span class="underline">biology</span> lab <span class="underline">assignment</span> that's <span class="underline">due</span> later this afternoon. <span class="time" data-times="2.53" data-time="18.98">[00:18.98]</span>So I'm here to <span class="underline">represent</span> the whole group.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="11.49" data-time="21.51">[00:21.51]</span>But...um...when we got your e-mail message about being worried about our research <span class="underline">project</span>, we were a little <span class="underline">confused</span>, we thought you were excited about our idea for the <span class="underline">project</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.63" data-time="33">[00:33.00]</span>Professor:Well, I think it's a great research topic, but when I looked closely at your plan for accomplishing the research, I realized that your group was probably asking for some trouble.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.2" data-time="42.63">[00:42.63]</span>Woman:What do you mean?<span class="time" data-times="10.41" data-time="43.83">[00:43.83]</span>I thought that, you know, by monitoring students studying in the library we could really get a good understanding of people's study habits and <span class="underline">stuff</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.94" data-time="54.24">[00:54.24]</span>Professor:The thing is, I think you might have a problem because of the Hawthorne Effect.</p>

              <span class="time" data-times="2.62" data-time="59.18">[00:59.18]</span>Woman:The Hawthorne Effect?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="12.07" data-time="61.8">[01:01.80]</span>Professor:The Hawthorne effect is a <span class="underline">technical</span> <span class="underline">term</span> for when researchers ...uh...more or less forget about a <span class="underline">specific</span> <span class="underline">variable</span>, the <span class="underline">variable</span> of the researchers themselves.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.73" data-time="73.87">[01:13.87]</span>Now, the students in the library, they are going to know that you are observing them, right?<span class="time" data-times="5.24" data-time="79.6">[01:19.60]</span> So you have to <span class="underline">consider</span> the effect your very presence will have on the people you are observing.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.68" data-time="84.84">[01:24.84]</span>Woman:But...so you think... <span class="time" data-times="4.25" data-time="87.52">[01:27.52]</span>I mean it's not like our observations would be a secret. <span class="time" data-times="3" data-time="91.77">[01:31.77]</span>The students would know exactly what we would be doing. <span class="time" data-times="4.02" data-time="94.77">[01:34.77]</span>I mean, we'd put up a sign right outside the library.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.71" data-time="98.79">[01:38.79]</span>Professor:Yes, but that's just it. <span class="time" data-times="4.4" data-time="101.5">[01:41.50]</span>When people know they are being watched, they act differently. <span class="time" data-times="5.87" data-time="105.9">[01:45.90]</span>Let me explain how the Hawthorne effect got its name and...well...you'll get the idea.</p>

              <span class="time" data-times="4.64" data-time="111.77">[01:51.77]</span>See, there was a manufacturing <span class="underline">facility</span> called the Hawthorne plant. <span class="time" data-times="5.71" data-time="116.41">[01:56.41]</span>And researchers conducted some experiments there to see what conditions make workers the most <span class="underline">productive</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.59" data-time="122.12">[02:02.12]</span>Woman:What <span class="underline">sort</span> of conditions?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.21" data-time="123.71">[02:03.71]</span>Professor:Well, one thing they experimented with was the lights. <span class="time" data-times="3.66" data-time="127.92">[02:07.92]</span>Were workers more <span class="underline">productive</span> with bright lights or <span class="underline">dim</span> lights?<span class="time" data-times="6.49" data-time="131.58">[02:11.58]</span>Well, here is the thing, whatever the researchers did, the workers' <span class="underline">productivity</span> increased. <span class="time" data-times="3.26" data-time="138.07">[02:18.07]</span>When the lighting was improved, <span class="underline">productivity</span> went up. <span class="time" data-times="3.88" data-time="141.33">[02:21.33]</span>When the lighting was dimmed, <span class="underline">productivity</span> went up again.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.68" data-time="145.21">[02:25.21]</span>Woman:That doesn't make a lot of <span class="underline">sense</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.2" data-time="146.89">[02:26.89]</span>Professor:Exactly! So <span class="underline">initially</span> the experiment was considered a failure. <span class="time" data-times="6.81" data-time="152.09">[02:32.09]</span>But then the researchers realized that their own presence had affected the workers' <span class="underline">productivity</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.94" data-time="158.9">[02:38.90]</span>The workers knew that the researchers were watching them, and with so much <span class="underline">attention</span> on them the workers felt compelled to work harder.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.07" data-time="166.84">[02:46.84]</span>Woman:Oh, I guess that really could be an <span class="underline">issue</span> with my group's research.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.51" data-time="171.91">[02:51.91]</span>Professor:Yes, but I don't want to send you all back to <span class="underline">square</span> one. <span class="time" data-times="4.84" data-time="175.42">[02:55.42]</span>So how about you set up a meeting with your group members and discuss this. <span class="time" data-times="3.25" data-time="180.26">[03:00.26]</span>Then we can meet again and go over your ideas. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="183.51">[03:03.51]</span>And I think that we should be able to <span class="underline">figure</span> out a way to get around the problem.</p>
