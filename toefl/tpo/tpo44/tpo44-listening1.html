<span class="highlight">conversation</span> between a student and her <span class="highlight">sociology</span> professor.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.64" data-time="6.71">[00:06.71]</span>Professor:I'm glad you got my message and were able to make it. <span class="time" data-times="2.41" data-time="9.35">[00:09.35]</span>But where are the other members of your group?<span class="time" data-times="1.32" data-time="11.76">[00:11.76]</span>Tom and Jane?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="1.97" data-time="13.08">[00:13.08]</span>Woman:They are actually at the library. <span class="time" data-times="3.93" data-time="15.05">[00:15.05]</span>They have a <span class="highlight">biology</span> lab <span class="highlight">assignment</span> that's <span class="highlight">due</span> later this afternoon. <span class="time" data-times="2.53" data-time="18.98">[00:18.98]</span>So I'm here to <span class="highlight">represent</span> the whole group.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="11.49" data-time="21.51">[00:21.51]</span>But...um...when we got your e-mail message about being worried about our research <span class="highlight">project</span>, we were a little <span class="highlight">confused</span>, we thought you were excited about our idea for the <span class="highlight">project</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="9.63" data-time="33">[00:33.00]</span>Professor:Well, I think it's a great research topic, but when I looked closely at your plan for accomplishing the research, I realized that your group was probably asking for some trouble.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="1.2" data-time="42.63">[00:42.63]</span>Woman:What do you mean?<span class="time" data-times="10.41" data-time="43.83">[00:43.83]</span>I thought that, you know, by monitoring students studying in the library we could really get a good understanding of people's study habits and <span class="highlight">stuff</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.94" data-time="54.24">[00:54.24]</span>Professor:The thing is, I think you might have a problem because of the Hawthorne Effect.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.62" data-time="59.18">[00:59.18]</span>Woman:The Hawthorne Effect?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="12.07" data-time="61.8">[01:01.80]</span>Professor:The Hawthorne effect is a <span class="highlight">technical</span><span class="highlight">term</span> for when researchers ...uh...more or less forget about a <span class="highlight">specific</span><span class="highlight">variable</span>, the <span class="highlight">variable</span> of the researchers themselves.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.73" data-time="73.87">[01:13.87]</span>Now, the students in the library, they are going to know that you are observing them, right?<span class="time" data-times="5.24" data-time="79.6">[01:19.60]</span> So you have to <span class="highlight">consider</span> the effect your very presence will have on the people you are observing.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.68" data-time="84.84">[01:24.84]</span>Woman:But...so you think... <span class="time" data-times="4.25" data-time="87.52">[01:27.52]</span>I mean it's not like our observations would be a secret. <span class="time" data-times="3" data-time="91.77">[01:31.77]</span>The students would know exactly what we would be doing. <span class="time" data-times="4.02" data-time="94.77">[01:34.77]</span>I mean, we'd put up a sign right outside the library.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.71" data-time="98.79">[01:38.79]</span>Professor:Yes, but that's just it. <span class="time" data-times="4.4" data-time="101.5">[01:41.50]</span>When people know they are being watched, they act differently. <span class="time" data-times="5.87" data-time="105.9">[01:45.90]</span>Let me explain how the Hawthorne effect got its name and...well...you'll get the idea.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.64" data-time="111.77">[01:51.77]</span>See, there was a manufacturing <span class="highlight">facility</span> called the Hawthorne plant. <span class="time" data-times="5.71" data-time="116.41">[01:56.41]</span>And researchers conducted some experiments there to see what conditions make workers the most <span class="highlight">productive</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="1.59" data-time="122.12">[02:02.12]</span>Woman:What <span class="highlight">sort</span> of conditions?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.21" data-time="123.71">[02:03.71]</span>Professor:Well, one thing they experimented with was the lights. <span class="time" data-times="3.66" data-time="127.92">[02:07.92]</span>Were workers more <span class="highlight">productive</span> with bright lights or <span class="highlight">dim</span> lights?<span class="time" data-times="6.49" data-time="131.58">[02:11.58]</span>Well, here is the thing, whatever the researchers did, the workers' <span class="highlight">productivity</span> increased. <span class="time" data-times="3.26" data-time="138.07">[02:18.07]</span>When the lighting was improved, <span class="highlight">productivity</span> went up. <span class="time" data-times="3.88" data-time="141.33">[02:21.33]</span>When the lighting was dimmed, <span class="highlight">productivity</span> went up again.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="1.68" data-time="145.21">[02:25.21]</span>Woman:That doesn't make a lot of <span class="highlight">sense</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.2" data-time="146.89">[02:26.89]</span>Professor:Exactly! So <span class="highlight">initially</span> the experiment was considered a failure. <span class="time" data-times="6.81" data-time="152.09">[02:32.09]</span>But then the researchers realized that their own presence had affected the workers' <span class="highlight">productivity</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.94" data-time="158.9">[02:38.90]</span>The workers knew that the researchers were watching them, and with so much <span class="highlight">attention</span> on them the workers felt compelled to work harder.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.07" data-time="166.84">[02:46.84]</span>Woman:Oh, I guess that really could be an <span class="highlight">issue</span> with my group's research.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.51" data-time="171.91">[02:51.91]</span>Professor:Yes, but I don't want to send you all back to <span class="highlight">square</span> one. <span class="time" data-times="4.84" data-time="175.42">[02:55.42]</span>So how about you set up a meeting with your group members and discuss this. <span class="time" data-times="3.25" data-time="180.26">[03:00.26]</span>Then we can meet again and go over your ideas. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="183.51">[03:03.51]</span>And I think that we should be able to <span class="highlight">figure</span> out a way to get around the problem.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the student go to see the professor?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To get his opinion about why a project she recently completed had unexpected results.</p><p>B. To discuss how a topic covered in class is similar to her group's research topic.</p><p>C. To ask him for suggestions to address a problem in her research.</p><p>D. To discuss the professor's concern about her group's research project.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The Professor mentioned here that the student's research topic is very good, but may face some difficulties in the research process. Judging from the combination of options, the recently completed mistake of the A option, B's similar to her group did not mention, C's ask him for suggestions not mentioned. So the correct answer is D, corresponding to professor's concern.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>In response to the professor's question, what does the woman say about Tom and Jane?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They are working on an assignment for another class.</p><p>B. They are already observing students for the research project.</p><p>C. They are dealing with a technical issue at the library.</p><p>D. They are making arrangements at the library for their research project.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The teaching here asks the students where the other two members are. The female students answer that they are rushing to work in the biological laboratory. She came here to represent the entire team. Corresponds to option A.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What had the group of students planned to research?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The effect of noise on the productivity of library employees.</p><p>B. The effect of changing the amount of light in the library.</p><p>C. The study habits of students in the library.</p><p>D. The effect that being observed while studying has on students.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Here the students asked further about the professor's statement. She felt that they were studying the students in the library and could better understand their study habits. Corresponds to option C.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor mention lighting?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To explain why production costs gradually increased over the years at a manufacturing plant</p><p>B. To give a reason for a decline in productivity at two manufacturing plants</p><p>C. To compare the working conditions at two manufacturing plants</p><p>D. To give an example of a working condition that was adjusted at a manufacturing plant</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The professor here gives examples of lighting experiments for students' questions. Workers' productivity increases when the lights are bright and dark. Outstanding experimental conditions were affected by different environmental conditions and corresponded to option D.</p></div></div><div class="replay" id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the student say this?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. She is disappointed with the observations that the members of her group have made so far.</p><p>B. She does not understand the point that the professor is making.</p><p>C. She wants to determine a way for her group to make observations in secret.</p><p>D. She is aware that her group's presence might affect student behavior.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The tone of the students can reflect her uncertain attitude, and the students added that their observation experiment will no longer be a secret, suggesting that she does not understand very much what the professor said the researcher's presence will have an impact on the researcher. The professor explained this issue in detail. Exclude option A of disappointed with the observations, C's determine a way, D's aware that her group. So the correct answer is B.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
