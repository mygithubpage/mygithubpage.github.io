Dr. Morten. <span class="time" data-times="1.44" data-time="7">[00:07.00]</span>I'm Karen Stern. <span class="time" data-times="3.39" data-time="8.44">[00:08.44]</span>I met you <span class="highlight">briefly</span> about a year ago when I was applying to the university. <span class="time" data-times="4.13" data-time="11.83">[00:11.83]</span>You were on a <span class="highlight">panel</span> of professors and you were talking about the art <span class="highlight">department</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.42" data-time="15.96">[00:15.96]</span>Professor:Ah...and you are now a student here. <span class="time" data-times="1.54" data-time="19.38">[00:19.38]</span>I guess I said the right thing.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.27" data-time="20.92">[00:20.92]</span>Student:Yeah. Right now I am doing the intro-courses in the art <span class="highlight">department</span>, but I am really interested in painting.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.5" data-time="27.19">[00:27.19]</span>Professor:Well, I teach several of the painting courses so I hope to see you in the future.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.31" data-time="31.69">[00:31.69]</span>Student:Actually I was wondering: you are in charge of student art exhibitions at the university <span class="highlight">gallery</span>, right?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="0.53" data-time="38">[00:38.00]</span>Professor:Right!</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.67" data-time="38.53">[00:38.53]</span>Student:So I know all the exhibitors are students, but I was wondering how you choose the works you <span class="highlight">exhibit</span> every month. <span class="time" data-times="2.82" data-time="44.2">[00:44.20]</span>Is there like a <span class="highlight">submission</span> <span class="highlight">process</span> or something?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.56" data-time="47.02">[00:47.02]</span>Professor:No. There is a <span class="highlight">submission</span> <span class="highlight">process</span>, yes. <span class="time" data-times="6.09" data-time="49.58">[00:49.58]</span>We a have <span class="highlight">gallery</span> <span class="highlight">review</span> <span class="highlight">committee</span>, but we already have our exhibitions planned for the rest of the schoolyear. <span class="time" data-times="5.01" data-time="55.67">[00:55.67]</span>Generally our exhibitors are third- and fourth-year students, well into their coursework.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.25" data-time="60.68">[01:00.68]</span>Student:Oh, Well, I guess that will be something to look <span class="highlight">forward</span> to then. <span class="time" data-times="3.37" data-time="64.93">[01:04.93]</span>Tell me, do you show all kinds of paintings?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.6" data-time="68.3">[01:08.30]</span>Professor:Well, actually we started doing something different with the <span class="highlight">gallery</span> this year. <span class="time" data-times="2.64" data-time="71.9">[01:11.90]</span>We are featuring a <span class="highlight">specific</span> <span class="highlight">technique</span> each month. <span class="time" data-times="3.66" data-time="74.54">[01:14.54]</span>Next month's exhibition, for <span class="highlight">instance</span>, will feature drip paintings.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.84" data-time="78.2">[01:18.20]</span>Student:Really? Like Jackson Pollock?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.06" data-time="80.04">[01:20.04]</span>Professor:Ah....so you are <span class="highlight">familiar</span> with Pollock's work.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.1" data-time="82.1">[01:22.10]</span>Student:Well, <span class="highlight">sort</span> of, though I've only seen photographs of it. <span class="time" data-times="3.88" data-time="85.2">[01:25.20]</span>I know he dripped paint onto the <span class="highlight">canvas</span> <span class="highlight">instead</span> of using a <span class="highlight">brush</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9" data-time="89.08">[01:29.08]</span>I read he stretched out his canvases on the floor of a <span class="highlight">studio</span> and then he climbed up on a ladder to pour paint, ordinary house paint, from a can onto the <span class="highlight">canvas</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="0.95" data-time="98.08">[01:38.08]</span>Professor:That's right. <span class="time" data-times="4.91" data-time="99.03">[01:39.03]</span>That was <span class="highlight">characteristic</span> of Pollock in the late forties, in what we call his drip period. <span class="time" data-times="9.8" data-time="103.94">[01:43.94]</span>And the object was to produce a <span class="highlight">constant</span> <span class="highlight">stream</span> of paint to create <span class="highlight">continuous</span> lines, because as you know when you use a <span class="highlight">brush</span> directly on a <span class="highlight">canvas</span> you get broken lines. <span class="time" data-times="2.09" data-time="113.74">[01:53.74]</span>So, you like Pollock.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.22" data-time="115.83">[01:55.83]</span>Student:Yeah, I do. <span class="time" data-times="2.37" data-time="117.05">[01:57.05]</span>I like <span class="highlight">abstract</span> works in general. <span class="time" data-times="2.21" data-time="119.42">[01:59.42]</span>There's a class on <span class="highlight">abstract</span> art, right?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.27" data-time="121.63">[02:01.63]</span>Professor:Actually I teach that class and drip painting was one of our themes last year. <span class="time" data-times="9.86" data-time="126.9">[02:06.90]</span>Some students from last year's class have continued experimenting with it and created some <span class="highlight">incredible</span> pieces using everything from squeezed bottles to computer controlled sprayers.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.68" data-time="136.76">[02:16.76]</span>Student:Do they look a lot like Pollock's work?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.94" data-time="139.44">[02:19.44]</span>Professor:Well, our goal wasn't to <span class="highlight">imitate</span> Jackson Pollock. <span class="time" data-times="4.45" data-time="142.38">[02:22.38]</span>The object was to get students to look at different ways of applying paint to a <span class="highlight">canvas</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.29" data-time="146.83">[02:26.83]</span>But you don't have to <span class="highlight">enroll</span> in a <span class="highlight">specific</span> <span class="highlight">course</span> to be invited to <span class="highlight">exhibit</span> your work. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="151.12">[02:31.12]</span>It just has to fit the theme for one of our exhibitions.</p>
