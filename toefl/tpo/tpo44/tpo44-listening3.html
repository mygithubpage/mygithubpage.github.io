            <span class="time" data-times="4.47" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator:Listen to part of a lecture in an <span class="highlight">introduction</span> to drama class.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="9.44" data-time="4.47">[00:04.47]</span>Professor:Now, <span class="highlight">throughout</span> the <span class="highlight">history</span> of drama, there has been a, well, a relationship between the structure of a play, and the structure of the <span class="highlight">space</span> where the play was performed. <span class="time" data-times="3.28" data-time="13.91">[00:13.91]</span>And this goes all the way back to the <span class="highlight">ancient</span> Greeks.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.87" data-time="17.19">[00:17.19]</span>The Greeks built the first theaters in the fifth <span class="highlight">century</span> B.C.E. <span class="time" data-times="1.98" data-time="21.06">[00:21.06]</span>These were outdoor theaters. <span class="time" data-times="6.87" data-time="23.04">[00:23.04]</span>The architects looked for sites where you had a natural bowl-like <span class="highlight">formation</span> on the side of a hill, and that's where they set the theater. <span class="time" data-times="2.72" data-time="29.91">[00:29.91]</span>All Greek theaters were <span class="highlight">pretty</span> much the same. <span class="time" data-times="9.27" data-time="32.63">[00:32.63]</span>There was some natural <span class="highlight">variation</span> to <span class="highlight">accommodate</span> the size and <span class="highlight">shape</span> of the site, but as far as the <span class="highlight">basic</span> elements went, those remained <span class="highlight">constant</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.82" data-time="41.9">[00:41.90]</span>Have a look at this <span class="highlight">diagram</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.96" data-time="44.72">[00:44.72]</span>Let's start with the area where the actors performed, like, what we call the <span class="highlight">stage</span> today. <span class="time" data-times="3.15" data-time="50.68">[00:50.68]</span>The Greeks referred to this <span class="highlight">space</span> as the Skene. <span class="time" data-times="4.84" data-time="53.83">[00:53.83]</span>Uh, there's some <span class="highlight">confusion</span> about the use of the word 'skene' by different scholars. <span class="time" data-times="14.05" data-time="58.67">[00:58.67]</span>Some authors use it to <span class="highlight">refer</span> only to the structure behind the <span class="highlight">stage</span>, while others use it to <span class="highlight">refer</span> to the structure and the <span class="highlight">stage</span> together, and that's how I'll use the <span class="highlight">term</span>, to <span class="highlight">refer</span> to both the <span class="highlight">stage</span> and the building.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="7.45" data-time="72.72">[01:12.72]</span>Um, so, anyway, the skene started as a simple wooden platform, but <span class="highlight">eventually</span> became much more <span class="highlight">elaborate</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.86" data-time="80.17">[01:20.17]</span>The front wall of the building was decorated like a palace, or a <span class="highlight">temple</span>, and served as background <span class="highlight">scenery</span> for the play. <span class="time" data-times="4.9" data-time="87.03">[01:27.03]</span>The building was also a <span class="highlight">storage</span> place for costumes, props, things like that.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="0.81999999999999" data-time="91.93">[01:31.93]</span>Yes, Robert?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="8.29" data-time="92.75">[01:32.75]</span>Student:So, did they <span class="highlight">decorate</span> the skene for each play or, um, change the <span class="highlight">scenery</span> during the play, like we do today? <span class="time" data-times="2.54" data-time="101.04">[01:41.04]</span>Or, did the whole story take place in one <span class="highlight">setting</span>?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="11.05" data-time="103.58">[01:43.58]</span>Professor:Well, everything the <span class="highlight">audience</span> saw happened in that one <span class="highlight">setting</span> usually in front of either a <span class="highlight">temple</span> or a palace, but the <span class="highlight">audience</span> didn't witness all events in the story. <span class="time" data-times="7.37" data-time="114.63">[01:54.63]</span>Some events couldn't be presented convincingly, so the playwrights had them take place somewhere off <span class="highlight">stage</span>, where the <span class="highlight">audience</span> couldn't see them. <span class="time" data-times="4.62" data-time="122">[02:02.00]</span>And then news of the event would be reported by one of the characters. Diane?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.04" data-time="126.62">[02:06.62]</span>Student:Last summer, I saw...Hippolytus.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.95" data-time="129.66">[02:09.66]</span>Professor:Excellent! I hope you enjoyed it.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="19.87" data-time="131.61">[02:11.61]</span>Student:<span class="highlight">Definitely</span>. So, at one point, you see Hippolytus being sent off by his father, then a little later, a messenger arrives and describes how Hippolytus was riding in his chariot when a <span class="highlight">giant</span> bull appeared out of the ocean, and caused the chariot to <span class="highlight">crash</span>, and then, after we hear what happened to Hippolytus, he's carried back on <span class="highlight">stage</span> where he dies.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="7.07" data-time="151.48">[02:31.48]</span>Professor:Exactly. I mean, can you imagine trying to show all that <span class="highlight">action</span>, a <span class="highlight">giant</span> animal rising out of the sea?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.65" data-time="158.55">[02:38.55]</span>Um, Okay. The next area was the <span class="highlight">space</span> the <span class="highlight">ancient</span> Greeks called the <span class="highlight">Orchestra</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.84" data-time="164.2">[02:44.20]</span>The <span class="highlight">orchestra</span> was either round, as you see here, or a semi-circle. <span class="time" data-times="8.72" data-time="169.04">[02:49.04]</span>Um, in <span class="highlight">ancient</span> Greek, the word <span class="highlight">orchestra</span> actually meant the dancing place, because this is where the <span class="highlight">chorus</span> danced and sang.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.25" data-time="177.76">[02:57.76]</span>But to understand Greek plays, you need to understand an <span class="highlight">additional</span> <span class="highlight">function</span> of the <span class="highlight">chorus</span>. <span class="time" data-times="14.59" data-time="184.01">[03:04.01]</span>Yes, the <span class="highlight">ancient</span> Greek <span class="highlight">chorus</span> did most <span class="highlight">definitely</span> sing and dance like choruses do today, but the <span class="highlight">chorus</span>'s most important role was commenting on what the characters on <span class="highlight">stage</span> were doing and thinking. <span class="time" data-times="7.77" data-time="198.6">[03:18.60]</span>In fact, <span class="highlight">Aristotle</span>, the Greek <span class="highlight">philosopher</span>, thought the <span class="highlight">chorus</span> should be considered as <span class="highlight">acting</span> out a role in the play.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.49" data-time="206.37">[03:26.37]</span>Student:Yeah, I read that a <span class="highlight">chorus</span> could have a <span class="highlight">distinct</span> <span class="highlight">personality</span>, just like a person.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.5" data-time="210.86">[03:30.86]</span>Professor:<span class="highlight">Absolutely</span>. In fact, you'll see an excellent example of that in the first play we'll be studying.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.37" data-time="216.36">[03:36.36]</span>Okay, the last <span class="highlight">space</span> was the seating area for the <span class="highlight">audience</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.61" data-time="220.73">[03:40.73]</span>This was called the theatron. <span class="time" data-times="7.78" data-time="223.34">[03:43.34]</span>In <span class="highlight">ancient</span> Greek, theatron means seeing, that's S-E-E-l-N-G, seeing place. <span class="time" data-times="6.18" data-time="231.12">[03:51.12]</span>The theatron was shaped in a semi-circle with rows of seating rising up the sides of the bowl. <span class="time" data-times="4.17" data-time="237.3">[03:57.30]</span>It was designed to take <span class="highlight">advantage</span> of the natural <span class="highlight">acoustic</span> benefits of the <span class="highlight">setting</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9.17" data-time="241.47">[04:01.47]</span>The <span class="highlight">shape</span> of the bowl captured <span class="highlight">sound</span> and funneled it upwards so that <span class="highlight">even</span> in the top rows, spectators were able to hear the performers very clearly.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.93" data-time="250.64">[04:10.64]</span>Actually, that the name theatron means seeing place is kind of <span class="highlight">ironic</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="256.57">[04:16.57]</span>Some theaters had fifty or more rows of seats accommodating up to 14,000 spectators, <span class="highlight">ascending</span> way up the hillside, and this was long before theater binoculars were invented.</p>

              <p>In the original text, professors first said that some incidents cannot be presented in a convincing manner. Therefore, the playwrights did not allow them to appear on the stage, and the audience could not see them. Then the students mentioned Hippolytus to prove it based on the professor's question. Option A is an illustration of a strategy adopted by the late Greek playwright, consistent with the original intention; Option B, in order to give an example of how animals were represented in ancient Greek plays, does not correspond to the original intention; the first use of a in option C.
