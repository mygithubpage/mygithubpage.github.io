              <span class="time" data-times="4.47" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator:Listen to part of a lecture in an <span class="underline">introduction</span> to drama class.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.44" data-time="4.47">[00:04.47]</span>Professor:Now, <span class="underline">throughout</span> the <span class="underline">history</span> of drama, there has been a, well, a relationship between the structure of a play, and the structure of the <span class="underline">space</span> where the play was performed. <span class="time" data-times="3.28" data-time="13.91">[00:13.91]</span>And this goes all the way back to the <span class="underline">ancient</span> Greeks.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.87" data-time="17.19">[00:17.19]</span>The Greeks built the first theaters in the fifth <span class="underline">century</span> B.C.E. <span class="time" data-times="1.98" data-time="21.06">[00:21.06]</span>These were outdoor theaters. <span class="time" data-times="6.87" data-time="23.04">[00:23.04]</span>The architects looked for sites where you had a natural bowl-like <span class="underline">formation</span> on the side of a hill, and that's where they set the theater. <span class="time" data-times="2.72" data-time="29.91">[00:29.91]</span>All Greek theaters were <span class="underline">pretty</span> much the same. <span class="time" data-times="9.27" data-time="32.63">[00:32.63]</span>There was some natural <span class="underline">variation</span> to <span class="underline">accommodate</span> the size and <span class="underline">shape</span> of the site, but as far as the <span class="underline">basic</span> elements went, those remained <span class="underline">constant</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.82" data-time="41.9">[00:41.90]</span>Have a look at this <span class="underline">diagram</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.96" data-time="44.72">[00:44.72]</span>Let's start with the area where the actors performed, like, what we call the <span class="underline">stage</span> today. <span class="time" data-times="3.15" data-time="50.68">[00:50.68]</span>The Greeks referred to this <span class="underline">space</span> as the Skene. <span class="time" data-times="4.84" data-time="53.83">[00:53.83]</span>Uh, there's some <span class="underline">confusion</span> about the use of the word 'skene' by different scholars. <span class="time" data-times="14.05" data-time="58.67">[00:58.67]</span>Some authors use it to <span class="underline">refer</span> only to the structure behind the <span class="underline">stage</span>, while others use it to <span class="underline">refer</span> to the structure and the <span class="underline">stage</span> together, and that's how I'll use the <span class="underline">term</span>, to <span class="underline">refer</span> to both the <span class="underline">stage</span> and the building.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.45" data-time="72.72">[01:12.72]</span>Um, so, anyway, the skene started as a simple wooden platform, but <span class="underline">eventually</span> became much more <span class="underline">elaborate</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.86" data-time="80.17">[01:20.17]</span>The front wall of the building was decorated like a palace, or a <span class="underline">temple</span>, and served as background <span class="underline">scenery</span> for the play. <span class="time" data-times="4.9" data-time="87.03">[01:27.03]</span>The building was also a <span class="underline">storage</span> place for costumes, props, things like that.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="0.81999999999999" data-time="91.93">[01:31.93]</span>Yes, Robert?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.29" data-time="92.75">[01:32.75]</span>Student:So, did they <span class="underline">decorate</span> the skene for each play or, um, change the <span class="underline">scenery</span> during the play, like we do today? <span class="time" data-times="2.54" data-time="101.04">[01:41.04]</span>Or, did the whole story take place in one <span class="underline">setting</span>?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="11.05" data-time="103.58">[01:43.58]</span>Professor:Well, everything the <span class="underline">audience</span> saw happened in that one <span class="underline">setting</span> usually in front of either a <span class="underline">temple</span> or a palace, but the <span class="underline">audience</span> didn't witness all events in the story. <span class="time" data-times="7.37" data-time="114.63">[01:54.63]</span>Some events couldn't be presented convincingly, so the playwrights had them take place somewhere off <span class="underline">stage</span>, where the <span class="underline">audience</span> couldn't see them. <span class="time" data-times="4.62" data-time="122">[02:02.00]</span>And then news of the event would be reported by one of the characters. Diane?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.04" data-time="126.62">[02:06.62]</span>Student:Last summer, I saw...Hippolytus.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.95" data-time="129.66">[02:09.66]</span>Professor:Excellent! I hope you enjoyed it.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="19.87" data-time="131.61">[02:11.61]</span>Student:<span class="underline">Definitely</span>. So, at one point, you see Hippolytus being sent off by his father, then a little later, a messenger arrives and describes how Hippolytus was riding in his chariot when a <span class="underline">giant</span> bull appeared out of the ocean, and caused the chariot to <span class="underline">crash</span>, and then, after we hear what happened to Hippolytus, he's carried back on <span class="underline">stage</span> where he dies.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.07" data-time="151.48">[02:31.48]</span>Professor:Exactly. I mean, can you imagine trying to show all that <span class="underline">action</span>, a <span class="underline">giant</span> animal rising out of the sea?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.65" data-time="158.55">[02:38.55]</span>Um, Okay. The next area was the <span class="underline">space</span> the <span class="underline">ancient</span> Greeks called the <span class="underline">Orchestra</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.84" data-time="164.2">[02:44.20]</span>The <span class="underline">orchestra</span> was either round, as you see here, or a semi-circle. <span class="time" data-times="8.72" data-time="169.04">[02:49.04]</span>Um, in <span class="underline">ancient</span> Greek, the word <span class="underline">orchestra</span> actually meant the dancing place, because this is where the <span class="underline">chorus</span> danced and sang.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.25" data-time="177.76">[02:57.76]</span>But to understand Greek plays, you need to understand an <span class="underline">additional</span> <span class="underline">function</span> of the <span class="underline">chorus</span>. <span class="time" data-times="14.59" data-time="184.01">[03:04.01]</span>Yes, the <span class="underline">ancient</span> Greek <span class="underline">chorus</span> did most <span class="underline">definitely</span> sing and dance like choruses do today, but the <span class="underline">chorus</span>'s most important role was commenting on what the characters on <span class="underline">stage</span> were doing and thinking. <span class="time" data-times="7.77" data-time="198.6">[03:18.60]</span>In fact, <span class="underline">Aristotle</span>, the Greek <span class="underline">philosopher</span>, thought the <span class="underline">chorus</span> should be considered as <span class="underline">acting</span> out a role in the play.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.49" data-time="206.37">[03:26.37]</span>Student:Yeah, I read that a <span class="underline">chorus</span> could have a <span class="underline">distinct</span> <span class="underline">personality</span>, just like a person.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.5" data-time="210.86">[03:30.86]</span>Professor:<span class="underline">Absolutely</span>. In fact, you'll see an excellent example of that in the first play we'll be studying.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.37" data-time="216.36">[03:36.36]</span>Okay, the last <span class="underline">space</span> was the seating area for the <span class="underline">audience</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.61" data-time="220.73">[03:40.73]</span>This was called the theatron. <span class="time" data-times="7.78" data-time="223.34">[03:43.34]</span>In <span class="underline">ancient</span> Greek, theatron means seeing, that's S-E-E-l-N-G, seeing place. <span class="time" data-times="6.18" data-time="231.12">[03:51.12]</span>The theatron was shaped in a semi-circle with rows of seating rising up the sides of the bowl. <span class="time" data-times="4.17" data-time="237.3">[03:57.30]</span>It was designed to take <span class="underline">advantage</span> of the natural <span class="underline">acoustic</span> benefits of the <span class="underline">setting</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9.17" data-time="241.47">[04:01.47]</span>The <span class="underline">shape</span> of the bowl captured <span class="underline">sound</span> and funneled it upwards so that <span class="underline">even</span> in the top rows, spectators were able to hear the performers very clearly.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.93" data-time="250.64">[04:10.64]</span>Actually, that the name theatron means seeing place is kind of <span class="underline">ironic</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="256.57">[04:16.57]</span>Some theaters had fifty or more rows of seats accommodating up to 14,000 spectators, <span class="underline">ascending</span> way up the hillside, and this was long before theater binoculars were invented.</p>
