          <p>When I was in college, I worked in a non-profit organization as a volunteer. I tutored the homeless children and encouraged them to challenge the difficulties. First of all, the experience colored my campus life and inspired my enthusiasm to participate in extracurricular activities. What's more, this volunteer experience enabled me to cherish the happiness and filled me with gratitude.</p>
