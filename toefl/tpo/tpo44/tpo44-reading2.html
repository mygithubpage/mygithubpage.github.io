The <span class="highlight">image</span> of the illuminated area outside the enclosure is thrown upside down as if by magic onto a surface in the darkened enclosure. This <span class="highlight">technique</span> was known as long ago as the fifth <span class="highlight">century</span> B.C. in China. <span class="highlight">Aristotle</span> also experimented with it in the fourth <span class="highlight">century</span> B.C., and Leonardo da Vinci described it in his notebooks in 1490. In 1558 Giovanni Battista Della Porta wrote in his twenty-volume work Magia naturalis (meaning "natural magic") instructions for adding a <span class="highlight">convex</span><span class="highlight">lens</span> to <span class="highlight">improve</span> the <span class="highlight">quality</span> of the <span class="highlight">image</span> thrown against a <span class="highlight">canvas</span> or <span class="highlight">panel</span> in the darkened area where its outlines could be traced. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> Later, <span class="highlight"><span class="question2">portable</span></span> camera obscuras were developed, with <span class="highlight">interior</span> mirrors and drawing tables on which the artist could <span class="highlight">trace</span> the <span class="highlight">image</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> For the artist, this <span class="highlight">technique</span> allows forms and <span class="highlight">linear</span><span class="highlight">perspective</span> to be drawn precisely as they would be seen from a single viewpoint. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span> Mirrors were also used to <span class="highlight">reverse</span> the <span class="question3">projected</span> images to their <span class="highlight">original</span> positions. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p><p>Did some of the great masters of painting, then, <span class="highlight">trace</span> their images using a camera obscura? Some art historians are now looking for clues of artists' use of such devices. <span class="question5">One of the artists whose paintings are being analyzed from this point of view is the great Dutch master, Jan Vermeer, who lived from 1632 to 1675 during the flowering of art and science in the Netherlands, including the science of optics.</span> Vermeer produced only about 30 known paintings, including his famous The Art of Painting. The room shown in it closely resembles the room in other Vermeer paintings, with lighting coming from a window on the left, the same roof beams, and <span class="highlight">similar</span> floor tiles, suggesting that the room was fitted with a camera obscura on the side in the <span class="highlight">foreground</span>. The map hung on the <span class="highlight">opposite</span> wall was a real map in Vermeer's <span class="highlight">possession</span>, reproduced in such <span class="question7">faithful</span><span class="highlight">detail</span> that some kind of <span class="highlight">tracery</span> is suspected. When one of Vermeer's paintings was X-rayed, it did not have any <span class="highlight">preliminary</span> sketches on the <span class="highlight">canvas</span><span class="highlight">beneath</span> the paint, but rather the complete <span class="highlight">image</span> drawn in black and white without any <span class="highlight">trial</span> sketches. Vermeer did not have any students, did not keep any records, and did not <span class="highlight">encourage</span> anyone to visit his <span class="highlight">studio</span>, facts that can be interpreted as protecting his secret use of a camera obscura.</p><p>In recent times the British artist David Hockney has published his investigations into the secret use of the camera obscura, claiming that for up to 400 years, many of Western art's great masters probably used the <span class="highlight">device</span> to produce almost photographically <span class="highlight">realistic</span> details in their paintings. He includes in this group Caravaggio, Hans Holbein, Leonardo da Vinci, Diego Velazquez, Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, Agnolo Bronzino, and Jan van Eyck. From an artist's point of view, Hockney observed that a camera obscura compresses the <span class="highlight">complicated</span> forms of a three-dimensional <span class="highlight">scene</span> into two-dimensional shapes that can easily be traced and also increases the <span class="highlight">contrast</span> between light and dark, <span class="highlight">leading</span> to the chiaroscuro effect seen in many of these paintings. In Jan van Eyck's The Marriage of Giovanni Arnolfini and Giovanna Cenami, the <span class="highlight">complicated</span> foreshortening in the chandelier and the <span class="highlight"><span class="question10">intricate</span></span><span class="highlight">detail</span> in the bride's garments are among the clues that Hockney thinks point to the use of the camera obscura.</p><p>So what are we to <span class="highlight">conclude</span>? If these artists did use a camera obscura, does that <span class="highlight"><span class="question11">diminish</span></span> their <span class="highlight">stature</span>? Hockney argues that the camera obscura does not <span class="highlight">replace</span><span class="highlight">artistic</span> skill in drawing and painting. In experimenting with it, he found that it is actually quite difficult to use for drawing, and he speculates that the artists probably combined their observations from life with tracing of shapes.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What can be inferred from paragraph 1 about Giovanni Battista Della Porta's contribution to the camera obscura?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.
