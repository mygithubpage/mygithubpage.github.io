        <article>
          <p>Listen to a conversation between two students.</p>
          <p>Man:Hey. Didn't you get a new roommate recently? Linda's her name, right? How's that working out?</p>
          <p>Woman:Oh. Linda's nice, but...well, there's sort of a problem.</p>
          <p>Man:Oh?</p>
          <p>Woman:Yeah. Our schedules totally conflict. I like to do my studying late at night in our room, but she likes to go to sleep early. So unfortunately, my studying, my typing on the computer, is keeping her awake.</p>
          <p>Man:What are you gonna do?</p>
          <p>Woman:Well, we've talked about it. Linda has to get up early every morning for class, so there's nothing she can do. So as I see it, I've got two options.</p>
          <p>Man:What are they?</p>
          <p>Woman:Well, I could adjust my schedule, start going to bed earlier and doing my studying either in the morning or sometime during the day, the way Linda does.</p>
          <p>Man:So you change your daily schedule so it's more like your roommate's?</p>
          <p>Woman:Yeah. That way I wouldn't be keeping her up at night.</p>
          <p>Man:Sure.</p>
          <p>Woman:The thing is I'm not really a morning person when it comes to studying, so I'm not sure how much work I'd get done in the morning or at other times of the day since I tend to be busy then doing other things.</p>
          <p>Man:What's your other option?</p>
          <p>Woman:Well, I could go to the library at night, do my studying there.</p>
          <p>Man:Why not do that? Use the library.</p>
          <p>Woman:Well, the thing is I prefer the convenience of my own room. The library is okay, but you know, I've got a really comfortable desk chair in my room and all my other stuffs there too, my books, my notes, the stuff I really need to help me study.</p>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>The woman has a problem with her roommate Linda: they have completely different schedules. She prefers to study late at night, but Linda likes to sleep early. Then the woman comes up with two solutions. This first option is that she could adjust her schedule, to make it more like her roommate's. But she is not sure how much work she gets done since she is not a very morning person. Another option is that she can go to library at night, but the library is not as convenient as her own room. Personally speaking, I prefer the second solution. Although she can try to adjust her schedule, there is no guarantee that she can adapt to this new lifestyle. Studying in library can not only provide her with a good studying environment, but also eliminating the conflicts between her and her roommate.</p>
