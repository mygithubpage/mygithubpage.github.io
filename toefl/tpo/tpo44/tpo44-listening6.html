            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.05" data-time="5.27">[00:05.27]</span>Professor:Now, there is growing <span class="highlight">interest</span> these days in generating <span class="highlight">electricity</span> from renewable energy sources, right?<span class="time" data-times="5.73" data-time="12.32">[00:12.32]</span>From developing wind farms to tapping into an <span class="highlight">underground</span> <span class="highlight">source</span> of <span class="highlight">geothermal</span> energy. <span class="time" data-times="7.39" data-time="18.05">[00:18.05]</span>And when you're considering a new <span class="highlight">project</span>, if s important to look at the costs as well as benefits of developing that energy <span class="highlight">source</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.3" data-time="25.44">[00:25.44]</span>Let me give you an example of the kind of thing I am talking about.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="11.73" data-time="28.74">[00:28.74]</span>There is currently a lot of <span class="highlight">interest</span> in harnessing the power of the oceans, of the ocean tides, that is, the movement of huge amounts of water which causes the water <span class="highlight">level</span> of oceans to rise and fall. <span class="time" data-times="6.62" data-time="40.47">[00:40.47]</span>The idea is that if we can <span class="highlight">harness</span> that <span class="highlight">tidal</span> energy, it'd be a great clean renewable energy <span class="highlight">source</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.45" data-time="47.09">[00:47.09]</span>One place where this <span class="highlight">tidal</span> energy can be harnessed is at a <span class="highlight">shallow</span> body of water, such as an estuary. <span class="time" data-times="2.95" data-time="53.54">[00:53.54]</span>Now, can anyone tell us what an estuary is?<span class="time" data-times="0.94" data-time="56.49">[00:56.49]</span> Yes, Ted.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.04" data-time="57.43">[00:57.43]</span>Student:An estuary is where a river enters the ocean. <span class="time" data-times="2.59" data-time="60.47">[01:00.47]</span>The fresh water meets the ocean water. <span class="time" data-times="1.7" data-time="63.06">[01:03.06]</span>Sometimes it is covered in water. <span class="time" data-times="1.55" data-time="64.76">[01:04.76]</span>Sometimes it is not.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.89" data-time="66.31">[01:06.31]</span>Professor:Some parts of the estuary, as the tides go in and out, but other parts are always submerged.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="11.87" data-time="73.2">[01:13.20]</span>Now, estuaries are an <span class="highlight">ideal</span> place to try to <span class="highlight">capture</span> energy from changes in tides because, well, there is an exceptionally large <span class="highlight">difference</span> between the water <span class="highlight">level</span> at high <span class="highlight">tide</span> and at low <span class="highlight">tide</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.21" data-time="85.07">[01:25.07]</span>All that movement of water generates a lot of energy. <span class="time" data-times="5.94" data-time="88.28">[01:28.28]</span>And one way to <span class="highlight">harness</span> that energy is by building a structure called a barrage there.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.84" data-time="94.22">[01:34.22]</span>A barrage is basically a large low <span class="highlight">dam</span> that's built <span class="highlight">across</span> an estuary. <span class="time" data-times="5.16" data-time="99.06">[01:39.06]</span>When the tides go in and out, the moving water flows <span class="highlight">through</span> tunnels in the barrage. <span class="time" data-times="8.97" data-time="104.22">[01:44.22]</span>So you have huge amounts of water trying to flow <span class="highlight">through</span> these <span class="highlight">relatively</span> small tunnels and that turns turbines that <span class="highlight">generate</span> <span class="highlight">electricity</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.61" data-time="113.19">[01:53.19]</span>Now, these estuaries are important because of their high <span class="highlight">level</span> of biological <span class="highlight">productivity</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.75" data-time="118.8">[01:58.80]</span>They are home to lots of birds, fish and other <span class="highlight">marine</span> life. <span class="time" data-times="4.93" data-time="122.55">[02:02.55]</span>So when you <span class="highlight">propose</span> to <span class="highlight">construct</span> a barrage, you have lots of issues to <span class="highlight">consider</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.28" data-time="127.48">[02:07.48]</span>For example, it would change the existing water levels in the estuary. <span class="time" data-times="8.08" data-time="131.76">[02:11.76]</span>Since a lot of water is getting held up by the barrage, the <span class="highlight">incoming</span> tides won't go as high, but they wouldn't be as low during low <span class="highlight">tide</span>, either. <span class="time" data-times="2" data-time="139.84">[02:19.84]</span>This might help prevent flooding. <span class="time" data-times="7.25" data-time="141.84">[02:21.84]</span>But it would also <span class="highlight">affect</span> the mudflats, those areas of mud that <span class="highlight">normally</span> are <span class="highlight">exposed</span> when the <span class="highlight">tide</span> recedes.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.69" data-time="149.09">[02:29.09]</span>Student:But don't lots of birds <span class="highlight">rely</span> on <span class="highlight">exposed</span> mudflats for food?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.35" data-time="153.78">[02:33.78]</span>I mean, don't they eat tiny animals that live in the mud?<span class="time" data-times="2.28" data-time="157.13">[02:37.13]</span> And what about those tiny animals?<span class="time" data-times="3" data-time="159.41">[02:39.41]</span> What would happen to them if the mudflats were <span class="highlight">endangered</span>?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.19" data-time="162.41">[02:42.41]</span>Professor:So you are seeing some of the <span class="highlight">potential</span> problems with the barrage. <span class="time" data-times="5.08" data-time="165.6">[02:45.60]</span>But <span class="highlight">consider</span> this, right now, the water in an estuary is very cloudy. <span class="time" data-times="5.73" data-time="170.68">[02:50.68]</span>The <span class="highlight">tidal</span> currents are <span class="highlight">constantly</span> churning up the sediments that rivers <span class="highlight">deposit</span> in the estuary. <span class="time" data-times="2.95" data-time="176.41">[02:56.41]</span>But a barrage would reduce the <span class="highlight">tidal</span> currents. <span class="time" data-times="3.5" data-time="179.36">[02:59.36]</span>So a lot of that <span class="highlight">sediment</span> would <span class="highlight">settle</span> to the floor of the estuary. <span class="time" data-times="1.89" data-time="182.86">[03:02.86]</span>It wouldn't get stirred up so much. <span class="time" data-times="9.94" data-time="184.75">[03:04.75]</span>The water would be clearer, allowing more sunlight to <span class="highlight">reach</span> deeper into the water, which might <span class="highlight">lead</span> to more food for birds and other animals, attracting new wildlife to the area. <span class="time" data-times="2.98" data-time="194.69">[03:14.69]</span>So it's a <span class="highlight">complicated</span> <span class="highlight">environmental</span> picture.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.25" data-time="197.67">[03:17.67]</span>Student:Have they tried this anywhere?<span class="time" data-times="1.73" data-time="198.92">[03:18.92]</span> Built a barrage?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.98" data-time="200.65">[03:20.65]</span>Professor:Yes, there are several in operation. <span class="time" data-times="1.41" data-time="203.63">[03:23.63]</span>There is one in France.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.68" data-time="205.04">[03:25.04]</span>Now, they have to be careful there about how they turn on the turbines because they create currents and waves that can <span class="highlight">affect</span> boats.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.23" data-time="211.72">[03:31.72]</span>But I haven't read about any <span class="highlight">major</span> <span class="highlight">ecological</span> problems. <span class="time" data-times="2.65" data-time="214.95">[03:34.95]</span>In fact, the fishing is supposed to have improved. <span class="time" data-times="2.46" data-time="217.6">[03:37.60]</span>Plus there is <span class="highlight">even</span> more bird life.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.12" data-time="220.06">[03:40.06]</span>But some of the barrages we're considering now would be much larger than that one. <span class="time" data-times="6.43" data-time="224.18">[03:44.18]</span>There has been one proposed for the estuary of Great Britain's Severn River, one of the largest estuaries in the world. <span class="time" data-times="2.61" data-time="230.61">[03:50.61]</span>It would be 16 kilometers long. <span class="time" data-times="3.87" data-time="233.22">[03:53.22]</span>Just to give you an idea, the barrage in France is less than a kilometer.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.87" data-time="237.09">[03:57.09]</span>Outside of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> concerns, such a <span class="highlight">project</span> would be hugely expensive and that's another <span class="highlight">argument</span> against barrages, well, such large ones anyway. <span class="time" data-times="6.79" data-time="246.96">[04:06.96]</span>Critics say that it would better to use that money for something else, such as improving the energy <span class="highlight">efficiency</span> of buildings. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="253.75">[04:13.75]</span>You could make a lot of buildings more <span class="highlight">efficient</span> with all that money and that would reduce the need for <span class="highlight">electricity</span>.</p>
