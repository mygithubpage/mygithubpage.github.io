part of a lecture in an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> science class.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.05" data-time="5.27">[00:05.27]</span>Professor:Now, there is growing <span class="highlight">interest</span> these days in generating <span class="highlight">electricity</span> from renewable energy sources, right?<span class="time" data-times="5.73" data-time="12.32">[00:12.32]</span>From developing wind farms to tapping into an <span class="highlight">underground</span><span class="highlight">source</span> of <span class="highlight">geothermal</span> energy. <span class="time" data-times="7.39" data-time="18.05">[00:18.05]</span>And when you're considering a new <span class="highlight">project</span>, if s important to look at the costs as well as benefits of developing that energy <span class="highlight">source</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.3" data-time="25.44">[00:25.44]</span>Let me give you an example of the kind of thing I am talking about.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="11.73" data-time="28.74">[00:28.74]</span>There is currently a lot of <span class="highlight">interest</span> in harnessing the power of the oceans, of the ocean tides, that is, the movement of huge amounts of water which causes the water <span class="highlight">level</span> of oceans to rise and fall. <span class="time" data-times="6.62" data-time="40.47">[00:40.47]</span>The idea is that if we can <span class="highlight">harness</span> that <span class="highlight">tidal</span> energy, it'd be a great clean renewable energy <span class="highlight">source</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.45" data-time="47.09">[00:47.09]</span>One place where this <span class="highlight">tidal</span> energy can be harnessed is at a <span class="highlight">shallow</span> body of water, such as an estuary. <span class="time" data-times="2.95" data-time="53.54">[00:53.54]</span>Now, can anyone tell us what an estuary is?<span class="time" data-times="0.94" data-time="56.49">[00:56.49]</span> Yes, Ted.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.04" data-time="57.43">[00:57.43]</span>Student:An estuary is where a river enters the ocean. <span class="time" data-times="2.59" data-time="60.47">[01:00.47]</span>The fresh water meets the ocean water. <span class="time" data-times="1.7" data-time="63.06">[01:03.06]</span>Sometimes it is covered in water. <span class="time" data-times="1.55" data-time="64.76">[01:04.76]</span>Sometimes it is not.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.89" data-time="66.31">[01:06.31]</span>Professor:Some parts of the estuary, as the tides go in and out, but other parts are always submerged.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="11.87" data-time="73.2">[01:13.20]</span>Now, estuaries are an <span class="highlight">ideal</span> place to try to <span class="highlight">capture</span> energy from changes in tides because, well, there is an exceptionally large <span class="highlight">difference</span> between the water <span class="highlight">level</span> at high <span class="highlight">tide</span> and at low <span class="highlight">tide</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.21" data-time="85.07">[01:25.07]</span>All that movement of water generates a lot of energy. <span class="time" data-times="5.94" data-time="88.28">[01:28.28]</span>And one way to <span class="highlight">harness</span> that energy is by building a structure called a barrage there.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.84" data-time="94.22">[01:34.22]</span>A barrage is basically a large low <span class="highlight">dam</span> that's built <span class="highlight">across</span> an estuary. <span class="time" data-times="5.16" data-time="99.06">[01:39.06]</span>When the tides go in and out, the moving water flows <span class="highlight">through</span> tunnels in the barrage. <span class="time" data-times="8.97" data-time="104.22">[01:44.22]</span>So you have huge amounts of water trying to flow <span class="highlight">through</span> these <span class="highlight">relatively</span> small tunnels and that turns turbines that <span class="highlight">generate</span><span class="highlight">electricity</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.61" data-time="113.19">[01:53.19]</span>Now, these estuaries are important because of their high <span class="highlight">level</span> of biological <span class="highlight">productivity</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.75" data-time="118.8">[01:58.80]</span>They are home to lots of birds, fish and other <span class="highlight">marine</span> life. <span class="time" data-times="4.93" data-time="122.55">[02:02.55]</span>So when you <span class="highlight">propose</span> to <span class="highlight">construct</span> a barrage, you have lots of issues to <span class="highlight">consider</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.28" data-time="127.48">[02:07.48]</span>For example, it would change the existing water levels in the estuary. <span class="time" data-times="8.08" data-time="131.76">[02:11.76]</span>Since a lot of water is getting held up by the barrage, the <span class="highlight">incoming</span> tides won't go as high, but they wouldn't be as low during low <span class="highlight">tide</span>, either. <span class="time" data-times="2" data-time="139.84">[02:19.84]</span>This might help prevent flooding. <span class="time" data-times="7.25" data-time="141.84">[02:21.84]</span>But it would also <span class="highlight">affect</span> the mudflats, those areas of mud that <span class="highlight">normally</span> are <span class="highlight">exposed</span> when the <span class="highlight">tide</span> recedes.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.69" data-time="149.09">[02:29.09]</span>Student:But don't lots of birds <span class="highlight">rely</span> on <span class="highlight">exposed</span> mudflats for food?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.35" data-time="153.78">[02:33.78]</span>I mean, don't they eat tiny animals that live in the mud?<span class="time" data-times="2.28" data-time="157.13">[02:37.13]</span> And what about those tiny animals?<span class="time" data-times="3" data-time="159.41">[02:39.41]</span> What would happen to them if the mudflats were <span class="highlight">endangered</span>?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.19" data-time="162.41">[02:42.41]</span>Professor:So you are seeing some of the <span class="highlight">potential</span> problems with the barrage. <span class="time" data-times="5.08" data-time="165.6">[02:45.60]</span>But <span class="highlight">consider</span> this, right now, the water in an estuary is very cloudy. <span class="time" data-times="5.73" data-time="170.68">[02:50.68]</span>The <span class="highlight">tidal</span> currents are <span class="highlight">constantly</span> churning up the sediments that rivers <span class="highlight">deposit</span> in the estuary. <span class="time" data-times="2.95" data-time="176.41">[02:56.41]</span>But a barrage would reduce the <span class="highlight">tidal</span> currents. <span class="time" data-times="3.5" data-time="179.36">[02:59.36]</span>So a lot of that <span class="highlight">sediment</span> would <span class="highlight">settle</span> to the floor of the estuary. <span class="time" data-times="1.89" data-time="182.86">[03:02.86]</span>It wouldn't get stirred up so much. <span class="time" data-times="9.94" data-time="184.75">[03:04.75]</span>The water would be clearer, allowing more sunlight to <span class="highlight">reach</span> deeper into the water, which might <span class="highlight">lead</span> to more food for birds and other animals, attracting new wildlife to the area. <span class="time" data-times="2.98" data-time="194.69">[03:14.69]</span>So it's a <span class="highlight">complicated</span><span class="highlight">environmental</span> picture.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="1.25" data-time="197.67">[03:17.67]</span>Student:Have they tried this anywhere?<span class="time" data-times="1.73" data-time="198.92">[03:18.92]</span> Built a barrage?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.98" data-time="200.65">[03:20.65]</span>Professor:Yes, there are several in operation. <span class="time" data-times="1.41" data-time="203.63">[03:23.63]</span>There is one in France.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.68" data-time="205.04">[03:25.04]</span>Now, they have to be careful there about how they turn on the turbines because they create currents and waves that can <span class="highlight">affect</span> boats.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.23" data-time="211.72">[03:31.72]</span>But I haven't read about any <span class="highlight">major</span><span class="highlight">ecological</span> problems. <span class="time" data-times="2.65" data-time="214.95">[03:34.95]</span>In fact, the fishing is supposed to have improved. <span class="time" data-times="2.46" data-time="217.6">[03:37.60]</span>Plus there is <span class="highlight">even</span> more bird life.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.12" data-time="220.06">[03:40.06]</span>But some of the barrages we're considering now would be much larger than that one. <span class="time" data-times="6.43" data-time="224.18">[03:44.18]</span>There has been one proposed for the estuary of Great Britain's Severn River, one of the largest estuaries in the world. <span class="time" data-times="2.61" data-time="230.61">[03:50.61]</span>It would be 16 kilometers long. <span class="time" data-times="3.87" data-time="233.22">[03:53.22]</span>Just to give you an idea, the barrage in France is less than a kilometer.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="9.87" data-time="237.09">[03:57.09]</span>Outside of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> concerns, such a <span class="highlight">project</span> would be hugely expensive and that's another <span class="highlight">argument</span> against barrages, well, such large ones anyway. <span class="time" data-times="6.79" data-time="246.96">[04:06.96]</span>Critics say that it would better to use that money for something else, such as improving the energy <span class="highlight">efficiency</span> of buildings. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="253.75">[04:13.75]</span>You could make a lot of buildings more <span class="highlight">efficient</span> with all that money and that would reduce the need for <span class="highlight">electricity</span>.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the main purpose of the talk?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To explain the mechanical functioning of barrages.</p><p>B. To discuss some possible ecological effects of building barrages.</p><p>C. To discuss the effects of ocean tides on coastal ecosystems.</p><p>D. To describe ways to increase biological productivity of estuaries.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The professor proposed that today's energy production from marine energy sources is not costly and energy-saving and environmentally friendly, and it is proposed that the construction of a dam at the sea inlet can be realized. Option A explains that the function of the dam is not the main purpose of this article; Option B discusses some of the ecological effects of dams that may be built, consistent with the original intention; Option C discusses the impact of waves on the coastal ecosystem, not the main purpose; Option D is to describe the increase The method of bio-productivity in the sea is inconsistent with the original.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor say about estuaries to support the claim that they are appropriate places for building barrages?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Estuaries undergo significant changes in water levels.</p><p>B. Estuaries attract a wide varity of animal species.</p><p>C. Estuaries are deeper than other bodies of water.</p><p>D. Most estuaries are far from resdential areas.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>When the professor introduced estuary, he said that it can capture energy very well, because the water level between high tide and low tide is very different, so it can generate a lot of energy; and the way to effectively harness these energy is to build Barrage. So it can directly correspond to the A option.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the professor's opinion when the man expresses concern about marine life on the mud flats?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. She thinks the environmental impact of barrages would be worse for birds than for fish.</p><p>B. She agrees that any damage to the mud flats would probably be irreversible.</p><p>C. She feels that the situation is more complex than the man realizes.</p><p>D. She does not believe that the mud flats support a wide variety of animal species.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The original student suggested that if the mud stalls were affected, the marine life would be implicated. Then the professor said that this is only a potential problem for the dam, but the dam will also reduce the tide. Professor A chose to think that the dam's environmental impact is more severe than that of fish. The source did not compare the fish and the bird's environment; Option B she agreed that any damage to the mudflat would be inevitable, not the professor's idea; Option C she thinks the situation is more complicated than the boy's concerns, with the original Consistent with the meaning; Option D, she believes that mudflats will not have different animal species, which is inconsistent with the original.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The professor mentions a change in the quantity of fish caught near a barrage in France. What most likely happened to the water in the estuary as a result of the construction of the barrage?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The water has become clearer.</p><p>B. The water has become saltier.</p><p>C. The water has become polluted</p><p>D. The water level has risen.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The professor mentioned that a dam in France is now very careful about how to start turbines because the tides it generates will affect the boats, and the ecological impact, especially fish and birds, is very favorable. These echo the ideas of the previous professor. Option A water becomes cleaner, and it can be inferred that the water quality is improved through the improvement of the fish's ecological environment; Option B is more salty and inconsistent with the original inference; Option C is more polluted by water, and It is inconsistent with the original inference; the level C of Option C has risen and has not been mentioned in the original text.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor say is a criticism of the proposed barrage at the Severn River in Great Britain?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It would damage nearby buildings.</p><p>B. It would attract harmful species to the region.</p><p>C. It would not be as large as the barrage in France.</p><p>D. it would be too expensive to build.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The original text mentioned that the dam will be built on the world's largest sea inlet in Severn River. In addition to environmental considerations, this project will be used to build huge amounts of money. Many people criticize that money should be spent on energy efficiency. Option A will destroy the surrounding buildings, which is inconsistent with the original; Option B will attract harmful species that are not in accordance with the original; Option C will not be as large as the French dam, not the content of the original text; Option D was built. The cost is too high, consistent with the original information.</p></div></div><div class="replay" id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor say this:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To request that the student answer in greater detail.</p><p>B. To introduce a new topic for discussion.</p><p>C. To make the student's statement more accurate.</p><p>D. To repeat a point that she had not stated clearly.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>This part of the hard-of-hearing content is what the professor asks the students. What is estuary? The student gives his own answer. The professor once again stated that some parts of the estuary are always flooded and some are not. It can be seen that the professor is supplemented by the student's answer. The answer is more accurate and corresponds to option C.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
