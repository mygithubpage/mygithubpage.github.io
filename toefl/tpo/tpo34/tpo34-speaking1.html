First, it would be a great place to take a break from study, especially when exams are coming up. While getting refreshments, I could have some small talks with my friends in the study group. In this way, I wouldn' t get a headache from staring at the computer screen for several hours in a row. Also, it would be really convenient to get coffee. Often times I would feel really sleepy and tired in the morning. At this point, it would be awesome if I could easily grab a latte in the library on my way to the self-study room. The minute I take a sip of my coffee, I' m completely picked up and ready to start a new study session.</p></article></div></main></body></html>
