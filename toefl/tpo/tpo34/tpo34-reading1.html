This came about from two <span class="highlight">major</span> developments: paper became <span class="highlight">common</span>, replacing <span class="highlight">parchment</span> as the <span class="highlight">major</span><span class="highlight">medium</span> for writing, and rounded scripts were regularized and perfected so that they replaced the <span class="highlight">angular</span> scripts of the <span class="highlight">previous</span> period, which because of their angularity were <span class="highlight">uneven</span> in height. Books became <span class="highlight">major</span> vehicles for <span class="highlight">artistic</span> expression, and the artists who produced them, <span class="highlight">notably</span> calligraphers and painters, enjoyed high <span class="highlight">status</span>, and their workshops were often <span class="highlight"><span class="question2">sponsored</span></span> by princes and their courts. Before A.D. 900, manuscripts of the Koran (the book containing the teachings of the Islamic <span class="highlight">religion</span>) <span class="highlight">seem</span> to have been the most <span class="highlight">common</span> type of book produced and decorated, but after that <span class="highlight">date</span> a wide <span class="highlight">range</span> of books were produced for a <span class="highlight">broad</span><span class="highlight">spectrum</span> of patrons. These continued to include, of <span class="highlight">course</span>, manuscripts of the Koran, which every Muslim <span class="highlight">wanted</span> to read, but <span class="highlight">scientific</span> works, histories, romances, and <span class="highlight">epic</span> and <span class="highlight">lyric</span><span class="highlight">poetry</span> were also copied in fine handwriting and decorated with beautiful illustrations. Most were made for sale on the open <span class="highlight">market</span>, and cities boasted <span class="highlight">special</span> souks (markets) where books were bought and sold. The mosque of Marrakech in Morocco is known as the Kutubiyya, or Booksellers' Mosque, after the <span class="highlight"><span class="question3">adjacent</span></span><span class="highlight">market</span>. Some of the most luxurious books were <span class="highlight">specific</span> commissions made at the order of a <span class="highlight">particular</span> prince and signed by the calligrapher and decorator.</p><p>Papermaking had been introduced to the Islamic lands from China in the eighth <span class="highlight">century</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>It has been said that Chinese papermakers were among the prisoners captured in a
battle fought near Samarqand between the Chinese and the Muslims in 751, and the <span class="highlight">technique</span> of papermaking - in which <span class="highlight">cellulose</span><span class="highlight">pulp</span><span class="question6">extracted from</span> any of several plants is first <span class="highlight">suspended</span> in water, caught on a fine <span class="highlight">screen</span>, and then dried into <span class="highlight">flexible</span> sheets - slowly <span class="highlight">spread</span> westward. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span><span class="highlight">Within</span> fifty years, the <span class="highlight">government</span> in Baghdad was using paper for documents.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>Writing in ink on paper, unlike <span class="highlight">parchment</span>, could not easily be erased, and <span class="highlight">therefore</span> paper had the <span class="highlight">advantage</span> that it was difficult to <span class="highlight">alter</span> what was written on it.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span><span class="question7">Papermaking <span class="highlight">spread</span> quickly to Egypt - and <span class="highlight">eventually</span> to Sicily and Spain - but it was several centuries before paper supplanted <span class="highlight">parchment</span> for copies of the Koran, probably because of the <span class="highlight">conservative</span> nature of <span class="highlight">religious</span> art and its practitioners.</span> In western Islamic lands, <span class="highlight">parchment</span> continued to be used for manuscripts of the Koran <span class="highlight">throughout</span> this period.</p><p>The <span class="highlight">introduction</span> of paper spurred a conceptual <span class="highlight">revolution</span> whose consequences have <span class="highlight">barely</span> been explored. Although paper was never as cheap as it has become today, it was far less expensive than <span class="highlight">parchment</span>, and <span class="highlight">therefore</span> more people could <span class="highlight">afford</span> to buy books, Paper is thinner than <span class="highlight">parchment</span>, so more pages could be enclosed <span class="highlight">within</span> a single <span class="highlight">volume</span>. <span class="question9">At first, paper was made in <span class="highlight">relatively</span> small sheets that were pasted together, but by the beginning of the fourteenth <span class="highlight">century</span>, very large sheets - as much as a meter <span class="highlight">across</span> - were <span class="highlight">available</span>.</span> These large sheets meant that calligraphers and artists had more <span class="highlight">space</span> on which to work. Paintings became more <span class="highlight">complicated</span>, giving the artist greater opportunities to <span class="highlight">depict</span><span class="highlight">space</span> or <span class="highlight">emotion</span>. The increased <span class="highlight">availability</span> of paper, particularly after 1250, encouraged people to develop systems of representation, such as architectural plans and drawings. This in turn allowed the easy <span class="highlight">transfer</span> of <span class="highlight">artistic</span> ideas and motifs over great distances from one <span class="highlight">medium</span> to another, and in a different <span class="highlight">scale</span> in ways that had been difficult, if not impossible, in the <span class="highlight">previous</span> period.</p><p>Rounded styles of Arabic handwriting had long been used for <span class="highlight">correspondence</span> and documents alongside the <span class="highlight">formal</span><span class="highlight">angular</span> scripts used for inscriptions and manuscripts of the Koran. Around the year 900, Ibn Muqla, who was a <span class="highlight">secretary</span> and vizier at the Abbasid <span class="highlight">court</span> in Baghdad, developed a system of proportioned writing. He standardized the length of alif, the first letter of the Arabic <span class="highlight">alphabet</span>, and then <span class="highlight">determined</span> what the size and <span class="highlight">shape</span> of all other letters should be, based on the alif. <span class="highlight">Eventually</span>, six round forms of handwriting, <span class="question12">composed of</span> three pairs of big and little scripts known <span class="highlight">collectively</span> as the Six Pens, became the <span class="highlight">standard</span><span class="highlight">repertory</span> of every calligrapher.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Paragraph 1 makes all of the following points about Islamic books EXCEPT:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

These continued to include, of course, manuscripts of the Koran, which every Muslim wanted to read, but scientific works, histories, romances, and epic and lyric poetry were also copied in fine handwriting and decorated with beautiful illustrations.

This came about from two major developments: paper There is a common, replacing parchment as the major medium for writing. This means that a large number of books appeared in the period 900-1500 AD, which brought about two major changes. One of them is that paper has become more common and replaced the previous parchment. Books that can be introduced before 900 AD are written on parchment, so they correspond to the D option.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>In paragraph 1, why does the author mention the fact that the mosque in Marrakech, Morocco, is known as the Booksellers' Mosque</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To cast doubt on the importance of souks in making books available to common people</p><p>B. To provide an example of a place where books were made at the order of a particular prince</p><p>C.

To demonstrate the need for religious texts in Islamic lands</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Positioning sentences were were for sale on the open market, and cities boasted special souks (markets) where books were bought and sold. Examples modified the previous sentence, expressing that most of the books were sold on the open market, cities are promoting the prosperity of the market After the development, the example illustrates the influence of the open market.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The phrase "<span class="highlight"><span class="question6">extracted from</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. taken out of</p><p>B. produced using</p><p>C. discovered in</p><p>D. combined with</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" A"><p>A extract from: Extracted from ... corresponding to option A taken out of.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It was several centuries before papermaking techniques spread to faraway areas where parchment was popular and used widely in art.</p><p>B. Although papermaking came to Egypt quickly, it took much longer for paper to be used when copying the Koran, probably because of the conservative nature of religious art.</p><p>C. Papermaking spread beyond Egypt, Sicily, and Spain, but it was not widely used by artists for centuries, probably because of the conservative nature of art in those countries.</p><p>D. Paper replaced parchment in copies of the Koran, probably at the request of conservative practitioners in areas like Egypt, Sicily, and Spain.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The focus of this long sentence is in the latter part of the sentence. We can clearly see the part of the transition and reason in the latter part of the sentence. The dash part of the first half can be omitted and not read, meaning that the papermaking technique spreads rapidly to Egypt, but the paper substitutes. Parchment has been used for centuries, probably because of the conservative nature of religious art. So for the B option, the two parts of the logic are clearly expressed. A option does not summarize the main logic of the original sentence, and the content is not complete; C option to change the meaning of the original sentence, the original sentence did not say it was not widely used by artists but that for copies of the Koran is not widely used . The difference between the D option and the original is too great.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>In paragraphs 2 and 3, which of the following is NOT mentioned as an advantage of paper over parchment?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

The sentence does not involve the part of the weight, sentence expression is also different, so C is wrong, choose C.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the author include the following information: "<span class="highlight">At first, paper was made in relatively small sheets that were pasted together, but by the beginning of the fourteenth century, very large sheets ï¿½ as much as a meter across ï¿½ were available.</span>"?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

C"><p>C This sentence is a detail sentence. Looking ahead, the second and third sentences are all details and describe the advantages of paper. However, the topic sentence of this paragraph only expresses that the introduction of paper brings influence to various fields and there is no corresponding. So this question is more special to look back, and the large sheets meant... after the example clause can help us to judge that this is a very close reference relationship, indicating that the role of these large papers is to make the artist's creation more complex and able to Give them more creative space and emotions. This matches the C option.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 3, the increased availability of paper and the development of systems of representation</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. encourage more people to make their own drawings</p><p>B. made the transfer of artistic ideas to distant people and places much easier</p><p>C. made architectural plans more complex and therefore harder to read</p><p>D. allowed artists to create paintings that were smaller in scale</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Through the increasing availability of paper and the development of systems of representation, we locate the penultimate sentence of this paragraph.
