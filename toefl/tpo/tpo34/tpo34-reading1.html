            <b>Islamic Art and The Book</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>The arts of the Islamic book, such as calligraphy and <span class="underline">decorative</span> drawing, developed during A.D. 900 to 1500, and <span class="underline">luxury</span> books are some of the most <span class="underline">characteristic</span> examples of Islamic art produced in this period. This came about from two <span class="underline">major</span> developments: paper became <span class="underline">common</span>, replacing <span class="underline">parchment</span> as the <span class="underline">major</span> <span class="underline">medium</span> for writing, and rounded scripts were regularized and perfected so that they replaced the <span class="underline">angular</span> scripts of the <span class="underline">previous</span> period, which because of their angularity were <span class="underline">uneven</span> in height. Books became <span class="underline">major</span> vehicles for <span class="underline">artistic</span> expression, and the artists who produced them, <span class="underline">notably</span> calligraphers and painters, enjoyed high <span class="underline">status</span>, and their workshops were often <span class="underline">sponsored</span> by princes and their courts. Before A.D. 900, manuscripts of the Koran (the book containing the teachings of the Islamic <span class="underline">religion</span>) <span class="underline">seem</span> to have been the most <span class="underline">common</span> type of book produced and decorated, but after that <span class="underline">date</span> a wide <span class="underline">range</span> of books were produced for a <span class="underline">broad</span> <span class="underline">spectrum</span> of patrons. These continued to include, of <span class="underline">course</span>, manuscripts of the Koran, which every Muslim <span class="underline">wanted</span> to read, but <span class="underline">scientific</span> works, histories, romances, and <span class="underline">epic</span> and <span class="underline">lyric</span> <span class="underline">poetry</span> were also copied in fine handwriting and decorated with beautiful illustrations. Most were made for sale on the open <span class="underline">market</span>, and cities boasted <span class="underline">special</span> souks (markets) where books were bought and sold. The mosque of Marrakech in Morocco is known as the Kutubiyya, or Booksellers' Mosque, after the <span class="underline">adjacent</span> <span class="underline">market</span>. Some of the most luxurious books were <span class="underline">specific</span> commissions made at the order of a <span class="underline">particular</span> prince and signed by the calligrapher and decorator.</p>
          <p>Papermaking had been introduced to the Islamic lands from China in the eighth <span class="underline">century</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>It has been said that Chinese papermakers were among the prisoners captured in a 
battle fought near Samarqand between the Chinese and the Muslims in 751, and the <span class="underline">technique</span> of papermaking – in which <span class="underline">cellulose</span> <span class="underline">pulp</span> extracted from any of several plants is first <span class="underline">suspended</span> in water, caught on a fine <span class="underline">screen</span>, and then dried into <span class="underline">flexible</span> sheets – slowly <span class="underline">spread</span> westward. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> <span class="underline">Within</span> fifty years, the <span class="underline">government</span> in Baghdad was using paper for documents. 
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>Writing in ink on paper, unlike <span class="underline">parchment</span>, could not easily be erased, and <span class="underline">therefore</span> paper had the <span class="underline">advantage</span> that it was difficult to <span class="underline">alter</span> what was written on it. 
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>Papermaking <span class="underline">spread</span> quickly to Egypt – and <span class="underline">eventually</span> to Sicily and Spain – but it was several centuries before paper supplanted <span class="underline">parchment</span> for copies of the Koran, probably because of the <span class="underline">conservative</span> nature of <span class="underline">religious</span> art and its practitioners. In western Islamic lands, <span class="underline">parchment</span> continued to be used for manuscripts of the Koran <span class="underline">throughout</span> this period.</p>
          <p>The <span class="underline">introduction</span> of paper spurred a conceptual <span class="underline">revolution</span> whose consequences have <span class="underline">barely</span> been explored. Although paper was never as cheap as it has become today, it was far less expensive than <span class="underline">parchment</span>, and <span class="underline">therefore</span> more people could <span class="underline">afford</span> to buy books, Paper is thinner than <span class="underline">parchment</span>, so more pages could be enclosed <span class="underline">within</span> a single <span class="underline">volume</span>. At first, paper was made in <span class="underline">relatively</span> small sheets that were pasted together, but by the beginning of the fourteenth <span class="underline">century</span>, very large sheets – as much as a meter <span class="underline">across</span> – were <span class="underline">available</span>. These large sheets meant that calligraphers and artists had more <span class="underline">space</span> on which to work. Paintings became more <span class="underline">complicated</span>, giving the artist greater opportunities to <span class="underline">depict</span> <span class="underline">space</span> or <span class="underline">emotion</span>. The increased <span class="underline">availability</span> of paper, particularly after 1250, encouraged people to develop systems of representation, such as architectural plans and drawings. This in turn allowed the easy <span class="underline">transfer</span> of <span class="underline">artistic</span> ideas and motifs over great distances from one <span class="underline">medium</span> to another, and in a different <span class="underline">scale</span> in ways that had been difficult, if not impossible, in the <span class="underline">previous</span> period.</p>
          <p>Rounded styles of Arabic handwriting had long been used for <span class="underline">correspondence</span> and documents alongside the <span class="underline">formal</span> <span class="underline">angular</span> scripts used for inscriptions and manuscripts of the Koran. Around the year 900, Ibn Muqla, who was a <span class="underline">secretary</span> and vizier at the Abbasid <span class="underline">court</span> in Baghdad, developed a system of proportioned writing. He standardized the length of alif, the first letter of the Arabic <span class="underline">alphabet</span>, and then <span class="underline">determined</span> what the size and <span class="underline">shape</span> of all other letters should be, based on the alif. <span class="underline">Eventually</span>, six round forms of handwriting, composed of three pairs of big and little scripts known <span class="underline">collectively</span> as the Six Pens, became the <span class="underline">standard</span> <span class="underline">repertory</span> of every calligrapher.</p>
