            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="11.65" data-time="6.92">[00:06.92]</span>Professor: At the end of yesterday's class, we were discussing landfills and the hundreds of millions of tons of everyday <span class="underline">garbage</span> which are deposited into them each year in the United States. <span class="time" data-times="5.23" data-time="18.57">[00:18.57]</span>It's a growing problem! Quite <span class="underline">simply</span>, we are running out of <span class="underline">space</span> to put our <span class="underline">garbage</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9.61" data-time="23.8">[00:23.80]</span>And this is especially true for <span class="underline">solid</span> <span class="underline">organic</span> waste: food scraps from home or food processing plants, <span class="underline">waste</span> from farms, that <span class="underline">sort</span> of thing. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.38" data-time="33.41">[00:33.41]</span>Did you know that two thirds of the <span class="underline">waste</span> sitting in our landfills is <span class="underline">organic</span> <span class="underline">material</span>? <span class="time" data-times="11.59" data-time="38.79">[00:38.79]</span>We have <span class="underline">government</span> recycling programs for materials like plastics, glass and metal, yet <span class="underline">widespread</span> solutions for <span class="underline">organic</span> <span class="underline">waste</span> materials <span class="underline">haven</span>'t really been addressed in the United States. <span class="time" data-times="3.53" data-time="50.38">[00:50.38]</span>I think this is just asking for trouble in the future. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="12.2" data-time="53.91">[00:53.91]</span>So today I want to talk about a technology that offers a <span class="underline">potential</span> <span class="underline">solution</span> to the problem-<span class="underline">Anaerobic</span> Phased Solids digestion, or APS digestion. <span class="time" data-times="6.77" data-time="66.11">[01:06.11]</span>First of all, what does <span class="underline">anaerobic</span> mean? Anyone? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.64" data-time="72.88">[01:12.88]</span>Student: Without <span class="underline">oxygen</span>? </p>

              <span class="time" data-times="0.85" data-time="74.52">[01:14.52]</span>Professor: Correct!<span class="time" data-times="10.85" data-time="75.37">[01:15.37]</span> APS digestion uses <span class="underline">anaerobic</span> <span class="underline">bacteria</span>, ones that <span class="underline">thrive</span> in the <span class="underline">absence</span> of <span class="underline">oxygen</span>, to <span class="underline">consume</span>, to <span class="underline">break</span> down <span class="underline">organic</span> <span class="underline">material</span>. </p>

              <span class="time" data-times="12.83" data-time="86.22">[01:26.22]</span>Student: Excuse me. Professor. Um...those <span class="underline">anaerobic</span> <span class="underline">bacteria</span> you are talking about...well, aren't <span class="underline">anaerobic</span> <span class="underline">bacteria</span> also used in <span class="underline">waste</span> water treatment plants? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.54" data-time="99.05">[01:39.05]</span>Professor: Yes. In fact, they are. <span class="time" data-times="2.69" data-time="100.59">[01:40.59]</span>Would you like to explain this to the class? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.32" data-time="103.28">[01:43.28]</span>Student: Sure! So when <span class="underline">waste</span> water is treated, one of the byproducts is a thick <span class="underline">liquid</span> called <span class="underline">sludge</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.04" data-time="109.6">[01:49.60]</span>And aren't <span class="underline">anaerobic</span> <span class="underline">bacteria</span> used to <span class="underline">break</span> down the <span class="underline">sludge</span>? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="0.85" data-time="113.64">[01:53.64]</span>Professor: That's right.<span class="time" data-times="4.2" data-time="114.49">[01:54.49]</span> <span class="underline">Anaerobic</span> <span class="underline">bacteria</span> have been used in <span class="underline">waste</span> water treatment for decades. </p>

              <span class="time" data-times="2.64" data-time="118.69">[01:58.69]</span>Student: So how is this technology different? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.54" data-time="121.33">[02:01.33]</span>Professor: Good question.<span class="time" data-times="8.06" data-time="122.87">[02:02.87]</span> The <span class="underline">anaerobic</span> digestion systems used in <span class="underline">waste</span> water plants are designed to treat <span class="underline">sludge</span>, not solids. <span class="time" data-times="6.08" data-time="130.93">[02:10.93]</span>Now, in the past, researchers have attempted to treat <span class="underline">solid</span> <span class="underline">organic</span> <span class="underline">waste</span> with that same equipment. <span class="time" data-times="1.98" data-time="137.01">[02:17.01]</span>But there was always a problem. <span class="time" data-times="8.89" data-time="138.99">[02:18.99]</span>In order to <span class="underline">process</span> the <span class="underline">solid</span> <span class="underline">waste</span>, the kind we find in landfills, you had to pretreat the solids to turn them into <span class="underline">sludge</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.8" data-time="147.88">[02:27.88]</span>First, by breaking the <span class="underline">material</span> apart mechanically into small particles and then adding a lot of water until you got a kind of thick, soupy mix that the equipment could <span class="underline">handle</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.38" data-time="158.68">[02:38.68]</span>But that <span class="underline">extra</span> step took time and required a lot of energy. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.53" data-time="163.06">[02:43.06]</span>Student: That sounds like it would <span class="underline">cost</span> a lot. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="0.73" data-time="166.59">[02:46.59]</span>Professor: That's right. <span class="time" data-times="5.05" data-time="167.32">[02:47.32]</span>But APS digestion is designed <span class="underline">specifically</span> to <span class="underline">handle</span> <span class="underline">solid</span> <span class="underline">waste</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.04" data-time="172.37">[02:52.37]</span>So it is much more cost-effective. <span class="time" data-times="4.19" data-time="174.41">[02:54.41]</span>The new technology processes <span class="underline">organic</span> <span class="underline">waste</span> in two phases. <span class="time" data-times="4.78" data-time="178.6">[02:58.60]</span>Remember, APS stands for <span class="underline">Anaerobic</span> Phased Solids digestion. </p>

              <span class="time" data-times="7.43" data-time="183.38">[03:03.38]</span>First, the <span class="underline">waste</span> <span class="underline">material</span> is loaded into a large, closed <span class="underline">container</span>, <span class="underline">along</span> with different types of <span class="underline">anaerobic</span> <span class="underline">bacteria</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.58" data-time="190.81">[03:10.81]</span>The <span class="underline">bacteria</span> <span class="underline">break</span> the solids down into acids and <span class="underline">hydrogen</span> gas. <span class="time" data-times="7.71" data-time="195.39">[03:15.39]</span>The <span class="underline">hydrogen</span> is extracted and the <span class="underline">remaining</span> acids are transferred into a different <span class="underline">container</span> for the <span class="underline">second</span> <span class="underline">phase</span> of the <span class="underline">process</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.87" data-time="203.1">[03:23.10]</span>There another type of <span class="underline">bacteria</span> converts the acids into <span class="underline">methane</span> gas. </p>

              <span class="time" data-times="3.44" data-time="207.97">[03:27.97]</span>Student: Aren't <span class="underline">hydrogen</span> and <span class="underline">methane</span> gas bad for the environment though? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.54" data-time="211.41">[03:31.41]</span>Professor: The answer in this case is no, because they don't <span class="underline">escape</span> into the <span class="underline">atmosphere</span>. <span class="time" data-times="13.22" data-time="215.95">[03:35.95]</span>The gases are captured and can be burned to produce <span class="underline">electricity</span>, which saves a lot of money and <span class="underline">ultimately</span> decreases our need for fuels like <span class="underline">petroleum</span> and <span class="underline">coal</span>, which are not only expensive but are also polluting. </p>

              <span class="time" data-times="3.54" data-time="229.17">[03:49.17]</span>Student: So <span class="underline">organic</span> <span class="underline">waste</span> from landfills could be processed this way? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.23" data-time="232.71">[03:52.71]</span>Professor: It is certainly one possibility. <span class="time" data-times="3.58" data-time="234.94">[03:54.94]</span>And APS digestion systems are very <span class="underline">versatile</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.4" data-time="238.52">[03:58.52]</span>They can be installed just about anywhere. <span class="time" data-times="8.31" data-time="240.92">[04:00.92]</span>See, <span class="underline">anaerobic</span> digestion systems used at <span class="underline">waste</span> water treatment plants are huge tanks that hold thousands of gallons of <span class="underline">waste</span> water. <span class="time" data-times="9.27" data-time="249.23">[04:09.23]</span>But the APS containers are small enough to be set up on site, where the <span class="underline">waste</span> is generated, like at food processing plants or on farms. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4" data-time="258.5">[04:18.50]</span>So <span class="underline">garbage</span> doesn't have to be transported long distances. <span class="time" data-times="5.76" data-time="262.5">[04:22.50]</span>As a matter of fact, a <span class="underline">couple</span> of universities successfully set up <span class="underline">demonstration</span> projects. <span class="time" data-times="7.12" data-time="268.26">[04:28.26]</span>They collected food scraps from dining halls and <span class="underline">local</span> restaurants and <span class="underline">process</span> them in APS facilities. <span class="time" data-times="6.12" data-time="275.38">[04:35.38]</span>Not only did the university <span class="underline">save</span> money, we are also learning <span class="underline">even</span> more about the APS <span class="underline">process</span>. </p>

              <span class="time" data-times="2.1" data-time="281.5">[04:41.50]</span>What is the next step <span class="underline">forward</span>? <span class="time" data-times="5.63" data-time="283.6">[04:43.60]</span>Well, APS digestion uses several different types of <span class="underline">anaerobic</span> <span class="underline">bacteria</span>, right? <span class="time" data-times="4.28" data-time="289.23">[04:49.23]</span>So what are the most <span class="underline">efficient</span> <span class="underline">bacteria</span> in the <span class="underline">process</span>? <span class="time" data-times="6.49" data-time="293.51">[04:53.51]</span>If researchers can <span class="underline">figure</span> that out, the highest performing <span class="underline">bacteria</span> mix for a system could be <span class="underline">determined</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="300">[5:00.00]</span> <span class="underline">Ultimately</span> the goal would be to grow enough of these <span class="underline">particular</span> <span class="underline">bacteria</span> to support large-scale <span class="underline">commercial</span> APS systems. </p>
