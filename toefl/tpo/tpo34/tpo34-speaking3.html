          <h4 class="w3-center">Program to Provide Free Tutoring</h4>
          <p>The university has announced that starting with the fall semester, free tutoring will be available to all new students for their entire first year. The academic dean, James Maxwell, commented, "The university is aware of the academic problems that many first-year students face when making the transition from high school to college." The new tutoring program, he said, is designed to assist first-year students who want or need additional support with their academic course work. The program will also be organized so that individual students can arrange to work with tutors majoring in their own chosen field of study.</p>

          <p>(man) Hey, did you read about this plan?</p>
          <p>(woman) Yeah, and I think it's really a great idea.</p>
          <p>(man) Why's that?</p>
          <p>(woman) Well, a lot of new students really need this, I mean, it's not just about getting extra help with the course material, they'll probably also get information about things like taking notes or the best way to study for exams.(man) Yeah, I barely even knew how to do those things when I first came here.(woman) Neither did I. So these are things most students wind up having to learn on their own at first. That's why so many of them have a hard time.(man) And it's probably good that they can work with somebody who has the same interests.</p>
          <p>(woman) Right, that will be a real advantage: to get information about the classes you're gonna need to take from somebody who's already taken those classes. And they could recommend professors and tell you who the best advisers in the department are, things like that.(man) I see what you mean, so new students could get access to information about the program from another student's point of view.</p>
          <p>(woman) Exactly!</p>

          <p>Well, according to the plan, the university is offering free tutoring to all new students for the entire first year to help the students who need additional support for their academic course work, and help from tutors in the same major. Accordingly, the woman agrees with the plan for two main reasons. Firstly, she believes that the students will not only get extra help with the course material, but also information like ideas or strategies for cracking exams. Therefore it'll be a lot easier for the freshmen to get their study started. Secondly, the woman thinks it will be a real advantage for the freshmen because they could receive information from the tutors who have already taken the classes, about past learning experience, such as recommended professors or best advisers and things like that. All in all, the woman agrees with the plan for the reasons stated above. (146 words)</p>
