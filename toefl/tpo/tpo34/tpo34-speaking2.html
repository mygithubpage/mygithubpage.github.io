        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>Although some people might say that banning private cars in downtown area would be a great solution for busy traffic in big cities, I don' t think it sounds so great because it would be really inconvenient under situations when people do need to drive. For example, if emergencies happen and we need to drive someone to the hospital, or if some day I' m almost late for work and don' t have enough time to take public transportation. Also, when we' re moving from place to place, it would be nearly impossible to take public transportation. Plus, completely banning private cars in downtown might cause traffic situations in other areas since people will have to choose alternative ways to reach their destinations.</p>
