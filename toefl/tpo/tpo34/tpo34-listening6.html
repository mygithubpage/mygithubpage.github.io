Cathy. Let's take another look. <span class="time" data-times="6.27" data-time="18.55">[00:18.55]</span>Do you <span class="highlight">recall</span>? Cathy. How this S-curve represents the life <span class="highlight">cycle</span> of <span class="highlight">innovation</span>?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.45" data-time="24.82">[00:24.82]</span>Student: Sure. Starting on the left, the new <span class="highlight">innovation</span>, let's say it's a new product.<span class="time" data-times="4.13" data-time="30.27">[00:30.27]</span>Almost nobody's heard of it or at <span class="highlight">least</span> nobody takes it seriously. <span class="time" data-times="7.36" data-time="34.4">[00:34.40]</span>Then its popularity increases, uh, slowly at first till sales really start accelerating quickly.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.54" data-time="41.76">[00:41.76]</span>There are where the <span class="highlight">line</span> goes up steeply in the middle as more and more get excited about the product and they go out and buy it. <span class="time" data-times="7.8" data-time="49.3">[00:49.30]</span>But <span class="highlight">eventually</span>, moving over to the right side there, <span class="highlight">interest</span> begins to <span class="highlight">fade</span> and the growth and sales levels off.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.15" data-time="57.1">[00:57.10]</span>Professor: At which point the <span class="highlight">market</span> has matured for that product. <span class="time" data-times="5.45" data-time="60.25">[01:00.25]</span>We can still sell it and <span class="highlight">even</span> marginally <span class="highlight">improve</span> it, but it's not new anymore. <span class="time" data-times="3.6" data-time="65.7">[01:05.70]</span>It no longer offers <span class="highlight">exciting</span> growth opportunities. <span class="time" data-times="10.97" data-time="69.3">[01:09.30]</span>So a business leader might face a choice: either <span class="highlight">stick</span> with this old, safe, proven idea or move on to the next big idea, a fresh <span class="highlight">innovation</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.34" data-time="80.27">[01:20.27]</span>But innovations are risky. <span class="time" data-times="2.3" data-time="82.61">[01:22.61]</span>They may succeed or they may not. <span class="time" data-times="2.55" data-time="84.91">[01:24.91]</span>OK. A case study. <span class="time" data-times="3.93" data-time="87.46">[01:27.46]</span>George. I have heard your Thursday night program on the <span class="highlight">campus</span> radio <span class="highlight">station</span>. <span class="time" data-times="1.6" data-time="91.39">[01:31.39]</span>You like Jazz, right?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.68" data-time="92.99">[01:32.99]</span>Student: Huh?! Uh...yeah...sure! But...what?!</p><p><span class="time" data-times="1.55" data-time="96.67">[01:36.67]</span>Professor: OK. Stay with me here. <span class="time" data-times="4.39" data-time="98.22">[01:38.22]</span>On your program last week, I heard an old Miles Davis <span class="highlight">album</span>. <span class="time" data-times="1.29" data-time="102.61">[01:42.61]</span>Tell us about that.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.9" data-time="103.9">[01:43.90]</span>Student: Uh...Miles Davis. Trumpet. <span class="time" data-times="4.63" data-time="106.8">[01:46.80]</span>I played a CD of a Jazz <span class="highlight">classic</span> he recorded in the 1950s called Kind of Blue. <span class="time" data-times="2.19" data-time="111.43">[01:51.43]</span>It's my all-time favorite Jazz recording.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.62" data-time="113.62">[01:53.62]</span>Professor: <span class="highlight">Mine</span> too. Would you call that recording <span class="highlight">innovative</span> for its time?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.03" data-time="118.24">[01:58.24]</span>Student: <span class="highlight">Absolutely</span>! Nothing at all like what he had recorded up till then. <span class="time" data-times="6.13" data-time="122.27">[02:02.27]</span>I mean, before that Miles Davis played things so <span class="highlight">complex</span> that...well...nobody could touch him. <span class="time" data-times="2.18" data-time="128.4">[02:08.40]</span>But this was something totally new.<span class="time" data-times="4.18" data-time="130.58">[02:10.58]</span> Suddenly his playing sounded so amazingly simple.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.03" data-time="134.76">[02:14.76]</span>Professor: And how did people react to this new <span class="highlight">sound</span> of Miles Davis?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.34" data-time="138.79">[02:18.79]</span>Student: Well...some were disappointed, <span class="highlight">even</span> angry that he'd <span class="highlight">abandon</span> his old style. <span class="time" data-times="6.07" data-time="144.13">[02:24.13]</span>But soon most of his fans came around and this new style appealed to a whole new group of jazz listeners.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.23" data-time="150.2">[02:30.20]</span>Professor: I guess so. Kind of Blue became the most commercially successful <span class="highlight">album</span> in the <span class="highlight">history</span> of jazz! <span class="time" data-times="2.25" data-time="157.43">[02:37.43]</span>So is there a lesson here anyone? <span class="time" data-times="2.29" data-time="159.68">[02:39.68]</span>Think of that S-curve I showed you.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.86" data-time="161.97">[02:41.97]</span>Student: Oh! So his old style of jazz was actually a kind of product, one that had been developed <span class="highlight">pretty</span> thoroughly. <span class="time" data-times="2.66" data-time="169.83">[02:49.83]</span>And he'd taken it about as far as he could. <span class="time" data-times="4.52" data-time="172.49">[02:52.49]</span>So he decided to take a big risk and try something totally new.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.98" data-time="177.01">[02:57.01]</span>Professor: Exactly! Something completely fresh and cool. <span class="time" data-times="1.89" data-time="181.99">[03:01.99]</span>And people couldn't get enough of it.<span class="time" data-times="5.02" data-time="183.88">[03:03.88]</span> It was a <span class="highlight">brand</span> new beginning that left lots of room for further <span class="highlight">development</span> artistically. <span class="time" data-times="11.99" data-time="188.9">[03:08.90]</span>And as a <span class="highlight">market</span><span class="highlight">analyst</span>, you could say that with Kind of Blue, he was jumping to the beginning of a <span class="highlight">brand</span> new S-curve, with all that <span class="highlight">potential</span> for <span class="highlight">profitable</span><span class="highlight">development</span> still ahead of him! <span class="time" data-times="2.44" data-time="200.89">[03:20.89]</span>But let me ask you something else. <span class="time" data-times="4.38" data-time="203.33">[03:23.33]</span>This isn't just the music of a single performer, is it? George.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.58" data-time="207.71">[03:27.71]</span>Student: <span class="highlight">Hardly</span>. More like a group of all-stars. <span class="time" data-times="6.57" data-time="211.29">[03:31.29]</span><span class="highlight">Along</span> with Miles Davis on trumpet, there is <span class="highlight">Bill</span> Evans on piano, John Coltrane on tenor saxophone...</p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.49" data-time="217.86">[03:37.86]</span>Professor: Individually perhaps the best in the business.<span class="time" data-times="8.08" data-time="220.35">[03:40.35]</span> But thinking of Miles Davis as the leader of this group, how did he organize and <span class="highlight">manage</span> all these <span class="highlight">incredible</span><span class="highlight">talent</span>?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="15.68" data-time="228.43">[03:48.43]</span>Student: Well, he'd <span class="highlight">lay</span> out the general <span class="highlight">outline</span>, the theme and then give each of these star performers, one by one, the <span class="highlight">creative</span> freedom to really show what they could do with it on their own <span class="highlight">instrument</span>, to <span class="highlight">improvise</span> and add something new, but always <span class="highlight">within</span> the same general theme.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="8.61" data-time="244.11">[04:04.11]</span>Professor: So Miles Davis gets <span class="highlight">credit</span> for recruiting the best jazz <span class="highlight">talent</span> anywhere and getting them to <span class="highlight">collaborate</span> on a <span class="highlight">fantastic</span><span class="highlight">musical</span> product. <span class="time" data-times="2.51" data-time="252.72">[04:12.72]</span>Everyone see the business parallels here? <span class="time" data-times="6.72" data-time="255.23">[04:15.23]</span>And give each of these musicians <span class="highlight">credit</span> for seizing this <span class="highlight">opportunity</span> and creating great <span class="highlight">individual</span> performances. <span class="time" data-times="5.57" data-time="261.95">[04:21.95]</span>But good jazz is more than just outstanding <span class="highlight">individual</span> performances, isn't it?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.49" data-time="267.52">[04:27.52]</span>Student: Definitely. Jazz musicians need to listen to each other and go with the flow. <span class="time" data-times="8.16" data-time="272.01">[04:32.01]</span>Like, one time somebody goofed and came in a little early, but everyone else adjusted and went right <span class="highlight">along</span> with it, as if nothing were wrong. <span class="time" data-times="4.74" data-time="280.17">[04:40.17]</span>And this mistake came out like just another unexpected <span class="highlight">creative</span><span class="highlight">interpretation</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="284.91">[04:44.91]</span>Professor: Thanks.
