            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.59" data-time="31.66">[00:31.66]</span>Librarian: He is probably talking about our <span class="underline">annual</span> book sale. <span class="time" data-times="1.45" data-time="34.25">[00:34.25]</span>We have one every <span class="underline">spring</span>. </p>

              <span class="time" data-times="3.61" data-time="46.42">[00:46.42]</span>Student: I've actually tried to find this book online but no luck so far. <span class="time" data-times="1.6" data-time="50.03">[00:50.03]</span>I was really hoping to buy it. </p>

              <span class="time" data-times="3.07" data-time="62">[01:02.00]</span>Librarian: That's where we keep books that <span class="underline">haven</span>'t been used for several years. <span class="time" data-times="4.18" data-time="65.07">[01:05.07]</span>They are still in the <span class="underline">catalog</span>, which means they can be <span class="underline">checked</span> out if you fill out a form. <span class="time" data-times="2.74" data-time="69.25">[01:09.25]</span>It takes maybe a day or two to <span class="underline">retrieve</span> one of them. </p>

              <span class="time" data-times="6.52" data-time="72.65">[01:12.65]</span>Librarian: And then before we decide to include a book in the sale, we <span class="underline">review</span> its <span class="underline">circulation</span> <span class="underline">history</span> again, which can take a while. <span class="time" data-times="1.94" data-time="79.17">[01:19.17]</span>We've got a lot of books in <span class="underline">storage</span>. </p>

              <span class="time" data-times="3.04" data-time="81.11">[01:21.11]</span>Student: So it's basically the unpopular books that get put up for sale then? </p>

              <span class="time" data-times="6.16" data-time="84.15">[01:24.15]</span>Librarian: Well, that...plus the main thing is to make sure students have <span class="underline">access</span> to the information in the books. <span class="time" data-times="4.79" data-time="90.31">[01:30.31]</span>A lot of them are <span class="underline">available</span> in electronic <span class="underline">format</span> these days, <span class="underline">even</span> the really old ones. <span class="time" data-times="2.04" data-time="95.1">[01:35.10]</span>You know, they have been preserved that way. </p>

              <span class="time" data-times="2.29" data-time="97.14">[01:37.14]</span>Student: So most of the books for sale are older books. </p>

              <span class="time" data-times="2.19" data-time="99.43">[01:39.43]</span>Librarian: Well, we get book donations too. <span class="time" data-times="1.99" data-time="101.62">[01:41.62]</span>And lots of those are new. <span class="time" data-times="5.16" data-time="103.61">[01:43.61]</span>Again, a <span class="underline">librarian</span> reviews them and decides whether to <span class="underline">catalogue</span> them or put them up for sale. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.73" data-time="108.77">[01:48.77]</span>Student: Is this sale open to the public? </p>

            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="0.55" data-time="123.17">[02:03.17]</span>Student: Really? <span class="time" data-times="1.59" data-time="123.72">[02:03.72]</span>What do volunteers have to do? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.19" data-time="125.31">[02:05.31]</span>Librarian: You help <span class="underline">sort</span> the books and set up the tables. <span class="time" data-times="3.05" data-time="127.5">[02:07.50]</span>But keep in <span class="underline">mind</span> those positions fill up quickly. <span class="time" data-times="5.79" data-time="130.55">[02:10.55]</span>Now, about this <span class="underline">particular</span> book, it wouldn't hurt to send a <span class="underline">formal</span> <span class="underline">request</span> to the collection <span class="underline">department</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.84" data-time="136.34">[02:16.34]</span>They might be able to let you know if it would be up for sale. </p>
