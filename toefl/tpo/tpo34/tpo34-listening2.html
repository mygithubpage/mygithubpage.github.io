OK? <span class="time" data-times="7.61" data-time="32.55">[00:32.55]</span>As you will <span class="highlight">recall</span>, Dada began in Switzerland, in the city of Zurich, in 1916. <span class="time" data-times="12.84" data-time="40.16">[00:40.16]</span>The artists who studied it were reacting against <span class="highlight">traditional</span> notions of beauty, of <span class="highlight">reason</span>, of progress, which had been standards of western thought since the 18th <span class="highlight">century</span>. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="8.35" data-time="53">[00:53.00]</span>They looked around. And well, I mean, the First World War was raging, so they didn't see much beauty, <span class="highlight">reason</span> or progress in the world. <span class="time" data-times="5.87" data-time="61.35">[01:01.35]</span><span class="highlight">Instead</span>, they saw a world that was <span class="highlight">chaotic</span>, <span class="highlight">random</span>, a world that didn't make <span class="highlight">sense</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.53" data-time="67.22">[01:07.22]</span>And if that's the way the world was, well, they <span class="highlight">wanted</span> their art to <span class="highlight">reflect</span> that. <span class="time" data-times="7.73" data-time="72.75">[01:12.75]</span>So let's...let's <span class="highlight">review</span> a <span class="highlight">couple</span> of key ideas that were the <span class="highlight">backbone</span> of Dada art. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.53" data-time="80.48">[01:20.48]</span>First, the Dadaists <span class="highlight">wanted</span> to completely <span class="highlight">reject</span> the <span class="highlight">classical</span> idea of art. <span class="time" data-times="6.71" data-time="86.01">[01:26.01]</span><span class="highlight">Classical</span> ideas like <span class="highlight">proportion</span>, <span class="highlight">balance</span>...all the things you think about when you think about great art. <span class="time" data-times="7.07" data-time="92.72">[01:32.72]</span>Great art involved <span class="highlight">reason</span>, the logic, the beauty that the Dadaists <span class="highlight">wanted</span> to <span class="highlight">overthrow</span>. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.57" data-time="99.79">[01:39.79]</span>So, well, you know, to a Dadaist, <span class="highlight">classical</span> artwork was a <span class="highlight">reflection</span> of outdated thinking! <span class="time" data-times="4.77" data-time="107.36">[01:47.36]</span>That's why Dadaists created sculptures like the ones we saw last week. <span class="time" data-times="3.19" data-time="112.13">[01:52.13]</span>Remember the stool with the bicycle wheel mounted on top? <span class="time" data-times="3.18" data-time="115.32">[01:55.32]</span>I wouldn't exactly called that beautiful, would you? <span class="time" data-times="2.9" data-time="118.5">[01:58.50]</span>But of <span class="highlight">course</span> it wasn't meant to be. <span class="time" data-times="1.64" data-time="121.4">[02:01.40]</span>That was the point! </p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.03" data-time="123.04">[02:03.04]</span>OK.

Right? <span class="time" data-times="6.35" data-time="128.07">[02:08.07]</span>Uh...if life is <span class="highlight">random</span>, said the Dadaists, why would we make art that has order and logic? <span class="time" data-times="11.15" data-time="134.42">[02:14.42]</span>And so we have that collage we looked at, with an artist took different, you know, cut-out squares of colored paper, threw them onto the <span class="highlight">canvas</span>, and wherever they landed, that was the <span class="highlight">composition</span> of the work! </p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.42" data-time="145.57">[02:25.57]</span>Another favorite of the Dadaists was something called <span class="highlight">chance</span><span class="highlight">poetry</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.59" data-time="149.99">[02:29.99]</span>A <span class="highlight">chance</span> poet would pull words out of a hat and that would be...that would make up the poem! <span class="time" data-times="8.27" data-time="156.58">[02:36.58]</span>And this idea of <span class="highlight">chance</span> and randomness was a key <span class="highlight">element</span> of Dadaism because the whole world seemed so <span class="highlight">random</span> to them. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="8.07" data-time="164.85">[02:44.85]</span>So now let's take a look at how Dadaist ideas represented to audiences in highly unconventional...well...<span class="time" data-times="3.93" data-time="172.92">[02:52.92]</span>I am not <span class="highlight">even</span> sure how to <span class="highlight">categorize</span> these theatrical events. <span class="time" data-times="3.08" data-time="176.85">[02:56.85]</span>I <span class="highlight">suppose</span> you just have to call them shows. <span class="time" data-times="5.07" data-time="179.93">[02:59.93]</span>These shows started in Zurich in a place called the Cabaret Voltaire. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="8.93" data-time="185">[03:05.00]</span>The rejection of <span class="highlight">classical</span> western art, well, you see this in the nature of what took place at the Cabaret Voltaire. <span class="time" data-times="2.64" data-time="193.93">[03:13.93]</span>They didn't put on plays or operas there. <span class="time" data-times="2.68" data-time="196.57">[03:16.57]</span>What they did was <span class="highlight">throw</span> out all conventions. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.45" data-time="199.25">[03:19.25]</span>They mixed everything and anything together. <span class="time" data-times="3.97" data-time="201.7">[03:21.70]</span>They would...it might start with somebody reading a poem. <span class="time" data-times="13.64" data-time="205.67">[03:25.67]</span>Then somebody else playing an <span class="highlight">instrument</span>, followed by a <span class="highlight">display</span> of paintings, followed by somebody else chanting, followed by somebody else banging on a big drum, and someone dressed in a robot <span class="highlight">costume</span> jumping up and down. <span class="time" data-times="2.94" data-time="219.31">[03:39.31]</span>So it's not like a play. <span class="time" data-times="5.72" data-time="222.25">[03:42.25]</span>There's no real <span class="highlight">plot</span><span class="highlight">development</span> here like you'd find in the <span class="highlight">traditional</span> theatrical performance. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="8.66" data-time="227.97">[03:47.97]</span>The performers at the Cabaret Voltaire would also get the <span class="highlight">audience</span> involved, which was extremely unusual. <span class="time" data-times="2.04" data-time="236.63">[03:56.63]</span>Think about a <span class="highlight">traditional</span> play. <span class="time" data-times="1.99" data-time="238.67">[03:58.67]</span>The <span class="highlight">action</span>'s self-contained. <span class="time" data-times="3.4" data-time="240.66">[04:00.66]</span>The actors act as if there is no one watching, right?

There is a long pause before the sentence. The professor said that the word so is very firm, and the next step is to say Dada art's backbone. First, the Dadaists wanted to completely reject the classical idea of art. The next paragraph is all about how to oppose classic art. Remember the stool with the bicycle wheel mounted on top? I wouldn't exactly called that beautiful, would you? But of course it wasn't meant to be. That was the point! The example is to support his point of view.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>"According to the professor, why did some Dadaist write poetry by pulling words out of a hat?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

So in the following lectures, professors often use Dada in comparison with traditional art. The answer to this question is also interspersed with the contrast. Professor So it's not like a play. This sentence not only summarizes, but also has a smile in his tone. The next step is to express that apart from traditional play is the meaning of plot development.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor, what contributed to the chaotic nature of the performances at the Cabaret Voltaire?
