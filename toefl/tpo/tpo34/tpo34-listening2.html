              <span class="time" data-times="6.82" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in an art <span class="highlight">history</span> class. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.83" data-time="6.82">[00:06.82]</span>Professor: All right.<span class="time" data-times="6.35" data-time="8.65">[00:08.65]</span> So last week we started talking about the painters and sculptors who were part of the art movement called Dada. <span class="time" data-times="6.87" data-time="15">[00:15.00]</span>But I don't want you to think the ideas we introduced last time were limited to painting, <span class="highlight">sculpture</span>, that <span class="highlight">sort</span> of thing. <span class="time" data-times="7.16" data-time="21.87">[00:21.87]</span>So today I want to move beyond the <span class="highlight">visual</span> arts and talk a bit about Dada in the performing arts, in theater. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.52" data-time="29.03">[00:29.03]</span>But let's start by reviewing what Dada is. OK? <span class="time" data-times="7.61" data-time="32.55">[00:32.55]</span>As you will <span class="highlight">recall</span>, Dada began in Switzerland, in the city of Zurich, in 1916. <span class="time" data-times="12.84" data-time="40.16">[00:40.16]</span>The artists who studied it were reacting against <span class="highlight">traditional</span> notions of beauty, of <span class="highlight">reason</span>, of progress, which had been standards of western thought since the 18th <span class="highlight">century</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.35" data-time="53">[00:53.00]</span>They looked around. And well, I mean, the First World War was raging, so they didn't see much beauty, <span class="highlight">reason</span> or progress in the world. <span class="time" data-times="5.87" data-time="61.35">[01:01.35]</span> <span class="highlight">Instead</span>, they saw a world that was <span class="highlight">chaotic</span>, <span class="highlight">random</span>, a world that didn't make <span class="highlight">sense</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.53" data-time="67.22">[01:07.22]</span>And if that's the way the world was, well, they <span class="highlight">wanted</span> their art to <span class="highlight">reflect</span> that. <span class="time" data-times="7.73" data-time="72.75">[01:12.75]</span>So let's...let's <span class="highlight">review</span> a <span class="highlight">couple</span> of key ideas that were the <span class="highlight">backbone</span> of Dada art. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.53" data-time="80.48">[01:20.48]</span>First, the Dadaists <span class="highlight">wanted</span> to completely <span class="highlight">reject</span> the <span class="highlight">classical</span> idea of art. <span class="time" data-times="6.71" data-time="86.01">[01:26.01]</span> <span class="highlight">Classical</span> ideas like <span class="highlight">proportion</span>, <span class="highlight">balance</span>...all the things you think about when you think about great art. <span class="time" data-times="7.07" data-time="92.72">[01:32.72]</span>Great art involved <span class="highlight">reason</span>, the logic, the beauty that the Dadaists <span class="highlight">wanted</span> to <span class="highlight">overthrow</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.57" data-time="99.79">[01:39.79]</span>So, well, you know, to a Dadaist, <span class="highlight">classical</span> artwork was a <span class="highlight">reflection</span> of outdated thinking! <span class="time" data-times="4.77" data-time="107.36">[01:47.36]</span>That's why Dadaists created sculptures like the ones we saw last week. <span class="time" data-times="3.19" data-time="112.13">[01:52.13]</span>Remember the stool with the bicycle wheel mounted on top? <span class="time" data-times="3.18" data-time="115.32">[01:55.32]</span>I wouldn't exactly called that beautiful, would you? <span class="time" data-times="2.9" data-time="118.5">[01:58.50]</span>But of <span class="highlight">course</span> it wasn't meant to be. <span class="time" data-times="1.64" data-time="121.4">[02:01.40]</span>That was the point! </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.03" data-time="123.04">[02:03.04]</span>OK. So another key Dada idea we talked about was the embracing of randomness. Right? <span class="time" data-times="6.35" data-time="128.07">[02:08.07]</span>Uh...if life is <span class="highlight">random</span>, said the Dadaists, why would we make art that has order and logic? <span class="time" data-times="11.15" data-time="134.42">[02:14.42]</span>And so we have that collage we looked at, with an artist took different, you know, cut-out squares of colored paper, threw them onto the <span class="highlight">canvas</span>, and wherever they landed, that was the <span class="highlight">composition</span> of the work! </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.42" data-time="145.57">[02:25.57]</span>Another favorite of the Dadaists was something called <span class="highlight">chance</span> <span class="highlight">poetry</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.59" data-time="149.99">[02:29.99]</span>A <span class="highlight">chance</span> poet would pull words out of a hat and that would be...that would make up the poem! <span class="time" data-times="8.27" data-time="156.58">[02:36.58]</span>And this idea of <span class="highlight">chance</span> and randomness was a key <span class="highlight">element</span> of Dadaism because the whole world seemed so <span class="highlight">random</span> to them. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.07" data-time="164.85">[02:44.85]</span>So now let's take a look at how Dadaist ideas represented to audiences in highly unconventional...well...<span class="time" data-times="3.93" data-time="172.92">[02:52.92]</span>I am not <span class="highlight">even</span> sure how to <span class="highlight">categorize</span> these theatrical events. <span class="time" data-times="3.08" data-time="176.85">[02:56.85]</span>I <span class="highlight">suppose</span> you just have to call them shows. <span class="time" data-times="5.07" data-time="179.93">[02:59.93]</span>These shows started in Zurich in a place called the Cabaret Voltaire. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.93" data-time="185">[03:05.00]</span>The rejection of <span class="highlight">classical</span> western art, well, you see this in the nature of what took place at the Cabaret Voltaire. <span class="time" data-times="2.64" data-time="193.93">[03:13.93]</span>They didn't put on plays or operas there. <span class="time" data-times="2.68" data-time="196.57">[03:16.57]</span>What they did was <span class="highlight">throw</span> out all conventions. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.45" data-time="199.25">[03:19.25]</span>They mixed everything and anything together. <span class="time" data-times="3.97" data-time="201.7">[03:21.70]</span>They would...it might start with somebody reading a poem. <span class="time" data-times="13.64" data-time="205.67">[03:25.67]</span>Then somebody else playing an <span class="highlight">instrument</span>, followed by a <span class="highlight">display</span> of paintings, followed by somebody else chanting, followed by somebody else banging on a big drum, and someone dressed in a robot <span class="highlight">costume</span> jumping up and down. <span class="time" data-times="2.94" data-time="219.31">[03:39.31]</span>So it's not like a play. <span class="time" data-times="5.72" data-time="222.25">[03:42.25]</span>There's no real <span class="highlight">plot</span> <span class="highlight">development</span> here like you'd find in the <span class="highlight">traditional</span> theatrical performance. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.66" data-time="227.97">[03:47.97]</span>The performers at the Cabaret Voltaire would also get the <span class="highlight">audience</span> involved, which was extremely unusual. <span class="time" data-times="2.04" data-time="236.63">[03:56.63]</span>Think about a <span class="highlight">traditional</span> play. <span class="time" data-times="1.99" data-time="238.67">[03:58.67]</span>The <span class="highlight">action</span>'s self-contained. <span class="time" data-times="3.4" data-time="240.66">[04:00.66]</span>The actors act as if there is no one watching, right? <span class="time" data-times="1.89" data-time="244.06">[04:04.06]</span>It's like a world unto itself. <span class="time" data-times="8.36" data-time="245.95">[04:05.95]</span>Well, at the Cabaret Voltaire, <span class="highlight">audience</span> members could get up on <span class="highlight">stage</span> and dance, or <span class="highlight">chant</span>, or shout and sing from their seats. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.92" data-time="254.31">[04:14.31]</span>And every night would be different, because there would be a different <span class="highlight">audience</span> and a different set of acts and displays. <span class="time" data-times="3.1" data-time="260.23">[04:20.23]</span>So all these could get <span class="highlight">pretty</span> <span class="highlight">chaotic</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.46" data-time="263.33">[04:23.33]</span>No barriers between the performers and the <span class="highlight">audience</span>, and no barriers between kinds of art either. <span class="time" data-times="7.16" data-time="269.79">[04:29.79]</span>Think about it: <span class="highlight">poetry</span>, paintings, music, dance...all on the same <span class="highlight">stage</span> and often at the same time! </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.7" data-time="276.95">[04:36.95]</span>This is what the Dadaists had in <span class="highlight">mind</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.07" data-time="279.65">[04:39.65]</span>When they set out to make art that reflected their own idea of reality, it didn't make <span class="highlight">sense</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="285.72">[04:45.72]</span>But why should it?! </p>
