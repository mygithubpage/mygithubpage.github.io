In my opinion, I disagree with the statement that nowadays it is more difficult to educate children than in the past because children can take advantage of those high-technologies to enhance their study.</p><p>First and foremost, compared to in the past, at present the cell phone can is enabled to create a good positive effect on children's study.  Thanks to various of advanced software on the cell phone, student find it not difficult to grasp the most scientific leaning methods. For instance, in the past, children learned the new words by the text book without audio format, which led to the children couldn't speak the words with correct pronunciations children's false pronunciations or even mute English ; while today, children can are allowed to study those new words by the cell phone and they can imitate the native speaker's voice through the audio format in the cell phone. As a result, more and more children can speak English fluently. From this fact, we can learn that the cell phone makes educating children much easier and comprehensive than before.</p><p>Furthermore, teaching children is easier than before by the way of the obvious benefit that playing online games which can cultivate children's ability of cooperation cannot be ignored. Through competing and interacting with others in the online games which can be called as a miniature of society, children can experience a sense of cooperation and responsibility intangibly. For example, due to the limitation of real situation, children had few opportunities to practice the ability of cooperation before. Nevertheless, it is much easier today, since in an online game, children are assigned to different tasks. Only when they cooperate well, can they get final success. From this experience, children can have a sense of teamwork, which cannot be learned from the class. This example tells us Obviously，in the modern society, children have kinds of chances to practice their cooperation's ability as a result of internet , which is better for their education.</p><p>Finally, contract to the past, today social networking can expend children's horizon, which is also beneficial for their education. various information filling in the web provides children with more broaden world without stepping outside. For example, ten years ago, with limited technology, only through travel can children learn different cultures and languages. However, it spent cost more money and more time; what's more, children were too young to go for a trip by themselves. So it was not easy to come true. But today, children just need to sit in front of the computer and type some key words through Google, and then they can get plenty of information as they want immediately. In addition, Children can learn other countries' culture and languages by watching the video online. Consequently, we can realize that social network Web site is a useful way to educate children. </p><p>In a nutshell, I strongly disagree with the statement. With the advanced technology like cell phone, online games, and social networking Web site it can facilitate children's education and help them be successful easier more easily in their future.</p></article></div></main></body></html>
