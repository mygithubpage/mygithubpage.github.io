part of a lecture in a <span class="highlight">botany</span> class.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="8.37" data-time="4.49">[00:04.49]</span>Professor: When we talk about <span class="highlight">pollination</span><span class="highlight">ecology</span>, we are talking about the relationship between a plant and its <span class="highlight">pollinator</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.27" data-time="12.86">[00:12.86]</span>From the plants' <span class="highlight">perspective</span>, the <span class="highlight">ideal</span><span class="highlight">pollinator</span> is an animal that is under-fed, ready to eat and in a <span class="highlight">hurry</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.97" data-time="21.13">[00:21.13]</span>The <span class="highlight">pollinator</span>, on the other hand, wants to <span class="highlight">remain</span> well-fed with as little effort as possible.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="8.76" data-time="27.1">[00:27.10]</span>These factors help <span class="highlight">drive</span> the <span class="highlight">evolution</span> of plants and their pollinators, both of which <span class="highlight">depend</span> on this <span class="highlight">balanced</span> and <span class="highlight">delicate</span> relationship. <span class="time" data-times="5.96" data-time="35.86">[00:35.86]</span>Sometimes only certain insects or birds can <span class="highlight">pollinate</span> certain plant <span class="highlight">species</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.19" data-time="41.82">[00:41.82]</span>So to really understand <span class="highlight">pollination</span><span class="highlight">ecology</span>, both the flower and its pollinators must be studied.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.46" data-time="49.01">[00:49.01]</span>Let's start with flowers. <span class="time" data-times="14.31" data-time="51.47">[00:51.47]</span>There are several important factors <span class="highlight">associated</span> with pollination: when and how often a plan flowers, how long the flowering <span class="highlight">cycle</span> lasts, and the number of flowers that open at the same time. <span class="time" data-times="15.1" data-time="65.78">[01:05.78]</span>For example, flowering may <span class="highlight">coincide</span> with the <span class="highlight">migration</span> of a certain animal <span class="highlight">species</span> that pollinates the plant, or producing many flowers at once may increase the number of pollinators a plant attracts.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.23" data-time="80.88">[01:20.88]</span>Other characteristics of flowers are also important. <span class="time" data-times="10.47" data-time="84.11">[01:24.11]</span>Features such as color, <span class="highlight">scent</span> and <span class="highlight">shape</span><span class="highlight">attract</span> pollinators, as does the <span class="highlight">reward</span> in the flower, the <span class="highlight">pollen</span> or the <span class="highlight">nectar</span>, that feeds the <span class="highlight">pollinator</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.31" data-time="94.58">[01:34.58]</span>For example, flowers that <span class="highlight">attract</span> bats <span class="highlight">tend</span> to be green or cream-colored, because visibility is important. <span class="time" data-times="2.34" data-time="102.89">[01:42.89]</span>Bats are <span class="highlight">practically</span><span class="highlight">blind</span>, remember. <span class="time" data-times="3.63" data-time="105.23">[01:45.23]</span>And these flowers <span class="highlight">bloom</span> at night when bats are active.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="10.62" data-time="108.86">[01:48.86]</span>Now, there's a flower in the Amazon rainforest called a royal water lily and the characteristics of its flowers change during the <span class="highlight">pollination</span><span class="highlight">process</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.91" data-time="119.48">[01:59.48]</span>The royal water lily uses color, <span class="highlight">temperature</span> and <span class="highlight">scent</span> to <span class="highlight">attract</span> the beetles that <span class="highlight">pollinate</span> it. <span class="time" data-times="5.95" data-time="126.39">[02:06.39]</span>When the flowers of the royal water lily first open up, when they first <span class="highlight">bloom</span>, they are white. <span class="time" data-times="4.6" data-time="132.34">[02:12.34]</span>They also <span class="highlight">emit</span> a strong <span class="highlight">odor</span> and their <span class="highlight">temperature</span> rises. <span class="time" data-times="3.24" data-time="136.94">[02:16.94]</span>Producing heat serves two purposes.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.47" data-time="140.18">[02:20.18]</span>It magnifies the <span class="highlight">scent</span> of the flower and it helps the beetles <span class="highlight">maintain</span> their body <span class="highlight">temperature</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9.02" data-time="146.65">[02:26.65]</span>When a beetle arrives at the flower, the flower closes around it for about 24 hours so that the beetle becomes covered with <span class="highlight">pollen</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.78" data-time="155.67">[02:35.67]</span>Then when the flower opens, its color changes to red and it cools down. <span class="time" data-times="7.06" data-time="161.45">[02:41.45]</span>When the beetle flies out, it carries the <span class="highlight">pollen</span> to a different, heated, white, <span class="highlight">fragrant</span> flower.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.68" data-time="168.51">[02:48.51]</span>As you can see, plants go to a lot of trouble to <span class="highlight">attract</span><span class="highlight">attention</span>.<span class="time" data-times="4.39" data-time="173.19">[02:53.19]</span> So what kind of <span class="highlight">attention</span> are they attracting? And why? <span class="time" data-times="6.42" data-time="177.58">[02:57.58]</span>Well, sometimes flowers provide <span class="highlight">shelter</span> for insects, a place to <span class="highlight">lay</span> eggs for <span class="highlight">instance</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.74" data-time="184">[03:04.00]</span>But usually the attraction is food: <span class="highlight">nectar</span> and <span class="highlight">pollen</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.72" data-time="187.74">[03:07.74]</span><span class="highlight">Nectar</span> is mainly a sugar <span class="highlight">solution</span>, while <span class="highlight">pollen</span> is a <span class="highlight">grain</span> made up of part of the plant's <span class="highlight">cell</span> structure. <span class="time" data-times="5.98" data-time="195.46">[03:15.46]</span>In both <span class="highlight">nectar</span> and <span class="highlight">pollen</span> production, <span class="highlight">quality</span> and <span class="highlight">quantity</span><span class="highlight">vary</span> over time. <span class="time" data-times="3.38" data-time="201.44">[03:21.44]</span>But they are always related to the needs of the <span class="highlight">pollinator</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.97" data-time="204.82">[03:24.82]</span>You can see that the relationship between pollinators and plants are <span class="highlight">delicate</span>, so any number of factors can <span class="highlight">disturb</span> them. <span class="time" data-times="6.32" data-time="212.79">[03:32.79]</span>Human <span class="highlight">development</span> is one. And <span class="highlight">agriculture</span> is generally believed to be the most harmful.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="12.38" data-time="219.11">[03:39.11]</span>It can <span class="highlight">fragment</span> habitats in a <span class="highlight">variety</span> of ways, reducing the number of pollinators, which in turn may reduce the number or size of the flowers, which of <span class="highlight">course</span> affects the animals that feed on them. <span class="time" data-times="5.32" data-time="231.49">[03:51.49]</span>Exotic plant <span class="highlight">species</span> not native to the area can move in and <span class="highlight">compete</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.58" data-time="236.81">[03:56.81]</span><span class="highlight">Even</span> bees brought in to <span class="highlight">pollinate</span> crops can <span class="highlight">alter</span> natural <span class="highlight">pollen</span><span class="highlight">dispersal</span> systems of rainforest plants.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="10.27" data-time="244.39">[04:04.39]</span>On the other hand, recent studies have shown that the disruption of one <span class="highlight">aspect</span> of the <span class="highlight">pollination</span><span class="highlight">cycle</span> doesn't usually <span class="highlight">lead</span> to the <span class="highlight">extinction</span> of other <span class="highlight">species</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.99" data-time="254.66">[04:14.66]</span>It turns out that plant-pollinator relationships are more <span class="highlight">adaptable</span> to change than we thought. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="260.65">[04:20.65]</span>So really it is hard to know just how <span class="highlight">agriculture</span> affects the <span class="highlight">pollination</span> of plants. </p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the lecture mainly about?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

The amount of water the plant recently received</p><p>D. The number of flowers that bloom at the same time</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="BD"><p>There are several important factors associated with pollination: when and how often a plant flowers, how long the flowering cycle lasts, and the number of flowers that open at the same time. First the professor uses the Let's start with... sentence to draw an important structure. Then use the total sentence to guide some key points.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor mention bats?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To emphasize that mammals can also be pollinators</p><p>B. To help explain the role of flower color in attracting pollinators</p><p>C. To suggest that bats are not efficient pollinators</p><p>D. To explain why some bats do not benefit from flowers that bloom only at night</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>For example, flowers that attract bats tend to be green- or cream-colored, because visibility isn't important. Bats are practically blind, remember. And these flowers bloom at night when the bats are active.
