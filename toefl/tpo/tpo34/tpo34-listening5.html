              <span class="time" data-times="4.49" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in a <span class="underline">botany</span> class.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.37" data-time="4.49">[00:04.49]</span>Professor: When we talk about <span class="underline">pollination</span> <span class="underline">ecology</span>, we are talking about the relationship between a plant and its <span class="underline">pollinator</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.27" data-time="12.86">[00:12.86]</span>From the plants' <span class="underline">perspective</span>, the <span class="underline">ideal</span> <span class="underline">pollinator</span> is an animal that is under-fed, ready to eat and in a <span class="underline">hurry</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.97" data-time="21.13">[00:21.13]</span>The <span class="underline">pollinator</span>, on the other hand, wants to <span class="underline">remain</span> well-fed with as little effort as possible.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.76" data-time="27.1">[00:27.10]</span>These factors help <span class="underline">drive</span> the <span class="underline">evolution</span> of plants and their pollinators, both of which <span class="underline">depend</span> on this <span class="underline">balanced</span> and <span class="underline">delicate</span> relationship. <span class="time" data-times="5.96" data-time="35.86">[00:35.86]</span>Sometimes only certain insects or birds can <span class="underline">pollinate</span> certain plant <span class="underline">species</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.19" data-time="41.82">[00:41.82]</span>So to really understand <span class="underline">pollination</span> <span class="underline">ecology</span>, both the flower and its pollinators must be studied.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.46" data-time="49.01">[00:49.01]</span>Let's start with flowers. <span class="time" data-times="14.31" data-time="51.47">[00:51.47]</span>There are several important factors <span class="underline">associated</span> with pollination: when and how often a plan flowers, how long the flowering <span class="underline">cycle</span> lasts, and the number of flowers that open at the same time. <span class="time" data-times="15.1" data-time="65.78">[01:05.78]</span>For example, flowering may <span class="underline">coincide</span> with the <span class="underline">migration</span> of a certain animal <span class="underline">species</span> that pollinates the plant, or producing many flowers at once may increase the number of pollinators a plant attracts.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.23" data-time="80.88">[01:20.88]</span>Other characteristics of flowers are also important. <span class="time" data-times="10.47" data-time="84.11">[01:24.11]</span>Features such as color, <span class="underline">scent</span> and <span class="underline">shape</span> <span class="underline">attract</span> pollinators, as does the <span class="underline">reward</span> in the flower, the <span class="underline">pollen</span> or the <span class="underline">nectar</span>, that feeds the <span class="underline">pollinator</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.31" data-time="94.58">[01:34.58]</span>For example, flowers that <span class="underline">attract</span> bats <span class="underline">tend</span> to be green or cream-colored, because visibility is important. <span class="time" data-times="2.34" data-time="102.89">[01:42.89]</span>Bats are <span class="underline">practically</span> <span class="underline">blind</span>, remember. <span class="time" data-times="3.63" data-time="105.23">[01:45.23]</span>And these flowers <span class="underline">bloom</span> at night when bats are active.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.62" data-time="108.86">[01:48.86]</span>Now, there's a flower in the Amazon rainforest called a royal water lily and the characteristics of its flowers change during the <span class="underline">pollination</span> <span class="underline">process</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.91" data-time="119.48">[01:59.48]</span>The royal water lily uses color, <span class="underline">temperature</span> and <span class="underline">scent</span> to <span class="underline">attract</span> the beetles that <span class="underline">pollinate</span> it. <span class="time" data-times="5.95" data-time="126.39">[02:06.39]</span>When the flowers of the royal water lily first open up, when they first <span class="underline">bloom</span>, they are white. <span class="time" data-times="4.6" data-time="132.34">[02:12.34]</span>They also <span class="underline">emit</span> a strong <span class="underline">odor</span> and their <span class="underline">temperature</span> rises. <span class="time" data-times="3.24" data-time="136.94">[02:16.94]</span>Producing heat serves two purposes.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.47" data-time="140.18">[02:20.18]</span>It magnifies the <span class="underline">scent</span> of the flower and it helps the beetles <span class="underline">maintain</span> their body <span class="underline">temperature</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9.02" data-time="146.65">[02:26.65]</span>When a beetle arrives at the flower, the flower closes around it for about 24 hours so that the beetle becomes covered with <span class="underline">pollen</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.78" data-time="155.67">[02:35.67]</span>Then when the flower opens, its color changes to red and it cools down. <span class="time" data-times="7.06" data-time="161.45">[02:41.45]</span>When the beetle flies out, it carries the <span class="underline">pollen</span> to a different, heated, white, <span class="underline">fragrant</span> flower.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.68" data-time="168.51">[02:48.51]</span>As you can see, plants go to a lot of trouble to <span class="underline">attract</span> <span class="underline">attention</span>.<span class="time" data-times="4.39" data-time="173.19">[02:53.19]</span> So what kind of <span class="underline">attention</span> are they attracting? And why? <span class="time" data-times="6.42" data-time="177.58">[02:57.58]</span>Well, sometimes flowers provide <span class="underline">shelter</span> for insects, a place to <span class="underline">lay</span> eggs for <span class="underline">instance</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.74" data-time="184">[03:04.00]</span>But usually the attraction is food: <span class="underline">nectar</span> and <span class="underline">pollen</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.72" data-time="187.74">[03:07.74]</span> <span class="underline">Nectar</span> is mainly a sugar <span class="underline">solution</span>, while <span class="underline">pollen</span> is a <span class="underline">grain</span> made up of part of the plant's <span class="underline">cell</span> structure. <span class="time" data-times="5.98" data-time="195.46">[03:15.46]</span>In both <span class="underline">nectar</span> and <span class="underline">pollen</span> production, <span class="underline">quality</span> and <span class="underline">quantity</span> <span class="underline">vary</span> over time. <span class="time" data-times="3.38" data-time="201.44">[03:21.44]</span>But they are always related to the needs of the <span class="underline">pollinator</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.97" data-time="204.82">[03:24.82]</span>You can see that the relationship between pollinators and plants are <span class="underline">delicate</span>, so any number of factors can <span class="underline">disturb</span> them. <span class="time" data-times="6.32" data-time="212.79">[03:32.79]</span>Human <span class="underline">development</span> is one. And <span class="underline">agriculture</span> is generally believed to be the most harmful.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="12.38" data-time="219.11">[03:39.11]</span>It can <span class="underline">fragment</span> habitats in a <span class="underline">variety</span> of ways, reducing the number of pollinators, which in turn may reduce the number or size of the flowers, which of <span class="underline">course</span> affects the animals that feed on them. <span class="time" data-times="5.32" data-time="231.49">[03:51.49]</span>Exotic plant <span class="underline">species</span> not native to the area can move in and <span class="underline">compete</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.58" data-time="236.81">[03:56.81]</span> <span class="underline">Even</span> bees brought in to <span class="underline">pollinate</span> crops can <span class="underline">alter</span> natural <span class="underline">pollen</span> <span class="underline">dispersal</span> systems of rainforest plants.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.27" data-time="244.39">[04:04.39]</span>On the other hand, recent studies have shown that the disruption of one <span class="underline">aspect</span> of the <span class="underline">pollination</span> <span class="underline">cycle</span> doesn't usually <span class="underline">lead</span> to the <span class="underline">extinction</span> of other <span class="underline">species</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.99" data-time="254.66">[04:14.66]</span>It turns out that plant-pollinator relationships are more <span class="underline">adaptable</span> to change than we thought. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="260.65">[04:20.65]</span>So really it is hard to know just how <span class="underline">agriculture</span> affects the <span class="underline">pollination</span> of plants. </p>
