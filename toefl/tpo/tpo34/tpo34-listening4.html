              <span class="time" data-times="8.11" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to a <span class="underline">conversation</span> between a student and her <span class="underline">creative</span> writing professor.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.54" data-time="8.11">[00:08.11]</span>Student: Hello. Professor Thomson. <span class="time" data-times="1.84" data-time="9.65">[00:09.65]</span>Could I talk to you for a <span class="underline">minute</span>?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.06" data-time="11.49">[00:11.49]</span>Professor: Oh. Hi. Laura. <span class="time" data-times="1.55" data-time="12.55">[00:12.55]</span>We missed you last class.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.15" data-time="14.1">[00:14.10]</span>Student: Yeah. I was sick for a few days. <span class="time" data-times="2.79" data-time="16.25">[00:16.25]</span>Um...I was wondering...did I miss a lot of work?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.22" data-time="19.04">[00:19.04]</span>Professor: Let's see...well, we discussed the story that you have been assigned to read for class. <span class="time" data-times="2.49" data-time="25.26">[00:25.26]</span>A Memory by Eudora Welty. <span class="time" data-times="4.43" data-time="27.75">[00:27.75]</span>And then we listened to a recording of an interview with Welty. <span class="time" data-times="2.29" data-time="32.18">[00:32.18]</span>The recording is on <span class="underline">reserve</span> at the library. <span class="time" data-times="1.55" data-time="34.47">[00:34.47]</span>You'll need to listen to it. <span class="time" data-times="3.33" data-time="36.02">[00:36.02]</span>So...did you have a <span class="underline">chance</span> to read the story?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.54" data-time="39.35">[00:39.35]</span>Student: Yeah. I did.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.31" data-time="41.89">[00:41.89]</span>Professor: What did you think?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.25" data-time="43.2">[00:43.20]</span>Student: Well...I was a little surprised. <span class="time" data-times="2.43" data-time="46.45">[00:46.45]</span>I mean, the first time I read it anyway.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.24" data-time="48.88">[00:48.88]</span>Professor: What surprised you?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.54" data-time="50.12">[00:50.12]</span>Student: You know, it just seemed like there was nothing going on in the story. <span class="time" data-times="4.27" data-time="54.66">[00:54.66]</span>I mean, a girl is just sitting at the <span class="underline">beach</span> thinking about one of her memories. <span class="time" data-times="7.07" data-time="58.93">[00:58.93]</span>And at the same time, she is watching other bathers on the <span class="underline">beach</span>, and <span class="underline">sort</span> of just thinking about what they are doing too. <span class="time" data-times="2.5" data-time="66">[01:06.00]</span>And that's all that happens! <span class="time" data-times="3.23" data-time="68.5">[01:08.50]</span>So at the end of the story, I thought, that's it?!</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.75" data-time="71.73">[01:11.73]</span>Professor: I know what you mean. <span class="time" data-times="9.49" data-time="73.48">[01:13.48]</span>There's no surprise ending like in O. Henry's story The Gift of the Magi or some big <span class="underline">adventure</span> like in Faulkner's The <span class="underline">Bear</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.19" data-time="82.97">[01:22.97]</span>So you didn't like the story?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.32" data-time="86.16">[01:26.16]</span>Student: Well, actually, while I was reading it the <span class="underline">second</span> time, I <span class="underline">sort</span> of realized that you don't need surprises or excitement to have a great story. <span class="time" data-times="7.47" data-time="94.48">[01:34.48]</span>The girl's memory and the <span class="underline">stuff</span> she was thinking about while she was watching the other people on the <span class="underline">beach</span> were really interesting to read about. <span class="time" data-times="9.05" data-time="101.95">[01:41.95]</span>And you know, it made me think that when I write my story, the one we have to write for this class, I can maybe use my own memories to get me started.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.24" data-time="111">[01:51.00]</span>Professor: Well, in fact, I'd hoped you'd see that. <span class="time" data-times="3.83" data-time="114.24">[01:54.24]</span>Of <span class="underline">course</span>, there are many levels to the story. <span class="time" data-times="8.77" data-time="118.07">[01:58.07]</span>But what I really <span class="underline">wanted</span> the class to take away from it was that you don't need to write about the great <span class="underline">exciting</span> world when you write you stories. <span class="time" data-times="3.28" data-time="126.84">[02:06.84]</span> <span class="underline">Even</span> writing about a memory can work.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.73" data-time="130.12">[02:10.12]</span>Student: Like I could write about one of the times I took a walk in the woods when I was a <span class="underline">kid</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.68" data-time="133.85">[02:13.85]</span>Professor: Exactly! You know, as the <span class="underline">due</span> day of your stories approaches, I am hearing from a lot of students that they are worried because they don't have anything <span class="underline">exciting</span> enough to write about. <span class="time" data-times="12.51" data-time="144.53">[02:24.53]</span>But Welty said in the interview we listened to and in her <span class="underline">autobiography</span> that her worst stories were the ones where she tried to write about people or places that were unfamiliar to her. <span class="time" data-times="3.88" data-time="157.04">[02:37.04]</span>That's why a lot of her stories are set in Mississippi, where she is from. <span class="time" data-times="7.62" data-time="160.92">[02:40.92]</span>Welty stressed that, for her anyway, familiarity with her <span class="underline">subject</span> matter was the key to a successful story.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.59" data-time="168.54">[02:48.54]</span>Student: Familiarity. <span class="time" data-times="1.44" data-time="170.13">[02:50.13]</span>That makes <span class="underline">sense</span>. <span class="time" data-times="1.67" data-time="171.57">[02:51.57]</span>Thanks Professor Thomson.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.18" data-time="173.24">[02:53.24]</span>Professor: No problem. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="174.42">[02:54.42]</span>Now, don't forget to listen to that recording.</p>
