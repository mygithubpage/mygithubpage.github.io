You know, as the <span class="highlight">due</span> day of your stories approaches, I am hearing from a lot of students that they are worried because they don't have anything <span class="highlight">exciting</span> enough to write about. <span class="time" data-times="12.51" data-time="144.53">[02:24.53]</span>But Welty said in the interview we listened to and in her <span class="highlight">autobiography</span> that her worst stories were the ones where she tried to write about people or places that were unfamiliar to her. <span class="time" data-times="3.88" data-time="157.04">[02:37.04]</span>That's why a lot of her stories are set in Mississippi, where she is from. <span class="time" data-times="7.62" data-time="160.92">[02:40.92]</span>Welty stressed that, for her anyway, familiarity with her <span class="highlight">subject</span> matter was the key to a successful story.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="1.59" data-time="168.54">[02:48.54]</span>Student: Familiarity. <span class="time" data-times="1.44" data-time="170.13">[02:50.13]</span>That makes <span class="highlight">sense</span>. <span class="time" data-times="1.67" data-time="171.57">[02:51.57]</span>Thanks Professor Thomson.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="1.18" data-time="173.24">[02:53.24]</span>Professor: No problem. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="174.42">[02:54.42]</span>Now, don't forget to listen to that recording.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What are the speakers mainly discussing?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.
