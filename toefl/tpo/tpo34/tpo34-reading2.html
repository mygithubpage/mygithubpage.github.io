            <b>The Development of Steam Power</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>By the eighteenth <span class="underline">century</span>, Britain was experiencing a <span class="underline">severe</span> <span class="underline">shortage</span> of energy. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>Because of the growth of <span class="underline">population</span>, most of the great forests of <span class="underline">medieval</span> Britain had long ago 
   been replaced by fields of <span class="underline">grain</span> and <span class="underline">hay</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>Wood was in ever-shorter <span class="underline">supply</span>, yet it remained tremendously important. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>It served as the <span class="underline">primary</span> <span class="underline">source</span> of heat for all homes and industries and as a <span class="underline">basic</span> <span class="underline">raw</span> <span class="underline">material</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>Processed wood (<span class="underline">charcoal</span>) was the <span class="underline">fuel</span> that was mixed with iron <span class="underline">ore</span> in the <span class="underline">blast</span> <span class="underline">furnace</span> to produce pig iron (<span class="underline">raw</span> iron). The iron <span class="underline">industry</span>'s <span class="underline">appetite</span> for wood was <span class="underline">enormous</span>, and by 1740 the British iron <span class="underline">industry</span> was stagnating. <span class="underline">Vast</span> forests enabled Russia to become the world's <span class="underline">leading</span> producer of iron, much of which was exported to Britain. But Russia's <span class="underline">potential</span> for growth was limited too, and in a few decades Russia would <span class="underline">reach</span> the <span class="underline">barrier</span> of inadequate energy that was already holding England back.</p>
          <p>As this early energy crisis grew worse, Britain looked toward its <span class="underline">abundant</span> and widely <span class="underline">scattered</span> reserves of <span class="underline">coal</span> as an <span class="underline">alternative</span> to its vanishing wood. <span class="underline">Coal</span> was first used in Britain in the late Middle Ages as a <span class="underline">source</span> of heat. By 1640 most homes in London were heated with it, and it also provided heat for making beer, glass, soap, and other products. <span class="underline">Coal</span> was not used, however, to produce <span class="underline">mechanical</span> energy or to power <span class="underline">machinery</span>. It was there that <span class="underline">coal</span>'s <span class="underline">potential</span> wad <span class="underline">enormous</span>.</p>
          <p>As more <span class="underline">coal</span> was produced, mines were dug deeper and deeper and were <span class="underline">constantly</span> filling with water. <span class="underline">Mechanical</span> pumps, usually powered by hundreds of horses waling in circles at the surface, had to be installed. Such power was expensive and bothersome. In an <span class="underline">attempt</span> to <span class="underline">overcome</span> these disadvantages, Thomas Savery in 1698 and Thomas Newcomen in 1705 invented the first <span class="underline">primitive</span> steam engines. Both engines were extremely inefficient. Both burned <span class="underline">coal</span> to produce steam, which was then used to <span class="underline">operate</span> a <span class="underline">pump</span>. However, by the early 1770s, many of the Savery engines and hundreds of the Newcomen engines were operating successfully, though inefficiently, in English and Scottish mines.</p>
          <p>In the early 1760s, a gifted young Scot named James Watt was drawn to a <span class="underline">critical</span> study of the steam <span class="underline">engine</span>. Watt was employed at the time by the University of Glasgow as a skilled crafts worker making <span class="underline">scientific</span> instruments. In 1763, Watt was called on to repair a Newcomen <span class="underline">engine</span> being used in a physics <span class="underline">course</span>. After a <span class="underline">series</span> of observations, Watt saw that the Newcomen's <span class="underline">waste</span> of energy could be reduced by adding a <span class="underline">separate</span> condenser. This splendid invention, patented in 1769, greatly increased the <span class="underline">efficiency</span> of the steam <span class="underline">engine</span>. The steam <span class="underline">engine</span> of Watt and his followers was the <span class="underline">technological</span> <span class="underline">advance</span> that gave people, at <span class="underline">least</span> for a while, unlimited power and allowed the invention and use of all kinds of power equipment.</p>
          <p>The steam <span class="underline">engine</span> was quickly put to use in several industries in Britain. It drained mines and made possible the production of ever more <span class="underline">coal</span> to feed steam engines elsewhere. The steam power plant began to <span class="underline">replace</span> waterpower in the cotton-spinning mills as well as other industries during the 1780s, contributing to a phenomenal rise in <span class="underline">industrialization</span>. The British iron <span class="underline">industry</span> was <span class="underline">radically</span> transformed. The use of powerful, steam-driven <span class="underline">bellows</span> in <span class="underline">blast</span> furnaces helped iron makers <span class="underline">switch</span> over rapidly from limited <span class="underline">charcoal</span> to unlimited coke (which is made from <span class="underline">coal</span>) in the <span class="underline">smelting</span> of pig iron (the <span class="underline">process</span> of refining impure iron) after 1770. In the 1780s, Henry Cort developed the puddling <span class="underline">furnace</span>, which allowed pig iron to be <span class="underline">refined</span> in turn with coke. Cort also developed heavy-duty, steam-powered rolling mills, which were <span class="underline">capable</span> of producing finished iron in every <span class="underline">shape</span> and form.</p>
          <p>The <span class="underline">economic</span> <span class="underline">consequence</span> of these <span class="underline">technical</span> innovations in steam power was a great <span class="underline">boom</span> in the British iron <span class="underline">industry</span>. In 1740 <span class="underline">annual</span> British iron production was only 17,000 tons, but by 1844, with the <span class="underline">spread</span> of coke <span class="underline">smelting</span> and the <span class="underline">impact</span> of Cort's inventions, it had increased to 3,000,000 tons. This was a truly amazing <span class="underline">expansion</span>. Once <span class="underline">scarce</span> and expensive, iron became cheap, <span class="underline">basic</span>, and <span class="underline">indispensable</span> to the <span class="underline">economy</span>.</p>
