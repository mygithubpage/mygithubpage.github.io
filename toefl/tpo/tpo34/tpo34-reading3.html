These plants usually <span class="highlight">occur</span> where ants are <span class="highlight">abundant</span>, most in the tropics but some in <span class="highlight">temperate</span> areas. Among those of northeastern North America are various plums, cherries, roses, hawthorns, poplars, and oaks. Like <span class="highlight">floral</span><span class="highlight">nectar</span>, extrafloral <span class="highlight">nectar</span> consists mainly of water with a high <span class="highlight">content</span> of dissolved sugars and, in some plants, small amounts of <span class="highlight">amino</span> acids. The extrafloral nectaries of some plants are known to <span class="highlight">attract</span> ants and other insects, but the <span class="highlight">evolutionary</span><span class="highlight">history</span> of most plants with these nectaries is unknown. <span class="highlight">Nevertheless</span>, most ecologists believe that all extrafloral nectaries <span class="highlight">attract</span> insects that will <span class="highlight">defend</span> the plant.</p><p>Ants are portably the most frequent and certainly the most <span class="highlight"><span class="question2">persistent</span></span> defenders of plants. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>Since the highly active worker ants <span class="highlight">require</span> a great <span class="highlight">deal</span> of energy, plants <span class="highlight">exploit</span> this need by providing extrafloral <span class="highlight">nectar</span> that supplies ants with <span class="highlight">abundant</span> energy. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>To return this <span class="highlight">favor</span>, ants guard the nectaries, driving away or killing intruding insects that might <span class="highlight">compete</span> with ants for <span class="highlight">nectar</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>Many of these intruders are <span class="highlight">herbivorous</span> and would eat the leaves of the plants. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p><p>Biologists once thought that <span class="highlight">secretion</span> of extrafloral <span class="highlight">nectar</span> has some purely <span class="highlight">internal</span><span class="highlight">physiological</span><span class="highlight">function</span>, and that ants provide no <span class="highlight">benefit</span> whatsoever to the plants that <span class="highlight">secrete</span> it. This view and the opposing "protectionist" <span class="highlight">hypothesis</span> that ants <span class="highlight">defend</span> plants had been disputed for over a hundred years when, in 1910, a <span class="highlight"><span class="question5">skeptical</span></span> William Morton Wheeler commented on the <span class="highlight">controversy</span>. He called for <span class="highlight">proof</span> of the protectionist view: that visitations of the ants <span class="highlight">confer</span> protection on the plants and that in the <span class="highlight">absence</span> of the insects a much greater number would <span class="highlight">perish</span> or fail to produce flowers or seeds than when the insects are present. <span class="question6">That we now have an <span class="highlight">abundance</span> of the <span class="highlight">proof</span> that was called for was established when Barbara Bentley reviewed the <span class="highlight">relevant</span><span class="highlight">evidence</span> in 1977, and since then many more observations and experiments have provided still further <span class="highlight">proof</span> that ants <span class="highlight">benefit</span> plants.</span></p><p>One example shows how ants attracted to extrafloral nectaries protect morning glories against attacking insects. The <span class="highlight">principal</span><span class="highlight">insect</span> enemies of the North American morning glory feed mainly on its flowers or fruits rather than its leaves. Grasshoppers feeding on flowers indirectly <span class="highlight">block</span><span class="highlight">pollination</span> and the production of seeds by destroying the corolla or the <span class="highlight">stigma</span>, which receives the <span class="highlight">pollen</span> grains and on which the <span class="highlight">pollen</span> germinates. Without their colorful corolla, flowers do not <span class="highlight">attract</span> pollinators and are not <span class="highlight">fertilized</span>. An adult <span class="highlight">grasshopper</span> can <span class="highlight">consume</span> a large corolla, about 2.5 inches long, in an hour. Caterpillars and seed beetles <span class="highlight">affect</span> seed production directly. Caterpillars <span class="highlight"><span class="question8">devour</span></span> the ovaries, where the seeds are produced, and seed beetle <span class="highlight">larvae</span> eat seeds as they <span class="highlight">burrow</span> in developing fruits.</p><p>Extrafloral nectaries at the <span class="highlight">base</span> of each sepal <span class="highlight">attract</span> several kinds of insects, but 96 percent of them are ants, several different <span class="highlight">species</span> of them. When buds are still small, less than a quarter of an inch long, the sepal nectaries are already present and producing <span class="highlight">nectar</span>. They continue to do so as the flower develops and while the fruit matures. Observations leave little <span class="highlight">doubt</span> that ants protect morning glory flowers and fruits from the combined enemy force of grasshoppers, caterpillars, and seed beetles. Bentley compares the seed production of six plants that grew where there were no ants with that of seventeen plants that were occupied by ants. Unprotected plants bore only 45 seeds per plant, but plants occupied by ants bore 211 seeds per plant. Although ants are not big enough to kill or seriously injure grasshoppers, they <span class="highlight">drive</span> them away by nipping at their feet. Seed beetles are more <span class="highlight"><span class="question10">vulnerable</span></span> because they are much smaller than grasshoppers. The ants <span class="highlight">prey</span> on the adult beetles, <span class="highlight">disturb</span> females as they <span class="highlight">lay</span> their eggs on developing fruits, and eat many of the eggs they do <span class="highlight">manage</span> to <span class="highlight">lay</span>.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 1, floral nectar and extrafloral nectar are alike in that</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. they are likely to be produced by the same plants</p><p>B. they basically consist of the same chemical components</p><p>C. they attract only insects that will defend the plant</p><p>D. they are produced by the same parts of the plant</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>It can be seen that floral nectar and extrafloral nectar have similar components, corresponding to the B in the option B. floral floral nectar, extrafloral nectar but mainly of water with a high content of dissolved sugars and, in some plants, small amounts of amino acids. Same chemical components.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>To say that ants are "<span class="highlight"><span class="question2">persistent</span></span>" defenders of plants means that</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. they defend plants against a wide variety of threats</p><p>B. they continue to defend plants for as long as the plants are threatened</p><p>C. they are successful defenders of plants</p><p>D. they are easily observable defenders of plants</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>This question is equal to the student's understanding of the meaning of the <span class="question2">persistent</span> word. Persistent, <span class="question2">persistent</span>/obstinate, corresponds to continue to defend plants in option B, giving the plant lasting protection.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What can be inferred from paragraph 2 about the ants that are attracted to the extrafloral nectaries?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They do not eat the leaves of the plants that produce extrafloral nectar.</p><p>B. They live almost entirely on extrafloral nectar.</p><p>C. They spend most of their energy guarding extrafloral nectaries.</p><p>D. They frequently fight among themselves over extrafloral nectar.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The extrafloral nectaries of some plants are known to attract ants and other insects, but the evolutionary history of most plants with these nectaries is unknown. Nevertheless, most ecologists believe that all extrafloral nectaries attract insects that will defend the Plant. The external nectar of some plants can attract ants and other insects, and these insects will protect the plants, that is to say that the ants and these insects will not destroy the plants, corresponding to the A option. They do not eat the leaves of the plants.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 3, what was the position of the opponents of the "protectionist" hypothesis?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Extrafloral nectar provides plants with a direct defense against attack by insects.</p><p>B. Ants substantially benefit plants that secrete extrafloral nectar.</p><p>C. The secretion of extrafloral nectar plays a role in the plant's internal functioning.</p><p>D. Ants visit plants that secrete extrafloral nectar as often as they visit plants that do not.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The second sentence is targeted through the opponents of the "protectionist" hypothesis, but this sentence only states that this opinion and the objections to the protectionist hypothesis are controversial, so their specific positions should be read first. The extrafloral nectar has some purely internal physiological function, and that ants provide no benefit whatsoever to the plants that secrete it. The secretion of the external nectar only has an internal physiological effect on the plant, and the ant has no effect, corresponding to the C option.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question5">skeptical</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. curious</p><p>B. doubtful</p><p>C. open-minded</p><p>D. practical</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>Skeptical, <span class="question5">skeptical</span>, corresponding b option doubtful, suspicious/doubtful.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. We now have ample proof that ants benefit plants.</p><p>B. Barbara Bentley has called for additional proof that ants benefit plants.</p><p>C. In 1977 Barbara Bentley conducted research that proved that all prior studies were wrong.</p><p>D. Proof that ants benefit plants will require many more observations and experiments.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>This sentence looks very long, the actual key content is We now have an abundance of the proof and since then many more observations and experiments have proposed still further proof that ants benefit plants. We now have a lot of previous evidence and after 1977 Various observations and experiments have been done to prove that ants are good for plants, corresponding to the A option.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, what effect does the destruction of the corolla have on plants?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It leaves the seeds exposed and unprotected.</p><p>B. It prevents the stigma from developing.</p><p>C. It keeps pollen grains from attaching properly.</p><p>D. It prevents the flower from attracting pollinators.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>If the corolla does not exist, the flower will not attract the pollinator and eventually will not be able to fertilize, affecting its growth, corresponding to the D option.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question8">devour</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. attack</p><p>B. eat</p><p>C. damage</p><p>D. prefer</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>Devour, <span class="question8">devour</span>, correspond to b option eat, eat.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What role does paragraph 5 play in the passage?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

It explains how insects find sources of nectar.</p><p>D. It presents information that partly contradicts the protectionist view.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>This section mainly used experiments to prove that plants protected by ants can produce more seeds, so it was finally proved that insects such as ants would be attracted to the outside nectar of plants and protect the plants, so the theory of protectionism was proved. Options.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question10">vulnerable</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. numerous</p><p>B. harmful</p><p>C. open to attack</p><p>D. difficult to locate</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" C"><p>Vulnerable, <span class="question10">vulnerable</span>/fragile, corresponding to C options open to attack, open attack.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 5, what did Bentley's comparative study show?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Many more plants grew in places where ants were present than where they were absent.</p><p>B. The ants preferred plants with low seed production to plants with high seed production.</p><p>C. The plants occupied by ants produced many more seeds than those that were not occupied by ants.</p><p>D. The plants that grew in places without ants were much smaller and weaker than those that grew in places where ants were present.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Bentley compares the seed production of six plants that grew where there were no ants with that of seventeen plants that were occupied by ants.

Corresponds to the B option; ...disturb females as they lay their eggs on developing fruits, and eat many of the eggs they do manage to lay. Corresponding to the C and D options; Several ants are not big enough to Kill or seriously injure grasshoppers, they drive them away by nipping at their feet. Here we talk about the ants can drive away the beggars, not to drive away the adult beetles, and the contents of the A options do not match, A wrong, so choose A.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Sometimes they capture the insects to feed their protein-hungry larvae..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The pronoun to be used in the sentences to be inserted must refer to the contents of the previous text. Judging by the context, it is obvious that the ants sometimes catch insects for their larvae to eat. Therefore, we must first confess that ants will catch insects to put this sentence, so it should clearly be placed in the third box, just before the ant to explain the ants in order to obtain nectar to drive or kill the invasion of insects.</p></div></div><div id="question14" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>Prose Summary Many plants have extrafloral nectaries that produce nectar even during periods in which the plant is not flowering.

Position the second sentence of the first paragraph of the article. Most of these plants are in the tropics and some are in the temperate zone, which is inconsistent with the content of the options.</p><p>B is wrong. Positioning the third paragraph of the first paragraph of the article, the components of the Extrafloral nectar and the floral nectar are similar and do not contain higher sugar content.</p><p>C is correct. Corresponding to the second paragraph of the article, external nectar of plants can attract certain insects, especially ants, to give them the energy they need to protect plants.</p><p>D correct. Corresponding to the second half of the third paragraph of the article, after the results of Bentley's experiment in 1977 and subsequent observations, we have accumulated a lot of evidence to prove that ants have a protective effect on the external nectar of plants.</p><p>E correct. Corresponding to the contents of the fourth and fifth paragraphs of the article, it was found through experiments that plants protected by ants can produce more seeds than plants protected by ants.</p><p>F error. Positioning the last two sentences of the fifth paragraph, the article does not say that ants will ignore small insects.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
