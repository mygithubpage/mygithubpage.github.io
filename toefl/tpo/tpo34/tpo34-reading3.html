            <b>Protection Of Plants By Insects</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>Many plants – one or more <span class="underline">species</span> of at <span class="underline">least</span> 68 different families – can <span class="underline">secrete</span> <span class="underline">nectar</span> <span class="underline">even</span> when they have no blossoms, because they <span class="underline">bear</span> extrafloral nectaries (structures that produce <span class="underline">nectar</span>) on stems, leaves, leaf stems, or other structures. These plants usually <span class="underline">occur</span> where ants are <span class="underline">abundant</span>, most in the tropics but some in <span class="underline">temperate</span> areas. Among those of northeastern North America are various plums, cherries, roses, hawthorns, poplars, and oaks. Like <span class="underline">floral</span> <span class="underline">nectar</span>, extrafloral <span class="underline">nectar</span> consists mainly of water with a high <span class="underline">content</span> of dissolved sugars and, in some plants, small amounts of <span class="underline">amino</span> acids. The extrafloral nectaries of some plants are known to <span class="underline">attract</span> ants and other insects, but the <span class="underline">evolutionary</span> <span class="underline">history</span> of most plants with these nectaries is unknown. <span class="underline">Nevertheless</span>, most ecologists believe that all extrafloral nectaries <span class="underline">attract</span> insects that will <span class="underline">defend</span> the plant.</p>
          <p>Ants are portably the most frequent and certainly the most <span class="underline">persistent</span> defenders of plants. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>Since the highly active worker ants <span class="underline">require</span> a great <span class="underline">deal</span> of energy, plants <span class="underline">exploit</span> this need by providing extrafloral <span class="underline">nectar</span> that supplies ants with <span class="underline">abundant</span> energy. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>To return this <span class="underline">favor</span>, ants guard the nectaries, driving away or killing intruding insects that might <span class="underline">compete</span> with ants for <span class="underline">nectar</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>Many of these intruders are <span class="underline">herbivorous</span> and would eat the leaves of the plants. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p>
          <p>Biologists once thought that <span class="underline">secretion</span> of extrafloral <span class="underline">nectar</span> has some purely <span class="underline">internal</span> <span class="underline">physiological</span> <span class="underline">function</span>, and that ants provide no <span class="underline">benefit</span> whatsoever to the plants that <span class="underline">secrete</span> it. This view and the opposing "protectionist" <span class="underline">hypothesis</span> that ants <span class="underline">defend</span> plants had been disputed for over a hundred years when, in 1910, a <span class="underline">skeptical</span> William Morton Wheeler commented on the <span class="underline">controversy</span>. He called for <span class="underline">proof</span> of the protectionist view: that visitations of the ants <span class="underline">confer</span> protection on the plants and that in the <span class="underline">absence</span> of the insects a much greater number would <span class="underline">perish</span> or fail to produce flowers or seeds than when the insects are present. That we now have an <span class="underline">abundance</span> of the <span class="underline">proof</span> that was called for was established when Barbara Bentley reviewed the <span class="underline">relevant</span> <span class="underline">evidence</span> in 1977, and since then many more observations and experiments have provided still further <span class="underline">proof</span> that ants <span class="underline">benefit</span> plants.</p>
          <p>One example shows how ants attracted to extrafloral nectaries protect morning glories against attacking insects. The <span class="underline">principal</span> <span class="underline">insect</span> enemies of the North American morning glory feed mainly on its flowers or fruits rather than its leaves. Grasshoppers feeding on flowers indirectly <span class="underline">block</span> <span class="underline">pollination</span> and the production of seeds by destroying the corolla or the <span class="underline">stigma</span>, which receives the <span class="underline">pollen</span> grains and on which the <span class="underline">pollen</span> germinates. Without their colorful corolla, flowers do not <span class="underline">attract</span> pollinators and are not <span class="underline">fertilized</span>. An adult <span class="underline">grasshopper</span> can <span class="underline">consume</span> a large corolla, about 2.5 inches long, in an hour. Caterpillars and seed beetles <span class="underline">affect</span> seed production directly. Caterpillars <span class="underline">devour</span> the ovaries, where the seeds are produced, and seed beetle <span class="underline">larvae</span> eat seeds as they <span class="underline">burrow</span> in developing fruits.</p>
          <p>Extrafloral nectaries at the <span class="underline">base</span> of each sepal <span class="underline">attract</span> several kinds of insects, but 96 percent of them are ants, several different <span class="underline">species</span> of them. When buds are still small, less than a quarter of an inch long, the sepal nectaries are already present and producing <span class="underline">nectar</span>. They continue to do so as the flower develops and while the fruit matures. Observations leave little <span class="underline">doubt</span> that ants protect morning glory flowers and fruits from the combined enemy force of grasshoppers, caterpillars, and seed beetles. Bentley compares the seed production of six plants that grew where there were no ants with that of seventeen plants that were occupied by ants. Unprotected plants bore only 45 seeds per plant, but plants occupied by ants bore 211 seeds per plant. Although ants are not big enough to kill or seriously injure grasshoppers, they <span class="underline">drive</span> them away by nipping at their feet. Seed beetles are more <span class="underline">vulnerable</span> because they are much smaller than grasshoppers. The ants <span class="underline">prey</span> on the adult beetles, <span class="underline">disturb</span> females as they <span class="underline">lay</span> their eggs on developing fruits, and eat many of the eggs they do <span class="underline">manage</span> to <span class="underline">lay</span>.</p>
