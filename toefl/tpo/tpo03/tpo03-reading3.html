          <h4 class="w3-center">The Long-Term Stability of Ecosystems</h4>
          <p>Plant communities <span class="highlight">assemble</span> themselves flexibly, and their <span class="highlight question1">particular</span> structure depends on the <span class="highlight">specific</span> <span class="highlight">history</span> of the area. Ecologists use the <span class="highlight">term</span> "<span class="highlight">succession</span>" to <span class="highlight">refer</span> to the changes that happen in plant communities and ecosystems over time. The first <span class="highlight">community</span> in a <span class="highlight">succession</span> is called a <span class="highlight">pioneer</span> <span class="highlight">community</span>, while the long-lived <span class="highlight">community</span> at the end of <span class="highlight">succession</span> is called a <span class="highlight">climax</span> <span class="highlight">community</span>. <span class="highlight">Pioneer</span> and successional plant communities are said to change over periods from 1 to 500 years. These changes-in plant numbers and the mix of <span class="highlight">species</span>-are <span class="highlight">cumulative</span>. <span class="highlight">Climax</span> communities themselves change but over periods of time greater than about 500 years.</p>
          <p>An ecologist who studies a pond today may well find it <span class="highlight">relatively</span> unchanged in a year's time. <span class="highlight">Individual</span> fish may be replaced, but the number of fish will <span class="highlight">tend</span> to be the same from one year to the next. We can say that the properties of an <span class="highlight">ecosystem</span> are more <span class="highlight">stable</span> than the <span class="highlight">individual</span> organisms that <span class="highlight">compose</span> the <span class="highlight">ecosystem</span>.</p>
          <p>At one time, ecologists believed that <span class="highlight">species</span> <span class="highlight">diversity</span> made ecosystems <span class="highlight">stable</span>. They believed that the greater the <span class="highlight">diversity</span> the more <span class="highlight">stable</span> the <span class="highlight">ecosystem</span>. Support for this idea came from the <span class="highlight">observation</span> that long-lasting <span class="highlight">climax</span> communities usually have more <span class="highlight">complex</span> food webs and more <span class="highlight">species</span> <span class="highlight">diversity</span> than <span class="highlight">pioneer</span> communities. Ecologists concluded that the <span class="highlight">apparent</span> <span class="highlight">stability</span> of <span class="highlight">climax</span> ecosystems depended on their <span class="highlight">complexity</span>. To take an <span class="highlight">extreme</span> example, farmlands dominated by a single crop are so unstable that one year of bad weather or the <span class="highlight">invasion</span> of a single <span class="highlight">pest</span> can destroy the entire crop. In <span class="highlight">contrast</span>, a <span class="highlight">complex</span> <span class="highlight">climax</span> <span class="highlight">community</span>, such as a <span class="highlight">temperate</span> forest, will <span class="highlight">tolerate</span> <span class="highlight">considerable</span> damage from weather to pests.</p>
          <p>The question of <span class="highlight">ecosystem</span> <span class="highlight">stability</span> is <span class="highlight">complicated</span>, however. The first problem is that ecologists do not all agree what "<span class="highlight">stability</span>" means. <span class="highlight">Stability</span> can be defined as <span class="highlight">simply</span> <span class="highlight">lack</span> of change. In that case, the <span class="highlight">climax</span> <span class="highlight">community</span> would be considered the most <span class="highlight">stable</span>, since, by <span class="highlight">definition</span>, it changes the <span class="highlight">least</span> over time. Alternatively, <span class="highlight">stability</span> can be defined as the speed with which an <span class="highlight">ecosystem</span> returns to a <span class="highlight">particular</span> form following a <span class="highlight">major</span> <span class="highlight">disturbance</span>, such as a fire. This kind of <span class="highlight">stability</span> is also called <span class="highlight">resilience</span>. In that case, <span class="highlight">climax</span> communities would be the most <span class="highlight">fragile</span> and the <span class="highlight">least</span> <span class="highlight">stable</span>, since they can <span class="highlight">require</span> hundreds of years to return to the <span class="highlight">climax</span> <span class="highlight">state</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="highlight">Even</span> the kind of <span class="highlight">stability</span> defined as simple <span class="highlight">lack</span> of change is not always <span class="highlight">associated</span> with <span class="highlight">maximum</span> <span class="highlight">diversity</span>. At <span class="highlight">least</span> in <span class="highlight">temperate</span> zones, <span class="highlight">maximum</span> <span class="highlight">diversity</span> is often found in mid-successional stages, not in the <span class="highlight">climax</span> <span class="highlight">community</span>. Once a redwood forest matures, for example, the kinds of <span class="highlight">species</span> and the number of individuals growing on the forest floor are reduced. In general, <span class="highlight">diversity</span>, by itself, does not ensure <span class="highlight">stability</span>. Mathematical models of ecosystems <span class="highlight">likewise</span> suggest that <span class="highlight">diversity</span> does not <span class="highlight"><span class="question8">guarantee</span></span> <span class="highlight">ecosystem</span> <span class="highlight">stability</span>-just the <span class="highlight">opposite</span>, in fact. A more <span class="highlight">complicated</span> system is, in general, more likely than a simple system to <span class="highlight">break</span> down. <span class="question9">A fifteen-speed racing bicycle is more likely to <span class="highlight">break</span> down than a child's tricycle.</span></p>
          <p>
            <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A">
            </span>Ecologists are especially interested to know what factors <span class="highlight">contribute</span> to the <span class="highlight">resilience</span> of communities because <span class="highlight">climax</span> communities all over the world are being <span class="highlight">severely</span> damaged or destroyed by human activities. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>The <span class="highlight">destruction</span> caused by the <span class="highlight">volcanic</span> <span class="highlight">explosion</span> of <span class="highlight">Mount</span> St. Helens, in the northwestern United States, for example, <span class="question10">pales</span> in <span class="highlight">comparison</span> to the <span class="highlight">destruction</span> caused by humans. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>We need to know what aspects of a <span class="highlight">community</span> are most important to the <span class="highlight">community</span>'s <span class="highlight">resistance</span> to <span class="highlight">destruction</span>, as well as its recovery. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p>
          <p><span class="question11">Many ecologists now think that the <span class="highlight">relative</span> long-term <span class="highlight">stability</span> of <span class="highlight">climax</span> communities comes not from <span class="highlight">diversity</span> but from the "patchiness" of the environment, an environment that varies from place to place supports more kinds of organisms than an environment that is <span class="highlight">uniform</span>.</span> A <span class="highlight">local</span> <span class="highlight">population</span> that goes <span class="highlight">extinct</span> is quickly replaced by immigrants from an <span class="highlight"><span class="question12">adjacent</span></span> <span class="highlight">community</span>. <span class="highlight">Even</span> if the new <span class="highlight">population</span> is of a different <span class="highlight">species</span>, it can <span class="highlight">approximately</span> fill the <span class="highlight">niche</span> vacated by the <span class="highlight">extinct</span> <span class="highlight">population</span> and keep the food web <span class="highlight">intact</span>.</p>

Support for this idea came from the observation that long-lasting climax communities usually have more complex food webs and more species diversity than Pioneer communities.

In that case, climax communities would be the most fragile and The least stable, since they can require hundreds of years to return to the climax state. Because ecologists have two opinions on what constitutes stability: from the standpoint of invariance, climax is the most stable; with rapid recovery From this point of view, climax is the most unstable, so climax is both stable and unstable. B clearly stated that in two aspects, all other options mentioned only one aspect.</p>
