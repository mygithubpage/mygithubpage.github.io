Ecologists use the <span class="highlight">term</span> "<span class="highlight">succession</span>" to <span class="highlight">refer</span> to the changes that happen in plant communities and ecosystems over time. The first <span class="highlight">community</span> in a <span class="highlight">succession</span> is called a <span class="highlight">pioneer</span><span class="highlight">community</span>, while the long-lived <span class="highlight">community</span> at the end of <span class="highlight">succession</span> is called a <span class="highlight">climax</span><span class="highlight">community</span>. <span class="highlight">Pioneer</span> and successional plant communities are said to change over periods from 1 to 500 years. These changes-in plant numbers and the mix of <span class="highlight">species</span>-are <span class="highlight">cumulative</span>. <span class="highlight">Climax</span> communities themselves change but over periods of time greater than about 500 years.</p><p>An ecologist who studies a pond today may well find it <span class="highlight">relatively</span> unchanged in a year's time. <span class="highlight">Individual</span> fish may be replaced, but the number of fish will <span class="highlight">tend</span> to be the same from one year to the next. We can say that the properties of an <span class="highlight">ecosystem</span> are more <span class="highlight">stable</span> than the <span class="highlight">individual</span> organisms that <span class="highlight">compose</span> the <span class="highlight">ecosystem</span>.</p><p>At one time, ecologists believed that <span class="highlight">species</span><span class="highlight">diversity</span> made ecosystems <span class="highlight">stable</span>. They believed that the greater the <span class="highlight">diversity</span> the more <span class="highlight">stable</span> the <span class="highlight">ecosystem</span>. Support for this idea came from the <span class="highlight">observation</span> that long-lasting <span class="highlight">climax</span> communities usually have more <span class="highlight">complex</span> food webs and more <span class="highlight">species</span><span class="highlight">diversity</span> than <span class="highlight">pioneer</span> communities. Ecologists concluded that the <span class="highlight">apparent</span><span class="highlight">stability</span> of <span class="highlight">climax</span> ecosystems depended on their <span class="highlight">complexity</span>. To take an <span class="highlight">extreme</span> example, farmlands dominated by a single crop are so unstable that one year of bad weather or the <span class="highlight">invasion</span> of a single <span class="highlight">pest</span> can destroy the entire crop. In <span class="highlight">contrast</span>, a <span class="highlight">complex</span><span class="highlight">climax</span><span class="highlight">community</span>, such as a <span class="highlight">temperate</span> forest, will <span class="highlight">tolerate</span><span class="highlight">considerable</span> damage from weather to pests.</p><p>The question of <span class="highlight">ecosystem</span><span class="highlight">stability</span> is <span class="highlight">complicated</span>, however. The first problem is that ecologists do not all agree what "<span class="highlight">stability</span>" means. <span class="highlight">Stability</span> can be defined as <span class="highlight">simply</span><span class="highlight">lack</span> of change. In that case, the <span class="highlight">climax</span><span class="highlight">community</span> would be considered the most <span class="highlight">stable</span>, since, by <span class="highlight">definition</span>, it changes the <span class="highlight">least</span> over time. Alternatively, <span class="highlight">stability</span> can be defined as the speed with which an <span class="highlight">ecosystem</span> returns to a <span class="highlight">particular</span> form following a <span class="highlight">major</span><span class="highlight">disturbance</span>, such as a fire. This kind of <span class="highlight">stability</span> is also called <span class="highlight">resilience</span>. In that case, <span class="highlight">climax</span> communities would be the most <span class="highlight">fragile</span> and the <span class="highlight">least</span><span class="highlight">stable</span>, since they can <span class="highlight">require</span> hundreds of years to return to the <span class="highlight">climax</span><span class="highlight">state</span>.</p><p><span class="highlight">Even</span> the kind of <span class="highlight">stability</span> defined as simple <span class="highlight">lack</span> of change is not always <span class="highlight">associated</span> with <span class="highlight">maximum</span><span class="highlight">diversity</span>. At <span class="highlight">least</span> in <span class="highlight">temperate</span> zones, <span class="highlight">maximum</span><span class="highlight">diversity</span> is often found in mid-successional stages, not in the <span class="highlight">climax</span><span class="highlight">community</span>. Once a redwood forest matures, for example, the kinds of <span class="highlight">species</span> and the number of individuals growing on the forest floor are reduced. In general, <span class="highlight">diversity</span>, by itself, does not ensure <span class="highlight">stability</span>. Mathematical models of ecosystems <span class="highlight">likewise</span> suggest that <span class="highlight">diversity</span> does not <span class="highlight"><span class="question8">guarantee</span></span><span class="highlight">ecosystem</span><span class="highlight">stability</span>-just the <span class="highlight">opposite</span>, in fact. A more <span class="highlight">complicated</span> system is, in general, more likely than a simple system to <span class="highlight">break</span> down. <span class="question9">A fifteen-speed racing bicycle is more likely to <span class="highlight">break</span> down than a child's tricycle.</span></p><p><span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>Ecologists are especially interested to know what factors <span class="highlight">contribute</span> to the <span class="highlight">resilience</span> of communities because <span class="highlight">climax</span> communities all over the world are being <span class="highlight">severely</span> damaged or destroyed by human activities. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>The <span class="highlight">destruction</span> caused by the <span class="highlight">volcanic</span><span class="highlight">explosion</span> of <span class="highlight">Mount</span> St. Helens, in the northwestern United States, for example, <span class="question10">pales</span> in <span class="highlight">comparison</span> to the <span class="highlight">destruction</span> caused by humans. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>We need to know what aspects of a <span class="highlight">community</span> are most important to the <span class="highlight">community</span>'s <span class="highlight">resistance</span> to <span class="highlight">destruction</span>, as well as its recovery. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p><p><span class="question11">Many ecologists now think that the <span class="highlight">relative</span> long-term <span class="highlight">stability</span> of <span class="highlight">climax</span> communities comes not from <span class="highlight">diversity</span> but from the "patchiness" of the environment, an environment that varies from place to place supports more kinds of organisms than an environment that is <span class="highlight">uniform</span>.</span> A <span class="highlight">local</span><span class="highlight">population</span> that goes <span class="highlight">extinct</span> is quickly replaced by immigrants from an <span class="highlight"><span class="question12">adjacent</span></span><span class="highlight">community</span>. <span class="highlight">Even</span> if the new <span class="highlight">population</span> is of a different <span class="highlight">species</span>, it can <span class="highlight">approximately</span> fill the <span class="highlight">niche</span> vacated by the <span class="highlight">extinct</span><span class="highlight">population</span> and keep the food web <span class="highlight">intact</span>.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">particular</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. natural</p><p>B. final</p><p>C. specific</p><p>D. complex</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C particular: Special, specific. A is natural; B is final; C is specific; D is complex. According to the word meaning, the answer is C's specific. The former says assemble them flexibly, and the more changeable ones are that each community is different and emphasizes particularity. And the second half said that the specific structure depends on the specific history, particular and specific echoes, so the answer is obviously C.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 1, which of the following is NOT true of climax communities?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They occur at the end of a succession.</p><p>B. They last longer than any other type of community.</p><p>C. The numbers of plants in them and the mix of species do not change.</p><p>D. They remain stable for at least 500 years at a time.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>B Climax communities are targeted to the third sentence and the last sentence: The first community in a succession is called a pioneer community, while the long-lived community at the end of succession is called a climax community. Climax communities own change But over periods of time greater than about 500 years. The third sentence shows A pair, not selected; the last sentence shows that D is not selected; B did not say it directly, saying that other communities have 1-500 years of variation, and climax is at least 500. Years, indicating that climax is longer, B is right, not selected. And the last sentence also said that climax is changing, and C said it is against the election.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 2, which of the following principles of ecosystems can be learned by studying a pond?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Ecosystem properties change more slowly than individuals in the system.</p><p>B. The stability of an ecosystem tends to change as individuals are replaced.</p><p>C. Individual organisms are stable from one year to the next.</p><p>D. A change in the members of an organism does not affect an ecosystem's properties.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A. The paragraph is very short. After reading it quickly, we find that the last sentence is the conclusion: We can say that the properties of an ecosystem are more stable than the individual organisms that compose the ecosystem. Stability, A is the answer. The other three options are not mentioned.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 3, ecologists once believed that which of the following illustrated the most stable ecosystems?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Pioneer communities</p><p>B. Climax communities</p><p>C. Single-crop farmlands</p><p>D. Successional plant communities</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B. Using ecologists as a key word to locate the first two sentences of this paragraph, said that ecologists believe that the more species the ecosystem is, the more stable it is. Then, as an example, the authors climax communities: They believed that the greater the diversity the more stable the ecosystem. Support for this idea came from the observation that long-lasting climax communities usually have more complex food webs and more species diversity than Pioneer communities. Explain that ecologists believe that climax communities are the most stable, and answer B.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, why is the question of ecosystem stability complicated?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The reasons for ecosystem change are not always clear.</p><p>B. Ecologists often confuse the word "stability" with the word "resilience."</p><p>C. The exact meaning of the word "stability" is debated by ecologists.</p><p>D. There are many different answers to ecological questions.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C With the question of ecosystem stability as the key word, locate the first sentence of this paragraph: The first problem is that ecologists do not all agree what "stability" means. Says the ecologists are still controversial about what the stability of the ecosystem is, C It is faithful rewriting of the original text.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, which of the following is true of climax communities?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They are more resilient than pioneer communities.</p><p>B. They can be considered both the most and the least stable communities.</p><p>C. They are stable because they recover quickly after major disturbances.</p><p>D. They are the most resilient communities because they change the least over time.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B. The climax communities were mentioned in two places: In that case, the climax community would be considered the most stable, since, by definition, it changes the least over time. In that case, climax communities would be the most fragile and The least stable, since they can require hundreds of years to return to the climax state. Because ecologists have two opinions on what constitutes stability: from the standpoint of invariance, climax is the most stable; with rapid recovery From this point of view, climax is the most unstable, so climax is both stable and unstable. B clearly stated that in two aspects, all other options mentioned only one aspect.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the following can be inferred from paragraph 5 about redwood forests?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They become less stable as they mature.</p><p>B. They support many species when they reach climax.</p><p>C. They are found in temperate zones.</p><p>D. They have reduced diversity during mid-successional stages.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C Redwood forest is used as a keyword to locate the third sentence of the original text. In fact, this redwood is a specific example of the preceding sentence: At least in temperate zones, maximum diversity is often found in mid-successional stages, not in the climax community. The sentence says at least in the temperate zone, mid is the most stable, not climax, followed by an example of redwood, it can be inferred that redwood is a temperate plant, C is the answer. A/B/D is contrary to the original meaning, and B and D basically mean the same, and they are not right.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question8">guarantee</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. increase</p><p>B. ensure</p><p>C. favor</p><p>D. complicate</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>B <span class="question8">guarantee</span>: Guarantee, <span class="question8">guarantee</span>. A is an increase; B is a <span class="question8">guarantee</span>; C is a favor, like; D is a make ... complex. According to the word meaning, B is the correct answer. Corresponding to Mathematical models of ecosystems former suggest that diversity does not <span class="question8">guarantee</span> shelf stability - just the opposite, in fact. There is a similar in this sentence, which shows that it is analogous to the previous sentence. The former sentence says that diversity does not ensure stability. The content is almost the same as the previous sentence, except that the verb is replaced, so the meaning of <span class="question8">guarantee</span> is assured.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>In paragraph 5, why does the author provide the information that "<span class="highlight">A fifteen-speed racing bicycle is more likely to break down than a child's tricycle</span>"?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To illustrate a general principle about the stability of systems by using an everyday example</p><p>B. To demonstrate that an understanding of stability in ecosystems can be applied to help understand stability in other situations</p><p>C. To make a comparison that supports the claim that, in general, stability increases with diversity</p><p>D. To provide an example that contradicts mathematical models of ecosystems</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A fifteen-speed racing bicycle is more likely to break down than a child's tricycle A"><p>The function of the brackets is to explain the text before the brackets: A more complicated system is, in general, more likely than a simple system to break down. The example of the tricycle, the tricycle is obviously a simple race car, so it is to support the previous article, A correct, C just say the opposite, the other did not say.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question10">pales</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. increases proportionally</p><p>B. differs</p><p>C. loses significance</p><p>D. is common</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" C"><p>C pale: pale, so that it is colorless. A is proportional growth; B is different; C is losing importance; D is common and common. According to the word meaning, C is the correct answer. Corresponding to the original The destruction caused by the volcanic explosion of Mount St. Helens, in the northwestern United States, for example, <span class="question10">pales</span> in comparison to the destruction caused by humans. The word before the sentence said that many climax communities have been destroyed by humans, that is, Emphasis on people's bad words is very serious. To give an example, the destruction of the St. Helens volcano shipbuilding has not been seriously damaged by human activities, so the C option lose significance is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incurred choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Ecologists now think that the stability of an environment is a result of diversity rather than patchiness.</p><p>B. Patchy environments that vary from place to place do not often have high species diversity.</p><p>C. Uniform environments cannot be climax communities because they do not support as many types of organisms as patchy environments.</p><p>D. A patchy environment is thought to increase stability because it is able to support a wide variety of organisms.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D : The structure of the original text is that the long-term stability of the ecosystem is not due to diversity, but to patchiness, which is explained in terms of species. A is wrong; B is wrong, because the original does not say that the patchiness and the diversity are contradictory; the C is wrong because the original compares the patchiness and the uniform, and the C directly compares the patchiness and the climax, and steals the concept; D is correct, and the attention to the original looks like There is no obvious causality, so it may be possible to look at the relationship between sentences only to exclude D, but the latter half of the original sentence is an interpretation of patchiness, so there is no obvious causal relationship.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question12">adjacent</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. foreign</p><p>B. stable</p><p>C. fluid</p><p>D. neighboring</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" D"><p>D,<span class="question12">adjacent</span>: Adjacent. A is foreign; B is stable; C is mobile; D is <span class="question12">adjacent</span>. According to the word meaning, D is the correct answer. The original local population that goes extinct is quickly replaced by immigrants from an <span class="question12">adjacent</span> community. When the local population is extinguished, it is supplemented by where the community comes from. The only possible alternatives are foreign and neighboring. These two options can be substituted into the original text. In addition to knowing the meaning of the word, it can also be considered that neighboring communities are more likely to be quickly replenished, and the scope of the outside is too large to be correct.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>In fact, damage to the environment by humans is often much more severe than damage by natural events and processes..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B According to human judgment in the sentence to be inserted, A/B/C is possible. The natural process of natural events and processes is synonymous with the St. Helens volcanic eruption in the second sentence, so B/C may be correct. However, according to the principle of the first theoretical example, the correct answer is that B is not C.</p></div></div><div id="question14" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>The process of succession and the stability of a climax community can change over time.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.The changes that occur in an ecosystem from the pioneer to the climax community can be seen in one human generation.</p><p>B.A high degree of species diversity does not always result in a stable ecosystem.</p><p>C.Disagreements over the meaning of the term "stability" make it difficult to identify the most stable ecosystems.</p><p>D.Ecologists agree that climax communities are the most stable types of ecosystems.</p><p>E.The level of resilience in a plant community contributes to its long-term stability.</p><p>F.The resilience of climax communities makes them resistant to destruction caused by humans.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="BCE"><p>The B.C.E The changes are contrary to the last sentence in the first paragraph of the original text. The A high degree option corresponds to the first sentence of the third and fifth paragraphs of the original text, and the last sentence of the fourth paragraph is correct. The level option corresponds to the first sentence of the sixth paragraph of the original text, and the second and third sentence of the fourth paragraph is correct. The Ecologists option is contrary to the first sentence in the fourth paragraph of the third paragraph of the original text. The Disagreements option corresponds to the second sentence of the fourth paragraph of the original text, correct. The resilience option was not originally described. The sixth paragraph of the original text says that it is not clear why the biomes resist damage.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
