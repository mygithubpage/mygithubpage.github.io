            <span class="highlight">Architecture</span> is the art and science of designing structures that organize and <span class="highlight">enclose</span> <span class="highlight">space</span> for <span class="highlight">practical</span> and <span class="highlight">symbolic</span> purposes. Because <span class="highlight">architecture</span> grows out of human needs and aspirations, it clearly communicates cultural values. Of all the <span class="highlight">visual</span> arts, <span class="highlight">architecture</span> affects our lives most directly for it determines the <span class="highlight">character</span> of the human environment in <span class="highlight">major</span> ways.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="highlight">Architecture</span> is a three-dimensional form. It utilizes <span class="highlight">space</span>, <span class="highlight">mass</span>, <span class="highlight">texture</span>, <span class="highlight">line</span>, light, and color. To be <span class="highlight">architecture</span>, a building must achieve a working <span class="highlight">harmony</span> with a <span class="highlight">variety</span> of elements. Humans instinctively seek structures that will <span class="highlight">shelter</span> and <span class="highlight"><span class="question3">enhance</span></span> their way of life. It is the work of architects to create buildings that are not <span class="highlight">simply</span> constructions but also <span class="highlight">offer</span> inspiration and <span class="highlight">delight</span>. Buildings <span class="highlight">contribute</span> to human life when they provide <span class="highlight">shelter</span>, <span class="highlight">enrich</span> <span class="highlight">space</span>, <span class="highlight">complement</span> their site, suit the <span class="highlight">climate</span>, and are <span class="highlight">economically</span> <span class="highlight"><span class="question2">feasible</span></span>. The <span class="highlight">client</span> who pays for the building and defines its <span class="highlight">function</span> is an important member of the architectural team. The <span class="highlight">mediocre</span> design of many <span class="highlight">contemporary</span> buildings can be traced to both clients and architects.</p>
          <p><span class="question4">In order for the structure to achieve the size and strength necessary to meet its purpose, <span class="highlight">architecture</span> employs methods of support that, because they are based on <span class="highlight">physical</span> laws, have changed little since people first discovered them-<span class="highlight">even</span> while building materials have changed <span class="highlight">dramatically</span>.</span> The world's architectural structures have also been <span class="question5">devised</span> in relation to the <span class="highlight">objective</span> limitations of materials. Structures can be analyzed in terms of how they <span class="highlight">deal</span> with <span class="highlight">downward</span> forces created by <span class="highlight">gravity</span>. They are designed to <span class="highlight">withstand</span> the forces of compression (pushing together), <span class="highlight">tension</span> (pulling apart), bending, or a <span class="highlight">combination</span> of these in different parts of the structure.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="highlight">Even</span>
            <span class="highlight">development</span> in <span class="highlight">architecture</span> has been the result of <span class="highlight">major</span> <span class="highlight">technological</span> changes. Materials and methods of <span class="highlight">construction</span> are <span class="highlight"><span class="question6">integral</span></span> parts of the design of <span class="highlight">architecture</span> structures. In earlier times it was necessary to design <span class="highlight">structural</span> systems <span class="highlight">suitable</span> for the materials that were <span class="highlight">available</span>, such as wood, stone, brick. Today technology has progressed to the point where it is possible to invent new building materials to suit the type of structure desired. <span class="highlight">Enormous</span> changes in materials and techniques of <span class="highlight">construction</span> <span class="highlight">within</span> the last few generations have made it possible to <span class="highlight">enclose</span> <span class="highlight">space</span> with much greater <span class="highlight">ease</span> and speed and with a <span class="highlight">minimum</span> of <span class="highlight">material</span>. Progress in this area can be measured by the <span class="highlight">difference</span> in weight between buildings built now and those of <span class="highlight">comparable</span> size built one hundred years ago.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A">
            </span>Modern architectural forms generally have three <span class="highlight">separate</span> components <span class="highlight">comparable</span> to elements of the human body: a supporting <span class="highlight">skeleton</span> or <span class="highlight">frame</span>, an outer skin enclosing the <span class="highlight">interior</span> spaces, and equipment, <span class="highlight">similar</span> to the body's <span class="highlight">vital</span> organs and systems. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>The equipment includes plumbing, electrical wiring, hot water, and air-conditioning. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>Of <span class="highlight">course</span> in early <span class="highlight">architecture</span>-such as igloos and <span class="highlight">adobe</span> structures-there was no such equipment, and the <span class="highlight">skeleton</span> and skin were often one. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p>
          <p>Much of the world's great <span class="highlight">architecture</span> has been constructed of stone because of its beauty, <span class="highlight">permanence</span>, and <span class="highlight">availability</span>. In the past, whole cities grew from the <span class="highlight"><span class="question10">arduous</span></span> task of cutting and piling stone upon. Some of the world's finest stone <span class="highlight">architecture</span> can be seen in the ruins of the <span class="highlight">ancient</span> Inca city of Machu Picchu high in the eastern Andes Mountains of Peru. The <span class="question11">doorways and windows</span> are made possible by placing over the open spaces thick stone beams that support the weight from above. A <span class="highlight">structural</span> invention had to be made before the <span class="highlight">physical</span> limitations of stone could be <span class="highlight">overcome</span> and new architectural forms could be created. That invention was the <span class="highlight">arch</span>, a curved structure originally made of <span class="highlight">separate</span> stone or brick segments. The <span class="highlight">arch</span> was used by the early cultures of the <span class="highlight">Mediterranean</span> area <span class="highlight">chiefly</span> for <span class="highlight">underground</span> drains, but it was the Romans who first developed and used the <span class="highlight">arch</span> extensively in aboveground structures. Roman builders perfected the semicircular <span class="highlight">arch</span> made of <span class="highlight">separate</span> blocks of stone. As a <span class="highlight">method</span> of spanning <span class="highlight">space</span>, the <span class="highlight">arch</span> can support greater weight than a <span class="highlight">horizontal</span> <span class="highlight">beam</span>. It works in compression to <span class="highlight">divert</span> the weight above it out to the sides, where the weight is <span class="highlight">borne</span> by the <span class="highlight">vertical</span> elements on either side of the <span class="highlight">arch</span>. The <span class="highlight">arch</span> is among the many important <span class="highlight">structural</span> breakthroughs that have characterized <span class="highlight">architecture</span> <span class="highlight">throughout</span> the centuries.</p>

No long limits is consistent with this sentence. Correctly select B: The current technology has progressed to the point where it is possible to invent new building materials to suit the type of structure desired. The three C materials are positioned to the enumeration part of the third sentence, but it is clear that they should be the main building materials of the past. ,not now.

The equipment image should be a vital organs and systems, not a component: Modern architectural forms generally..., and equipment, similar to the body's vital organs. And systems. B uses early building as a key word to locate in the last sentence of the article. Skeleton and skin are the same, so it is different from people: Of course in early architecture-such as igloos and adobe structures-there was no such equipment, and the skeleton And skin was often one. C's change did not say; D is correct because the original text says that the modern building is like the human body (the same as the A option, corresponding to the first sentence).
