Because <span class="highlight">architecture</span> grows out of human needs and aspirations, it clearly communicates cultural values. Of all the <span class="highlight">visual</span> arts, <span class="highlight">architecture</span> affects our lives most directly for it determines the <span class="highlight">character</span> of the human environment in <span class="highlight">major</span> ways.</p><p><span class="highlight">Architecture</span> is a three-dimensional form. It utilizes <span class="highlight">space</span>, <span class="highlight">mass</span>, <span class="highlight">texture</span>, <span class="highlight">line</span>, light, and color. To be <span class="highlight">architecture</span>, a building must achieve a working <span class="highlight">harmony</span> with a <span class="highlight">variety</span> of elements. Humans instinctively seek structures that will <span class="highlight">shelter</span> and <span class="highlight"><span class="question3">enhance</span></span> their way of life. It is the work of architects to create buildings that are not <span class="highlight">simply</span> constructions but also <span class="highlight">offer</span> inspiration and <span class="highlight">delight</span>. Buildings <span class="highlight">contribute</span> to human life when they provide <span class="highlight">shelter</span>, <span class="highlight">enrich</span><span class="highlight">space</span>, <span class="highlight">complement</span> their site, suit the <span class="highlight">climate</span>, and are <span class="highlight">economically</span><span class="highlight"><span class="question2">feasible</span></span>. The <span class="highlight">client</span> who pays for the building and defines its <span class="highlight">function</span> is an important member of the architectural team. The <span class="highlight">mediocre</span> design of many <span class="highlight">contemporary</span> buildings can be traced to both clients and architects.</p><p><span class="question4">In order for the structure to achieve the size and strength necessary to meet its purpose, <span class="highlight">architecture</span> employs methods of support that, because they are based on <span class="highlight">physical</span> laws, have changed little since people first discovered them-<span class="highlight">even</span> while building materials have changed <span class="highlight">dramatically</span>.</span> The world's architectural structures have also been <span class="question5">devised</span> in relation to the <span class="highlight">objective</span> limitations of materials. Structures can be analyzed in terms of how they <span class="highlight">deal</span> with <span class="highlight">downward</span> forces created by <span class="highlight">gravity</span>. They are designed to <span class="highlight">withstand</span> the forces of compression (pushing together), <span class="highlight">tension</span> (pulling apart), bending, or a <span class="highlight">combination</span> of these in different parts of the structure.</p><p><span class="highlight">Even</span><span class="highlight">development</span> in <span class="highlight">architecture</span> has been the result of <span class="highlight">major</span><span class="highlight">technological</span> changes. Materials and methods of <span class="highlight">construction</span> are <span class="highlight"><span class="question6">integral</span></span> parts of the design of <span class="highlight">architecture</span> structures. In earlier times it was necessary to design <span class="highlight">structural</span> systems <span class="highlight">suitable</span> for the materials that were <span class="highlight">available</span>, such as wood, stone, brick. Today technology has progressed to the point where it is possible to invent new building materials to suit the type of structure desired. <span class="highlight">Enormous</span> changes in materials and techniques of <span class="highlight">construction</span><span class="highlight">within</span> the last few generations have made it possible to <span class="highlight">enclose</span><span class="highlight">space</span> with much greater <span class="highlight">ease</span> and speed and with a <span class="highlight">minimum</span> of <span class="highlight">material</span>. Progress in this area can be measured by the <span class="highlight">difference</span> in weight between buildings built now and those of <span class="highlight">comparable</span> size built one hundred years ago.</p><p><span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>Modern architectural forms generally have three <span class="highlight">separate</span> components <span class="highlight">comparable</span> to elements of the human body: a supporting <span class="highlight">skeleton</span> or <span class="highlight">frame</span>, an outer skin enclosing the <span class="highlight">interior</span> spaces, and equipment, <span class="highlight">similar</span> to the body's <span class="highlight">vital</span> organs and systems. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>The equipment includes plumbing, electrical wiring, hot water, and air-conditioning. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>Of <span class="highlight">course</span> in early <span class="highlight">architecture</span>-such as igloos and <span class="highlight">adobe</span> structures-there was no such equipment, and the <span class="highlight">skeleton</span> and skin were often one. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p><p>Much of the world's great <span class="highlight">architecture</span> has been constructed of stone because of its beauty, <span class="highlight">permanence</span>, and <span class="highlight">availability</span>. In the past, whole cities grew from the <span class="highlight"><span class="question10">arduous</span></span> task of cutting and piling stone upon. Some of the world's finest stone <span class="highlight">architecture</span> can be seen in the ruins of the <span class="highlight">ancient</span> Inca city of Machu Picchu high in the eastern Andes Mountains of Peru. The <span class="question11">doorways and windows</span> are made possible by placing over the open spaces thick stone beams that support the weight from above. A <span class="highlight">structural</span> invention had to be made before the <span class="highlight">physical</span> limitations of stone could be <span class="highlight">overcome</span> and new architectural forms could be created. That invention was the <span class="highlight">arch</span>, a curved structure originally made of <span class="highlight">separate</span> stone or brick segments. The <span class="highlight">arch</span> was used by the early cultures of the <span class="highlight">Mediterranean</span> area <span class="highlight">chiefly</span> for <span class="highlight">underground</span> drains, but it was the Romans who first developed and used the <span class="highlight">arch</span> extensively in aboveground structures. Roman builders perfected the semicircular <span class="highlight">arch</span> made of <span class="highlight">separate</span> blocks of stone. As a <span class="highlight">method</span> of spanning <span class="highlight">space</span>, the <span class="highlight">arch</span> can support greater weight than a <span class="highlight">horizontal</span><span class="highlight">beam</span>. It works in compression to <span class="highlight">divert</span> the weight above it out to the sides, where the weight is <span class="highlight">borne</span> by the <span class="highlight">vertical</span> elements on either side of the <span class="highlight">arch</span>. The <span class="highlight">arch</span> is among the many important <span class="highlight">structural</span> breakthroughs that have characterized <span class="highlight">architecture</span><span class="highlight">throughout</span> the centuries.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 1, all of the following statements about architecture are true EXCEPT:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Architecture is visual art.</p><p>B. Architecture reflects the cultural values of its creators.</p><p>C. Architecture has both artistic and scientific dimensions.</p><p>D. Architecture has an indirect effect on life.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D EXCEPT problem exclusion method, using visual art as a keyword to locate the last sentence of this paragraph, A right, not selected; D option and A option in the same sentence, indirect effect and directly the original word in the opposite, wrong, choose: Of all the Visual arts, architecture affects our lives most directly for it determines the character of the human environment in major ways. Using the keywords of cultural values to locate the second sentence, B pairs, not selecting: Because architecture grows out of human needs and aspirations, It clearly communicates cultural values. Using artistic and scientific dimensions as a key word to locate the first sentence, C pairs, not selecting: Architecture is the art and science of designing structures that organize and enclose space for practical and symbolic purposes.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question2">feasible</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. in existence</p><p>B. without question</p><p>C. achievable</p><p>D. most likely</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" C"><p>C, <span class="question2">feasible</span>: Feasible. A is extant; B is no doubt; C is complete; D is most likely. According to the word meaning, the correct answer is C. Corresponding to the original Buildings contribute to human life when they provide when they provide, enrich space, complement their site, suit the climate, and are economically <span class="question2">feasible</span>. The original said that several advantages of the building, such as providing places sheltering from wind and rain, enriching the space, economy What about it is definitely a positive word. A is neutral and wrong. B is not a problem. Although it is positive but it is too large, it is not selected, and C is correct. D is very likely to be positive, but its degree is insufficient and it is not selected.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question3">enhance</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. protect</p><p>B. improve</p><p>C. organize</p><p>D. match</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>B, <span class="question3">enhance</span>: increase, increase. The increase of the corresponding B option is improved. A is protection; C is organization; D is match. A option is for protection; C options for organization; D options for matching. Corresponding to the original Humans instinctively seek structures that will shelter and <span class="question3">enhance</span> their way of life. This sentence says: People instinctively seek structures that can shelter and <span class="question3">enhance</span> their lifestyle. In this sentence, <span class="question3">enhance</span> and asylum juxtaposed, after substituting the four options, it was discovered that A was excluded, and shelter meaning repeated, not selected; after the CD was substituted, the way of life was not suitable; B was most consistent with this parallel structure, and Semantic coherence after substitution, matching is also appropriate.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Unchanging physical laws have limited the size and strength of buildings that can be made with materials discovered long ago.</p><p>B. Building materials have changed in order to increase architectural size and strength, but physical laws of structure have not changed.</p><p>C. When people first started to build, the structural methods used to provide strength and size were inadequate because they were not based on physical laws.</p><p>D. Unlike building materials, the methods of support used in architecture have not changed over time because they are based on physical laws.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D In order for is just an adverbial statement of a table, not very important, for a moment to give up not to see; at the same time, the part of the insert does not look. The whole sentence becomes: The methods used by architects are constant, despite the great changes in building materials. The main logic is turning. A did not say that the original construction material had changed a lot, and law did not limit the size and strength, so it was completely wrong; B was wrong in the adverbial part of the in order, the original did not say; C said not based on physical laws and the original Wrong; D correct.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question5">devised</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. combined</p><p>B. created</p><p>C. introduced</p><p>D. suggested</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>B devise: Design, invention. A is the bond; B is the creation, the establishment; C is the introduction; D is the recommendation. According to the word meaning, B is the correct answer. The sentence says that the world's architectural structures have also been <span class="question5">devised</span> in relation to the visibility limitations of materials. The sentence says that the construction of the world is also based on the limitations of building materials. Because there is also, it is followed by the previous sentence. The preceding sentence is The above question has already been analyzed. It is said that the architect adopted a variety of methods to meet the requirements, indicating that the construction of the building should be a process from scratch. Therefore, the B option create is most suitable.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question6">integral</span></span>" is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. essential</p><p>B. variable</p><p>C. practical</p><p>D. independent</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" A"><p>A <span class="question6">integral</span>: complete, necessary. A is basic and necessary; B is volatile; C is practical and practical; D is independent. According to the meaning of the word, A correctly corresponds to the original. Materials and construction methods are the parts of the building, and the substitution options also know that it should be an important part of A. B can be Changed C does not depend on the facts. D Although the meaning of independence is basic, it is a clear violation of the original textual context. Building materials and methods should influence each other and cannot be independent.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, which of the following is true about materials used in the construction of buildings?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Because new building materials are hard to find, construction techniques have changed very little from past generations.</p><p>B. The availability of suitable building materials no longer limits the types of structures that may be built.</p><p>C. The primary building materials that are available today are wood, stone, and brick.</p><p>D. Architects in earlier times did not have enough building materials to enclose large spaces.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B. The entire section devoted a lot of space to the discussion of building materials. It is recommended that exclusion be used. A's new building material is positioned in the fourth sentence, but the hard to find option is obviously contradictory to this statement, and the same error is found in the B option. No long limits is consistent with this sentence. Correctly select B: The current technology has progressed to the point where it is possible to invent new building materials to suit the type of structure desired. The three C materials are positioned to the enumeration part of the third sentence, but it is clear that they should be the main building materials of the past. ,not now. In earlier times it was necessary to design structural systems suitable for the materials that were available, such as wood, stone, brick. D did not say that the option was not mentioned in the original, it looked like the penultimate sentence, but the meaning was different.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>In paragraph 4, what does the author imply about modern buildings?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They occupy much less space than buildings constructed one hundred years ago.</p><p>B. They are not very different from the building of a few generations ago.</p><p>C. They weigh less in relation to their size than buildings constructed one hundred years ago.</p><p>D. They take a long time to build as a result of their complex construction methods.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C buildings with modern buildings keyword positioning to the last sentence built now: Progress in this area can be measured by the difference in weight between buildings built now and those of comparable size built one hundred years ago. Said to compare now and one hundred years The weight of buildings of similar size before we can find the progress made in building technology, that is, the light of the previous reappearance, so the answer is C, the other did not say.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the following correctly characterizes the relationship between the human body and architecture that is described in paragraph 5?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Complex equipment inside buildings is the one element in modern architecture that resembles a component of the human body.</p><p>B. The components in early buildings were similar to three particular elements of the human body.</p><p>C. Modern buildings have components that are as likely to change as the human body is.</p><p>D. In general, modern buildings more closely resemble the human body than earlier buildings do.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D This section compares the structure of the building with the structure of the human body and finds three things in common. In the elimination method, A uses the keyword keyword to position the last sentence of the first sentence. The equipment image should be a vital organs and systems, not a component: Modern architectural forms generally..., and equipment, similar to the body's vital organs. And systems. B uses early building as a key word to locate in the last sentence of the article. Skeleton and skin are the same, so it is different from people: Of course in early architecture-such as igloos and adobe structures-there was no such equipment, and the skeleton And skin was often one. C's change did not say; D is correct because the original text says that the modern building is like the human body (the same as the A option, corresponding to the first sentence). The skeleton and skin of the previous building are one (corresponding to the same sentence as B). ) So modern architecture is more human than the previous building.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question10">arduous</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. difficult</p><p>B. necessary</p><p>C. skilled</p><p>D. shared</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" A"><p>A <span class="question10">arduous</span>: Difficult, difficult. A is difficult; B is necessary; C is skilled and skilled; D is shared. According to the word meaning, A option is correct. According to the original In the past, the whole cities grew up from the <span class="question10">arduous</span> task of cutting and piling stone upon the original. In the past, the whole city was made by cutting and stacking stones. This task must be difficult, and it seems to be a skill to substitute it into the original text. And it is necessary to rely on it, but D is not right to share. If cutting is a tricky thing, stacking should not be necessary. Be careful not to think of it. Is stacking and cutting stone necessary to build a city? Can use wood and other building materials, so necessary, too, correct answer.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the author include a description of how the "<span class="highlight"><span class="question11">doorways and windows</span></span>" of Machu Picchu were constructed?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To indicate that the combined skeletons and skins of the stone buildings of Machu Picchu were similar to igloos and adobe structures</p><p>B. To indicate the different kinds of stones that had to be cut to build Machu Picchu</p><p>C. To provide an illustration of the kind of construction that was required before arches were invented</p><p>D. To explain how ancient builders reduced the amount of time necessary to construct buildings from stone</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" C"><p>The purpose of the function, read the words <span class="question11">doorways and windows</span>, saying that the doors and windows is formed by placing the stone beam on the top of the space, read the previous sentence is also an example, it is not the answer, look down: A The invention had to be made before the physical limitations of stone could be overcome and new architectural forms could be created. There was a new invention that had to be overcome to overcome the obstacles that the stone brought to the building. According to the original, doors and windows must be on the open space supported by the stone beams. This is a solution before the new invention, so the answer is C.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 6, which of the following statements is true of the arch?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The Romans were the first people to use the stone arch.</p><p>B. The invention of the arch allowed new architectural forms to be developed.</p><p>C. The arch worked by distributing the structural load of a building toward the center of the arch.</p><p>D. The Romans followed earlier practices in their use of arches.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B, with the arch keyword located to the invention was the arch sentence, followed by the sentence that was read: A structural invention had to be made before the physical limitations of stone could be overcome and new architectural forms could be created. The invention was the arch, a curved structure originally made of separate stone or brick segments. To overcome obstacles that stone brings to the building, there must be a new invention. This invention is arch, so the advent of arch makes other building methods possible. correct. The Romans were the first to use arch extensively in the construction of the earth. They were not the first to use the arch, the A mistake, nor the method of follow- ing the predecessors, D-error; the pressure was dispersed, divert, not concentrated at the midpoint, C said anti.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>However, some modern architectural designs, such as those using folded plates of concreter or air-inflated structures, are again unifying skeleton and skin..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>Dbid and again unifying both indicate that the correct insertion point must be said before the skeleton and skin are combined. This can echo the again of the sentence (again), so A and B are incorrect; such equipment after C refers to the contents of C before. The transition is tight and not suitable for inserting sentences; so D is the correct answer, often one and again.</p></div></div><div id="question14" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>Architecture uses forms and space to express cultural values.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.Architects seek to create buildings that are both visually appealing and well suited for human use.</p><p>B.Over the course of the history of building, innovations in material and methods of construction have given architects ever greater freedom to express themselves.</p><p>C.Throughout history buildings have been constructed like human bodies, needing distinct "organ" systems in order to function.</p><p>D.Both clients and architects are responsible for the mediocre designs of some modern buildings.</p><p>E.Modern buildings tend to lack the beauty of ancient stone buildings such as those of Machu Picchu.</p><p>F.The discovery and use of the arch typifies the way in which architecture advances by developing more efficient types of structures.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="ABF"><p>The A.B.F Architects option corresponds to the first sentence of the full text, correct. The Over option corresponds to the third sentence of the fourth paragraph and the first sentence of the third paragraph, correct. The Throughout option is the opposite of the first sentence of the fifth paragraph. The Both option is a detail, not selected. The Modern option is wrong, because the original text did not say that the modern building does not look good and does not choose. The last sentence of the sixth paragraph of the discovery option is correct.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
