lecture in a <span class="highlight">film</span><span class="highlight">history</span> class.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="13.07" data-time="6.94">[00:06.94]</span>Professor: Okay, we've been discussing films in the 1920s and 30s, and how back then <span class="highlight">film</span> categories, as we know them today, had not yet been established. <span class="time" data-times="18.52" data-time="20.01">[00:20.01]</span>We said that by today's standards, many of the films of the 20s and 30s would be considered hybrids, that is, a mixture of styles that wouldn't exactly fit into any of today's categories, and in that <span class="highlight">context</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.52" data-time="38.53">[00:38.53]</span>Today we are going to talk about a film-maker who began making very <span class="highlight">unique</span> films in the late 1920s. <span class="time" data-times="4.86" data-time="46.05">[00:46.05]</span>He was French, and his name was Jean Painlevé. <span class="time" data-times="4.8" data-time="50.91">[00:50.91]</span>Jean Painlevé was born in 1902. <span class="time" data-times="3.41" data-time="55.71">[00:55.71]</span>He made his first <span class="highlight">film</span> in 1928. <span class="time" data-times="13.26" data-time="59.12">[00:59.12]</span>Now in a way, Painlevé's films <span class="highlight">conform</span> to norms of the 20s and 30s, that is, they don't fit very neatly into the categories we use to <span class="highlight">classify</span> films today. <span class="time" data-times="9.96" data-time="72.38">[01:12.38]</span>That said, <span class="highlight">even</span> by the standards of the 20s and 30s, Painlevé's films were <span class="highlight">unique</span>, a hybrid of styles.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="8.54" data-time="82.34">[01:22.34]</span>He had a <span class="highlight">special</span> way of fusing, or some people might say confusing, science and <span class="highlight">fiction</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.03" data-time="90.88">[01:30.88]</span>His films begin with facts, but then they become more and more fictional. <span class="time" data-times="4.42" data-time="97.91">[01:37.91]</span>They <span class="highlight">gradually</span> add more and more fictional elements. <span class="time" data-times="6.52" data-time="102.33">[01:42.33]</span>In fact, Painlevé was known for saying that science is <span class="highlight">fiction</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="9.13" data-time="108.85">[01:48.85]</span>Painlevé was a <span class="highlight">pioneer</span> in underwater film-making, and a lot of his short films focused on the <span class="highlight">aquatic</span> animal world. <span class="time" data-times="11.83" data-time="117.98">[01:57.98]</span>He liked to show small underwater creatures, displaying what seemed like <span class="highlight">familiar</span> human characteristics – what we think of as <span class="highlight">unique</span> to humans. <span class="time" data-times="6.48" data-time="129.81">[02:09.81]</span>He might take a clip of a <span class="highlight">mollusk</span> going up and down in the water and set it to music.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.87" data-time="136.29">[02:16.29]</span>You know, to make it look like the <span class="highlight">mollusk</span> were dancing to the music like a human being – that <span class="highlight">sort</span> of thing. <span class="time" data-times="9.61" data-time="143.16">[02:23.16]</span>But then he suddenly changed the <span class="highlight">image</span> or narration to <span class="highlight">remind</span> us how different the animals are, how unlike humans. <span class="time" data-times="11.05" data-time="152.77">[02:32.77]</span>He <span class="highlight">confused</span> his <span class="highlight">audience</span> in the way he portrayed the animals he filmed, mixing up on notions of the categories of humans and animals.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.37" data-time="163.82">[02:43.82]</span>The films make us a little uncomfortable at times because we are uncertain about what we are seeing. <span class="time" data-times="9.49" data-time="170.19">[02:50.19]</span>It gives him films an uncanny feature: the <span class="highlight">familiar</span> made unfamiliar, the normal made suspicious. <span class="time" data-times="3.97" data-time="179.68">[02:59.68]</span>He liked twists, he liked the unusual. <span class="time" data-times="11.58" data-time="183.65">[03:03.65]</span>In fact, one of his favorite sea animals was the seahorse because with seahorses, it's the <span class="highlight">male</span> that carries the eggs, and he thought that was great. <span class="time" data-times="5.59" data-time="195.23">[03:15.23]</span>His first and most <span class="highlight">celebrated</span> underwater <span class="highlight">film</span> is about the seahorse. <span class="time" data-times="2.18" data-time="200.82">[03:20.82]</span>Susan, you have a question?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.32" data-time="203">[03:23.00]</span>Student 1: But underwater film-making wasn't that unusual, was it? <span class="time" data-times="3.63" data-time="207.32">[03:27.32]</span>I mean, weren't there other people making movies underwater?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.81" data-time="210.95">[03:30.95]</span>Professor: Well, actually, it was <span class="highlight">pretty</span><span class="highlight">rare</span> at that time. <span class="time" data-times="3.6" data-time="214.76">[03:34.76]</span>I mean, we are talking about the early 1920s.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.03" data-time="218.36">[03:38.36]</span>Student 1: But what about Jacques Cousteau? <span class="time" data-times="4.34" data-time="220.39">[03:40.39]</span>Was he like an innovator, you know, with underwater <span class="highlight">photography</span> too?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.5" data-time="224.73">[03:44.73]</span>Professor: Ah, Jacques Cousteau. <span class="time" data-times="8.98" data-time="227.23">[03:47.23]</span>Well, Painlevé and Cousteau did both <span class="highlight">film</span> underwater, and they were both innovators, so you are right in that <span class="highlight">sense</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.99" data-time="236.21">[03:56.21]</span>But that's <span class="highlight">pretty</span> much where the similarities end. <span class="time" data-times="4.76" data-time="239.2">[03:59.20]</span>First of all, Painlevé was about 20 years ahead of Cousteau.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="12.38" data-time="243.96">[04:03.96]</span>And Cousteau's adventures were high-tech, with lots of <span class="highlight">fancy</span> equipment, whereas Painlevé kind of patched the equipment together as he needed it. <span class="time" data-times="12.91" data-time="256.34">[04:16.34]</span>Cousteau usually filmed large animals, usually in the open sea, whereas Painlevé generally filmed smaller animals, and he liked to <span class="highlight">film</span> in <span class="highlight">shallow</span> water.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="9.54" data-time="269.25">[04:29.25]</span>Uh, what else, oh well, the main <span class="highlight">difference</span> was that Cousteau <span class="highlight">simply</span> investigated and presented the facts – he didn't mix in <span class="highlight">fiction</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.55" data-time="278.79">[04:38.79]</span>He was a <span class="highlight">strict</span> documentarist. <span class="time" data-times="4.55" data-time="281.34">[04:41.34]</span>He set the <span class="highlight">standard</span> really for the nature <span class="highlight">documentary</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.63" data-time="285.89">[04:45.89]</span>Painlevé, on the other hand, as we said before, mixed in elements of <span class="highlight">fiction</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.46" data-time="291.52">[04:51.52]</span>And his films are much more <span class="highlight">artistic</span>, incorporating music as an important <span class="highlight">element</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.71" data-time="297.98">[04:57.98]</span>John, you have a question?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="10.87" data-time="300.69">[05:00.69]</span>Student 2: Well, maybe I shouldn't be asking this, but if Painlevé's films are so <span class="highlight">special</span>, so good, why <span class="highlight">haven</span>'t we ever heard of them? <span class="time" data-times="3.49" data-time="311.56">[05:11.56]</span>I mean, everyone's heard of Jacques Cousteau.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.35" data-time="315.05">[05:15.05]</span>Professor: Well, that's a <span class="highlight">fair</span> question. <span class="time" data-times="7.64" data-time="317.4">[05:17.40]</span>Uh, the short answer is that Painlevé's style just never caught on with the public. <span class="time" data-times="11.1" data-time="325.04">[05:25.04]</span>I mean, it probably goes back at <span class="highlight">least</span> in part to where we mentioned earlier, that people didn't know what to make of his films – they were <span class="highlight">confused</span> by them, <span class="time" data-times="9.19" data-time="336.14">[05:36.14]</span>whereas Cousteau's documentaries were very <span class="highlight">straightforward</span>, met people's expectations more than Painlevé's films did. <span class="time" data-times="4.2" data-time="345.33">[05:45.33]</span>But you are true: <span class="highlight">film</span><span class="highlight">history</span> is about what we know about them. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="349.53">[05:49.53]</span>And Painlevé is still highly respected in many circles.</p></p></article></section><div id="question"><div id="question1"><p>What is the main purpose of the lecture?</p><label class="my-label"><span>A.
