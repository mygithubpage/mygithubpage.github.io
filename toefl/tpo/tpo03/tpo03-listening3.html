lecture in a <span class="highlight">film</span><span class="highlight">history</span> class.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="13.07" data-time="6.94">[00:06.94]</span>Professor: Okay, we've been discussing films in the 1920s and 30s, and how back then <span class="highlight">film</span> categories, as we know them today, had not yet been established. <span class="time" data-times="18.52" data-time="20.01">[00:20.01]</span>We said that by today's standards, many of the films of the 20s and 30s would be considered hybrids, that is, a mixture of styles that wouldn't exactly fit into any of today's categories, and in that <span class="highlight">context</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.52" data-time="38.53">[00:38.53]</span>Today we are going to talk about a film-maker who began making very <span class="highlight">unique</span> films in the late 1920s. <span class="time" data-times="4.86" data-time="46.05">[00:46.05]</span>He was French, and his name was Jean Painlevé. <span class="time" data-times="4.8" data-time="50.91">[00:50.91]</span>Jean Painlevé was born in 1902. <span class="time" data-times="3.41" data-time="55.71">[00:55.71]</span>He made his first <span class="highlight">film</span> in 1928. <span class="time" data-times="13.26" data-time="59.12">[00:59.12]</span>Now in a way, Painlevé's films <span class="highlight">conform</span> to norms of the 20s and 30s, that is, they don't fit very neatly into the categories we use to <span class="highlight">classify</span> films today. <span class="time" data-times="9.96" data-time="72.38">[01:12.38]</span>That said, <span class="highlight">even</span> by the standards of the 20s and 30s, Painlevé's films were <span class="highlight">unique</span>, a hybrid of styles.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="8.54" data-time="82.34">[01:22.34]</span>He had a <span class="highlight">special</span> way of fusing, or some people might say confusing, science and <span class="highlight">fiction</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.03" data-time="90.88">[01:30.88]</span>His films begin with facts, but then they become more and more fictional. <span class="time" data-times="4.42" data-time="97.91">[01:37.91]</span>They <span class="highlight">gradually</span> add more and more fictional elements. <span class="time" data-times="6.52" data-time="102.33">[01:42.33]</span>In fact, Painlevé was known for saying that science is <span class="highlight">fiction</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="9.13" data-time="108.85">[01:48.85]</span>Painlevé was a <span class="highlight">pioneer</span> in underwater film-making, and a lot of his short films focused on the <span class="highlight">aquatic</span> animal world. <span class="time" data-times="11.83" data-time="117.98">[01:57.98]</span>He liked to show small underwater creatures, displaying what seemed like <span class="highlight">familiar</span> human characteristics – what we think of as <span class="highlight">unique</span> to humans. <span class="time" data-times="6.48" data-time="129.81">[02:09.81]</span>He might take a clip of a <span class="highlight">mollusk</span> going up and down in the water and set it to music.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.87" data-time="136.29">[02:16.29]</span>You know, to make it look like the <span class="highlight">mollusk</span> were dancing to the music like a human being – that <span class="highlight">sort</span> of thing. <span class="time" data-times="9.61" data-time="143.16">[02:23.16]</span>But then he suddenly changed the <span class="highlight">image</span> or narration to <span class="highlight">remind</span> us how different the animals are, how unlike humans. <span class="time" data-times="11.05" data-time="152.77">[02:32.77]</span>He <span class="highlight">confused</span> his <span class="highlight">audience</span> in the way he portrayed the animals he filmed, mixing up on notions of the categories of humans and animals.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.37" data-time="163.82">[02:43.82]</span>The films make us a little uncomfortable at times because we are uncertain about what we are seeing. <span class="time" data-times="9.49" data-time="170.19">[02:50.19]</span>It gives him films an uncanny feature: the <span class="highlight">familiar</span> made unfamiliar, the normal made suspicious. <span class="time" data-times="3.97" data-time="179.68">[02:59.68]</span>He liked twists, he liked the unusual. <span class="time" data-times="11.58" data-time="183.65">[03:03.65]</span>In fact, one of his favorite sea animals was the seahorse because with seahorses, it's the <span class="highlight">male</span> that carries the eggs, and he thought that was great. <span class="time" data-times="5.59" data-time="195.23">[03:15.23]</span>His first and most <span class="highlight">celebrated</span> underwater <span class="highlight">film</span> is about the seahorse. <span class="time" data-times="2.18" data-time="200.82">[03:20.82]</span>Susan, you have a question?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.32" data-time="203">[03:23.00]</span>Student 1: But underwater film-making wasn't that unusual, was it? <span class="time" data-times="3.63" data-time="207.32">[03:27.32]</span>I mean, weren't there other people making movies underwater?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.81" data-time="210.95">[03:30.95]</span>Professor: Well, actually, it was <span class="highlight">pretty</span><span class="highlight">rare</span> at that time. <span class="time" data-times="3.6" data-time="214.76">[03:34.76]</span>I mean, we are talking about the early 1920s.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.03" data-time="218.36">[03:38.36]</span>Student 1: But what about Jacques Cousteau? <span class="time" data-times="4.34" data-time="220.39">[03:40.39]</span>Was he like an innovator, you know, with underwater <span class="highlight">photography</span> too?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.5" data-time="224.73">[03:44.73]</span>Professor: Ah, Jacques Cousteau. <span class="time" data-times="8.98" data-time="227.23">[03:47.23]</span>Well, Painlevé and Cousteau did both <span class="highlight">film</span> underwater, and they were both innovators, so you are right in that <span class="highlight">sense</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.99" data-time="236.21">[03:56.21]</span>But that's <span class="highlight">pretty</span> much where the similarities end. <span class="time" data-times="4.76" data-time="239.2">[03:59.20]</span>First of all, Painlevé was about 20 years ahead of Cousteau.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="12.38" data-time="243.96">[04:03.96]</span>And Cousteau's adventures were high-tech, with lots of <span class="highlight">fancy</span> equipment, whereas Painlevé kind of patched the equipment together as he needed it. <span class="time" data-times="12.91" data-time="256.34">[04:16.34]</span>Cousteau usually filmed large animals, usually in the open sea, whereas Painlevé generally filmed smaller animals, and he liked to <span class="highlight">film</span> in <span class="highlight">shallow</span> water.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="9.54" data-time="269.25">[04:29.25]</span>Uh, what else, oh well, the main <span class="highlight">difference</span> was that Cousteau <span class="highlight">simply</span> investigated and presented the facts – he didn't mix in <span class="highlight">fiction</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.55" data-time="278.79">[04:38.79]</span>He was a <span class="highlight">strict</span> documentarist. <span class="time" data-times="4.55" data-time="281.34">[04:41.34]</span>He set the <span class="highlight">standard</span> really for the nature <span class="highlight">documentary</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.63" data-time="285.89">[04:45.89]</span>Painlevé, on the other hand, as we said before, mixed in elements of <span class="highlight">fiction</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.46" data-time="291.52">[04:51.52]</span>And his films are much more <span class="highlight">artistic</span>, incorporating music as an important <span class="highlight">element</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.71" data-time="297.98">[04:57.98]</span>John, you have a question?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="10.87" data-time="300.69">[05:00.69]</span>Student 2: Well, maybe I shouldn't be asking this, but if Painlevé's films are so <span class="highlight">special</span>, so good, why <span class="highlight">haven</span>'t we ever heard of them? <span class="time" data-times="3.49" data-time="311.56">[05:11.56]</span>I mean, everyone's heard of Jacques Cousteau.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.35" data-time="315.05">[05:15.05]</span>Professor: Well, that's a <span class="highlight">fair</span> question. <span class="time" data-times="7.64" data-time="317.4">[05:17.40]</span>Uh, the short answer is that Painlevé's style just never caught on with the public. <span class="time" data-times="11.1" data-time="325.04">[05:25.04]</span>I mean, it probably goes back at <span class="highlight">least</span> in part to where we mentioned earlier, that people didn't know what to make of his films – they were <span class="highlight">confused</span> by them, <span class="time" data-times="9.19" data-time="336.14">[05:36.14]</span>whereas Cousteau's documentaries were very <span class="highlight">straightforward</span>, met people's expectations more than Painlevé's films did. <span class="time" data-times="4.2" data-time="345.33">[05:45.33]</span>But you are true: <span class="highlight">film</span><span class="highlight">history</span> is about what we know about them. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="349.53">[05:49.53]</span>And Painlevé is still highly respected in many circles.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the main purpose of the lecture?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To discuss the style of an early filmmaker.</p><p>B. To describe different types of filmmaking in the 1930s.</p><p>C. To discuss the emergence of the documentary film.</p><p>D. To describe Painleve's influence on today's science-fiction films.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>Today we are going to talk about a film-maker who started making very unique films in the late 1920s. Today a large section of Content Professor was content on the review, and the sentence after today was today The focus of this lesson is the main purpose. B, D is a partial cover. It is not just Painleve's influence or his style that is discussed. C is irrelevant. The emphasis in this article is not documentary.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why are Painleve's films typical of the films of the 1920s and 1930s?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They do not have sound.</p><p>B. They are filmed underwater.</p><p>C. They are easy to understand.</p><p>D. They difficult to categorize.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>Now in a way, Painlevé's films conform to norms of the 20s and 30s, that is, they don't fit very neatly into the categories we use to classify films today. That said, even by the standards of the 20s and 30s, Painlevé's Films were unique, a hybrid of styles. From the description of this sentence, we can see that P's film style is unique and mixed style at the time or now and cannot be classified. A is a common feature of the era of silent movies. In B's words, there are also other people who shoot underwater movies and can be classified as documentaries. C. Films are contrary to the fact that P is difficult to understand.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor,how did Painleve's film confuse the audience?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They show animals out of their natural habitat.</p><p>B. They depict animals as having both human and animal characteristics.</p><p>C. The narration is scientific and difficult to understand.</p><p>D. The audiences of the 1920s and 1930s were not used to films shot underwater.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>A is inconsistent with the facts and is still photographed in animal habitats. C is mentioned in the text but does not answer this question, and his film was started with scientific content, and then changed. D also had other underwater filmmakers at the time.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor mention sea horses?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To explain that they were difficult to film in the 1930s.</p><p>B. To point out that Cousteau made documentaries about them.</p><p>C. To illustrate Pianleve's fascination with unusual animals.</p><p>D. To explain why Painleve's underwater films were not successful.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>First of all, say that P likes something different, then says one of his favorite sea animals was the seahorse. Obviously seahorse is an example of what he likes to do different things. A, B, D do not want to close.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor compare the film style of Jacques Cousteau and Jean Painleve?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To explain how Painleve influenced Cousteau.</p><p>B. To emphasize the uniqueness of Painleve's filming style.</p><p>C. To emphasize the artistic value of Cousteau's documentary films.</p><p>D. To demonstrate the superiority of Painleve's filmmaking equipment.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>He set the standard really for the nature documentary. Painlevé, on the other hand, as we said before, mixed in elements of fiction. And his films are much more artistic, incorporating music as an important element. The style of P is unique and unique. C is an integral part of the P features. D is wrong. The text emphasizes Cousteau's equipment. A is not mentioned.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the student imply when he say this:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. He does not like Jean Painleve's films.</p><p>B. He thinks that the professor should spend more time discussing Jacques Cousteau's film.</p><p>C. He believes that high quality filmmakers are usually well known.</p><p>D. He believes that Jean Painleve's film have been unfairly overlooked.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>From the post-professor's answer, it can be shown that the students' question of P comes from the fact that P does not have C, which reflects the students' belief that good filmmakers should be well-known. A is too subjective. Obviously students do not understand and do not like it. B, D is not mentioned.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
