Explain why these characteristics are important to you.</p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>I think a good parent should be patient. Because children are always confused with the things around them, they ask questions every now and then. A good parent should be patient enough to give them answers. When i was very young, I always asked questions like "Why can airplanes fly?","Why can't we fly?" and "Why the earth is a globe?". My parents answered these questions patiently and if they couldn't, they would buy books that have the answers to my questions. I also think a good parent should be open-minded. In other words, they should respect their children's decisions when their kids are growing up. My parents always show their respect to my decisions. My major in the college is software engineering, but I decided to be an English teacher after graduation. My parents respected my decision and allow me to pursue my own interest. Thanks to my parents, I am patient and I respect other people.</p></article></div></main></body></html>
