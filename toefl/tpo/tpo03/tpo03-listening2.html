              <span class="time" data-times="11.55" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in an <span class="underline">environmental</span> science class.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.12" data-time="11.55">[00:11.55]</span>Professor: Now, we've been talking about the loss of animal <span class="underline">habitat</span> from housing developments, uh ..., growing cities – small <span class="underline">habitat</span> losses. <span class="time" data-times="6.86" data-time="21.67">[00:21.67]</span>But today I <span class="underline">wanna</span> begin talking about what happens when <span class="underline">habitat</span> is reduced <span class="underline">across</span> a large area. <span class="time" data-times="9.76" data-time="28.53">[00:28.53]</span>There are, of <span class="underline">course</span>, animal <span class="underline">species</span> that <span class="underline">require</span> large areas of <span class="underline">habitat</span>, and some <span class="underline">migrate</span> over very long distances. <span class="time" data-times="7.38" data-time="38.29">[00:38.29]</span>So what's the <span class="underline">impact</span> of <span class="underline">habitat</span> loss on those animals – animals that need large areas of <span class="underline">habitat</span>?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.5" data-time="45.67">[00:45.67]</span>Well, I'll use the humming birds as an example. <span class="time" data-times="8.85" data-time="49.17">[00:49.17]</span>Now you know a humming bird is amazingly small, but <span class="underline">even</span> though it's really tiny, it migrates over very long distances, <span class="time" data-times="9.58" data-time="58.02">[00:58.02]</span>travels up and down the western <span class="underline">hemisphere</span> – the Americas, back and forth between where it breeds in the summer and the warmer climates where it spends the winter. <span class="time" data-times="5.8" data-time="67.6">[01:07.60]</span>So you would say that this whole area over which it migrates is its <span class="underline">habitat</span><span class="time" data-times="6.55" data-time="73.4">[01:13.40]</span>because on this long distance journey, it needs to come down to feed and sleep every so often, right?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.76" data-time="79.95">[01:19.95]</span>Well, the humming bird beats its wings – get this – about 3 thousand times per <span class="underline">minute</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.72" data-time="87.71">[01:27.71]</span>So you think, wow, it must need a lot of energy, a lot of food, right? <span class="time" data-times="1.54" data-time="92.43">[01:32.43]</span>Well, it does. <span class="time" data-times="6.69" data-time="93.97">[01:33.97]</span>It drinks a lot of <span class="underline">nectar</span> from flowers and feeds on some insects, but it's energy <span class="underline">efficient</span> too. <span class="time" data-times="1.37" data-time="100.66">[01:40.66]</span>You can't say it isn't. <span class="time" data-times="6.34" data-time="102.03">[01:42.03]</span>I mean, as it flies all the way <span class="underline">across</span> the Gulf of Mexico, it uses up none of its body fat.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.96" data-time="108.37">[01:48.37]</span>But that doesn't mean it doesn't need to eat. <span class="time" data-times="4.97" data-time="111.33">[01:51.33]</span>So humming birds have to <span class="underline">rely</span> on plants in their natural <span class="underline">habitat</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.53" data-time="116.3">[01:56.30]</span>And it goes without saying, but the <span class="underline">opposite</span> is true as well, plants <span class="underline">depend</span> on humming birds too. <span class="time" data-times="3.94" data-time="123.83">[02:03.83]</span>There are some flowers that can only be pollinated by the humming birds. <span class="time" data-times="6.9" data-time="127.77">[02:07.77]</span>Without it stopping to feed and <span class="underline">spread</span> <span class="underline">pollen</span> from flower to flower, these plants would <span class="underline">cease</span> to exist.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="18.24" data-time="134.67">[02:14.67]</span>But the problem, well, as natural <span class="underline">habitat</span> <span class="underline">along</span> these <span class="underline">migration</span> routes is developed by humans for housing or <span class="underline">agriculture</span> or cleared for raising <span class="underline">cattle</span>, for <span class="underline">instance</span>, there is less food <span class="underline">available</span> for migrating humming birds. <span class="time" data-times="5.79" data-time="152.91">[02:32.91]</span>Their nesting sites are affected too, the same by the same sorts of human activities. <span class="time" data-times="5.19" data-time="158.7">[02:38.70]</span>And all of these activities <span class="underline">pose</span> a real threat to the humming bird <span class="underline">population</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.15" data-time="163.89">[02:43.89]</span>So to help them <span class="underline">survive</span>, we need to <span class="underline">preserve</span> their habitats.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="13.05" data-time="169.04">[02:49.04]</span>And one of the <span class="underline">concrete</span> ways people have been doing this is by cleaning up polluted <span class="underline">habitat</span> areas and then replanting flowers, um, replanting native flowers that humming birds feed on. <span class="time" data-times="5.47" data-time="182.09">[03:02.09]</span>Promoting <span class="underline">ecological</span> tourism is another way to help <span class="underline">save</span> their <span class="underline">habitat</span>. <span class="time" data-times="11.82" data-time="187.56">[03:07.56]</span>As the number of visitors, eco-tourists who come to humming bird habitats to watch the birds, the more the number of visitors grows, the more <span class="underline">local</span> businesses' profit, <span class="time" data-times="8.08" data-time="199.38">[03:19.38]</span>so <span class="underline">ecological</span> tourism can bring <span class="underline">financial</span> rewards, all the more <span class="underline">reason</span> to value these beautiful little creatures in their <span class="underline">habitat</span>, right?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="14.8" data-time="207.46">[03:27.46]</span>But to understand more about how to protect and support the humming birds the best we can, we've got to learn more about their <span class="underline">breeding</span>, nesting sites and <span class="underline">migration</span> routes, and also about the natural habitats we find there. <span class="time" data-times="4.66" data-time="222.26">[03:42.26]</span>That should help us <span class="underline">determine</span> how to prevent further <span class="underline">decline</span> in the <span class="underline">population</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.68" data-time="226.92">[03:46.92]</span>A good research <span class="underline">method</span>, a good way to learn more, is by running a banding study.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.77" data-time="233.6">[03:53.60]</span>Banding the birds allows us to <span class="underline">track</span> them over their lifetime. <span class="time" data-times="2.83" data-time="237.37">[03:57.37]</span>It's been a practice that's been used by researchers for years. <span class="time" data-times="19.13" data-time="240.2">[04:00.20]</span>In fact, most of what we known about humming birds comes from banding studies, where we <span class="underline">capture</span> a humming bird and make sure all the information about it, like its weight and age and length, are all recorded and put into an international information database.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.1" data-time="259.33">[04:19.33]</span>And then we place an extremely lightweight <span class="underline">band</span> on one of its legs, well, what looks like a leg, although technically it's considered part of the bird's foot. <span class="time" data-times="7.27" data-time="269.43">[04:29.43]</span>Anyway, these bands are perfectly safe, and some humming birds have worn them for years with no <span class="underline">evidence</span> of any problems. <span class="time" data-times="10.9" data-time="276.7">[04:36.70]</span>The <span class="underline">band</span> is labeled with a tracking number, oh, and there is a phone number on the <span class="underline">band</span> for people to call for free, to <span class="underline">report</span> a banded bird they've found or recaptured.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.95" data-time="287.6">[04:47.60]</span>So when a banded bird is recaptured and reported, we learn about its <span class="underline">migration</span> <span class="underline">route</span>, its growth, and how long it has been alive, its <span class="underline">lifespan</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.2" data-time="297.55">[04:57.55]</span>One recaptured bird had been almost 12 years earlier – she was one of the oldest humming birds on <span class="underline">record</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.82" data-time="304.75">[05:04.75]</span>Another interesting thing we've learned is that some humming birds, um, they no longer use a certain <span class="underline">route</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.57" data-time="312.57">[05:12.57]</span>They travel by a different <span class="underline">route</span> to <span class="underline">reach</span> their <span class="underline">destination</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="316.14">[05:16.14]</span>And findings like these have been of <span class="underline">interest</span> to biologists and <span class="underline">environmental</span> scientists in a number of countries who are trying to understand the complexities of how changes in a <span class="underline">habitat</span> <span class="underline">affect</span> the <span class="underline">species</span> in it.</p>
