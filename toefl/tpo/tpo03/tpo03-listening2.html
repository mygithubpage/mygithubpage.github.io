lecture in an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> science class.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="10.12" data-time="11.55">[00:11.55]</span>Professor: Now, we've been talking about the loss of animal <span class="highlight">habitat</span> from housing developments, uh ..., growing cities – small <span class="highlight">habitat</span> losses. <span class="time" data-times="6.86" data-time="21.67">[00:21.67]</span>But today I <span class="highlight">wanna</span> begin talking about what happens when <span class="highlight">habitat</span> is reduced <span class="highlight">across</span> a large area. <span class="time" data-times="9.76" data-time="28.53">[00:28.53]</span>There are, of <span class="highlight">course</span>, animal <span class="highlight">species</span> that <span class="highlight">require</span> large areas of <span class="highlight">habitat</span>, and some <span class="highlight">migrate</span> over very long distances. <span class="time" data-times="7.38" data-time="38.29">[00:38.29]</span>So what's the <span class="highlight">impact</span> of <span class="highlight">habitat</span> loss on those animals – animals that need large areas of <span class="highlight">habitat</span>?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.5" data-time="45.67">[00:45.67]</span>Well, I'll use the humming birds as an example. <span class="time" data-times="8.85" data-time="49.17">[00:49.17]</span>Now you know a humming bird is amazingly small, but <span class="highlight">even</span> though it's really tiny, it migrates over very long distances, <span class="time" data-times="9.58" data-time="58.02">[00:58.02]</span>travels up and down the western <span class="highlight">hemisphere</span> – the Americas, back and forth between where it breeds in the summer and the warmer climates where it spends the winter. <span class="time" data-times="5.8" data-time="67.6">[01:07.60]</span>So you would say that this whole area over which it migrates is its <span class="highlight">habitat</span><span class="time" data-times="6.55" data-time="73.4">[01:13.40]</span>because on this long distance journey, it needs to come down to feed and sleep every so often, right?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.76" data-time="79.95">[01:19.95]</span>Well, the humming bird beats its wings – get this – about 3 thousand times per <span class="highlight">minute</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.72" data-time="87.71">[01:27.71]</span>So you think, wow, it must need a lot of energy, a lot of food, right? <span class="time" data-times="1.54" data-time="92.43">[01:32.43]</span>Well, it does. <span class="time" data-times="6.69" data-time="93.97">[01:33.97]</span>It drinks a lot of <span class="highlight">nectar</span> from flowers and feeds on some insects, but it's energy <span class="highlight">efficient</span> too. <span class="time" data-times="1.37" data-time="100.66">[01:40.66]</span>You can't say it isn't. <span class="time" data-times="6.34" data-time="102.03">[01:42.03]</span>I mean, as it flies all the way <span class="highlight">across</span> the Gulf of Mexico, it uses up none of its body fat.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.96" data-time="108.37">[01:48.37]</span>But that doesn't mean it doesn't need to eat. <span class="time" data-times="4.97" data-time="111.33">[01:51.33]</span>So humming birds have to <span class="highlight">rely</span> on plants in their natural <span class="highlight">habitat</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.53" data-time="116.3">[01:56.30]</span>And it goes without saying, but the <span class="highlight">opposite</span> is true as well, plants <span class="highlight">depend</span> on humming birds too. <span class="time" data-times="3.94" data-time="123.83">[02:03.83]</span>There are some flowers that can only be pollinated by the humming birds. <span class="time" data-times="6.9" data-time="127.77">[02:07.77]</span>Without it stopping to feed and <span class="highlight">spread</span><span class="highlight">pollen</span> from flower to flower, these plants would <span class="highlight">cease</span> to exist.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="18.24" data-time="134.67">[02:14.67]</span>But the problem, well, as natural <span class="highlight">habitat</span><span class="highlight">along</span> these <span class="highlight">migration</span> routes is developed by humans for housing or <span class="highlight">agriculture</span> or cleared for raising <span class="highlight">cattle</span>, for <span class="highlight">instance</span>, there is less food <span class="highlight">available</span> for migrating humming birds. <span class="time" data-times="5.79" data-time="152.91">[02:32.91]</span>Their nesting sites are affected too, the same by the same sorts of human activities. <span class="time" data-times="5.19" data-time="158.7">[02:38.70]</span>And all of these activities <span class="highlight">pose</span> a real threat to the humming bird <span class="highlight">population</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.15" data-time="163.89">[02:43.89]</span>So to help them <span class="highlight">survive</span>, we need to <span class="highlight">preserve</span> their habitats.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="13.05" data-time="169.04">[02:49.04]</span>And one of the <span class="highlight">concrete</span> ways people have been doing this is by cleaning up polluted <span class="highlight">habitat</span> areas and then replanting flowers, um, replanting native flowers that humming birds feed on. <span class="time" data-times="5.47" data-time="182.09">[03:02.09]</span>Promoting <span class="highlight">ecological</span> tourism is another way to help <span class="highlight">save</span> their <span class="highlight">habitat</span>. <span class="time" data-times="11.82" data-time="187.56">[03:07.56]</span>As the number of visitors, eco-tourists who come to humming bird habitats to watch the birds, the more the number of visitors grows, the more <span class="highlight">local</span> businesses' profit, <span class="time" data-times="8.08" data-time="199.38">[03:19.38]</span>so <span class="highlight">ecological</span> tourism can bring <span class="highlight">financial</span> rewards, all the more <span class="highlight">reason</span> to value these beautiful little creatures in their <span class="highlight">habitat</span>, right?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="14.8" data-time="207.46">[03:27.46]</span>But to understand more about how to protect and support the humming birds the best we can, we've got to learn more about their <span class="highlight">breeding</span>, nesting sites and <span class="highlight">migration</span> routes, and also about the natural habitats we find there. <span class="time" data-times="4.66" data-time="222.26">[03:42.26]</span>That should help us <span class="highlight">determine</span> how to prevent further <span class="highlight">decline</span> in the <span class="highlight">population</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.68" data-time="226.92">[03:46.92]</span>A good research <span class="highlight">method</span>, a good way to learn more, is by running a banding study.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.77" data-time="233.6">[03:53.60]</span>Banding the birds allows us to <span class="highlight">track</span> them over their lifetime. <span class="time" data-times="2.83" data-time="237.37">[03:57.37]</span>It's been a practice that's been used by researchers for years. <span class="time" data-times="19.13" data-time="240.2">[04:00.20]</span>In fact, most of what we known about humming birds comes from banding studies, where we <span class="highlight">capture</span> a humming bird and make sure all the information about it, like its weight and age and length, are all recorded and put into an international information database.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="10.1" data-time="259.33">[04:19.33]</span>And then we place an extremely lightweight <span class="highlight">band</span> on one of its legs, well, what looks like a leg, although technically it's considered part of the bird's foot. <span class="time" data-times="7.27" data-time="269.43">[04:29.43]</span>Anyway, these bands are perfectly safe, and some humming birds have worn them for years with no <span class="highlight">evidence</span> of any problems. <span class="time" data-times="10.9" data-time="276.7">[04:36.70]</span>The <span class="highlight">band</span> is labeled with a tracking number, oh, and there is a phone number on the <span class="highlight">band</span> for people to call for free, to <span class="highlight">report</span> a banded bird they've found or recaptured.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="9.95" data-time="287.6">[04:47.60]</span>So when a banded bird is recaptured and reported, we learn about its <span class="highlight">migration</span><span class="highlight">route</span>, its growth, and how long it has been alive, its <span class="highlight">lifespan</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.2" data-time="297.55">[04:57.55]</span>One recaptured bird had been almost 12 years earlier – she was one of the oldest humming birds on <span class="highlight">record</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.82" data-time="304.75">[05:04.75]</span>Another interesting thing we've learned is that some humming birds, um, they no longer use a certain <span class="highlight">route</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.57" data-time="312.57">[05:12.57]</span>They travel by a different <span class="highlight">route</span> to <span class="highlight">reach</span> their <span class="highlight">destination</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="316.14">[05:16.14]</span>And findings like these have been of <span class="highlight">interest</span> to biologists and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> scientists in a number of countries who are trying to understand the complexities of how changes in a <span class="highlight">habitat</span><span class="highlight">affect</span> the <span class="highlight">species</span> in it.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor mainly discuss?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Major changes in the migratory patterns of hummingbirds.</p><p>B. The adaptation of hummingbirds to urban environments.</p><p>C. Concern about the reduction of hummingbird habitat.</p><p>D. The impact of ecotourism on hummingbird populations.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Now, we've been talking about the loss of animal habitat from housing developments, uh ..., growing cities – small habitat losses. But today I wanna begin talking about what happens</p><p>When what habitat is reduced across a large area. So what's the impact of home loss on those animals – animals that need large areas of habitat? But after the content is today's topic. Option B does not match the facts in the article. The A option seems to be confused but the emphasis on impact and habitat loss leads to a reduction in their number, not change. Although there is mention of migratory, it is only to explain that it needs to consume a lot of energy during the migration, not to discuss the changes of their migration route.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor imply might cause a decrease in the hummingbird population?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. An increase in the ecotourism industry.</p><p>B. An increase in the use of land to raise crops and cattle.</p><p>C. A decrease in banding studies.</p><p>D. A decrease in the distance traveled during migration.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>This sentence clearly refers to the development of human agriculture and battle is the main cause of the reduction of habitat and the number of hummingbirds. A is contrary to the fact that the purpose of the ecotourism industry is to help protect hummingbirds. C, banding studies will not affect the number of hummingbirds. The distance of the migration in D showed no decrease in the professor's speech.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor say people have done to help hummingbirds survive?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They have built a series of hummingbird feeding stations.</p><p>B. They have supported new laws that punish polluters of wildlife habitats.</p><p>C. They have replanted native flowers in once polluted areas.</p><p>D. They have learned to identify various hummingbird species.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>So help them survive, we need to preserve their habitats. And one of the concrete ways people have been doing this is cleaning up polluted habitat areas and then replanting flowers, um, replanting native flowers that humming birds feed on. It can be seen that the professor mentioned how to help the hummingbird survive, that is, the contents of the C option. A, B did not mention that D does not help hummingbirds to survive.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What way of collecting information about migrating hummingbirds does the professor mention?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Receiving radio signals from electronic tracking devices.</p><p>B. Being contacted by people who recapture banded birds.</p><p>C. Counting the birds that return to the same region every year.</p><p>D. Comparing old and young birds' migration routes.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>...oh, and there is a phone number on the band for people to call for free, to report a banded bird to be found or recaptured. So when a banded bird is recaptured and reported, we learn ... The message is to have a free phone call on the band where the hummingbirds were found and call the researchers about what they observed. Then after induction, it is found in answer B. The radio signals in A cannot be used for tracking. C did not mention that D did not allow researchers to obtain data on specific hummingbirds.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor imply researchers have learned while studying hummingbird migration?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Hummingbirds have totally disappeared from some countries due to recent habitat destruction.</p><p>B. Programs to replant flowers native to hummingbird habitats are not succeeding.</p><p>C. Some groups of hummingbirds have changed their migration patterns.</p><p>D. Some plant species pollinated by hummingbirds have become extinct.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Although there is a large section of the information collected by the professor, but only the phrase and the hummingbird relocation route, another interesting thing we learned is that some humming birds no longer use a certain route. They travel by a different route to reach their destination. Directly related. From no longer use a certain route it was seen that the hummingbirds changed their migration path. None of A.B.D mentioned it.</p></div></div><div class="replay" id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor imply when she say this:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. There is disagreement about the idea she has presented.</p><p>B. She does not plan to discuss all the details.</p><p>C. Her next point may seem to contradict what she has just said.</p><p>D. The point she will make next should be obvious to the students.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>It goes without saying that the professor fully believes what she will say next is very clear to the student. Obviously she does not want to correct or negate the previous idea, nor does it mean that she does not intend to say details. She discussed the details in the following statement.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
