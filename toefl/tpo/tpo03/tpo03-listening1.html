To notify the university of her change of address.</p><p>B. To find out where her physics class is being held.</p><p>C. To get directions to the science building.</p><p>D. To complain about her physics class being canceled.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Physics of the class 403 has been moved into the classroom. Could you tell me where the class is? The question is clearly reflected in the student's coming. Excuse me, I'm assumed to be having my physics class in the science building, but no one one's in the classroom. The purpose of the consultation is to find out where her physics class is, and this option B fits directly. The C option is an irrelevant option, because the clause clearly shows that she has been to Science building and found no one in the classroom, so it can be excluded first. Obviously she still didn't know that the physics class was canceled, so D was excluded. At this time, she was completely unaware that the school's contact did not update the address. Therefore, A was excluded.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What happened to the letter the university sent to the woman?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. She threw it away by mistake.</p><p>B. Her roommate forgot to give it to her.</p><p>C. It was sent to her old mailing address.</p><p>D. It was sent to another student by mistake.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>In these two dialogues it is clear that the letter was sent to the old apartment, which is the old mailing address in the answer. A. There was a mention in the conversation: I wonder if I threw it away with all the junk mail by mistake. But this is only speculation, not fact, from the wonder if. Both the B and D options are not mentioned. It is only subjective that may be the possible reason for not receiving the letter, but it has nothing to do with the dialogue.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why was the woman's physics class canceled?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Not enough students signed up to take the class.</p><p>B. No professors were available to teach the class.</p><p>C. The university changed its requirements for physics students.</p><p>D. There were no classrooms available in the science building at the hour.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>From this set of questions and answers clearly pointed out the questions in the question, why cancle class and the staff's answer is very straightforward, that is, don't have enough students C, D is nothing to do, then peofessor mentioned, but It's not because of the teacher's question, You know, it's a practical issue, like we can't have an instructor when there're only a few students in the class. But the school will not teach the teacher only once to a few students. The number of students.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the man suggest the woman do before the beginning of next semester?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Consult with her advisor about her class schedule.</p><p>B. Check with the registrar's office about the location of the class.</p><p>C. Register for her classes early.</p><p>D. Call the physics department.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The question that starts with But is the prompt, telling us that this worker is about to tell the student how to solve this problem. A, B, C options are not mentioned. Only mention this student to modify the address instead of the class location.</p></div></div><div class="replay" id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the man imply when he say this:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. He know the physics class has been canceled.</p><p>B. He is not sure where the science building is.</p><p>C. Many of the room assignments have been changed.</p><p>D. The women can check for herself where her class is.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>At first, the staff did not know that the student's specific situation only meant that she could not find the classroom. Well, he said, there's a room assignment sheet on the bulletin board outside this office. It's just telling the students that you can go on this board yourself Is the meaning of the D option. A. Obviously the wrong option. Before querying the computer, he did not know about the course. The original text of B and C is not mentioned.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
