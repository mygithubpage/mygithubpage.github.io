            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.28" data-time="6.66">[00:06.66]</span>Professor: Now <span class="underline">astronomy</span> didn't really <span class="underline">bloom</span> into the science it is today until the <span class="underline">development</span> of spectroscopy. <span class="time" data-times="9.13" data-time="13.94">[00:13.94]</span>Spectroscopy is basically the study of spectra and spectral lines of light, and <span class="underline">specifically</span> for us, the light from stars. <span class="time" data-times="4.13" data-time="23.07">[00:23.07]</span>It makes it possible to <span class="underline">analyze</span> the light emitted from stars. <span class="time" data-times="9.22" data-time="27.2">[00:27.20]</span>When you <span class="underline">analyze</span> this light, you can <span class="underline">figure</span> out their distance from the earth, and <span class="underline">identify</span> what they are made of, <span class="underline">determine</span> their chemical <span class="underline">composition</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.01" data-time="36.42">[00:36.42]</span>Before we get into that though, it's probably a good thing to back up a bit. <span class="time" data-times="10.56" data-time="41.43">[00:41.43]</span>You all know how when you take a <span class="underline">crystal</span> prism and pass a <span class="underline">beam</span> of sunlight <span class="underline">through</span> it, you get a <span class="underline">spectrum</span>, which looks like a <span class="underline">continuous</span> <span class="underline">band</span> of <span class="underline">rainbow</span> colors. <span class="time" data-times="8.24" data-time="51.99">[00:51.99]</span>The light that we see with our human eyes as a <span class="underline">band</span> of <span class="underline">rainbow</span> color falls in a <span class="underline">range</span> of what's called <span class="underline">visible</span> light. <span class="time" data-times="6.16" data-time="60.23">[01:00.23]</span>And <span class="underline">visible</span> light spectroscopy is probably the most important kind of spectroscopy. <span class="time" data-times="4.44" data-time="66.39">[01:06.39]</span>Anyone want to take a stab at the <span class="underline">scientific</span> <span class="underline">term</span> for <span class="underline">visible</span> light? <span class="time" data-times="4.48" data-time="70.83">[01:10.83]</span>And I'm sure all of you know this because you all did the reading for today.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.48" data-time="75.31">[01:15.31]</span>Student: <span class="underline">Optical</span> <span class="underline">radiation</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4" data-time="77.79">[01:17.79]</span>But I thought being <span class="underline">exposed</span> to <span class="underline">radiation</span> is dangerous.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.85" data-time="81.79">[01:21.79]</span>Professor: Yes, and no. <span class="time" data-times="5.64" data-time="83.64">[01:23.64]</span>If you are talking about <span class="underline">radiation</span>, like in the <span class="underline">element</span> Uranium, yeah, that's dangerous. <span class="time" data-times="6.88" data-time="89.28">[01:29.28]</span>But <span class="underline">radiation</span> as a general <span class="underline">term</span> actually refers to anything that spreads away from its <span class="underline">source</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.83" data-time="96.16">[01:36.16]</span>So <span class="underline">optical</span> <span class="underline">radiation</span> is just <span class="underline">visible</span> light energy spreading out.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.59" data-time="100.99">[01:40.99]</span>OK, so we've got a <span class="underline">spectrum</span> of a <span class="underline">beam</span> of sunlight and it looks like the colors bleed into each other. <span class="time" data-times="7.87" data-time="107.58">[01:47.58]</span>There are no interruptions, just a <span class="underline">band</span> flowing from violet to green, to yellow, to... you get the idea. <span class="time" data-times="4.12" data-time="115.45">[01:55.45]</span>Well, what happens if the sunlight's <span class="underline">spectrum</span> is magnified? <span class="time" data-times="2.56" data-time="119.57">[01:59.57]</span>Maybe you all didn't do the reading. <span class="time" data-times="1.85" data-time="122.13">[02:02.13]</span>Well, here's what you'd see. <span class="time" data-times="6.72" data-time="123.98">[02:03.98]</span>I want you to know this that this <span class="underline">spectrum</span> is interrupted by dark lines called spectral lines.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.88" data-time="130.7">[02:10.70]</span>If you really <span class="underline">magnify</span> the <span class="underline">spectrum</span> of the sunlight, you could <span class="underline">identify</span> more than 100,000 of them. <span class="time" data-times="5.76" data-time="137.58">[02:17.58]</span>They may look like kind of randomly placed, but they actually form many <span class="underline">distinct</span> patterns. <span class="time" data-times="6.3" data-time="143.34">[02:23.34]</span>And if you were looking at the <span class="underline">spectrum</span> of some other star, the colors would be the same. <span class="time" data-times="5.77" data-time="149.64">[02:29.64]</span>But the spectral lines would <span class="underline">break</span> it up at different places, making different patterns. <span class="time" data-times="10.86" data-time="155.41">[02:35.41]</span>Each <span class="underline">pattern</span> stands for a <span class="underline">distinct</span> chemical <span class="underline">element</span>, and so different sets or patterns of spectral lines mean that the star has a different chemical <span class="underline">composition</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.59" data-time="166.27">[02:46.27]</span>Student: So how do we know which spectral patterns <span class="underline">match</span> up with which elements?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.48" data-time="170.86">[02:50.86]</span>Professor: Well, a kind of spectroscopic library of elements was compiled using <span class="underline">flame</span> tests. <span class="time" data-times="6.56" data-time="176.34">[02:56.34]</span>A known <span class="underline">element</span>, say a piece of iron for example, is heated in a <span class="underline">pure</span> gas <span class="underline">flame</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.42" data-time="182.9">[03:02.90]</span>The iron <span class="underline">eventually</span> heats to the point that it radiates light. <span class="time" data-times="4.77" data-time="187.32">[03:07.32]</span>This light is passed <span class="underline">through</span> a prism, which breaks it up into a <span class="underline">spectrum</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.65" data-time="192.09">[03:12.09]</span>And a <span class="underline">unique</span> <span class="underline">pattern</span>, kind of like a chemical fingerprint of spectral lines for that <span class="underline">element</span> appears.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="13.85" data-time="198.74">[03:18.74]</span>This <span class="underline">process</span> was repeated over and over again for many different elements, so we can <span class="underline">figure</span> out the chemical makeup of another star by comparing the spectral <span class="underline">pattern</span> it has to the <span class="underline">pattern</span> of the elements in the library. <span class="time" data-times="6.71" data-time="212.59">[03:32.59]</span>Oh, an interesting story about how one of the elements was discovered <span class="underline">through</span> spectroscopy. <span class="time" data-times="6.51" data-time="219.3">[03:39.30]</span>There was a <span class="underline">pretty</span> <span class="underline">extensive</span> library of spectral <span class="underline">line</span> patterns of elements <span class="underline">even</span> by the 1860s.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.7" data-time="225.81">[03:45.81]</span>A British <span class="underline">astronomer</span> was analyzing a spectrograph of sunlight, and he noticed a <span class="underline">particular</span> <span class="underline">pattern</span> of spectral lines that didn't <span class="underline">match</span> anything in the library. <span class="time" data-times="7.87" data-time="235.51">[03:55.51]</span>So he put two and two together, and decided there was an <span class="underline">element</span> in the sun that hadn't been discovered here on the earth yet. <span class="time" data-times="2.61" data-time="243.38">[04:03.38]</span>Any guesses about what that <span class="underline">element</span> is? <span class="time" data-times="5.59" data-time="245.99">[04:05.99]</span>It actually turned out to be <span class="underline">pretty</span> <span class="underline">common</span> and I'm sure all of you know it. <span class="time" data-times="3.41" data-time="251.58">[04:11.58]</span>OK. Let's try something else. <span class="time" data-times="5.03" data-time="254.99">[04:14.99]</span>Any of you happened to be <span class="underline">familiar</span> with the Greek word for "sun" by <span class="underline">chance</span>?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.78" data-time="260.02">[04:20.02]</span>Student: Something like "Helius" or something like that. <span class="time" data-times="1.83" data-time="263.8">[04:23.80]</span>Oh it must be "Helium". <span class="time" data-times="3.21" data-time="265.63">[04:25.63]</span>So you are saying that Helium was discovered on the sun first.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="268.84">[04:28.84]</span>Professor: Yes, and this is a good example of how important spectroscopy is in <span class="underline">astronomy</span>.</p>
