Different ways of magnifying the spectrum of a star.</p><p>B. How a chemical element was first discovered on the Sun.</p><p>C. How astronomers identify the chemical elements in a star.</p><p>D. Why the spectra of different stars are composed of different colors.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Go straight to the top. The development of spectroscopy has promoted the development of astronomy. Through the study of the spectrum, we can analyze the light emitted from the stars to understand the distance and composition of the star from the earth.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor explain to one of the students about the term "radiation"?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It is defined incorrectly in the textbooks.</p><p>B. It was first used in the nineteenth century.</p><p>C. It is rarely used by astronomers.</p><p>D. It does not refer only to harmful energy.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>Yes, and no. If you are talking about radiation, like in the element Uranium, yeah, that's dangerous. But radiation as a general term actually mentioning anything anything spreads away from its source. So optical radiation is just visible light energy spreading out Students believe that exposure to radiation is dangerous, but in the case of light radiation, radiation like uranium is dangerous, but light radiation is emitted by a visible light source, so it is not dangerous. Therefore, "radiation" does not only refer to Dangerous energy.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What can be inferred about two stars if their spectra have similar spectral line patterns?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The stars are approximately the same distance from the Earth.</p><p>B. The stars probably have some chemical elements in common.</p><p>C. The stars have nearly the same brightness.</p><p>D. The stars are probably of the same size.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Each pattern stands for a distinct chemical element, and so different sets or patterns of spectral lines mean that the star has a different chemical composition. The spectral lines of each star are composed of different patterns. Each pattern represents a different chemical element. According to the article, if the patterns are different, it means that the chemical composition of the two stars is different. In turn, if the patterns are the same, it means that the two stars have the same chemical composition.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor,what is the purpose of heating an element in a spectroscopic flame test?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To cause an element to emit light.</p><p>B. To study an element in combination with other elements.</p><p>C. To remove impurities from the element.</p><p>D. To measure an element's resistance to heat.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The purpose of the flame test is to heat an element to emit light, thus obtaining a unique spectral line pattern belonging to the element and collecting it into the spectral cluster.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor say this?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. He is about to provide some background information.</p><p>B. He is about to repeat what he just said.</p><p>C. He intends to focus on the history of astronomy.</p><p>D. He intends to explain two different points of view.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>From the phrase "bak up" it is clear that the professor will provide some background knowledge.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor ask this?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To check the students' understanding of their reading assignment.</p><p>B. To give the students a hint to the answer to his previous question.</p><p>C. To emphasize how important it is for astronomers to study Greek.</p><p>D. To remind the students about the historical background of astronomy.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The professor asked the students to guess what the unknown element was, and then asked a question to ask who happened to know the word sun in Greek. The purpose was to give the students first to use the pronunciation of the word to associate with the Helium element so that the unknown element was What's the answer to this question.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
