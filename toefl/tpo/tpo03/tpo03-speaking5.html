I won an award from the Creative Writing Institute for a story I wrote and ...</p><p>(man) That doesn't sound like anything's wrong.</p><p>(woman) Well, it's a huge honor to win and there's an award ceremony they've invited me to attend which I'm so excited about, but, and here's what's frustrating: I've got a Biology exam that's scheduled for the same time.</p><p>(man) Uh oh, well, have you talked to your professor about this?</p><p>(woman) Yeah, she said I could write a five-page paper instead, and I have lots of ideas and know I could do a good job, but...</p><p>(man) But what?</p><p>(woman) Well, writing a paper would take up so much time, a lot more than studying for and taking the exam. I have lots of other school work to deal with.</p><p>(man) Oh! Or you could have someone else to receive the award for you. I mean, go in your place and accept on your behalf.</p><p>(woman) Maybe, I'll still get the award and the money that way.</p><p>(man) Oooh, you won money too?</p><p>(woman) Yeah, pretty cool, huh? But an yways, my parents were really looking forward to coming and seeing me on stage shaking hands with the Institute's president Knoff. I hate to disappoint them.</p><p>(man) True, I'm sure they are really proud.</p><p>(woman) Like I said, I'm still struggling about what to do.</p></article><section id="question"><h4>Question</h4><p>The speakers discuss two possible solutions to the woman's problem. Briefly summarize the problem then state which of the solutions you recommend and explain why. </p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>Well, the woman's problem is that her award ceremony conflicts with her coming biology exam, and accordingly the man offers two solutions for the woman: first, she could talk to her professor about the schedule conflict or second, she could find someone else to receive the award for her. In such a dilemma, l believe the second solution is a better one for two main reasons. For one thing, a five-page paper is even more time appealing and exhausting than her biology exam, because it is known to all that students could easily get an exam cracked within like no more than 5 days but it usually takes at least more than 2 weeks to get a paper done. Second, finding someone to receive the award would be really easy-maybe a phone call will do and still the woman could get her award. (148 words)</p></article></div></main></body></html>
