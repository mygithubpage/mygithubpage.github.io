This <span class="highlight">region</span> has a <span class="highlight">semiarid</span><span class="highlight">climate</span>, and for 50 years after its <span class="highlight">settlement</span>, it supported a low-intensity agricultural <span class="highlight">economy</span> of <span class="highlight">cattle</span> ranching and wheat farming. In the early twentieth <span class="highlight">century</span>, however, it was discovered that much of the High Plains was underlain by a huge <span class="highlight">aquifer</span> (a rock <span class="highlight">layer</span> containing large quantities of <span class="highlight">groundwater</span>). This <span class="highlight">aquifer</span> was named the Ogallala <span class="highlight">aquifer</span> after the Ogallala Sioux Indians, who once inhabited the region</p><p>The Ogallala <span class="highlight">aquifer</span> is a sandstone <span class="highlight">formation</span> that underlies some 583,000 <span class="highlight">square</span> kilometers of land extending from northwestern Texas to southern South Dakota. Water from rains and <span class="highlight">melting</span> snows has been accumulating in the Ogallala for the past 30,000 years. <span class="question3">Estimates <span class="highlight">indicate</span> that the <span class="highlight">aquifer</span> contains enough water to fill Lake Huron, but <span class="highlight">unfortunately</span>, under the <span class="highlight">semiarid</span><span class="highlight">climatic</span> conditions that presently exist in the <span class="highlight">region</span>, rates of <span class="highlight">addition</span> to the <span class="highlight">aquifer</span> are <span class="highlight">minimal</span>, amounting to about half a centimeter a year.</span></p><p>The first wells were drilled into the Ogallala during the <span class="highlight">drought</span> years of the early 1930s. The <span class="question4">ensuing</span> rapid <span class="highlight">expansion</span> of <span class="highlight">irrigation</span><span class="highlight">agriculture</span>, especially from the 1950s onward, transformed the <span class="highlight">economy</span> of the <span class="highlight">region</span>. More than 100,000 wells now tap the Ogallala. Modern <span class="highlight">irrigation</span> devices, each <span class="highlight">capable</span> of spraying 4.5 million liters of water a day, have produced a <span class="highlight">landscape</span> dominated by geometric patterns of <span class="highlight">circular</span> green islands of crops. Ogallala water has enabled the High Plains <span class="highlight">region</span> to <span class="highlight">supply</span><span class="highlight">significant</span> amounts of the cotton, sorghum, wheat, and corn grown in the United States. In <span class="highlight">addition</span>, 40 percent of American grain-fed beef <span class="highlight">cattle</span> are fattened here.</p><p>This <span class="highlight"><span class="question6">unprecedented</span></span><span class="highlight">development</span> of a <span class="highlight">finite</span><span class="highlight">groundwater</span><span class="highlight">resource</span> with an almost <span class="highlight">negligible</span> natural <span class="highlight">recharge</span><span class="highlight">rate</span>-that is, <span class="highlight"><span class="question7">virtually</span></span> no natural water <span class="highlight">source</span> to <span class="highlight">replenish</span> the water <span class="highlight">supply</span>-has caused water tables in the <span class="highlight">region</span> to fall <span class="highlight">drastically</span>. In the 1930s, wells encountered <span class="highlight">plentiful</span> water at a depth of about 15 meters; currently, they must be dug to depths of 45 to 60 meters or more. In places, the water table is declining at a <span class="highlight">rate</span> of a meter a year, necessitating the <span class="highlight">periodic</span> deepening of wells and the use of ever-more-powerful pumps. It is estimated that at <span class="highlight">current</span> withdrawal rates, much of the <span class="highlight">aquifer</span> will run dry <span class="highlight">within</span> 40 years. The situation is most <span class="highlight">critical</span> in Texas, where the <span class="highlight">climate</span> is driest, the greatest <span class="highlight">amount</span> of water is being pumped, and the <span class="highlight">aquifer</span> contains the <span class="highlight">least</span> water. It is projected that the <span class="highlight">remaining</span> Ogallala water will, by the year 2030, support only 35 to 40 percent of the irrigated <span class="highlight">acreage</span> in Texas that is supported in 1980.</p><p>The <span class="highlight">reaction</span> of farmers to the <span class="highlight"><span class="question10">inevitable</span></span> depletion of the Ogallala varies. Many have been attempting to <span class="highlight">conserve</span> water by irrigating less frequently or by switching to crops 
 that <span class="highlight">require</span> less water. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> Others, however, have adopted the <span class="highlight">philosophy</span> that it is best to use the water while it is still <span class="highlight">economically</span><span class="highlight">profitable</span> to do so and to <span class="highlight">concentrate</span> on 
 high-value crops such as cotton.  <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> The <span class="highlight">incentive</span> of the farmers who wish to <span class="highlight">conserve</span> water is reduced by their knowledge that many of their neighbors are profiting by using great amounts of water,
 and in the <span class="highlight">process</span> are drawing down the entire <span class="highlight">region</span>'s water supplies. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span></p><p>In the face of the upcoming water <span class="highlight">supply</span> crisis, a number of grandiose schemes have been developed to <span class="highlight">transport</span><span class="highlight">vast</span> quantities of water by <span class="highlight">canal</span> or pipeline from the Mississippi,
 the Missouri, or the Arkansas rivers. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span><span class="highlight">Unfortunately</span>, the <span class="highlight">cost</span> of water obtained <span class="highlight">through</span> any of these schemes would increase pumping costs at <span class="highlight">least</span> tenfold,
 making the <span class="highlight">cost</span> of irrigated agricultural products from the <span class="highlight">region</span> uncompetitive on the national and international markets.
<span class="highlight">Somewhat</span> more <span class="highlight">promising</span> have been recent experiments for releasing capillary water (water in the soil) above the water table by injecting compressed <span class="highlight">air</span> into the ground.
<span class="highlight">Even</span> if this <span class="highlight">process</span> proves successful, however, it would almost triple water costs. Genetic <span class="highlight">engineering</span> also may provide a <span class="highlight">partial</span><span class="highlight">solution</span>,
 as new strains of drought-resistant crops continue to be developed. Whatever the final answer to the water crisis may be, it is <span class="highlight">evident</span> that <span class="highlight">within</span> the High Plains, 
 <span class="highlight">irrigation</span> water will never again be the <span class="highlight">abundant</span>, inexpensive <span class="highlight">resource</span> it was during the agricultural <span class="highlight">boom</span> years of the mid-twentieth <span class="highlight">century</span>.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 1, which of the following statements about the High Plains is true?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Until farmers and ranchers settled there in the 1880s, the High Plains had never been inhabited.</p><p>B. The climate of the High Plains is characterized by higher-than-average temperatures.</p><p>C. The large aquifer that lies underneath the High Plains was discovered by the Ogallala Sioux Indians.</p><p>D. Before the early 1900s there was only a small amount of farming and ranching in the High Plains.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>Exclusion method, using the 1880s keyword to locate the first sentence, saying that the 1880s peasants and herdsmen settled in High Plains, did not say there was no person before 1880, and A mistake: The vast grasslands of the High Plains in the central United States were settled by farmers And ranchers in the 1880s. Positioned by climate keyword to the second sentence, the original said semiarid, did not say temperature, B wrong; D in small amount of farming and ranching and the second sentence of the original low-intensity is synonymous ,selected. This region has a semiarid climate, and for 50 years after its settlement, it supported a low-intensity agricultural economy of cattle ranching and wheat farming. It was he who discovered that C mistake: This aquifer was named the Ogallala aquifer after the Ogallala Sioux Indians, who once inhabited the region.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 2, all of the following statements about the Ogallala aquifer are true EXCEPT:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The aquifer stretches from South Dakota to Texas.</p><p>B. The aquifer's water comes from underground springs.</p><p>C. Water has been gathering in the aquifer for 30,000 years.</p><p>D. The aquifer's water is stored in a layer of sandstone.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>A, with two place names, and D with sandstone as the key word, locates to the first sentence. Both A and D are right. The following: The Ogallala aquifer is a sandstone formation that underlies some 583,000 square kilometers of land extending from northwestern Texas to southern South Dakota. .C is targeted to the second sentence with a keyword of 30,000 years, C pairs, not selected: Water from rains and melting snows has been accumulating in the Ogallala for the past 30,000 years. From this sentence you can also see that the groundwater is from the rain And melting snow is not spring water, so B is wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Despite the current impressive size of the Ogallala aquifer, the region's climate keeps the rates of water addition very small.</p><p>B. Although the aquifer has been adding water at the rate of only half a centimeter a year, it will eventually accumulate enough water of fill Lake Huron.</p><p>C. Because of the region's present climatic conditions, water is being added each year to the aquifer.</p><p>D. Even when the region experiences unfortunate climatic conditions, the rates of addition of water continue to increase.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A. The structure of the text is estimated to be a lot of water enough to fill the Lake Huron, but in semi-arid weather, supplements are less. The main logic is the turning point. After the turning point, emphasis is placed on the emphasis. A. The answer fully reflects these two aspects and is correct. B emphasizes the point. The original sentence emphasizes that there are few supplements. B emphasizes that the current quantity is large; C's added is inconsistent with the original sentence, and the main ones are missing. The content; D said that the continued growth of supplements, the original did not say.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question4">ensuing</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. continuing</p><p>B. surprising</p><p>C. initial</p><p>D. subsequent</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" D"><p>Ensue follows, next, so subsequent is the answer. The original text says that the first batch of wells were excavated in 1930s. The phrase <span class="question4">ensuing</span> said that the 1950s had a rapid expansion of agriculture. These two times show that the movements are successive, and the first general must have the following, so it should be Followed. Note that continuing is a big confusing term. Continuation refers to the continuation of an action, and the next two things happen. B is surprising and C was originally, and it wasn't the beginning.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>In paragraph 3, why does the author provide the information that 40 percent of American cattle are fattened in the High Plains?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To suggest that crop cultivation is not the most important part of the economy of the High Plains</p><p>B. To indicate that not all economic activity in the High Plains is dependent on irrigation</p><p>C. To provide another example of how water from the Ogallala has transformed the economy of the High Plains</p><p>D. To contrast cattle-fattening practices in the High Plains with those used in other region of the United States</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>40% of the functional objectives are clearly an example. Looking forward, the water in this place supports many crops in the high plains region. In addition, it indicates further, that is, in addition to agriculture and animal husbandry, it is C,provide another example. Did not say that agriculture and animal husbandry are important, A fault; animal husbandry does not rely on irrigation, but also rely on the water in this place, so B has nothing to do; no comparison, D wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question6">unprecedented</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. difficult to control</p><p>B. without any restriction</p><p>C. unlike anything in the past</p><p>D. rapidly expanding</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" C"><p>Unbounded: Unprecedented, un said no, before pre, thought of precede, before... A is difficult to control; B is not limited; C is different from anything in the past; D is a rapid expansion. According to the word meaning, C is correct. This corresponds to the original: This <span class="question6">unprecedented</span> development of a finite groundwater resource with an almost negligible natural recharge rate-that is, <span class="question7">virtually</span> no natural water source to replenish the water supply-has caused water tables in the region to fall drastically.A Unrestricted is slightly derogatory, and the original word is just a fact that is neutral. The rapid expansion of D does not matter, and the three A/B/D options have similarities in meaning, except that C is different. As long as you know that pre is, you must be able to choose the answer.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question7">virtually</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. clearly</p><p>B. perhaps</p><p>C. frequently</p><p>D. almost</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" D"><p>Virtually. Note that virtual has two opposite meanings: virtual and real. Before the dash, we say negligible recharge rate. Supply is negligible. It is rare, but there are still some. There is no water added afterwards. If you choose three things other than almost. It means that there may be no water, which is inconsistent with the original meaning.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, all of following are consequences of the heavy use of the Ogallala aquifer for irrigation EXCEPT:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The recharge rate of the aquifer is decreasing.</p><p>B. Water tables in the region are becoming increasingly lower.</p><p>C. Wells now have to be dug to much greater depths than before.</p><p>D. Increasingly powerful pumps are needed to draw water from the aquifer.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>Virtually. Note that virtual has two opposite meanings: virtual and real. Before the dash, we say negligible recharge rate. Supply is negligible. It is rare, but there are still some. There is no water to add to the explanation. If you choose three items other than almost, It means that there may be no water, which is inconsistent with the original meaning.......</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, compared with all other states that use Ogallala water for irrigation, Texas</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. has the greatest amount of farmland being irrigated with Ogallala water</p><p>B. contains the largest amount of Ogallala water underneath the soil</p><p>C. is expected to face the worst water supply crisis as the Ogallala runs dry</p><p>D. uses the least amount of Ogallala water for its irrigation needs</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>With Texas as the key word to the penultimate sentence, it is said that Texas has the driest climate, the least groundwater, and the most serious problems. C is a synonym for the original text.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question10">inevitable</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. unfortunate</p><p>B. predictable</p><p>C. unavoidable</p><p>D. final</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" C"><p>Inevitable: <span class="question10">inevitable</span>, <span class="question10">inevitable</span>. A is unfortunate; B is unpredictable; C is <span class="question10">inevitable</span>; D is final. According to the word meaning, C is correct. Corresponding to the original text: The reaction of farmers to the <span class="question10">inevitable</span> depletion of the Ogallala varies. The whole story says that the groundwater level is drastically declining. The depletion refers to the use of water. It is certain that the groundwater will use up light. The author is merely stating the facts. There is no good or bad, so unfortunate wrong, do not subjectively guess that the water is not good for the local people; predictable is also foreseeable because the original does not give any predictive information; as far as the word itself is concerned, the in prefix means negative, So the answer must have similar parts, unavoidable is undoubtedly the best option.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Paragraph 5 mentions which of the following as a source of difficulty for some farmers who try to conserve water?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Crops that do not need much water are difficult to grow in the High Plains.</p><p>B. Farmers who grow crops that need a lot of water make higher profits.</p><p>C. Irrigating less frequently often leads to crop failure.</p><p>D. Few farmers are convinced that the aquifer will eventually run dry.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Targeting to the last sentence with some farmers who try to conserve water, saying that those farmers who do not save water do not profit from saving water, only B mentions the profit issue among many options and is the correct answer.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 6, what is the main disadvantage of the proposed plans to transport river water to the High Plains?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The rivers cannot supply sufficient water for the farmer's needs.</p><p>B. Increased irrigation costs would make the products too expensive.</p><p>C. The costs of using capillary water for irrigation will increase.</p><p>D. Farmers will be forced to switch to genetically engineered crops.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The keyword "transport water" is used to locate the first sentence of this paragraph. The beginning of the second sentence unfortunately clearly shows that this sentence will say that a problem caused by transporting water is that the cost is too high and the product price will become uncompetitive. C mentions the cost, and only B mentions that the price of the product is rising and correct.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>But even if uncooperative farmers were to join in the conservation efforts, this would only delay the depletion of the aquifer..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C Two decision points, the first being uncooperative farmers, and the uncooperative peasants, based on this point, A and C are possible answers, and the second point is the concession of even if the sentence to be inserted says even those who are willing Cooperatively, before inserting points correctly, it must be said that those people are not cooperating, so C is the correct answer, and the sentence of many before and after A is very close to the sentence of other, and no sentence is inserted.</p></div></div><div id="question14" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>The Ogallala aquifer is a large underground source of water in the High Plains region of the United States.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.The use of the Ogallala for irrigation has allowed the High Plains to become one of the most productive agricultural regions in the United States.</p><p>B.Given the aquifer's low recharge rate, its use for irrigation is causing water tables to drop and will eventually lead to its depletion.</p><p>C.Releasing capillary water and introducing drought-resistant crops are less-promising solutions to the water supply crisis than bringing in river water</p><p>D.The periodic deepening of wells and the use of more-powerful pumps would help increase the natural recharge rate of the Ogallala.</p><p>E.In Texas, a great deal of attention is being paid to genetic engineering because it is there that the most critical situation exists.</p><p>F.Several solutions to the upcoming water supply crisis have been proposed, but none of them promises to keep the costs of irrigation low.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="ABF"><p>The article title suggests that there are several possible directions for the article: phenomenon explanation, historical process, problem solving.</p><p>The first paragraph and second paragraph of the text station explain Ogallala Aquifer, which is a background introduction.</p><p>The three paragraphs describe the process of OA water resource extraction and economic contribution, suggesting the cause of depletion.</p><p>The first sentence of the four paragraphs summarizes the depletion problem and describes the seriousness of the problem.</p><p>The fifth paragraph introduces the residents' reactions, suggesting that the problem will not be resolved and will be even more serious.</p><p>The final paragraph introduces several possible solutions.
