            <b>Depletion of the Ogallala Aquifer</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>The <span class="underline">vast</span> grasslands of the High Plains in the central United States were settled by farmers and ranchers in the 1880s. This <span class="underline">region</span> has a <span class="underline">semiarid</span> <span class="underline">climate</span>, and for 50 years after its <span class="underline">settlement</span>, it supported a low-intensity agricultural <span class="underline">economy</span> of <span class="underline">cattle</span> ranching and wheat farming. In the early twentieth <span class="underline">century</span>, however, it was discovered that much of the High Plains was underlain by a huge <span class="underline">aquifer</span> (a rock <span class="underline">layer</span> containing large quantities of <span class="underline">groundwater</span>). This <span class="underline">aquifer</span> was named the Ogallala <span class="underline">aquifer</span> after the Ogallala Sioux Indians, who once inhabited the region</p>
          <p>The Ogallala <span class="underline">aquifer</span> is a sandstone <span class="underline">formation</span> that underlies some 583,000 <span class="underline">square</span> kilometers of land extending from northwestern Texas to southern South Dakota. Water from rains and <span class="underline">melting</span> snows has been accumulating in the Ogallala for the past 30,000 years. Estimates <span class="underline">indicate</span> that the <span class="underline">aquifer</span> contains enough water to fill Lake Huron, but <span class="underline">unfortunately</span>, under the <span class="underline">semiarid</span> <span class="underline">climatic</span> conditions that presently exist in the <span class="underline">region</span>, rates of <span class="underline">addition</span> to the <span class="underline">aquifer</span> are <span class="underline">minimal</span>, amounting to about half a centimeter a year.</p>
          <p>The first wells were drilled into the Ogallala during the <span class="underline">drought</span> years of the early 1930s. The ensuing rapid <span class="underline">expansion</span> of <span class="underline">irrigation</span> <span class="underline">agriculture</span>, especially from the 1950s onward, transformed the <span class="underline">economy</span> of the <span class="underline">region</span>. More than 100,000 wells now tap the Ogallala. Modern <span class="underline">irrigation</span> devices, each <span class="underline">capable</span> of spraying 4.5 million liters of water a day, have produced a <span class="underline">landscape</span> dominated by geometric patterns of <span class="underline">circular</span> green islands of crops. Ogallala water has enabled the High Plains <span class="underline">region</span> to <span class="underline">supply</span> <span class="underline">significant</span> amounts of the cotton, sorghum, wheat, and corn grown in the United States. In <span class="underline">addition</span>, 40 percent of American grain-fed beef <span class="underline">cattle</span> are fattened here.</p>
          <p>This <span class="underline">unprecedented</span> <span class="underline">development</span> of a <span class="underline">finite</span> <span class="underline">groundwater</span> <span class="underline">resource</span> with an almost <span class="underline">negligible</span> natural <span class="underline">recharge</span> <span class="underline">rate</span>-that is, <span class="underline">virtually</span> no natural water <span class="underline">source</span> to <span class="underline">replenish</span> the water <span class="underline">supply</span>-has caused water tables in the <span class="underline">region</span> to fall <span class="underline">drastically</span>. In the 1930s, wells encountered <span class="underline">plentiful</span> water at a depth of about 15 meters; currently, they must be dug to depths of 45 to 60 meters or more. In places, the water table is declining at a <span class="underline">rate</span> of a meter a year, necessitating the <span class="underline">periodic</span> deepening of wells and the use of ever-more-powerful pumps. It is estimated that at <span class="underline">current</span> withdrawal rates, much of the <span class="underline">aquifer</span> will run dry <span class="underline">within</span> 40 years. The situation is most <span class="underline">critical</span> in Texas, where the <span class="underline">climate</span> is driest, the greatest <span class="underline">amount</span> of water is being pumped, and the <span class="underline">aquifer</span> contains the <span class="underline">least</span> water. It is projected that the <span class="underline">remaining</span> Ogallala water will, by the year 2030, support only 35 to 40 percent of the irrigated <span class="underline">acreage</span> in Texas that is supported in 1980.</p>
          <p>The <span class="underline">reaction</span> of farmers to the <span class="underline">inevitable</span> depletion of the Ogallala varies. Many have been attempting to <span class="underline">conserve</span> water by irrigating less frequently or by switching to crops 
 that <span class="underline">require</span> less water. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> Others, however, have adopted the <span class="underline">philosophy</span> that it is best to use the water while it is still <span class="underline">economically</span> <span class="underline">profitable</span> to do so and to <span class="underline">concentrate</span> on 
 high-value crops such as cotton.  <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> The <span class="underline">incentive</span> of the farmers who wish to <span class="underline">conserve</span> water is reduced by their knowledge that many of their neighbors are profiting by using great amounts of water,
 and in the <span class="underline">process</span> are drawing down the entire <span class="underline">region</span>'s water supplies. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span></p>
          <p>In the face of the upcoming water <span class="underline">supply</span> crisis, a number of grandiose schemes have been developed to <span class="underline">transport</span> <span class="underline">vast</span> quantities of water by <span class="underline">canal</span> or pipeline from the Mississippi,
 the Missouri, or the Arkansas rivers. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span> <span class="underline">Unfortunately</span>, the <span class="underline">cost</span> of water obtained <span class="underline">through</span> any of these schemes would increase pumping costs at <span class="underline">least</span> tenfold,
 making the <span class="underline">cost</span> of irrigated agricultural products from the <span class="underline">region</span> uncompetitive on the national and international markets.
<span class="underline">Somewhat</span> more <span class="underline">promising</span> have been recent experiments for releasing capillary water (water in the soil) above the water table by injecting compressed <span class="underline">air</span> into the ground.
<span class="underline">Even</span> if this <span class="underline">process</span> proves successful, however, it would almost triple water costs. Genetic <span class="underline">engineering</span> also may provide a <span class="underline">partial</span> <span class="underline">solution</span>,
 as new strains of drought-resistant crops continue to be developed. Whatever the final answer to the water crisis may be, it is <span class="underline">evident</span> that <span class="underline">within</span> the High Plains, 
 <span class="underline">irrigation</span> water will never again be the <span class="underline">abundant</span>, inexpensive <span class="underline">resource</span> it was during the agricultural <span class="underline">boom</span> years of the mid-twentieth <span class="underline">century</span>.</p>
