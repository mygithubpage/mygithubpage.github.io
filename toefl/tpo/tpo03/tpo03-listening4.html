              <span class="time" data-times="8.53" data-time="5.45">[00:05.45]</span>Student: Hi, Professor Archure, you know how in class last week you said you were looking for students who are interested in volunteering for your archeology <span class="underline">project</span>? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.05" data-time="13.98">[00:13.98]</span>Professor: Of <span class="underline">course</span>, are you volunteering? </p>

              <span class="time" data-times="0.73" data-time="16.03">[00:16.03]</span>Student: Yes, I am. <span class="time" data-times="6.31" data-time="16.76">[00:16.76]</span>It sounds really interesting, but er... do I need to have any experience for these kinds of projects? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.33" data-time="23.07">[00:23.07]</span>Professor: No, not really. <span class="time" data-times="8.05" data-time="24.4">[00:24.40]</span>I <span class="underline">assume</span> that most students taking the <span class="underline">introductory</span> <span class="underline">level</span> of class would have little or no experience with the archeological research, but that's ok. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.06" data-time="32.45">[00:32.45]</span>Student: Oh, good, that's a <span class="underline">relief</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.7" data-time="34.51">[00:34.51]</span>Actually, that's why I'm volunteering for the <span class="underline">project</span> - to get experience. <span class="time" data-times="1.5" data-time="39.21">[00:39.21]</span>What kind of work is it? </p>

              <span class="time" data-times="2.22" data-time="86.39">[01:26.39]</span>Professor: That's right, no traveling involved. <span class="time" data-times="4.91" data-time="88.61">[01:28.61]</span>I wouldn't <span class="underline">expect</span> volunteers to travel to a site, especially in the middle of the <span class="underline">semester</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.36" data-time="93.52">[01:33.52]</span>We <span class="underline">expect</span> to find many more things, but we do need more people to help. </p>

            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.89" data-time="120.27">[02:00.27]</span>Professor: I think it'll <span class="underline">depend</span> on what type of work you do in the <span class="underline">excavation</span>, but I imagine we can <span class="underline">arrange</span> something. <span class="time" data-times="6.56" data-time="127.16">[02:07.16]</span>Actually I've been considering offering <span class="underline">extra</span> <span class="underline">credit</span> for class because I've been having a <span class="underline">tough</span> time getting volunteers. <span class="time" data-times="3.65" data-time="133.72">[02:13.72]</span> <span class="underline">Extra</span> <span class="underline">credit</span> is always a good <span class="underline">incentive</span> for students. </p>
