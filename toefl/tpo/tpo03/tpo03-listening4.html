To ask about a class assignment.</p><p>B. To find out about a midsemester project.</p><p>C. To get information about summer jobs.</p><p>D. To discuss ways to improve his grade.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Hi, Professor Archure, you know how in class last week you said you were looking for students who are interested in volunteering for your archeology project? The first question shows that the purpose of the student to find the professor is for that archeological project. A, C, D are not mentioned.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What was originally located on the site of the lecture hall?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. A farmhouse.</p><p>B. A pottery factory.</p><p>C. A clothing store.</p><p>D. A bottle-manufacturing plant.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>Well, as you know, we're studying the history of the campus this semester. This used to be agricultural agricultural and we already know that where the main lecture hall now stands, there once were farm house and barn that were erected in the Late 1700s. The predecessor of lecture hall from the corresponding text was a farm house.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is mentioned as an advantage of working on this project?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Off-campus travel is paid off.</p><p>B. Students can leave class early.</p><p>C. The location is convenient.</p><p>D. It fulfills a graduation requirement.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Wow, and it's all right here on campus.</p><p>Professor : That's right, no traveling involved. Especially in the middle of the semester. It can be seen from the tone of the students and the teacher's statement that the convenience of this project is that it has no travel on campus so it is C. D is not an advantage. A, B are irrelevant options.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the professor considering doing to get more volunteers?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

Providing flexible work schedules.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>There er... is there any way I can use the experience to get some extra credit in class?</p><p>Actually I've been caused by the problem providing extra credit for class because I've been having a tough time getting volunteers. Extra credit is always a good incentive for students. After the boys ask questions, the next Pro's answer is the answer to this question. Obviously none of the BCD has been mentioned.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What information does the student still need to get from the professor?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

I want to wait still Friday to see how many students volunteer, and then I'll schedule the training class next week at a time that's convenient for everyone.</p><p>Student : Ok. I'll wait to hear from you. Thanks a lot for accepting me From the set of questions and answers at the end of the conversation, you can hear that Pro hasn't determined the training session yet, so this is what the student still needs to know. D answered the pro before the conversation.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
