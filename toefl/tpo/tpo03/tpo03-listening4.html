              <span class="time" data-times="2.54" data-time="101.37">[01:41.37]</span>Professor: I'm hoping to get five or six. <span class="time" data-times="4.24" data-time="103.91">[01:43.91]</span>I've asked for volunteers in all of the classes I teach, but no one has responded. <span class="time" data-times="2.19" data-time="108.15">[01:48.15]</span>You are the first person to express <span class="highlight">interest</span>. </p>

            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.89" data-time="120.27">[02:00.27]</span>Professor: I think it'll <span class="highlight">depend</span> on what type of work you do in the <span class="highlight">excavation</span>, but I imagine we can <span class="highlight">arrange</span> something. <span class="time" data-times="6.56" data-time="127.16">[02:07.16]</span>Actually I've been considering offering <span class="highlight">extra</span> <span class="highlight">credit</span> for class because I've been having a <span class="highlight">tough</span> time getting volunteers. <span class="time" data-times="3.65" data-time="133.72">[02:13.72]</span> <span class="highlight">Extra</span> <span class="highlight">credit</span> is always a good <span class="highlight">incentive</span> for students. </p>
