          <h4 class="w3-center">Energy and the Industrial Revolution</h4>
          <p>For years historians have sought to <span class="highlight">identify</span> <span class="highlight">crucial</span> elements in the eighteenth-century rise in <span class="highlight">industry</span>, technology, and <span class="highlight">economic</span> power known as the <span class="highlight">Industrial</span> <span class="highlight">Revolution</span>, and many give <span class="highlight">prominence</span> to <span class="question2">the problem of energy.</span> Until the eighteenth <span class="highlight">century</span>, people relied on energy derived from plants as well as animal and human <span class="highlight">muscle</span> to provide power. Increased <span class="highlight">efficiency</span> in the use of water and wind helped with such tasks as pumping, milling, or sailing. However, by the eighteenth <span class="highlight">century</span>, Great Britain in <span class="highlight">particular</span> was experiencing an energy <span class="highlight">shortage</span>. Wood, the <span class="highlight">primary</span> <span class="highlight">source</span> of heat for homes and industries and also used in the iron <span class="highlight">industry</span> as processed <span class="highlight">charcoal</span>, was diminishing in <span class="highlight">supply</span>. <span class="question1">Great Britain had large amounts of <span class="highlight">coal</span></span> ; however, there were not yet <span class="highlight">efficient</span> means by which to produce <span class="highlight">mechanical</span> energy or to power <span class="highlight">machinery</span>. This was to <span class="highlight">occur</span> with progress in the <span class="highlight">development</span> of the steam <span class="highlight">engine</span>.</p>
          <p>In the late 1700s James Watt designed an <span class="highlight">efficient</span> and commercially <span class="highlight">viable</span> steam <span class="highlight">engine</span> that was soon applied to a <span class="highlight">variety</span> of <span class="highlight">industrial</span> uses as it became cheaper to use. The <span class="highlight">engine</span> helped solve the problem of draining <span class="highlight">coal</span> mines of <span class="highlight">groundwater</span> and increased the production of <span class="highlight">coal</span> needed to power steam engines elsewhere. A rotary <span class="highlight">engine</span> attached to the steam <span class="highlight">engine</span> enabled shafts to be turned and machines to be driven, resulting in mills using steam power to <span class="highlight">spin</span> and <span class="highlight">weave</span> cotton. Since the steam <span class="highlight">engine</span> was fired by <span class="highlight">coal</span>, the large mills did not need to be located by rivers, as had mills that used water- driven machines. The <span class="highlight">shift</span> to increased mechanization in cotton production is <span class="question4"><span class="highlight">apparent</span> in</span> the <span class="highlight">import</span> of <span class="highlight">raw</span> cotton and the sale of cotton goods. Between 1760 and 1850, the <span class="highlight">amount</span> of <span class="highlight">raw</span> cotton imported increased 230 times. Production of British cotton goods increased sixtyfold, and cotton cloth became Great Britain's most important product, <span class="highlight">accounting</span> for one-half of all exports. The success of the steam <span class="highlight">engine</span> resulted in increased demands for <span class="highlight">coal</span>, and the <span class="highlight"><span class="question6">consequent</span></span> increase in <span class="highlight">coal</span> production was made possible as the steam-powered pumps drained water from the ever-deeper <span class="highlight">coal</span> seams found below the water table.</p>
          <p>The <span class="highlight">availability</span> of steam power and the demands for new machines facilitated the <span class="highlight">transformation</span> of the iron <span class="highlight">industry</span>. <span class="highlight">Charcoal</span>, made from wood and thus in limited <span class="highlight">supply</span>, was replaced with coal-derived coke (<span class="highlight">substance</span> left after <span class="highlight">coal</span> is heated) as steam-driven <span class="highlight">bellows</span> came into use for producing of <span class="highlight">raw</span> iron. Impurities were burnt away with the use of coke, producing a high-quality <span class="highlight">refined</span> iron. Reduced <span class="highlight">cost</span> was also <span class="highlight">instrumental</span> in developing steam-powered rolling mills <span class="highlight">capable</span> of producing finished iron of various shapes and sizes. The resulting <span class="highlight">boom</span> in the iron <span class="highlight">industry</span> expanded the <span class="highlight">annual</span> iron <span class="highlight">output</span> by more than 170 times between 1740 and 1840, and by the 1850s Great Britain was producing more tons of iron than the rest of the world combined. The developments in the iron <span class="highlight">industry</span> were in part a <span class="highlight">response</span> to the demand for more machines and the ever-widening use of higher-quality iron in other industries.</p>
          <p>Steam power and iron combined to revolutionize <span class="highlight">transport</span>, which in turn had further implications. Improvements in road <span class="highlight">construction</span> and sailing had occurred, but shipping heavy <span class="highlight">freight</span> over 
land remained expensive, <span class="highlight">even</span> with the use of rivers and canals wherever possible. Parallel rails had long been used in <span class="highlight">mining</span> operations to move bigger loads, but horses were still the <span class="highlight">primary</span> <span class="highlight">source</span> of power. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>However, the arrival of the steam <span class="highlight">engine</span> <span class="question10">initiated</span> a complete <span class="highlight">transformation</span> in rail <span class="highlight">transportation</span>, entrenching and expanding the <span class="highlight">Industrial</span> <span class="highlight">Revolution</span>.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>As <span class="highlight">transportation</span> improved, <span class="highlight">distant</span> and larger markets <span class="highlight">within</span> the nation could be reached, <span class="highlight">thereby</span> encouraging the <span class="highlight">development</span> of larger factories to keep pace with increasing sales.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>Greater <span class="highlight">productivity</span> and rising demands provided entrepreneurs with profits that could be reinvested to take <span class="highlight">advantage</span> of new technologies to further <span class="highlight">expand</span> <span class="highlight">capacity</span>, or to seek <span class="highlight">alternative</span>
investment opportunities. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>Also, the <span class="highlight">availability</span> of jobs in railway <span class="highlight">construction</span> attracted many <span class="highlight">rural</span> laborers <span class="question12"><span class="highlight">accustomed</span> to</span> <span class="highlight">seasonal</span> and <span class="highlight">temporary</span> <span class="highlight">employment</span>. When the work was completed, 
many moved to other <span class="highlight">construction</span> jobs or to factory work in cities and towns, where they became part of an expanding working class.</p>

              <p>C See the previous point in this sentence. The wood in the previous sentence is not an opinion. Look ahead and say that Great Britain inparticular was experiencing an energy shortage. This is a point of view. The shaded sentence says that Britain has a large amount of coal, and it is followed by a whoever, because it is not efficient; therefore, the C option says that the UK's energy shortage is not because the fuel shortage is correct. The analysis of other options, Option A, is against the previous point of view. It is wrong, because the example will always support the point of view, unless there is a new point of view, and however in the article is not efficient enough to further explain the point of view. Both the B and D options do not illustrate the previous point.</p>

So the positioning sentence is: and cotton cloth became Great Britain's most important product, accounting for one-half of all exports. The answer is B. Tips: Positioning tips, in addition to using noun positioning, we should pay attention to the stem, adverbs, adjectives; other verbs often indicate logic. For example, result in cause and effect.</p>

This paragraph mainly means that the steam engine invented by Watt is used in many industries, and the details of many applications are listed in the paragraph. While the first paragraph is talking about the factors that discuss the industrial revolution, the end of the paragraph emphasizes that the steam engine may have played a role. From this point of view, the second paragraph is followed by the first paragraph, which specifically shows the role of the steam engine in the industrial revolution. Corresponds to the D option. A option, said the details, with no relation to the full text; B option, and later also extended quickly, did not mention the original; C option, the original industry did not issue.</p>

The A option as steam-driven bellows came into use for producing of raw iron B options the 1850s Great Britain was producing more tons of iron than the rest of the world combined C option steam-powered rolling mills capable of producing finished iron of various shapes and The sizes.D option says that Reduced cost was also instrumental instead of increasing the price. Tips: The EXCEPT questions examine the ability to check long sentences, and ETS tends to give the best answers. This is to make sure that all options are checked and that when you encounter the wrong option, you can simply select one. EXCEPT's decentralized list of questions, from the back to the front of the nuclear comparison is better, saving time.</p>
