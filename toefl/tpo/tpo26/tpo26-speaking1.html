I am interested in reading them because I've watched all the movies and I think they are awesome. The stories have opened a new world to me. In this magic world, I can do everything and at least temporarily forget all the worries in the real world. Besides, People who have read the books told me that there are more details in the books and stories are more exciting. There are even some strange characters that didn't get filmed into the movie.
