It uses artistic methods more than scientific ones.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="BC"><p>Very good. Not just art. (C)</p><p>There's a lot of interdisciplinary work. (B)</p><p>What do the professors say about the protection of the arts? Answer: 1. There are many interdisciplinary tasks. People from different fields may work together to solve a work of art. 2. Not just artwork, old artifacts are also valuable when they show early technology.

The overall grip. From the original text, we can see why the professor mentioned that the initial ink in the manuscript contains iron? Answer: So he thought of a method similar to watching iron in spinach to see the iron in parchment. It was concluded that in order to explain why X-rays were used to study parchment.</p></div></div><div class="replay" id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor say this:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.
