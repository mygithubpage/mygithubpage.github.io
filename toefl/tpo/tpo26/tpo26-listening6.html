            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="11.39" data-time="4.12">[00:04.12]</span>Professor: So far we have been talking all <span class="underline">semester</span> about restoring and preserving pieces of art, like <span class="underline">ancient</span> frescos, early oil paintings, etc.. <span class="time" data-times="7.08" data-time="15.51">[00:15.51]</span>But although our <span class="underline">field</span> is called art <span class="underline">conservation</span>, it also involves...what? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.1" data-time="22.59">[00:22.59]</span>Student: Um. . . preserving other types of cultural materials too. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="0.98" data-time="26.69">[00:26.69]</span>Professor: Very good. <span class="time" data-times="1.84" data-time="27.67">[00:27.67]</span>Not just art. <span class="time" data-times="8.06" data-time="29.51">[00:29.51]</span>Old artifacts are very <span class="underline">valuable</span> when they <span class="underline">represent</span> early technologies, all <span class="underline">contain</span> important historical information. <span class="time" data-times="3.11" data-time="37.57">[00:37.57]</span>In fact, let me give you an example. <span class="time" data-times="6.34" data-time="40.68">[00:40.68]</span>You've heard about the Greek <span class="underline">scholar</span> <span class="underline">Archimedes</span>, who lived more than 2, 000 years ago, I am sure. <span class="time" data-times="4.67" data-time="47.02">[00:47.02]</span> <span class="underline">Archimedes</span> was a great <span class="underline">mathematician</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.6" data-time="51.69">[00:51.69]</span>For example, he discovered the formula for the <span class="underline">volume</span> of a <span class="underline">sphere</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.32" data-time="56.29">[00:56.29]</span>Not much of his work has survived, but what has survived is <span class="underline">brilliant</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.46" data-time="62.61">[01:02.61]</span>And then in 1906, a Palimpsest of <span class="underline">Archimedes</span>' writing was discovered. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.75" data-time="69.07">[01:09.07]</span>Now, a palimpsest is a type of <span class="underline">manuscript</span> that contains writing that's hidden because something else was written over it later. <span class="time" data-times="1.72" data-time="79.82">[01:19.82]</span>I'll explain in a <span class="underline">minute</span>.<span class="time" data-times="8.42" data-time="81.54">[01:21.54]</span> This <span class="underline">Archimedes</span> palimpsest, as it's now called, is by far the most important palimpsest anyone has ever seen. <span class="time" data-times="7.67" data-time="89.96">[01:29.96]</span>Because it contains the only known existing copy of <span class="underline">Archimedes</span>' treatise, called <span class="underline">Method</span>. <span class="time" data-times="12.09" data-time="97.63">[01:37.63]</span> <span class="underline">Archimedes</span> shows in it how math can be applied to physics and <span class="underline">physical</span> reasoning back to math problems, which is how he calculated the <span class="underline">volume</span> of the <span class="underline">sphere</span>, for example. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.49" data-time="109.72">[01:49.72]</span>This may be <span class="underline">commonplace</span> today, but was <span class="underline">revolutionary</span> in his time. <span class="time" data-times="6.48" data-time="117.21">[01:57.21]</span>A few years ago, the palimpsest was sold at an <span class="underline">auction</span> for 2 million dollars. <span class="time" data-times="16.46" data-time="123.69">[02:03.69]</span>It could have ended up tucked away in a private collection, but fortunately, the collector who bought it has agreed to have experts <span class="underline">restore</span> every single word <span class="underline">Archimedes</span> wrote, so the contents can be shared with the world and studied. <span class="time" data-times="3.09" data-time="140.15">[02:20.15]</span>But there are two main problems.<span class="time" data-times="3.69" data-time="143.24">[02:23.24]</span> What do you think the first one might be? Jennifer? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.18" data-time="146.93">[02:26.93]</span>Student: Um...well, it sounds like it's extremely old.<span class="time" data-times="4.18" data-time="153.11">[02:33.11]</span> So probably some pages are at the point of crumbling into dust? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.35" data-time="157.29">[02:37.29]</span>Professor: True. And some are moldy, and some were eaten away at by bookworms.<span class="time" data-times="2.6" data-time="162.64">[02:42.64]</span>This thing's really <span class="underline">decayed</span>.<span class="time" data-times="2.63" data-time="165.24">[02:45.24]</span> But on top of that, there's another <span class="underline">issue</span>.<span class="time" data-times="2.7" data-time="167.87">[02:47.87]</span> And this is the <span class="underline">reason</span> why it's a palimpsest. <span class="time" data-times="8" data-time="170.57">[02:50.57]</span>You see, the text apparently sat around in a library in Constantinople until 1229 A.D. <span class="time" data-times="10.25" data-time="178.57">[02:58.57]</span>But then a scribe erased, scraped away the writing as clean as he could in order to use the pages to write his own book on. <span class="time" data-times="1.93" data-time="188.82">[03:08.82]</span>Why would he do that? <span class="time" data-times="1.78" data-time="190.75">[03:10.75]</span>Take a guess. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.83" data-time="192.53">[03:12.53]</span>Student: Must have been a paper <span class="underline">shortage</span>? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.93" data-time="196.36">[03:16.36]</span>Professor: Well? They used <span class="underline">parchment</span> to write on, but yes, there was a <span class="underline">parchment</span> <span class="underline">shortage</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.15" data-time="202.29">[03:22.29]</span>Student: So you are saying the <span class="underline">parchment</span> was basically recycled? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="13.67" data-time="206.44">[03:26.44]</span>Professor: Correct. Then, <span class="underline">even</span> later on, in the twentieth <span class="underline">century</span>, a forger painted <span class="underline">ancient</span>-looking pictures on several of the pages in order to make the book <span class="underline">seem</span> older and increase its value.<span class="time" data-times="4.83" data-time="220.11">[03:40.11]</span>So <span class="underline">unfortunately</span>, that's quite a <span class="underline">history</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.5" data-time="224.94">[03:44.94]</span>Student: But professor Wilkens, if the scribe scraped away <span class="underline">Archimedes</span>' words and if these paintings covered the pages, how can the <span class="underline">original</span> work be recovered? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.37" data-time="234.44">[03:54.44]</span>Professor: Ah, that's why I am telling you the story. <span class="time" data-times="3.94" data-time="237.81">[03:57.81]</span>That's our task as conservationists, isn't it? <span class="time" data-times="1.85" data-time="241.75">[04:01.75]</span>To find a way.<span class="time" data-times="4.53" data-time="243.6">[04:03.60]</span>There were still <span class="underline">faint</span> traces of <span class="underline">Archimedes</span>' words on the pages.<span class="time" data-times="8.4" data-time="248.13">[04:08.13]</span>First, we tried to make the <span class="underline">Archimedes</span>' words stand out with a <span class="underline">variety</span> of technologies, using <span class="underline">ultraviolet</span> light. <span class="time" data-times="2.83" data-time="256.53">[04:16.53]</span>But that didn't work on every page.<span class="time" data-times="6.94" data-time="259.36">[04:19.36]</span> But then, there was this new idea that came from a scientist studying <span class="underline">spinach</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.23" data-time="266.3">[04:26.30]</span>Student: <span class="underline">Spinach</span>? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.94" data-time="267.53">[04:27.53]</span>Professor: Yes. <span class="underline">Spinach</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.31" data-time="269.47">[04:29.47]</span>This physicist, Uwe Bergman, does research that involves studying iron in <span class="underline">spinach</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.57" data-time="276.78">[04:36.78]</span>He was reading an article about problems with the palimpsest and it said that there is iron in the <span class="underline">original</span> <span class="underline">Archimedes</span>' ink. <span class="time" data-times="9.45" data-time="285.35">[04:45.35]</span>So he came up with an idea to use the same <span class="underline">method</span> of looking at iron in <span class="underline">spinach</span> to view the iron on the palimpsest pages.<span class="time" data-times="2.87" data-time="294.8">[04:54.80]</span> And his idea worked. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="18.17" data-time="297.67">[04:57.67]</span> Bergman's <span class="underline">technique</span> allows X-rays to pass <span class="underline">through</span> the forged paintings, pass <span class="underline">through</span> the scribe's writing to hit the iron traces from the ink of the <span class="underline">original</span> <span class="underline">Archimedes</span>' text and create an <span class="underline">image</span> just of the iron on the pages. <span class="time" data-times="5.28" data-time="315.84">[05:15.84]</span>The iron-based letters <span class="underline">seem</span> to just pop off the page. <span class="time" data-times="7.29" data-time="321.12">[05:21.12]</span>The <span class="underline">original</span> text and diagrams emerged, <span class="underline">line</span> by <span class="underline">line</span>, <span class="underline">diagram</span> after <span class="underline">diagram</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.5" data-time="328.41">[05:28.41]</span>And that's kind of <span class="underline">typical</span> of our <span class="underline">field</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.12" data-time="331.91">[05:31.91]</span>There's a lot of interdisciplinary work. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="335.03">[05:35.03]</span>People from several different fields might be involved in working with a single art. </p>
