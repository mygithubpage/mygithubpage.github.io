            <span class="time" data-times="10.75" data-time="69.07">[01:09.07]</span>Now, a palimpsest is a type of <span class="highlight">manuscript</span> that contains writing that's hidden because something else was written over it later. <span class="time" data-times="1.72" data-time="79.82">[01:19.82]</span>I'll explain in a <span class="highlight">minute</span>.<span class="time" data-times="8.42" data-time="81.54">[01:21.54]</span> This <span class="highlight">Archimedes</span> palimpsest, as it's now called, is by far the most important palimpsest anyone has ever seen. <span class="time" data-times="7.67" data-time="89.96">[01:29.96]</span>Because it contains the only known existing copy of <span class="highlight">Archimedes</span>' treatise, called <span class="highlight">Method</span>. <span class="time" data-times="12.09" data-time="97.63">[01:37.63]</span> <span class="highlight">Archimedes</span> shows in it how math can be applied to physics and <span class="highlight">physical</span> reasoning back to math problems, which is how he calculated the <span class="highlight">volume</span> of the <span class="highlight">sphere</span>, for example. </p>

            <span class="time" data-times="5.35" data-time="157.29">[02:37.29]</span>Professor: True.

            <span class="time" data-times="3.83" data-time="192.53">[03:12.53]</span>Student: Must have been a paper <span class="highlight">shortage</span>? </p>

          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.15" data-time="202.29">[03:22.29]</span>Student: So you are saying the <span class="highlight">parchment</span> was basically recycled? </p>

            <span class="time" data-times="13.67" data-time="206.44">[03:26.44]</span>Professor: Correct. Then, <span class="highlight">even</span> later on, in the twentieth <span class="highlight">century</span>, a forger painted <span class="highlight">ancient</span>-looking pictures on several of the pages in order to make the book <span class="highlight">seem</span> older and increase its value.<span class="time" data-times="4.83" data-time="220.11">[03:40.11]</span>So <span class="highlight">unfortunately</span>, that's quite a <span class="highlight">history</span>. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="9.5" data-time="224.94">[03:44.94]</span>Student: But professor Wilkens, if the scribe scraped away <span class="highlight">Archimedes</span>' words and if these paintings covered the pages, how can the <span class="highlight">original</span> work be recovered? </p>

            <span class="time" data-times="3.37" data-time="234.44">[03:54.44]</span>Professor: Ah, that's why I am telling you the story. <span class="time" data-times="3.94" data-time="237.81">[03:57.81]</span>That's our task as conservationists, isn't it? <span class="time" data-times="1.85" data-time="241.75">[04:01.75]</span>To find a way.<span class="time" data-times="4.53" data-time="243.6">[04:03.60]</span>There were still <span class="highlight">faint</span> traces of <span class="highlight">Archimedes</span>' words on the pages.<span class="time" data-times="8.4" data-time="248.13">[04:08.13]</span>First, we tried to make the <span class="highlight">Archimedes</span>' words stand out with a <span class="highlight">variety</span> of technologies, using <span class="highlight">ultraviolet</span> light. <span class="time" data-times="2.83" data-time="256.53">[04:16.53]</span>But that didn't work on every page.<span class="time" data-times="6.94" data-time="259.36">[04:19.36]</span> But then, there was this new idea that came from a scientist studying <span class="highlight">spinach</span>. </p>

              <p>There's a lot of interdisciplinary work. (B)</p>
              <p>What do the professors say about the protection of the arts? Answer: 1. There are many interdisciplinary tasks. People from different fields may work together to solve a work of art. 2. Not just artwork, old artifacts are also valuable when they show early technology. These have important historical information.</p>
