            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.88" data-time="5.1">[00:05.10]</span>Professor: Last class someone asked about green marketing.<span class="time" data-times="5.53" data-time="9.98">[00:09.98]</span> Green marketing refers to companies promoting the products as environmentally friendly. <span class="time" data-times="4.28" data-time="15.51">[00:15.51]</span>Companies often turn to advertising experts to help them do this. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.08" data-time="19.79">[00:19.79]</span>Green marketing seems recent, but advertising professionals grew <span class="underline">interest</span> in it several decades ago.<span class="time" data-times="7.76" data-time="26.87">[00:26.87]</span>The seeds for green marketing were probably planted in 1970, when the first Earth Day took place. <span class="time" data-times="6.02" data-time="34.63">[00:34.63]</span>Rallies all over the United States were organized to <span class="underline">protest</span> <span class="underline">environmental</span> <span class="underline">degradation</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.68" data-time="40.65">[00:40.65]</span>Some 20 million demonstrators participated in that first Earth Day.<span class="time" data-times="3.49" data-time="46.33">[00:46.33]</span> And it helped <span class="underline">spark</span> dozens of <span class="underline">environmental</span> laws.<span class="time" data-times="8.27" data-time="49.82">[00:49.82]</span>The biggest was the <span class="underline">Endangered</span> <span class="underline">Species</span> Act of 1973, which protects imperiled animal <span class="underline">species</span> from <span class="underline">extinction</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.88" data-time="58.09">[00:58.09]</span>There was also <span class="underline">passage</span> of the Clean Water Act and the Clean <span class="underline">Air</span> Act was strengthened. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.15" data-time="63.97">[01:03.97]</span>Earth Day, <span class="underline">Environmental</span> Laws, <span class="underline">Environmental</span> Issues in the news, Being Green was entering the mainstream.<span class="time" data-times="4.15" data-time="72.12">[01:12.12]</span>And business started saying, hey, we can get involved in this. <span class="time" data-times="7.92" data-time="76.27">[01:16.27]</span>So in 1975, a <span class="underline">major</span> advertising <span class="underline">trade</span> group held its first workshop on <span class="underline">ecological</span> marketing. <span class="time" data-times="6.57" data-time="84.19">[01:24.19]</span>A few years later, we began seeing ads tapping into people's <span class="underline">environmental</span> concerns. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.34" data-time="90.76">[01:30.76]</span>But some green marketers learned the hard way, green marketing must still <span class="underline">involve</span> all the same principles of a <span class="underline">traditional</span> marketing <span class="underline">campaign</span>. <span class="time" data-times="12.12" data-time="100.1">[01:40.10]</span>You ad must <span class="underline">attract</span> <span class="underline">attention</span>, <span class="underline">stimulate</span> consumers' <span class="underline">interest</span>, create a <span class="underline">desire</span> for your product, and <span class="underline">motivate</span> people to take <span class="underline">action</span> to buy your product. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.62" data-time="112.22">[01:52.22]</span>So let me tell you about one green marketing <span class="underline">campaign</span> that failed at first and explain why. <span class="time" data-times="3.43" data-time="117.84">[01:57.84]</span>It was a <span class="underline">compact</span> fluorescent light <span class="underline">bulb</span>. <span class="time" data-times="1.85" data-time="121.27">[02:01.27]</span>We'll call it the eco-light. <span class="time" data-times="4.35" data-time="123.12">[02:03.12]</span>It was first introduced, I believe, in the late 90s. <span class="time" data-times="3.79" data-time="127.47">[02:07.47]</span>It <span class="underline">cost</span> far more than a <span class="underline">regular</span> incandescent <span class="underline">bulb</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.12" data-time="131.26">[02:11.26]</span>The advertising message was, basically, "use this eco-light and <span class="underline">save</span> the <span class="underline">planet</span>". </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.39" data-time="137.38">[02:17.38]</span>But that message wasn't <span class="underline">effective</span>.<span class="time" data-times="9.27" data-time="139.77">[02:19.77]</span> Research shows that consumers don't want to let go off any <span class="underline">traditional</span> product attributes, like <span class="underline">convenience</span>, price and <span class="underline">quality</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.82" data-time="149.04">[02:29.04]</span> <span class="underline">Even</span> though surveys <span class="underline">indicate</span> that almost everybody cares about the environment. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.45" data-time="153.86">[02:33.86]</span>So the <span class="underline">company</span> reintroduced the eco-light with a new message, one that emphasized <span class="underline">cost</span> savings, that the eco-light lowers electric bills and lasts for years. <span class="time" data-times="6.71" data-time="164.31">[02:44.31]</span>So it's good for earth, cost-effective and <span class="underline">convenient</span> because it doesn't have to be changed every few months.<span class="time" data-times="3.65" data-time="171.02">[02:51.02]</span> This ad <span class="underline">campaign</span> worked like a charm. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="17.65" data-time="174.67">[02:54.67]</span>Something else, uh, the <span class="underline">company</span> that makes the co-light, researchers would <span class="underline">consider</span> it an '<span class="underline">extreme</span> green <span class="underline">company</span>', not only because its product are energy-efficient, but because the <span class="underline">company</span> tries to reduce its <span class="underline">environmental</span> <span class="underline">impact</span> in other ways too.<span class="time" data-times="10.95" data-time="192.32">[03:12.32]</span>Like in <span class="underline">addition</span> to selling Earth- friendly products, its offices and factories are designed to <span class="underline">conserve</span> energy and use all sorts of recycled materials. <span class="time" data-times="7.16" data-time="203.27">[03:23.27]</span>A <span class="underline">company</span> that only recycles office paper, researchers would <span class="underline">classify</span> as a 'lean green <span class="underline">company</span>'. <span class="time" data-times="3.39" data-time="210.43">[03:30.43]</span>And there are other degrees of greenness in between. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.27" data-time="213.82">[03:33.82]</span>So if your green marketing <span class="underline">strategy</span>'s <span class="underline">gonna</span> work, your message should be <span class="underline">valid</span> on all dimensions. <span class="time" data-times="7.61" data-time="222.09">[03:42.09]</span>When a <span class="underline">company</span> as a whole is credited for reducing its <span class="underline">environmental</span> <span class="underline">impact</span>, this can <span class="underline">lead</span> to <span class="underline">brand</span> loyalty.<span class="time" data-times="3.64" data-time="229.7">[03:49.70]</span>People will come back and buy your product more and more. <span class="time" data-times="7.91" data-time="233.34">[03:53.34]</span>However, let's say you're fine for violating the Clean Water Act while manufacturing products from recycled materials. <span class="time" data-times="2.54" data-time="241.25">[04:01.25]</span>The public would <span class="underline">eventually</span> find out. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="243.79">[04:03.79]</span>You can't just make the <span class="underline">claim</span> that a product is environmentally friendly and not follow <span class="underline">through</span> on. </p>
