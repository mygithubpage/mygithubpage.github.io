          <p>Now listen to a conversation between two students. </p>
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>(man) Hey, Mary, how's your volunteer work going? You're still involved in that after-school program with the elementary kids? </p>
          <p>(woman) Yeah, but I've got a problem. I am supposed to be driving a bunch of them to the zoo tomorrow. (man) Yeah? </p>
          <p>(woman) And I was supposed to rent a van for the trip. But I waited too long to call the rental agency to reserve one. </p>
          <p>(man) Oh! </p>
          <p>(woman) Now it turns out they don't have any vans available for tomorrow. I don't know what to do? These kids will be really disappointed if their trip gets cancelled. (man) Hmmm, well, doesn't one of your friends on campus have a car? I mean, couldn't you borrow it for the day? </p>
          <p>(woman) Yeah, probably, but I'd need to borrow two cars or there wouldn't be enough space for all the kids. </p>
          <p>(man) Um, hum. </p>
          <p>(woman) That's why I was going to rent the van. And then I'd need to find somebody else to drive, too. I can't drive two cars by myself. </p>
          <p>(man) Yeah, that's true. Well, I am sure you can probably find a volunteer or if you wanted to save yourself the trouble of hunting down a second driver, what about public transportation? Check the bus schedule, I think there's a bus line that goes right past the zoo. </p>
          <p>(woman) Yeah, that's a possibility, but I don't know, it might be a real challenge supervising the kids on the bus. (man) Ha, ha... </p>
          <p>(woman) Sometimes they are a handful when they get excited. It's an option, though. </p>
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>The man's having a problem with his rock and roll concert: he wanted to have the concert in the campus auditorium but the auditorium has been already booked for the next few weekends. Accordingly, there are two solutions: first, he could reschedule his performance next Wednesday night, the only time that the auditorium is available; or he could play his performance with some of his friends on weekends in the campus auditorium. I guess the man should share his show with his friends for several reasons. Firstly, the man and his band could learn a lot from performing with his friends, because it's his band's debut and he might be inexperienced to handle everything of details well. But by singing and playing together with some other band, the man and his band could be more relaxed and more importantly learn more practical stage experience. On top of that, any weekends concert will be always the most welcome one on campus, since most of the students only relax themselves and go to enjoy some live entertainment show on weekends not during the weekdays. So I strongly recommend the man's band join his friend's band and performance together. (193 words)</p>
