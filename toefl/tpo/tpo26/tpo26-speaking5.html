We've been practicing a couple of months and I think we're ready to have a concert.</p><p>(woman) Great, are you gonna have the show soon?</p><p>(man) Yeah, hopefully sometime in the next couple of weeks. We're all pretty busy but I think we can squeeze in a show before summer starts and everyone goes away.</p><p>(woman) Cool! Where's it gonna be?</p><p>(man) We wanted to do it in the campus auditorium. We play rock and roll. It's kind of loud so it'd sound great in there. Problem is the auditorium's already booked for the next few weekends.</p><p>(woman) So what are you gonna do?</p><p>(man) Well, there are no weekends left before summer but there is an opening next Wednesday night, we could do the show then.</p><p>(woman) That could be good, I mean, concerts are usually on the weekends, but it'll be something fun for people to do in the middle of the week.</p><p>(man) Yeah, that's true. It's just that, well, there'll probably be a smaller audience on a Wednesday which might be kind of disappointing.</p><p>(woman) Well, yeah</p><p>(man) But there is one other option. We're friends with people in another band. They're gonna be performing in the auditorium next Saturday. And they actually said they'd be willing to let us perform with them.</p><p>(woman) Wow! That's really nice of them.</p><p>(man) Yeah, we'd play for a little while and then they'd play the rest of the night as scheduled.</p><p>(woman) Sounds good.</p><p>(man) Yeah, only catch is we wouldn't have much time to perform so we wouldn't be able to do all the songs we've been preparing.</p></article><section id="question"><h4>Question</h4><p>Briefly summarize the problem the speakers are discussing. Then state which solution you would recommend. Explain the reasons for your recommendation. </p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>The man's having a problem with his rock and roll concert: he wanted to have the concert in the campus auditorium but the auditorium has been already booked for the next few weekends. Accordingly, there are two solutions: first, he could reschedule his performance next Wednesday night, the only time that the auditorium is available; or he could play his performance with some of his friends on weekends in the campus auditorium. I guess the man should share his show with his friends for several reasons. Firstly, the man and his band could learn a lot from performing with his friends, because it's his band's debut and he might be inexperienced to handle everything of details well. But by singing and playing together with some other band, the man and his band could be more relaxed and more importantly learn more practical stage experience. On top of that, any weekends concert will be always the most welcome one on campus, since most of the students only relax themselves and go to enjoy some live entertainment show on weekends not during the weekdays. So I strongly recommend the man's band join his friend's band and performance together. (193 words)</p></article></div></main></body></html>
