Other people prefer not to bring their cell or mobile phone with them everywhere they go, or they choose not to own one at all. Which do you prefer? Explain why.</p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>"I prefer not to bring cell-phones everywhere. There are some occasions I want to be detached from the world. For example, when I am readying a book in my study or in the library. It's very annoying to hear the ring of the cell-phone or feel the vibrations. It always interrupts my train of thoughts. Having a cell-phone everywhere means you can be disturbed anytime. Nowadays, not just your friends will call you or send you message. More often than not, you receive spam messages or anonymous calls. It makes angry even to answer the calls.
