          <h4 class="w3-center">Epiphytes</h4>
          <p>In rain forests, the canopy produced by the upper layer of branches may be so dense that few plants can grow on the shady ground below. Even so, many plants have adapted to life in the rain forest, developing fascinating strategies for survival. For example, various species known as epiphytes use a host plant as a platform for growth. Although epiphytes grow on a host tree, they take no nutrients from the tree itself. Attached to the tree, sometimes 30 or 40 meters high, these aerial plants have access to sunlight but not to nutrients from the soil below. As a result, they have developed unusual mechanisms that have allowed them to overcome this problem.</p>

          <p>Now listen to part of a lecture on this topic in a business management class. </p>
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>(male professor) </p>
          <p>So, let me tell you about my own experiences when I was working for a computer company a couple of years ago. </p>
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>So, one day a co-worker and I suggested we should give our computers a design make-over: make them look more up-to-date. Market research was showing that new customers said they would be more interested in buying our computers if they looked cooler. Our technology was advanced but the outside design looked really old-fashioned. </p>
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>At first, more than half the group supported us. There were a few senior managers there who didn't support the design change. One of the senior manager said, "Our focus has always been on technology, changing the look is an unnecessary cost." Almost immediately, some of our supporters changed their minds! Even my co-worker changed his mind! When I asked him why after the meeting, he told me he didn't want to make a bad impression on the senior managers. He thought that disagreeing with them might jeopardize his chances of getting a promotion by not looking like a team-player. </p>
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>What about me? I hate to admit it, but, after a few hours of discussion, I started wondering if it was worth everyone's time to argue about this? As more people sided with the senior management, I started to feel that I was the only one holding up the vote. Everyone else seemed to think change wasn't necessary. I voted against my own idea in the end. </p>
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>So we unanimously decided to stay with the current old-looking design. But this decision ended up costing us a lot of money. That same year, our competitor came out with a new design that attracted some of our customers and prevented us from profiting from new customers. </p>
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>Epiphytes is a kind of rain forest plant that uses a host plant as a platform for growth to get sunlight. And it also develops some mechanism to get nutrients since it's away from the soil. For example, Urn plant often wraps its root around the tree or the trunk of upper part of the tree so it resides high in the canopy to get plenty of sunlight. Then it has leaves of unique shape which help it get nutrients. Its leaves are long, stiff and spiky. They're slightly overlapping and rolled tightly to form a funnel/cone shape, and then its flowers are held on a single stem in the center. So the whole thing is shaped into a bowl. And when it rains, the rain water rolls down to be collected in the bowl. Then the debris of dead leaves and insects falls into the bowl and decomposes there to form a kind of fertilizer, which can be used by the plant when in need. (166 words)</p>
