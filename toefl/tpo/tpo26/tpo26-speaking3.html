          <h4 class="w3-center">Advisor Meetings Should No Longer Be Required</h4>At present, students are required to meet with their academic advisors before the beginning of every semester. The advisors help students select courses and advise them on graduation requirements. However, I don't see the point of required meetings, since the necessary information about the courses is already available on the university's Web site, which all students have access to. In addition, eliminating meetings with advisors would ease the difficulty that students often have in finding a time to schedule a meeting when both they and their advisors are free.
Sincerely,
Amy Williams</article>

          <p>Now listen to two students discussing the letter.</p>
          <p>(man) Did you see this letter?</p>
          <p>(woman) Yeah, why?</p>
          <p>(man) Well, I don't agree. It's definitely not the same thing to just go on the university's Web site.</p>
          <p>(woman) You don't think so?</p>
          <p>(man) No, I mean, sure, the basic information is there, but that's not all advisors help you with. Sometimes there're different ways you can meet a requirement for graduation, like, different classes you can take. And if you talk to someone, they can help you figure it out.</p>
          <p>(woman) And you can't get that from just reading what's on the Web site.</p>
          <p>(man) Right, advisors have a lot of expert information so they make it easier for you to see what your choices are.</p>
          <p>(woman) I see what you mean.</p>
          <p>(man) And as for scheduling meetings, I've never had that kind of trouble.</p>
          <p>(woman) Me neither.</p>
          <p>(man) So anyone who does have problems must be waiting to the last minute to set something up.</p>
          <p>(woman) That's possible.</p>
          <p>(man) I mean, the thing is, if you call or go to the office early enough to set up an appointment, schedules are open. It's just that if you wait till the last possible day, it'll be harder cause they already have lots of students scheduled then.</p>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>Well, the proposal says that the students should not be required to meet with their advisors who help to select courses and give advice mainly on graduation requirements for two reasons. However the man disagrees for two main reasons. Firstly, he thinks that the advisors could help the students with more than the basic information on the Internet. For example, there are different ways to meet the requirements for the graduation and with the help from the advisors the students can easily figure it out, because the advisors have the expert information and can judge the students, choices easier. Secondly, he believes if the students could set up the appointment ahead of time instead of leaving it to the last minute, it will be no problem to schedule their meeting. So the man is against the proposal. </p>
