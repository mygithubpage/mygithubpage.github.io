          <h4 class="w3-center">Advisor Meetings Should No Longer Be Required</h4>
          <p>At present, students are required to meet with their academic advisors before the beginning of every semester. The advisors help students select courses and advise them on graduation requirements. However, I don't see the point of required meetings, since the necessary information about the courses is already available on the university's Web site, which all students have access to. In addition, eliminating meetings with advisors would ease the difficulty that students often have in finding a time to schedule a meeting when both they and their advisors are free.</p>
          <p>Sincerely</p>
          <p>Amy Williams</p>

          <p>Now listen to two students discussing the opinion expressed in the letter. </p>
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>(man) Did you see Paul's letter in the paper about the new sculpture? </p>
          <p>(woman) Yeah, but it was totally unconvincing. His reasons for opposing the plan are just totally off. I am glad that we'll finally have some nice art on campus. I'd like to shake the donor's hand and say "thank you." (man) What do you mean the donor? </p>
          <p>(woman) You didn't know? An anonymous donor is paying the bill for most of the sculpture. </p>
          <p>(man) Not the university? </p>
          <p>(woman) No! His assumptions about who's paying are all wrong! </p>
          <p>(man) Still, I wonder if he has a point about the space it'll take up? </p>
          <p>(woman) Well, you know why Paul is upset. He and his friends are always out there on the lawn right where the sculpture will be, kicking around the soccer ball. Now they'll just have to use another part of the campus to play. </p>
          <p>(man) Oh! So he just doesn't want to have to move. </p>
          <p>(woman) Yeah! For him, it's sculpture versus convenience. </p>
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>Well, the proposal says that the students should not be required to meet with their advisors who help to select courses and give advice mainly on graduation requirements for two reasons. However the man disagrees for two main reasons. Firstly, he thinks that the advisors could help the students with more than the basic information on the Internet. For example, there are different ways to meet the requirements for the graduation and with the help from the advisors the students can easily figure it out, because the advisors have the expert information and can judge the students, choices easier. Secondly, he believes if the students could set up the appointment ahead of time instead of leaving it to the last minute, it will be no problem to schedule their meeting. So the man is against the proposal.</p>
