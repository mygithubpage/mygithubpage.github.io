            <b>Survival of Plants and Animals in Desert Conditions</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>The <span class="underline">harsh</span> conditions in deserts are <span class="underline">intolerable</span> for most plants and animals. Despite these conditions, however, many varieties of plants and animals have adapted to deserts in a number of ways.
Most plant tissues die if their water <span class="underline">content</span> falls too low: the nutrients that feed plants are transmitted by water; water is a <span class="underline">raw</span> <span class="underline">material</span> in the <span class="underline">vital</span> <span class="underline">process</span> of <span class="underline">photosynthesis</span>; and water 
regulates the <span class="underline">temperature</span> of a plant by its <span class="underline">ability</span> to <span class="underline">absorb</span> heat and because water <span class="underline">vapor</span> lost to the <span class="underline">atmosphere</span> <span class="underline">through</span> the leaves helps to <span class="underline">lower</span> plant temperatures. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>Water controls the <span class="underline">volume</span> 
of plant matter produced. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>The <span class="underline">distribution</span> of plants <span class="underline">within</span> different areas of <span class="underline">desert</span> is also controlled by water. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>Some areas, because of their soil <span class="underline">texture</span>, <span class="underline">topographical</span> <span class="underline">position</span>, 
or distance from rivers or <span class="underline">groundwater</span>, have <span class="underline">virtually</span> no water <span class="underline">available</span> to plants, whereas others do. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p>
          <p>The nature of plant life in deserts is also highly dependent on the fact that they have to <span class="underline">adapt</span> to the <span class="underline">prevailing</span> aridity. There are two general classes of vegetation: long-lived perennials, which may be succulent (water-storing) and are often dwarfed and woody, and annuals or ephemerals, which have a short life <span class="underline">cycle</span> and may form a <span class="underline">fairly</span> <span class="underline"><span class="underline">dense</span></span> stand immediately after rain.</p>
          <p>The <span class="underline">ephemeral</span> plants <span class="underline">evade</span> <span class="underline">drought</span>. <span class="underline">Given</span> a year of <span class="underline">favorable</span> <span class="underline">precipitation</span>, such plants will develop vigorously and produce large numbers of flowers and fruit. This replenishes the seed <span class="underline">content</span> of the <span class="underline">desert</span> soil. The seeds then lie <span class="underline">dormant</span> until the next wet year, when the <span class="underline">desert</span> blooms again.</p>
          <p>The <span class="underline">perennial</span> <span class="underline">vegetation</span> adjusts to the aridity by means of various avoidance mechanisms. Most <span class="underline">desert</span> plants are probably best classified as xerophytes. They <span class="underline">possess</span> drought-resisting adaptations: loss of water <span class="underline">through</span> the leaves is reduced by means of <span class="underline"><span class="underline">dense</span></span> hairs covering <span class="underline">waxy</span> leaf surfaces, by the closure of pores during the hottest times to reduce water loss, and by the rolling up or shedding of leaves at the beginning of the dry <span class="underline">season</span>. Some xerophytes, the succulents (including cacti), store water in their structures. Another way of countering <span class="underline">drought</span> is to have a limited <span class="underline">amount</span> of <span class="underline">mass</span> above ground and to have <span class="underline">extensive</span> <span class="underline">root</span> networks below ground. It is not unusual for the roots of some <span class="underline">desert</span> perennials to <span class="underline">extend</span> <span class="underline">downward</span> more than ten meters. Some plants are woody in type -an <span class="underline">adaptation</span> designed to prevent <span class="underline">collapse</span> of the plant <span class="underline">tissue</span> when water <span class="underline">stress</span> produces wilting. Another class of <span class="underline">desert</span> plant is the phreatophyte. These have adapted to the environment by the <span class="underline">development</span> of long taproots that <span class="underline">penetrate</span> <span class="underline">downward</span> until they <span class="underline">approach</span> the assured water <span class="underline">supply</span> provided by <span class="underline">groundwater</span>. Among these plants are the <span class="underline">date</span> palm, tamarisk, and mesquite. They commonly grow near <span class="underline">stream</span> channels, springs, or on the margins of lakes.</p>
          <p>Animals also have to <span class="underline">adapt</span> to <span class="underline">desert</span> conditions, and they may do it <span class="underline">through</span> two forms of <span class="underline">behavioral</span> adaptation: they either <span class="underline">escape</span> or <span class="underline">retreat</span>. <span class="underline">Escape</span> involves such actions as aestivation, a condition of <span class="underline">prolonged</span> <span class="underline">dormancy</span>, or <span class="underline">torpor</span>, during which animals reduce their <span class="underline">metabolic</span> <span class="underline">rate</span> and body <span class="underline">temperature</span> during the hot <span class="underline">season</span> or during very dry spells.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="underline">Seasonal</span>
            <span class="underline">migration</span> is another form of <span class="underline">escape</span>, especially for large mammals or birds. The <span class="underline">term</span> <span class="underline">retreat</span> is applied to the short-term <span class="underline">escape</span> <span class="underline">behavior</span> of <span class="underline">desert</span> animals, and it usually assumes the <span class="underline">pattern</span> of a daily <span class="underline">rhythm</span>. Birds <span class="underline">shelter</span> in nests, rock overhangs, trees, and <span class="underline"><span class="underline">dense</span></span> shrubs to <span class="underline">avoid</span> the hottest hours of the day, while mammals like the kangaroo rat <span class="underline">burrow</span> <span class="underline">underground</span>.</p>
          <p>Some animals have <span class="underline">behavioral</span>, <span class="underline">physiological</span>, and <span class="underline">morphological</span> (<span class="underline">structural</span>) adaptations that enable them to <span class="underline">withstand</span> <span class="underline">extreme</span> conditions. For example, the <span class="underline">ostrich</span> has <span class="underline">plumage</span> that is so constructed that the feathers are long but not too <span class="underline"><span class="underline">dense</span></span>. When conditions are hot, the <span class="underline">ostrich</span> erects them on its back, thus increasing the thickness of the <span class="underline">barrier</span> between <span class="underline">solar</span> <span class="underline">radiation</span> and the skin. The <span class="underline">sparse</span> <span class="underline">distribution</span> of the feathers, however, also allows <span class="underline">considerable</span> <span class="underline">lateral</span> <span class="underline">air</span> movement over the skin surface, <span class="underline">thereby</span> permitting further heat loss by <span class="underline">convection</span>. Furthermore, the birds orient themselves carefully with regard to the Sun and gently <span class="underline">flap</span> their wings to increase <span class="underline">convection</span> cooling</p>
