          <h4 class="w3-center">Survival of Plants and Animals in Desert Conditions</h4>
          <p>The <span class="highlight">harsh</span> conditions in deserts are <span class="highlight">intolerable</span> for most plants and animals. Despite these conditions, however, many varieties of plants and animals have adapted to deserts in a number of ways.
Most plant tissues die if their water <span class="highlight">content</span> falls too low: the nutrients that feed plants are transmitted by water; water is a <span class="highlight">raw</span> <span class="highlight">material</span> in the <span class="highlight">vital</span> <span class="highlight">process</span> of <span class="highlight">photosynthesis</span>; and water 
regulates the <span class="highlight">temperature</span> of a plant by its <span class="highlight">ability</span> to <span class="highlight">absorb</span> heat and because water <span class="highlight">vapor</span> lost to the <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span> <span class="highlight">through</span> the leaves helps to <span class="highlight">lower</span> plant temperatures. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>Water controls the <span class="highlight">volume</span> 
of plant matter produced. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>The <span class="highlight">distribution</span> of plants <span class="highlight">within</span> different areas of <span class="highlight">desert</span> is also controlled by water. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>Some areas, because of their soil <span class="highlight">texture</span>, <span class="highlight">topographical</span> <span class="highlight">position</span>, 
or distance from rivers or <span class="highlight">groundwater</span>, have <span class="highlight">virtually</span> no water <span class="highlight">available</span> to plants, whereas others do. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p>
          <p>The nature of plant life in deserts is also highly dependent on the fact that they have to <span class="highlight">adapt</span> to the <span class="highlight">prevailing</span> aridity. There are two general classes of vegetation: long-lived perennials, which may be succulent (water-storing) and are often dwarfed and woody, and annuals or ephemerals, which have a short life <span class="highlight">cycle</span> and may form a <span class="highlight">fairly</span> <span class="highlight"><span class="highlight">dense</span></span> stand immediately after rain.</p>
          <p>The <span class="highlight">ephemeral</span> plants <span class="highlight">evade</span> <span class="highlight">drought</span>. <span class="highlight">Given</span> a year of <span class="highlight">favorable</span> <span class="highlight">precipitation</span>, such plants will develop <span class="question4">vigorously</span> and produce large numbers of flowers and fruit. This replenishes the seed <span class="highlight">content</span> of the <span class="highlight">desert</span> soil. The seeds then lie <span class="highlight">dormant</span> until the next wet year, when the <span class="highlight">desert</span> blooms again.</p>
          <p>The <span class="highlight">perennial</span> <span class="highlight">vegetation</span> adjusts to the aridity by means of various avoidance mechanisms. Most <span class="highlight">desert</span> plants are probably best classified as xerophytes. They <span class="highlight">possess</span> drought-resisting adaptations: loss of water <span class="highlight">through</span> the leaves is reduced by means of <span class="highlight"><span class="highlight">dense</span></span> hairs covering <span class="highlight">waxy</span> leaf surfaces, by the closure of pores during the hottest times to reduce water loss, and by the rolling up or shedding of leaves at the beginning of the dry <span class="highlight">season</span>. Some xerophytes, the succulents (including cacti), store water in their structures. Another way of <span class="question5">countering</span> <span class="highlight">drought</span> is to have a limited <span class="highlight">amount</span> of <span class="highlight">mass</span> above ground and to have <span class="highlight">extensive</span> <span class="highlight">root</span> networks below ground. It is not unusual for the roots of some <span class="highlight">desert</span> perennials to <span class="highlight">extend</span> <span class="highlight">downward</span> more than ten meters. Some plants are woody in type -an <span class="highlight">adaptation</span> designed to prevent <span class="highlight">collapse</span> of the plant <span class="highlight">tissue</span> when water <span class="highlight">stress</span> produces wilting. Another class of <span class="highlight">desert</span> plant is the phreatophyte. These have adapted to the environment by the <span class="highlight">development</span> of long taproots that <span class="highlight">penetrate</span> <span class="highlight">downward</span> until they <span class="highlight">approach</span> the <span class="question7">assured</span> water <span class="highlight">supply</span> provided by <span class="highlight">groundwater</span>. Among these plants are <span class="question8">the <span class="highlight">date</span> palm, tamarisk, and mesquite.</span> They commonly grow near <span class="highlight">stream</span> channels, springs, or on the margins of lakes.</p>
          <p>Animals also have to <span class="highlight">adapt</span> to <span class="highlight">desert</span> conditions, and they may do it <span class="highlight">through</span> two forms of <span class="highlight">behavioral</span> adaptation: they either <span class="highlight">escape</span> or <span class="highlight">retreat</span>. <span class="question9"><span class="highlight">Escape</span> involves such actions as aestivation, a condition of <span class="highlight">prolonged</span> <span class="highlight">dormancy</span>, or <span class="highlight">torpor</span>, during which animals reduce their <span class="highlight">metabolic</span> <span class="highlight">rate</span> and body <span class="highlight">temperature</span> during the hot <span class="highlight">season</span> or during very dry spells.</span></p>
          <p>
            <span class="highlight">Seasonal</span>
            <span class="highlight">migration</span> is another form of <span class="highlight">escape</span>, especially for large mammals or birds. The <span class="highlight">term</span> <span class="highlight">retreat</span> is applied to the short-term <span class="highlight">escape</span> <span class="highlight">behavior</span> of <span class="highlight">desert</span> animals, and it usually assumes the <span class="highlight">pattern</span> of a daily <span class="highlight">rhythm</span>. Birds <span class="highlight">shelter</span> in nests, rock overhangs, trees, and <span class="highlight"><span class="highlight">dense</span></span> shrubs to <span class="highlight">avoid</span> the hottest hours of the day, while mammals like the kangaroo rat <span class="highlight">burrow</span> <span class="highlight">underground</span>.</p>
          <p>Some animals have <span class="highlight">behavioral</span>, <span class="highlight">physiological</span>, and <span class="highlight">morphological</span> (<span class="highlight">structural</span>) adaptations that enable them to <span class="highlight">withstand</span> <span class="highlight">extreme</span> conditions. For example, the <span class="highlight">ostrich</span> has <span class="highlight">plumage</span> that is so constructed that the feathers are long but not too <span class="highlight"><span class="highlight">dense</span></span>. When conditions are hot, the <span class="highlight">ostrich</span> erects them on its back, thus increasing the thickness of the <span class="highlight">barrier</span> between <span class="highlight">solar</span> <span class="highlight">radiation</span> and the skin. The <span class="highlight">sparse</span> <span class="highlight">distribution</span> of the feathers, however, also allows <span class="highlight">considerable</span> <span class="highlight">lateral</span> <span class="highlight">air</span> movement over the skin surface, <span class="highlight">thereby</span> permitting further heat loss by <span class="highlight">convection</span>. Furthermore, the birds orient themselves carefully with regard to the Sun and gently <span class="highlight">flap</span> their wings to increase <span class="highlight">convection</span> cooling</p>

              <p>The whole section of B is discussing ephemeral plants, so it is not good to locate, but this section is relatively short and you can read it quickly. A option is wrong, because from the source we can see that in the wet year will produce a large number of seeds, A option and the original contradictory; B option is correct, positioning sentence: This replenishes the seed content of the desert soil. This sentence said that in the rainy season, will produce Scorpions, then to fill the drylands. The reasoning questions are examined in reverse, so in the dry season, seeds are not naturally produced; the C option is relatively wrong, and the original does not show the later;D option, or it is quite wrong.</p>

              <p>A. Targeting the first sentence with the words desert animal retreat. There are two methods. One is escape, and the other is retreat. But the following paragraphs are all about escape. There is no retreat. I don't know if it's mine. To understand the problem, the real answer to this question should be in the next paragraph. The second sentence in the next paragraph begins with retreat. The last sentence is to retreat birds in order to escape the heat and the mammals hide in the cave. In other words, the retreat is for summer. The correct answer is A. If you do not see the next class of students, this last sentence says escape occurs in a hot or dry period, can also be introduced to escape the sun, this is an infer question.</p>

The core object of the results is plant material, so go to the text to find relevant content. In the sentence before the B option, we mentioned plant matter produced. The topic is consistent with the insertion sentence. From the content point of view, it is just a reasonable reason to insert the sentence description phenomenon. So B is correct. The A option is obviously not suitable. Before discussing the water, the temperature can be lowered, which is inconsistent with the topic of the inserted sentence. The C option is not appropriate. It should be that some areas are obviously followed by the previous sentence. The D option is not suitable, D That sentence is an enumeration, obviously not explaining a reason.</p>

              <p>Annual and Perennial are mainly mentioned in the second to fourth paragraphs. The Woody option was classified as perennial when it was mentioned in the second sentence of the second paragraph. The Explosive option is mentioned at the end of the second paragraph and throughout the third paragraph. Although it is not the original word, it is said that once the precipitation is high, it grows very well, that is, it is explosive, so it belongs to annual. The Long option is wrong, because the original text says that the extensive root network is the way to cope with the drought, not talking about the shallow root. The Storage option was also mentioned in the second sentence of the second paragraph when it came to classification. It belongs to perennial. The original Minimization option is completely silent, not an option of any category. The Short option is also mentioned in the second sentence of the second paragraph when it comes to classification. It is annual. The Leaves option is in the second sentence of the fourth paragraph and belongs to perennial.</p>
