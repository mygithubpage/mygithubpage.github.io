            <b>Sumer and the First Cities of the Ancient Near East</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>The earliest of the city states of the <span class="underline">ancient</span> Near East appeared at the southern end of the Mesopotamian <span class="underline">plain</span>, the area between the <span class="underline">Tigris</span> and <span class="underline">Euphrates</span> rivers in what is now Iraq. It was here that the <span class="underline">civilization</span> known as Sumer emerged in its earliest form in the fifth <span class="underline">millennium</span>. At first sight, the <span class="underline">plain</span> did not <span class="underline">appear</span> to be a likely home for a <span class="underline">civilization</span>. There were few natural resources, no <span class="underline">timber</span>, stone, or metals. <span class="underline">Rainfall</span> was limited, and what water there was rushed <span class="underline">across</span> the <span class="underline">plain</span> in the <span class="underline">annual</span> flood of melted snow. As the <span class="underline">plain</span> fell only 20 meters in 500 kilometers, the beds of the rivers shifted <span class="underline">constantly</span>. It was this that made the <span class="underline">organization</span> of <span class="underline">irrigation</span>, particularly the building of canals to <span class="underline">channel</span> and <span class="underline">preserve</span> the water, <span class="underline">essential</span>. Once this was done and the <span class="underline">silt</span> carried down by the rivers was planted, the rewards were rich: four to five times what rain-fed earth would produce. It was these conditions that allowed an elite to <span class="underline">emerge</span>, probably as an organizing class, and to <span class="underline">sustain</span> itself <span class="underline">through</span> the control of <span class="underline">surplus</span> crops.</p>
          <p>It is difficult to <span class="underline">isolate</span> the factors that led to the next <span class="underline">development</span>-the <span class="underline">emergence</span> of <span class="underline">urban</span> settlements. The earliest, that of Eridu, about 4500 B.C.E., and Uruk, a thousand years later, center on <span class="underline">impressive</span> <span class="underline">temple</span> complexes built of mud brick. In some way, the elite had <span class="underline">associated</span> themselves with the power of the gods. Uruk, for <span class="underline">instance</span>, had two <span class="underline">patron</span> gods-Anu, the god of the sky and <span class="underline">sovereign</span> of all other gods, and Inanna, a goddess of love and war-and there were others, patrons of different cities. Human beings were at their <span class="underline">mercy</span>. The biblical story of the Flood may <span class="underline">originate</span> in Sumer. In the earliest <span class="underline">version</span>, the gods destroy the human race because its <span class="underline">clamor</span> had been so disturbing to them.</p>
          <p>It used to be believed that before 3000 B.C.E. the <span class="underline">political</span> and <span class="underline">economic</span> life of the cities was centered on their temples, but it now seems probable that the cities had <span class="underline">secular</span> rulers from earliest times. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> <span class="underline">Within</span> the city lived administrators, craftspeople, and merchants. (Trading was important, as so many <span class="underline">raw</span> materials, the semiprecious stones for the decoration of the temples, timbers for roofs, and all metals, had to be imported.) <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>An increasingly <span class="underline">sophisticated</span> system of <span class="underline">administration</span> led in about 3300 B.C.E. to the <span class="underline">appearance</span> of writing. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>The earliest <span class="underline">script</span> was based on logograms, with a <span class="underline">symbol</span> being used to express a whole word. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>The logograms were incised on <span class="underline">damp</span> <span class="underline">clay</span> tablets with a <span class="underline">stylus</span> with a <span class="underline">wedge</span> <span class="underline">shape</span> at its end. (The Romans called the <span class="underline">shape</span> cuneus and this gives the <span class="underline">script</span> its name of <span class="underline">cuneiform</span>.) Two thousand logograms have been recorded from these early centuries of writing. A more <span class="underline">economical</span> <span class="underline">approach</span> was to use a sign to express not a whole word but a single <span class="underline">syllable</span>. (To take an example: the <span class="underline">Sumerian</span> word for " head" was "sag." Whenever a word including a <span class="underline">syllable</span> in which the <span class="underline">sound</span> "sag" was to be written, the sign for "sag" could be used to express that <span class="underline">syllable</span> with the <span class="underline">remaining</span> syllables of the word expressed by other signs.) By 2300 B.C.E. the number of signs required had been reduced to 600, and the <span class="underline">range</span> of words that could be expressed had widened. Texts dealing with <span class="underline">economic</span> matters predominated, as they always had done; but at this point works of theology, <span class="underline">literature</span>, <span class="underline">history</span>, and law also appeared.</p>
          <p>Other innovations of the late fourth <span class="underline">millennium</span> include the wheel, probably developed first as a more <span class="underline">efficient</span> way of making <span class="underline">pottery</span> and then transferred to <span class="underline">transport</span>. A tablet engraved about 3000 B.C.E. provides the earliest known example from Sumer, a roofed boxlike sledge mounted on four <span class="underline">solid</span> wheels. A <span class="underline">major</span> <span class="underline">development</span> was the discovery, again about 3000 B.C.E., that if <span class="underline">copper</span>, which had been known in <span class="underline">Mesopotamia</span> since about 3500 B.C.E., was mixed with tin, a much harder metal, <span class="underline">bronze</span>, would result. Although <span class="underline">copper</span> and stone tools continued to be used, <span class="underline">bronze</span> was far more successful in creating sharp edges that could be used as anything from saws and scythes to weapons. The period from 3000 to 1000 B.C.E., when the use of <span class="underline">bronze</span> became <span class="underline">widespread</span>, is <span class="underline">normally</span> referred to as the <span class="underline">Bronze</span> Age.</p>
