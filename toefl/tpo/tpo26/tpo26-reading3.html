It was here that the <span class="highlight">civilization</span> known as Sumer emerged in its earliest form in the fifth <span class="highlight">millennium</span>. At first sight, the <span class="highlight">plain</span> did not <span class="highlight">appear</span> to be a likely home for a <span class="highlight">civilization</span>. There were few natural resources, no <span class="highlight">timber</span>, stone, or metals. <span class="highlight">Rainfall</span> was limited, and what water there was rushed <span class="highlight">across</span> the <span class="highlight">plain</span> in the <span class="highlight">annual</span> flood of melted snow. As the <span class="highlight">plain</span> fell only 20 meters in 500 kilometers, the beds of the rivers shifted <span class="highlight">constantly</span>. It was this that made the <span class="highlight">organization</span> of <span class="highlight">irrigation</span>, particularly the building of canals to <span class="highlight">channel</span> and <span class="highlight">preserve</span> the water, <span class="highlight">essential</span>. Once this was done and the <span class="highlight">silt</span> carried down by the rivers was planted, the rewards were rich: four to five times what rain-fed earth would produce. It was these conditions that allowed an elite to <span class="highlight">emerge</span>, probably as an organizing class, and to <span class="highlight"><span class="question3">sustain</span></span> itself <span class="highlight">through</span> the control of <span class="highlight">surplus</span> crops.</p><p>It is difficult to <span class="highlight">isolate</span> the factors that led to the next <span class="highlight">development</span>-the <span class="highlight">emergence</span> of <span class="highlight">urban</span> settlements. The earliest, that of Eridu, about 4500 B.C.E., and Uruk, a thousand years later, center on <span class="highlight">impressive</span><span class="highlight">temple</span> complexes built of mud brick. In some way, the elite had <span class="highlight">associated</span> themselves with the power of the gods. Uruk, for <span class="highlight">instance</span>, had two <span class="highlight">patron</span> gods-Anu, the god of the sky and <span class="highlight"><span class="question5">sovereign</span></span> of all other gods, and Inanna, a goddess of love and war-and there were others, patrons of different cities. Human beings were at their <span class="highlight">mercy</span>. The biblical story of the Flood may <span class="highlight">originate</span> in Sumer. In the earliest <span class="highlight">version</span>, the gods destroy the human race because its <span class="highlight">clamor</span> had been so disturbing to them.</p><p>It used to be believed that before 3000 B.C.E. the <span class="highlight">political</span> and <span class="highlight">economic</span> life of the cities was centered on their temples, but it now seems probable that the cities had <span class="highlight">secular</span> rulers from earliest times. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span><span class="highlight">Within</span> the city lived administrators, craftspeople, and merchants. (Trading was important, as so many <span class="highlight">raw</span> materials, the semiprecious stones for the decoration of the temples, timbers for roofs, and all metals, had to be imported.) <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>An increasingly <span class="highlight">sophisticated</span> system of <span class="highlight">administration</span> led in about 3300 B.C.E. to the <span class="highlight">appearance</span> of writing. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>The earliest <span class="highlight">script</span> was based on logograms, with a <span class="highlight">symbol</span> being used to express a whole word. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>The logograms were incised on <span class="highlight">damp</span><span class="highlight">clay</span> tablets with a <span class="highlight">stylus</span> with a <span class="highlight">wedge</span><span class="highlight">shape</span> at its end. (The Romans called the <span class="highlight">shape</span> cuneus and this gives the <span class="highlight">script</span> its name of <span class="highlight">cuneiform</span>.) Two thousand logograms have been recorded from these early centuries of writing. A more <span class="highlight">economical</span><span class="highlight">approach</span> was to use a sign to express not a whole word but a single <span class="highlight">syllable</span>. (To take an example: the <span class="highlight">Sumerian</span> word for " head" was "sag." Whenever a word including a <span class="highlight">syllable</span> in which the <span class="highlight">sound</span> "sag" was to be written, the sign for "sag" could be used to express that <span class="highlight">syllable</span> with the <span class="highlight">remaining</span> syllables of the word expressed by other signs.) By 2300 B.C.E. the number of signs required had been reduced to 600, and the <span class="highlight">range</span> of words that could be expressed had widened. Texts dealing with <span class="highlight">economic</span> matters predominated, as they always had done; but at this point works of theology, <span class="highlight">literature</span>, <span class="highlight">history</span>, and law also appeared.</p><p>Other innovations of the late fourth <span class="highlight">millennium</span> include the wheel, probably developed first as a more <span class="highlight">efficient</span> way of making <span class="highlight">pottery</span> and then transferred to <span class="highlight">transport</span>. A tablet <span class="question10">engraved</span> about 3000 B.C.E. provides the earliest known example from Sumer, a roofed boxlike sledge mounted on four <span class="highlight">solid</span> wheels. <span class="question11">A <span class="highlight">major</span><span class="highlight">development</span> was the discovery, again about 3000 B.C.E., that if <span class="highlight">copper</span>, which had been known in <span class="highlight">Mesopotamia</span> since about 3500 B.C.E., was mixed with tin, a much harder metal, <span class="highlight">bronze</span>, would result.</span> Although <span class="highlight">copper</span> and stone tools continued to be used, <span class="highlight">bronze</span> was far more successful in creating sharp edges that could be used as anything from saws and scythes to weapons. The period from 3000 to 1000 B.C.E., when the use of <span class="highlight">bronze</span> became <span class="highlight"><span class="question12">widespread</span></span>, is <span class="highlight">normally</span> referred to as the <span class="highlight">Bronze</span> Age.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the following is NOT mentioned in paragraph 1 as a disadvantage of the Mesopotamian plain?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. There was not very much rainfall for most of the year.</p><p>B. Melting snow caused flooding every year.</p><p>C. The silt deposited by rivers damaged crops.</p><p>D. Timber, stone and metals were not readily available.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The A option uses the rainfall, B option with melting snow to locate:</p><p>Rainfall was limited, and what water there was rushed across the plain in the annual flood of melted snow.</p><p>The AB option echoes the original text, so it is not selected.</p><p>The C option uses the slot to locate:</p><p>Once this was done and the silt carried down by the rivers was planted, the rewards were rich: four to five times what rain-fed earth would produce.</p><p>The rewards brought here are generous. So the C option's damaged crops is the opposite of the original, choose C.</p><p>The stone, metal of the D option corresponds to:</p><p>There were few natural resources, no timber, stone, or metals.</p><p>D is correct, not selected.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 1, which of the following made it possible for an elite to emerge?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. New crops were developed that were better suited to conditions on the Mesopotamian plain.</p><p>B. The richest individuals managed to gain control of the most valuable cropland.</p><p>C. Control over the few available natural resources made some people four to five times richer than everyone else.</p><p>D. The building of canals to increase agricultural output required organization.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The D keyword is an elite, and the positioning sentence is It was these conditions thatallowed... the control of surplus crops. This sentence first and then provides partial answers, above the crops. On the other hand, the present pronoun in this sentence indicates that the answer is in front of you. Looking forward, you have the advantage that you can find irrigation, building of canals, all of which are in agriculture. So the correct answer is D. A option: added a layer of logic, that is, the suit can not see, and that better did not say; B option: the highest level did not mention; C option: the comparison level does not matter. Tips: The pronouns have been integrated into the detailed questions in the detailed questions and inserted questions in ETS, so these questions are met and must be found.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question3">sustain</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. defend</p><p>B. promote</p><p>C. maintain</p><p>D. transform</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" C"><p>C <span class="question3">sustain</span>: Maintain, support. A option for defense, B option for promotion; C option for maintenance; D option for change, conversion. According to the word meaning, the C option is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 2, Eridu and Uruk are examples of urban settlements that</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. lacked the features usually found in other early urban settlements</p><p>B. developed around religious buildings</p><p>C. grew much more rapidly than most of the urban settlements found in Sumer</p><p>D. were mysteriously destroyed and abandoned</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B positioning words, Eridu and Uruk, positioning sentence: The earliest, that of Eridu, about 4500 B.C.E., and Uruk, a thousand years later, center on impressive temple complexes built of mud brick. The core word is temple, built. Rewrite for option B. A option, lack did not mention the C option, the comparison level did not issue D option, abandoned did not mention.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question5">sovereign</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. counselor</p><p>B. master</p><p>C. defender</p><p>D. creator</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>B <span class="question5">sovereign</span>: Monarch, supreme ruler. A is a consultant, B is the owner, C is the guard, and D is the creator. According to the word meaning, the B option is the closest.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 3, which of the following led to the appearance of writing?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. An increasingly sophisticated administrative system</p><p>B. Coordination between secular and religious leaders</p><p>C. The large volume of trade, particularly imports</p><p>D. A rapidly expanding and changing population</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A. Positioning the keyword to the first bracket after the appearance of writing, said that the increasingly complex management system led to writing, so the correct answer is A. The leaders of B, the imports of C, and the population of D are not in the positioning sentence and are not selected.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>In paragraph 3, why does the author provide the information that the number of signs in use had dropped from 2,000 to 600 by 2300 B.C.E.?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To argue that the development of writing involved periods of growth followed by periods of decline</p><p>B. To demonstrate that earlier written texts used a larger vocabulary than later texts, which were aimed at a broader audience</p><p>C. To support the claim that the range of words expressed by logograms varied widely depending on time period and type of text</p><p>D. To provide evidence for the increased efficiency of using signs to express syllables rather than whole words</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The sentence after the third keyword is positioned as a number, the entire sentence is an example. Since it is a goal question, the previous parenthesis is also an example. Further, the more economical way is to use Sign does not express a complete word and expresses a syllable. Only D is the one talking about this. During the period of A's growth and decline, B's larger vocabulary was not selected and was not selected. Although C's logogram was mentioned, the original did not say varied widel, so it was not selected.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 3, ancient texts most commonly dealt with</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. theology</p><p>B. literature</p><p>C. economics</p><p>D. law</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C. Using the keywords of ancient texts to navigate to the last sentence, the original talks about economic matters predominanted, which is the question of the most common. The correct answer is C. The others did not say.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, the earliest wheels probably</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. were first developed in areas outside Mesopotamia</p><p>B. were used to make pottery</p><p>C. appeared on boxlike sledges</p><p>D. were used to transport goods between cities</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B. Using the wheel as the key word to locate the first sentence, the original wheel was originally an efficient method to make pottery and then transferred to the transport, so the correct answer is B, D is somewhat confusing, but the attention is to have transport later. , so D is not right, the others did not say.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question10">engraved</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. carved</p><p>B. produced</p><p>C. dated</p><p>D. discovered</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" A"><p>A engrave: Engraving.

Also around 3000 B.C.E. , it was discovered that mixing copper, known from about 3500 B.C.E. , with tin would create a much harder metal known as bronze.</p><p>B. Although copper had been known since 3500 B.C.E. in Mesopotamia, the discovery of bronze did not occur until around 3000 B.C.E.</p><p>C. Another major development around 3000 B.C.E. was the discovery that copper could be mixed with a much harder metal known as tin.</p><p>D. The development of bronze by mixing copper and tin probably occurred around 3000 B.C.E. but may have happened as early as 3500 B.C.E.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A first reads the logic, then reads the main sentence and checks it. The original sentence removes the insertion, keeps the logic and the main sentence, and becomes this. A major development was the discover that if copper was mixed with tin, a much harder metal, bronze, wouldresult. A option: Contains the core meaning of the logical comparison level, the main sentence. For the correct answer; Option B: A concession occurs, this logic error; Option C: Missing the main sentence core bronze; Option D: Adding logical but.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question12">widespread</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. obvious</p><p>B. significant</p><p>C. necessary</p><p>D. common</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" D"><p>D <span class="question12">widespread</span>: universal.
