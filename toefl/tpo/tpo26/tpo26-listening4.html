          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.31" data-time="5.27">[00:05.27]</span>Professor: Hi, Jean.How was the...uh, the <span class="highlight">conference</span>, right?<span class="time" data-times="1.69" data-time="10.58">[00:10.58]</span> The <span class="highlight">conference</span> on volunteerism? <span class="time" data-times="1.61" data-time="12.27">[00:12.27]</span>That's where you were last week. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.87" data-time="13.88">[00:13.88]</span>Student: Yeah. It was great.<span class="time" data-times="4.53" data-time="15.75">[00:15.75]</span> I met a lot of people from some really amazing organizations that are working in the area.<span class="time" data-times="3.4" data-time="20.28">[00:20.28]</span>Now it would be a lot easier to get students to <span class="highlight">volunteer</span> in the <span class="highlight">community</span>.<span class="time" data-times="3.13" data-time="23.68">[00:23.68]</span>Plus, I've never been to any of the beaches here before.<span class="time" data-times="2.28" data-time="26.81">[00:26.81]</span>Being at the <span class="highlight">beach</span> was <span class="highlight">definitely</span> a plus. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.65" data-time="29.09">[00:29.09]</span>Professor: Well, I hope you had time to look over the notes from the class you missed.<span class="time" data-times="1.79" data-time="32.74">[00:32.74]</span>You did get the notes, right? </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.79" data-time="34.53">[00:34.53]</span>Student: Yup.I'II look them over before tomorrow's class. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.93" data-time="37.32">[00:37.32]</span>Professor: Good.And let me know if you have any questions. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.09" data-time="40.25">[00:40.25]</span>Student: Well, there is something that I <span class="highlight">wanted</span> to ask you now.<span class="time" data-times="2.74" data-time="43.34">[00:43.34]</span>It's about something I noticed at the <span class="highlight">beach</span>. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.24" data-time="46.08">[00:46.08]</span>Professor: Oh, what's that? </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.88" data-time="47.32">[00:47.32]</span>Student: Well, see, there are a lot of <span class="highlight">jellyfish</span> there, floating in the water. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.94" data-time="51.2">[00:51.20]</span>Professor: That couldn't have been pleasant. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.44" data-time="53.14">[00:53.14]</span>Student: Not for swimming. <span class="time" data-times="1.95" data-time="54.58">[00:54.58]</span>But it was interesting.<span class="time" data-times="2.54" data-time="56.53">[00:56.53]</span> I mean, the <span class="highlight">jellyfish</span> were glowing.<span class="time" data-times="0.95" data-time="59.07">[00:59.07]</span>I <span class="highlight">swear</span> they were.<span class="time" data-times="1.99" data-time="60.02">[01:00.02]</span>And I am wondering what that's about. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.74" data-time="62.01">[01:02.01]</span>Professor: Ah, glowing <span class="highlight">jellyfish</span>.<span class="time" data-times="1.14" data-time="64.75">[01:04.75]</span>That is interesting.<span class="time" data-times="2.95" data-time="65.89">[01:05.89]</span> Uh, it's called <span class="highlight">bioluminescence</span>.<span class="time" data-times="3.15" data-time="68.84">[01:08.84]</span>And actually we are going to talk about it later in the <span class="highlight">semester</span>.<span class="time" data-times="8.09" data-time="71.99">[01:11.99]</span>Basically, <span class="highlight">bioluminescence</span> is light that's produced by a chemical <span class="highlight">reaction</span>. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.64" data-time="80.08">[01:20.08]</span>Student: Really? Inside the <span class="highlight">jellyfish</span>? </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.98" data-time="82.72">[01:22.72]</span>Professor: Well, not all <span class="highlight">jellyfish</span>, about half of them.<span class="time" data-times="5.62" data-time="85.7">[01:25.70]</span>Actually, a lot of <span class="highlight">marine</span> organisms have this <span class="highlight">ability</span>, especially in deeper parts of the ocean. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.42" data-time="91.32">[01:31.32]</span>Student: Oh? I get it.<span class="time" data-times="3.06" data-time="92.74">[01:32.74]</span> Like the darker it gets, the more the fish needs light, right? </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.94" data-time="95.8">[01:35.80]</span>Professor: Well.<span class="highlight">bioluminescence</span> serves a number of functions.<span class="time" data-times="4.78" data-time="99.74">[01:39.74]</span>Most <span class="highlight">aquatic</span> organisms use it for communication and for attracting <span class="highlight">prey</span>.<span class="time" data-times="4.94" data-time="104.52">[01:44.52]</span>But <span class="highlight">jellyfish</span> usually use it as a <span class="highlight">defense</span> against predators.<span class="time" data-times="6.23" data-time="109.46">[01:49.46]</span>Some <span class="highlight">jellyfish</span> produce bright flashes of light that confuse predators, to, uh, to <span class="highlight">startle</span> them.<span class="time" data-times="8.66" data-time="115.69">[01:55.69]</span>But <span class="highlight">jellyfish</span> closer to the surface, probably like the <span class="highlight">jellyfish</span> you saw, they use <span class="highlight">bioluminescence</span> to <span class="highlight">hide</span>.<span class="time" data-times="9.02" data-time="124.35">[02:04.35]</span>The light they produce matches the color of the <span class="highlight">dim</span> sunlight, so they <span class="highlight">blend</span> in, and, uh, and predators can't see them. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="10.17" data-time="133.37">[02:13.37]</span>Student: Wow, really? Well, I am looking for a topic for my <span class="highlight">term</span> paper ,so maybe I could do it on these glowing <span class="highlight">jellyfish</span>.<span class="time" data-times="5.52" data-time="143.54">[02:23.54]</span>That's why I <span class="highlight">wanted</span> to ask you about them, you know, to find out if there was really something to write about. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.19" data-time="149.06">[02:29.06]</span>Professor: It's a great topic.<span class="time" data-times="3.04" data-time="151.25">[02:31.25]</span>But you'II have to make sure the topic is manageable.<span class="time" data-times="21.91" data-time="154.29">[02:34.29]</span>Like I said, about half of all <span class="highlight">jellyfish</span> are bioluminescent, so you may want to look at a <span class="highlight">particular</span> type of <span class="highlight">jellyfish</span> or several types that <span class="highlight">benefit</span> from <span class="highlight">bioluminescence</span> in the same way, or you could <span class="highlight">investigate</span> <span class="highlight">current</span> research on <span class="highlight">bioluminescence</span>, on, on the chemical <span class="highlight">process</span>, or...Here's an idea.<span class="time" data-times="3.07" data-time="176.2">[02:56.20]</span>You <span class="highlight">seem</span> to be very involved in <span class="highlight">local</span> issues.<span class="time" data-times="6.59" data-time="179.27">[02:59.27]</span>See if you can <span class="highlight">identify</span> the <span class="highlight">jellyfish</span> you observed on the <span class="highlight">beach</span> and how they fit into the <span class="highlight">local</span> <span class="highlight">ecosystem</span>. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="185.86">[03:05.86]</span>Student: Yeah, you know, some of the <span class="highlight">environmental</span> groups I met last week might <span class="highlight">even</span> be able to help me. </p>
