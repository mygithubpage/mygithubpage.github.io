To obtain notes from a class she missed.</p><p>B. To discuss a conference she attended.</p><p>C. To ask about a possible topic for a research paper.</p><p>D. To clarify information about volunteering in the community.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>On this question, students and teachers talked for most of the day and began to discuss this semester paper. She said that she wanted to write something about bioluminescence.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the student say about the conference she attended?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It will help convince students to get involved in the community.</p><p>B. It taught her a lot about marine ecosystems.</p><p>C. It helped her gain a volunteer position at a local organization.</p><p>D. Few students were involved in the conference.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>Professor: Hi, Jean. How was the...uh, the conference, right? the conference on volunteerism? That's where you were last week.</p><p>Student: Yeah. It was great. I met a lot of people from some really amazing organizations that are working in the area. Now it would be a lot easier to get students to volunteer in the community. Plus, I've never been to any of the beaches here before. Being at the beach was definitely a plus.</p><p>This is the beginning professor asked her, what will happen recently, ah, girl, she said, a lot of people, do not worry about finding volunteers</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What caused the woman to become interested in bioluminescence?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It was mentioned in the notes from a class she missed.</p><p>B. She observed the phenomenon while on a recent trip to a conference.</p><p>C. A volunteer she worked with told her about seeing some bioluminescent fish.</p><p>D. She heard a talk about bioluminescence at a conference she attended.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>It's about something I noticed at the beach. This question is also quite straightforward. She said that when she walked along the beach, she saw the glowing creatures. That's B.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor,why were the jellyfish that the student saw glowing?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They were avoiding predators by blending in with their surrounding.</p><p>B. They were trying to confuse predators with bright flashes of light.</p><p>C. They were communicating with each other.</p><p>D. They were trying to light up the dark water so they could see prey.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>Professor: Well. Bioluminescence serves a number of functions. Most aquatic organisms use it for communication and for attracting prey. But jellyfish usually use it as a defense against predators. Some jellyfish produce bright flashes of light that confuse predators, to, uh, to startle them. But jellyfish closer to the surface, probably like the jellyfish you saw, they use bioluminescence to hide. The light they produce matches the color of the dim sunlight, so they blend in, and, uh, and predators can't see them.</p><p>This question should be careful. Bioluminescence has many purposes, but the question asks the purpose of the specific one that the little girl sees. The professor said that for the animals that you see near the water surface, they are to hide , Send out the same light as sunlight, hide it. Everyone should recognize this question well. It should be considered a difficult problem. It is necessary to be very careful. In particular, the B option is not bright. Select A.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor imply about the student's proposed research topic?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. A variety of bioluminescent organisms should be included in the research.</p><p>B. Writing about the topic might be difficult because there is so much information on it.</p><p>C. The student should choose a topic that has already been covered in class.</p><p>D. The student should explain how bioluminescence benefits various species of jellyfish differently.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Professor: It's a great topic. But you'II have to make sure the topic is manageable. Like I said, about half of all jellyfish are bioluminescent, so you may want to look at a particular type of jellyfish or several types that benefit from bioluminescence in the same way, or you could investigate current research on bioluminescence, on, on the chemical Process, or...Here's an idea. You seem to be very involved in local issues. See if you can identify the jellyfish you observed on the beach and how they fit into the local ecosystem.</p><p>The subject professor said that the question you picked is very good, but if you choose a manageable topic, only about half of the J fish will shine. You have to see which types are sent and those that are not. This still has many difficulties. A, C, D are not right, choose B.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
