The discovery of a previously unknown trace metal.</p><p>B. The role trace metals play in carbon cycling.</p><p>C. Ways that living organisms rid themselves of trace metals.</p><p>D. Ways that zinc interacts with carbon dioxide.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>This tutorial is still relatively friendly. It begins with the trace metal, especially the role of zinc in the C cycle. Later on, the role of calcium was also mentioned. So, the answer is definitely B. Metals use the plural because of the mention of two metals, one zinc and one calcium, and the article refers to the C cycle a very large number of times. A's discovery is out of nothing; the way itself in C is wrong, nor does it mention that organisms have to exclude metals; D's different ways of interacting are obviously not.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor imply about the conversion of carbon dioxide molecules in plants?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It is an unusually complex chemical process</p><p>B. It only takes place in full sunlight</p><p>C. It proceeds slowly when cadmium is present</p><p>D. It is regulated by an enzyme that may contain zinc</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>When the teacher talks about the C-circulation in the human body, he needs an enzyme (protein), which contains Zn. Then, the plant is also a similar enzyme. So the answer is D. Did not mention the chemical reaction process. Did not talk about the sun. The C option is behind.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor,why is it surprising that many marine plants are able to survive near the surface of oceans?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Weather conditions near the surface disrupt certain life processes.</p><p>B. The salt content of surface waters is constantly changing.</p><p>C. Surface waters contain low quantities of zinc.</p><p>D. Surface waters absorb large amounts of carbon dioxide.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The professor said that there are very few zinc spots near the surface of the water and the shallows. How did these plants survive? So, the answer is naturally C. A whole article does not speak of climate; B in the salinity is out of nothing; D may everyone misunderstood it, there is less zinc in that place, is to rely on another thing to pass CO2, see next question. However, there is a lot of CO2 on the surface without saying water.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor,what important function do diatoms serve?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They alter cadmium so it is less toxic to humans.</p><p>B. They help cycle zinc in places where it is scarce.</p><p>C. They distribute carbon throughout the ocean.</p><p>D. They remove cadmium from the ocean floor.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>After answering the above question, after saying that there was very little zinc on the surface, the professor said that he was relying on the large amount of CO2 absorbed by the diamors and passing it to the deep water. So the answer is direct C.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What point does the professor make when she talks about cadmium being poisonous to humans?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. That cadmium and zinc can serve a similar function in plant enzymes.</p><p>B. That both cadmium and zinc are rare in plant enzymes.</p><p>C. That most trace metals are poisonous to humans.</p><p>D. That cadmium does not serve any biological purpose.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>On this question, the students asked the teacher if the cadmium was not toxic. According to the teacher, it was poisonous, but there were very few things in the human body. They were part of the enzyme components. These enzymes have a very important role in the body. The cadmium element is mentioned because, in the absence of zinc, those plants are still able to live well. The reason why wolfram is because of the presence of cadmium is to play the same role.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>The professor states that the discovery of an enzyme containing cadmium is important. What are two reasons that this discovery is important?Click on 2 answers.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It may lead to the discovery of new enzymes that use other trace metals.</p><p>B. It may explain the ocean's increased level of carbon dioxide.</p><p>C. It may explain the scarcity of some elements in the ocean.</p><p>D. It may help scientist better understand global warming.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="AD"><p>This question, the professor said, after discovering that calcium has the same properties, we can find different enzymes, because in fact there may be different enzymes in marine life, but we don't know it. The second point, we know, Greenhouse gases are CO2. These enzymes are capable of treating CO2. (Dragging into the deep sea), then we should be able to understand a bit of global warming.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
