          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="14.34" data-time="4.57">[00:04.57]</span>Professor: OK.Just before the end of the last class, we started talking about <span class="highlight">trace</span> metals, metals found in living organisms in very small quantities that serve an important biological, important nutritive <span class="highlight">function</span> in those organisms.<span class="time" data-times="4.39" data-time="18.91">[00:18.91]</span>And one <span class="highlight">trace</span> metal that serves a nutritive <span class="highlight">function</span> is <span class="highlight">zinc</span>. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="11.84" data-time="23.3">[00:23.30]</span>
            <span class="highlight">Zinc</span> assists in a number of processes in humans, but we are going to <span class="highlight">focus</span> on just one, one that applies to a number of organisms, not just humans.<span class="time" data-times="13.51" data-time="35.14">[00:35.14]</span>See, <span class="highlight">zinc</span> plays a <span class="highlight">major</span> role in <span class="highlight">carbon</span> cycling, the <span class="highlight">conversion</span> of various kinds of molecules with <span class="highlight">carbon</span>, Iike <span class="highlight">carbon</span> <span class="highlight">dioxide</span>, into other kinds of molecules with <span class="highlight">carbon</span> that organisms can use. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.14" data-time="48.65">[00:48.65]</span>So, take <span class="highlight">respiration</span>.<span class="time" data-times="5.44" data-time="50.79">[00:50.79]</span>Our bodies, our cells produce <span class="highlight">carbon</span> <span class="highlight">dioxide</span> when they <span class="highlight">break</span> down sugars.<span class="time" data-times="9.19" data-time="56.23">[00:56.23]</span>We need to get the CO2 out of our bodies, so the CO2 is <span class="highlight">converted</span> into <span class="highlight">carbonic</span> <span class="highlight">acid</span>, which the blood is able to carry to the lungs.<span class="time" data-times="7.03" data-time="65.42">[01:05.42]</span>Once the <span class="highlight">carbonic</span> <span class="highlight">acid</span> reaches the lungs, it's <span class="highlight">converted</span> back into <span class="highlight">carbon</span> <span class="highlight">dioxide</span> so that we can breathe it out. <span class="time" data-times="5.08" data-time="72.45">[01:12.45]</span>Now, this whole <span class="highlight">conversion</span> <span class="highlight">process</span> relies on a <span class="highlight">particular</span> <span class="highlight">enzyme</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.88" data-time="77.53">[01:17.53]</span>Uh, who remembers what an <span class="highlight">enzyme</span> is? Bob? </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.82" data-time="81.41">[01:21.41]</span>Student: Uh, it's a <span class="highlight">protein</span>, a <span class="highlight">specific</span> kind of <span class="highlight">protein</span>, one that speeds up chemical reactions. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.92" data-time="88.23">[01:28.23]</span>Professor: Exactly. Different enzymes assist in different chemical reactions. <span class="time" data-times="5.58" data-time="93.15">[01:33.15]</span>Now, the one that speeds up the <span class="highlight">conversion</span> of <span class="highlight">carbon</span> <span class="highlight">dioxide</span> has <span class="highlight">zinc</span> in it.<span class="time" data-times="5.58" data-time="98.73">[01:38.73]</span>So this <span class="highlight">zinc</span> <span class="highlight">enzyme</span> is <span class="highlight">critical</span> for getting CO2 out of our bodies <span class="highlight">through</span> the lungs. <span class="time" data-times="3.09" data-time="104.31">[01:44.31]</span>And it's also extremely important for plants. <span class="time" data-times="2.14" data-time="107.4">[01:47.40]</span>Bob, can you tell us why? </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.3" data-time="109.54">[01:49.54]</span>Student: For making food, for <span class="highlight">photosynthesis</span>? </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.45" data-time="111.84">[01:51.84]</span>Professor: Exactly.For <span class="highlight">photosynthesis</span>.<span class="time" data-times="12.12" data-time="114.29">[01:54.29]</span>Plants also <span class="highlight">convert</span> <span class="highlight">carbon</span> <span class="highlight">dioxide</span> into different forms of carbon-containing molecules and the <span class="highlight">conversion</span> <span class="highlight">process</span> used relies on the very same <span class="highlight">enzyme</span> that works in humans.<span class="time" data-times="3.09" data-time="126.41">[02:06.41]</span>So <span class="highlight">zinc</span> is also important for plants. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.33" data-time="129.5">[02:09.50]</span>OK. But <span class="highlight">zinc</span> is <span class="highlight">scarce</span> in certain environments.<span class="time" data-times="11.04" data-time="134.83">[02:14.83]</span>And it's particularly <span class="highlight">scarce</span> in waters near the surface of rivers and lakes and shallower parts of oceans, which might make us <span class="highlight">wonder</span> how plants could live there at all.<span class="time" data-times="6.32" data-time="145.87">[02:25.87]</span>In fact, there are a lot of <span class="highlight">marine</span> plants that <span class="highlight">survive</span>, that grow and <span class="highlight">reproduce</span> in surface waters.<span class="time" data-times="3.06" data-time="152.19">[02:32.19]</span>In <span class="highlight">particular</span>, there are a lot of diatoms. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="9.6" data-time="155.25">[02:35.25]</span>Diatoms are <span class="highlight">microscopic</span>, <span class="highlight">photosynthetic</span> organisms and they are a <span class="highlight">major</span> <span class="highlight">source</span> of food for other organisms in the ocean<span class="time" data-times="13.22" data-time="164.85">[02:44.85]</span>There are a number of different types of diatoms, and, well, diatoms play a very important role in the <span class="highlight">carbon</span> cycling <span class="highlight">process</span>, because they help make <span class="highlight">carbon</span> <span class="highlight">available</span> to other organisms in deeper parts of the ocean.<span class="time" data-times="17.23" data-time="178.07">[02:58.07]</span>The <span class="highlight">carbon</span> that these diatoms use in <span class="highlight">photosynthesis</span> is transferred to other parts of the ocean when the diatoms are eaten, say, by a fish that absorbs the <span class="highlight">carbon</span> and then swims to another part of the ocean, or when diatoms die and fall to the ocean floor. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.38" data-time="195.3">[03:15.30]</span>So how did diatoms <span class="highlight">survive</span> if <span class="highlight">zinc</span> is so <span class="highlight">scarce</span>? <span class="time" data-times="9.1" data-time="200.68">[03:20.68]</span>Well, recently researchers discovered that a <span class="highlight">specific</span> type of diatom makes a different <span class="highlight">enzyme</span> that serves the same purpose.<span class="time" data-times="3" data-time="209.78">[03:29.78]</span>But this <span class="highlight">enzyme</span> doesn't <span class="highlight">contain</span> <span class="highlight">zinc</span>.<span class="time" data-times="5.17" data-time="212.78">[03:32.78]</span> <span class="highlight">Instead</span> this new <span class="highlight">enzyme</span> incorporates another <span class="highlight">trace</span> metal, cadmium.<span class="time" data-times="3.2" data-time="217.95">[03:37.95]</span>Kelly, you've got a question? </p>

            <span class="time" data-times="3.73" data-time="221.15">[03:41.15]</span>Student: Yeah.I thought cadmium was <span class="highlight">toxic</span>.<span class="time" data-times="1.13" data-time="224.88">[03:44.88]</span>Didn't you say that? </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.59" data-time="226.01">[03:46.01]</span>Professor: It is <span class="highlight">poisonous</span> to humans.Uh. <span class="time" data-times="6.48" data-time="228.6">[03:48.60]</span>actually, we used to think that it was <span class="highlight">toxic</span> to all biological life, that it didn't serve any biological purpose.<span class="time" data-times="9.45" data-time="235.08">[03:55.08]</span>But new study suggests that cadmium can actually <span class="highlight">substitute</span> for <span class="highlight">zinc</span>, that organisms can use it <span class="highlight">instead</span> of <span class="highlight">zinc</span> when there isn't enough <span class="highlight">zinc</span> in their environment. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.78" data-time="244.53">[04:04.53]</span>Now, the discovery of this cadmium-based <span class="highlight">enzyme</span> is really important for a number of reasons.<span class="time" data-times="4.48" data-time="251.31">[04:11.31]</span>It's actually the first <span class="highlight">enzyme</span> we have discovered that uses cadmium.<span class="time" data-times="12.54" data-time="255.79">[04:15.79]</span>So it's possible that other not so <span class="highlight">typical</span> <span class="highlight">trace</span> metals may be used in chemical processes, that <span class="highlight">marine</span> organisms might make enzymes from other <span class="highlight">trace</span> metals when the <span class="highlight">essential</span> one is <span class="highlight">scarce</span>.<span class="time" data-times="4.73" data-time="268.33">[04:28.33]</span>And there may be other types of diatoms that use cadmiumto <span class="highlight">cycle</span> <span class="highlight">carbon</span>. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3" data-time="273.06">[04:33.06]</span>But there's something else to think about.<span class="time" data-times="6.9" data-time="276.06">[04:36.06]</span>What is one of the most <span class="highlight">common</span> greenhouse gases in our <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span>, one of the <span class="highlight">major</span> culprits in global warming.<span class="time" data-times="2.2" data-time="282.96">[04:42.96]</span> <span class="highlight">Carbon</span> <span class="highlight">dioxide</span>, right? </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="14.19" data-time="285.16">[04:45.16]</span>Now, if all these diatoms are taking <span class="highlight">carbon</span> <span class="highlight">dioxide</span> from the surface, converting it and transporting it to the bottom of the ocean, well, maybe there's more to that whole <span class="highlight">process</span>, that <span class="highlight">cycle</span>, something that we've overlooked.<span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="299.35">[04:59.35]</span>So further research might tell us more about these warming cycles too. </p>
