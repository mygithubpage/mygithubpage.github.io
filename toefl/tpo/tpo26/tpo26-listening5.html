              <span class="time" data-times="3.9" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in an <span class="underline">astronomy</span> class. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.85" data-time="3.9">[00:03.90]</span>Professor: 0K.We have been looking at some of the smaller members of our <span class="underline">solar</span> system, comets.<span class="time" data-times="3.26" data-time="10.75">[00:10.75]</span>You already know about the structure of comets.<span class="time" data-times="8.02" data-time="14.01">[00:14.01]</span>Let's continue our discussion now by talking about orbits, especially those of the so-called periodic-orbit comets.<span class="time" data-times="5.87" data-time="22.03">[00:22.03]</span>These are the comets that circle around the Sun <span class="underline">pretty</span> regularly.<span class="time" data-times="5.28" data-time="27.9">[00:27.90]</span>They return again and again, <span class="underline">predictably</span>, after a certain period of time. <span class="time" data-times="3.64" data-time="33.18">[00:33.18]</span>That's why we say their orbits are <span class="underline">periodic</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.53" data-time="36.82">[00:36.82]</span>Probably the most famous and brightest of these is Halley's <span class="underline">comet</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.16" data-time="41.35">[00:41.35]</span>Halley's <span class="underline">comet</span> comes from far out in the <span class="underline">solar</span> system, goes in close to the Sun, and then out again.<span class="time" data-times="6.02" data-time="49.51">[00:49.51]</span>At its closest <span class="underline">approach</span> to the Sun, Halley's <span class="underline">comet</span> is about twice as close to the Sun as Earth is.<span class="time" data-times="1.44" data-time="55.53">[00:55.53]</span>And at its farthest.<span class="time" data-times="6.07" data-time="56.97">[00:56.97]</span>It's about thirty-five times farther from the Sun than we are, which puts it out beyond Neptune.<span class="time" data-times="10.4" data-time="63.04">[01:03.04]</span>Basically, the idea here is that a <span class="underline">periodic</span> <span class="underline">comet</span>, with its very <span class="underline">elongated</span> <span class="underline">orbit</span>, just keeps coming back around again and again.<span class="time" data-times="5.94" data-time="73.44">[01:13.44]</span>With Halley's <span class="underline">comet</span>, well, it returns every 75 years, <span class="underline">roughly</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.84" data-time="79.38">[01:19.38]</span>But where is Halley 's <span class="underline">Comet</span> during most of this time? <span class="time" data-times="6.21" data-time="83.22">[01:23.22]</span>Well, like all orbiting bodies, a <span class="underline">comet</span> moves faster when it's closer to the Sun. <span class="time" data-times="5.61" data-time="89.43">[01:29.43]</span>So it only spends about a year or two in our neighborhood, inside the <span class="underline">orbit</span> of <span class="underline">Jupiter</span>.<span class="time" data-times="7.67" data-time="95.04">[01:35.04]</span>Most of its time is spent way out beyond <span class="underline">Jupiter</span>'s <span class="underline">orbit</span>, poking <span class="underline">along</span> near the farther reaches of its own <span class="underline">orbit</span>.<span class="time" data-times="9.78" data-time="102.71">[01:42.71]</span>Because of this, we can only see Halley's for a few months every 75 years, first on its way in toward the Sun, and then on its way out again. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="11.04" data-time="112.49">[01:52.49]</span>Now, you remember from our <span class="underline">previous</span> discussion that a <span class="underline">comet</span>'s <span class="underline">nucleus</span> ,its <span class="underline">core</span>, is made up of ice and dust, like a frozen snowball.<span class="time" data-times="4.24" data-time="123.53">[02:03.53]</span>And as it approaches the Sun, it starts to heat up.<span class="time" data-times="5.54" data-time="127.77">[02:07.77]</span>And some of the ice vaporizes into gas and spreads out from the <span class="underline">nucleus</span>.<span class="time" data-times="10.41" data-time="133.31">[02:13.31]</span>The gases that <span class="underline">vaporize</span> from the <span class="underline">comet</span>, the <span class="underline">comet</span> never collects them back again, so on every <span class="underline">orbit</span>, the <span class="underline">comet</span> leaves part of itself behind. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.88" data-time="143.72">[02:23.72]</span>OK.How old is this <span class="underline">solar</span> system? <span class="time" data-times="2.59" data-time="146.6">[02:26.60]</span>Four and a half billion years,remember? <span class="time" data-times="6.32" data-time="149.19">[02:29.19]</span>And Halley's is going around the Sun once every 75 years and losing <span class="underline">stuff</span> each time.<span class="time" data-times="3.93" data-time="155.51">[02:35.51]</span>So the <span class="underline">comet</span> should be long gone by now, right? <span class="time" data-times="5.28" data-time="159.44">[02:39.44]</span>I mean, how come Halley's is still there, after four and a half billion years. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.43" data-time="164.72">[02:44.72]</span>How could it be?<span class="time" data-times="13.82" data-time="166.15">[02:46.15]</span> Well, the answer is that this <span class="underline">comet</span> hasn't always been in such a short <span class="underline">periodic</span> <span class="underline">orbit</span>, since once a <span class="underline">comet</span> gets into an <span class="underline">orbit</span> that keeps it coming in close to the Sun quite frequently.<span class="time" data-times="4.23" data-time="179.97">[02:59.97]</span>Well, that <span class="underline">comet</span>'s probably not going to be around too much longer. <span class="time" data-times="5.13" data-time="184.2">[03:04.20]</span>So this kind of <span class="underline">periodic</span> <span class="underline">orbit</span> is only a <span class="underline">phase</span> in a <span class="underline">comet</span>'s life.<span class="time" data-times="3.88" data-time="189.33">[03:09.33]</span>A <span class="underline">phase</span> that just precedes its final breakup.<span class="time" data-times="6.18" data-time="193.21">[03:13.21]</span>We've seen comets do that, going toward the Sun and then come back around ,torn into pieces. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.59" data-time="199.39">[03:19.39]</span>But lots of comets aren't like that.<span class="time" data-times="4.93" data-time="201.98">[03:21.98]</span>They come in, pass behind the Sun, and then travel back out.<span class="time" data-times="8.5" data-time="206.91">[03:26.91]</span>But with an <span class="underline">orbit</span> so large, and its farthest place so far away from the Sun that we just don't know how far out it goes.<span class="time" data-times="5.73" data-time="215.41">[03:35.41]</span>We just can't <span class="underline">determine</span> that very accurately from the close-in part of the <span class="underline">orbit</span> that we do see.<span class="time" data-times="4.73" data-time="221.14">[03:41.14]</span>So these are often called parabolic-orbit comets. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.63" data-time="225.87">[03:45.87]</span>Parabolic means the <span class="underline">orbit</span> is open at the far end.<span class="time" data-times="9.21" data-time="232.5">[03:52.50]</span>Actually the <span class="underline">orbit</span> probably does close and return the <span class="underline">comet</span> to the <span class="underline">vicinity</span> of the Sun <span class="underline">eventually</span>, but the period might be tens of thousands of years.<span class="time" data-times="2.56" data-time="241.71">[04:01.71]</span>And basically, we can't <span class="underline">determine</span> it.<span class="time" data-times="6.33" data-time="244.27">[04:04.27]</span>So we just, we <span class="underline">refer</span> to them as open-ended parabolic-orbit comets. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="12.35" data-time="250.6">[04:10.60]</span>So, what can change a <span class="underline">comet</span> with one of these long orbits where they only come by the Sun occasionally into a much more frequent <span class="underline">periodic</span> visitor? <span class="time" data-times="5.38" data-time="262.95">[04:22.95]</span>Well, <span class="underline">gravitational</span> <span class="underline">interaction</span> with planets, right? <span class="time" data-times="15.27" data-time="268.33">[04:28.33]</span>lf a <span class="underline">comet</span> on one of these long period orbits at some point comes close to <span class="underline">Jupiter</span> or <span class="underline">Saturn</span> or one of the other planets, then the pull of that <span class="underline">planet</span>'s <span class="underline">gravity</span> might <span class="underline">alter</span> the <span class="underline">orbit</span>, maybe make it much shorter. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="283.6">[04:43.60]</span>So this <span class="underline">comet</span>, if it happens to pass by a <span class="underline">planet</span> just the right way, it can be drawn into a new <span class="underline">orbit</span>, one that'll <span class="underline">capture</span> it and keep it coming back around the Sun much more often. </p>
