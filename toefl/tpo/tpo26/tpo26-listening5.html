The orbits of comets.</p><p>B. Unique characteristics of a famous comet.</p><p>C. The structure of comets.</p><p>D. The origin and life cycle of comets.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>Let's suggest that the main topic of the speech was about the orbit of comets.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor,what happens as a comet approaches the Sun?Click on 2 answers.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Its nucleus loses some material.</p><p>B. Its core becomes brighter.</p><p>C. It moves faster.</p><p>D. It absorbs gases from the Sun.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="AC"><p>Well, like all orbiting bodies, a comet moves faster when it's closer to the Sun(C)</p><p>And some of the ice vaporizes into gas and spreads out from the nucleus. The gases that vaporize from the comet, the comet never collects them back again, so on every orbit, the comet leaves part of itself behind (A)</p><p>The prompt word, Well, Now, you remember is a reminder, and the speech says: What happened when the comet approached the sun? It happened: 1. Well, Like all rotating celestial bodies, when the comet moves closer to the sun, it moves faster. As he approached the sun, he began to warm up, and some ice evaporated into gas and escaped from the nuclear area.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor emphasize the amount of time Hailey's Comet is beyond the orbit of Jupiter?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To account for the comet's composition of ice and dust.</p><p>B. To show the effect of Jupiter's gravity on the comet's orbit.</p><p>C. To argue that the comet's orbit should not be considered periodic.</p><p>D. To explain why the comet is not visible from Earth very often.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>Because of this, we can only see Halley's for a few months every 75 years, first on its way in toward the Sun, and then on its way out again. The prompt word Because of this about the reason leads to the reason why Halley's comet is outside Jupiter's orbit. Because we can only see it for several months every 75 years.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the professor imply about the history of Hailey's Comet?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

Hailey's Comet has always had the same orbit that it has now.</p><p>D. Hailey's Comet is much younger than the rest of the solar system.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>Well, the answer is that this comet hasn't always been in such a short periodic orbit, since once a comet gets into</p><p>An orbit that keeps it coming in close to the Sun quite frequently. What does the professor imply about Halley's comet? Saying that he is not always on such a short cycle, it can be concluded that Halley's comet is not always on the same track.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the professor's opinion about the name "parabolic-orbit comets"?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

It will probably be replaced soon with a new name.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>We just can't determine that very accurately from the close-in part of the orbit that we do see. What is the professor's view of the parabolic orbital comet? Answer: We cannot make very definite decisions from the part of the center that we see, so these are always called parabolic orbiting satellites.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor,what can change a parabolic-orbit into a periodic-orbit comet?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

Energy from the Sun.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Well, gratification interaction with planets, right? According to the professor, what can change the parabola to become a periodic orbit? Answer: The gravity of the planet may change the orbit and make it shorter.
