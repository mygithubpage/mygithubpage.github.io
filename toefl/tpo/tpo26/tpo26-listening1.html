              <span class="time" data-times="5.59" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to a <span class="underline">conversation</span> between a student and a university print shop employee.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.69" data-time="5.59">[00:05.59]</span>Student: Hi. I saw your ad in the <span class="underline">campus</span> newspaper.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.25" data-time="10.28">[00:10.28]</span>Employee: Oh. We don't have any job opening right now.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.77" data-time="13.53">[00:13.53]</span>Student: Oh, no. I meant the other ad, about the services you provide for students. <span class="time" data-times="3.85" data-time="18.3">[00:18.30]</span>You see, I have been working at the <span class="underline">campus</span> tutoring center as a math <span class="underline">tutor</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.59" data-time="22.15">[00:22.15]</span>But things have changed, including my <span class="underline">schedule</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.96" data-time="24.74">[00:24.74]</span>And now I want to start doing tutoring work independently. <span class="time" data-times="5.08" data-time="27.7">[00:27.70]</span>But in order to, basically, start my own business, I need to get the work out.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="0.76" data-time="32.78">[00:32.78]</span>Employee: Ok.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.03" data-time="33.54">[00:33.54]</span>Student: I was thinking I should get something printed up that I can hand out to people.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.77" data-time="37.57">[00:37.57]</span>Employee: Ah. Well, actually, I just printed up some great-looking flyers for someone doing the same thing.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.98" data-time="44.34">[00:44.34]</span>Student: Flyers. Yeah, that's an idea.<span class="time" data-times="2.8" data-time="47.32">[00:47.32]</span> I guess then I could post them around the <span class="underline">campus</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.05" data-time="50.12">[00:50.12]</span>Employee: Yeah. And you can hand them out too.<span class="time" data-times="2.03" data-time="52.17">[00:52.17]</span> But, oh, you know what? <span class="time" data-times="3.45" data-time="54.2">[00:54.20]</span>I did something really neat for someone last week. <span class="time" data-times="7.63" data-time="57.65">[00:57.65]</span>She didn't want to go the <span class="underline">traditional</span> <span class="underline">route</span>, you know, business cards, flyers, so we customized pencils for her.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.04" data-time="65.28">[01:05.28]</span>Student: Pencils?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.24" data-time="66.32">[01:06.32]</span>Employee: Yeah. You know, a little message printed on the pencil.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.14" data-time="69.56">[01:09.56]</span>Student: Oh, that's cool.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.83" data-time="70.7">[01:10.70]</span>Employee: Yeah. But you should know, it's not our cheapest option. <span class="time" data-times="3.04" data-time="75.53">[01:15.53]</span>Oh, and you know those little <span class="underline">sticky</span> notes?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.39" data-time="78.57">[01:18.57]</span>Student: You do those too?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.59" data-time="79.96">[01:19.96]</span>Employee: Well, we did once. <span class="time" data-times="4.82" data-time="81.55">[01:21.55]</span>I think those bright pieces of paper would be real <span class="underline">attention</span> getters. <span class="time" data-times="4.32" data-time="86.37">[01:26.37]</span>You know, student use them all the time, so they should be good for business. <span class="time" data-times="2.39" data-time="90.69">[01:30.69]</span>I don't know why we <span class="underline">haven</span>'t done more.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.06" data-time="93.08">[01:33.08]</span>Student: Wow.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.34" data-time="94.14">[01:34.14]</span>Employee: So you've got some options.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.18" data-time="96.48">[01:36.48]</span>Student: Right. Well, what about business cards? <span class="time" data-times="2.08" data-time="99.66">[01:39.66]</span>My friend has these business cards. <span class="time" data-times="1.27" data-time="101.74">[01:41.74]</span>She does tutoring too. <span class="time" data-times="4.38" data-time="103.01">[01:43.01]</span>And she got them at this place in town, but they were kind of expensive.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.39" data-time="107.39">[01:47.39]</span>Employee: For business card? <span class="time" data-times="2.44" data-time="108.78">[01:48.78]</span>Well, I don't know what your friend paid. <span class="time" data-times="3.84" data-time="111.22">[01:51.22]</span>But we could do something real simple and it wouldn't be much. <span class="time" data-times="7.07" data-time="115.06">[01:55.06]</span>Like for a <span class="underline">batch</span> of 250 for one of our <span class="underline">standard</span> designs, 20 dollars maybe.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.69" data-time="122.13">[02:02.13]</span>Student: 20 dollars sounds okay.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.93" data-time="123.82">[02:03.82]</span>Employee: Now, there are some other choices that'll <span class="underline">affect</span> the <span class="underline">cost</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.18" data-time="127.75">[02:07.75]</span>You know, like different background patterns, using color ink, that <span class="underline">sort</span> of thing.<span class="time" data-times="3.74" data-time="132.93">[02:12.93]</span>And it also depends on how many words you want to include.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.74" data-time="136.67">[02:16.67]</span>Student: Ok. Well, I know what I want them to say.<span class="time" data-times="4.34" data-time="139.41">[02:19.41]</span> But I am just thinking, I kind of like that pencil idea.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.04" data-time="143.75">[02:23.75]</span>Employee: Yeah. I thought it was neat. <span class="time" data-times="6.76" data-time="145.79">[02:25.79]</span>Now, of <span class="underline">course</span> you can only fit your name and phone number, and like, in your case, math tutoring on it.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.53" data-time="152.55">[02:32.55]</span>Student: Right. Well, I could <span class="underline">custom</span> design the business cards <span class="underline">through</span>, right? <span class="time" data-times="1.5" data-time="157.08">[02:37.08]</span>That's what my friend did. <span class="time" data-times="3.23" data-time="158.58">[02:38.58]</span>She said she designed them at the computer right there at the print shop.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.65" data-time="161.81">[02:41.81]</span>Employee: Well, you can do that here too. <span class="time" data-times="6.04" data-time="164.46">[02:44.46]</span>But a <span class="underline">custom</span> design would be a bigger investment for your business than one of our <span class="underline">standard</span> designs.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.29" data-time="170.5">[02:50.50]</span>Student: Well, I don't know. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="172.79">[02:52.79]</span>I am interested in business cards, so can I look at the <span class="underline">standard</span> designs?</p>
