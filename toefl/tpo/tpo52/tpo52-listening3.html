of a lecture in an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> science class.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.5" data-time="6">[00:06.00]</span>Professor:Today we are going to begin discussing ecosystems.<span class="time" data-times="14.1" data-time="9.5">[00:09.50]</span> One important point I want to <span class="highlight">emphasize</span> in the reading is that there are many interactions that take place <span class="highlight">within</span> an <span class="highlight">ecosystem</span>, interactions between animals, interactions between living and non-living things and so on. <span class="time" data-times="3.9" data-time="23.6">[00:23.60]</span>Now these interactions can be <span class="highlight">fairly</span> simple and <span class="highlight">straightforward</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.75" data-time="27.5">[00:27.50]</span>Ah, there are certain <span class="highlight">species</span> of ants and rodents sharing a <span class="highlight">desert</span><span class="highlight">ecosystem</span> in Arizona. <span class="time" data-times="2.85" data-time="33.25">[00:33.25]</span>And they <span class="highlight">compete</span> for the same plants to eat. <span class="time" data-times="9" data-time="36.1">[00:36.10]</span>And the competition influence is not only the size of the ant and <span class="highlight">rodent</span> populations, but also the number of eventual plants. <span class="time" data-times="4" data-time="45.1">[00:45.10]</span>Now, this <span class="highlight">interaction</span> is easy to see, right? <span class="time" data-times="8.4" data-time="49.1">[00:49.10]</span>However, there are many other interactions <span class="highlight">within</span> ecosystems that are not so <span class="highlight">apparent</span> and <span class="highlight">require</span> closer examination.<span class="time" data-times="6.2" data-time="57.5">[00:57.50]</span> And the example from your reading was the forest <span class="highlight">ecosystem</span><span class="highlight">along</span> the <span class="highlight">Pacific</span><span class="highlight">coast</span> of North America. <span class="time" data-times="4" data-time="63.7">[01:03.70]</span>Um, <span class="highlight">specifically</span> the role of <span class="highlight">salmon</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="9" data-time="67.7">[01:07.70]</span>Ok, as you probably know, <span class="highlight">salmon</span> are born in fresh water streams, they might ran to oceans where they spent most of their lives. <span class="time" data-times="5.45" data-time="76.7">[01:16.70]</span>And then they return to the same streams where they were born to <span class="highlight">reproduce</span>, or <span class="highlight">spawn</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.35" data-time="82.15">[01:22.15]</span>In order to <span class="highlight">spawn</span>, <span class="highlight">salmon</span> need cold, <span class="highlight">clear</span> streams to ensure the <span class="highlight">survival</span> of their eggs.<span class="time" data-times="4.1" data-time="89.5">[01:29.50]</span> And trees in the surrounding forest play an important role here. <span class="time" data-times="3" data-time="93.6">[01:33.60]</span> Their leaves provide <span class="highlight">shade</span> from the Sun. <span class="time" data-times="6.05" data-time="96.6">[01:36.60]</span> When logging removes the trees, the streams are open to the Sun and the water becomes warmer. <span class="time" data-times="6.38" data-time="102.65">[01:42.65]</span> When the water warms up, the <span class="highlight">concentration</span> of dissolved <span class="highlight">oxygen</span> in the water decreases. <span class="time" data-times="3.84" data-time="109.03">[01:49.03]</span>And this reduces the <span class="highlight">chance</span> that the <span class="highlight">salmon</span> eggs will <span class="highlight">survive</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.03" data-time="112.87">[01:52.87]</span>And the trees also help keep the soil on the banks of the <span class="highlight">stream</span> in place. <span class="time" data-times="7.1" data-time="117.9">[01:57.90]</span><span class="highlight">Salmon</span> cannot <span class="highlight">spawn</span> in streambeds clogged with <span class="highlight">sediment</span>, dirt, from the surrounding area. <span class="time" data-times="3.1" data-time="125">[02:05.00]</span>They need a clean, graveled streambed.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.4" data-time="128.1">[02:08.10]</span>Bred?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.1" data-time="130.5">[02:10.50]</span>Bred:I read that <span class="highlight">salmon</span> also help keep <span class="highlight">stream</span> healthy.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="1" data-time="133.6">[02:13.60]</span>Professor:Right. <span class="time" data-times="4.2" data-time="134.6">[02:14.60]</span><span class="highlight">Salmon</span><span class="highlight">contribute</span> important nutrients like <span class="highlight">carbon</span> and <span class="highlight">phosphorus</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.5" data-time="138.8">[02:18.80]</span>And these nutrients <span class="highlight">promote</span><span class="highlight">diversity</span> in the <span class="highlight">stream</span> environment. <span class="time" data-times="10.6" data-time="143.3">[02:23.30]</span> Ok, um, so <span class="highlight">salmon</span> need trees to successfully <span class="highlight">reproduce</span>, but surprisingly trees also need <span class="highlight">salmon</span>.<span class="time" data-times="3.65" data-time="153.9">[02:33.90]</span> And bears play an important <span class="highlight">intermediary</span> role. <span class="time" data-times="6.15" data-time="157.55">[02:37.55]</span>So in the autumn, bears are busy putting on extra-weight as they <span class="highlight">prepare</span> to hibernate. <span class="time" data-times="7.6" data-time="163.7">[02:43.70]</span>Each <span class="highlight">bear</span> catches an estimated 700 fish during the 45 days that the <span class="highlight">salmon</span> are spawning.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.4" data-time="171.3">[02:51.30]</span>The bears catch the <span class="highlight">salmon</span> in the streams and then they carry them back into the forest to eat. <span class="time" data-times="3.9" data-time="177.7">[02:57.70]</span>Sometimes as much as 800 meters from the streams. <span class="time" data-times="10.17" data-time="181.6">[03:01.60]</span>And since the bears only eat about half of each fish they catch, other animals like eagles, crows and insects feed on the leftovers.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="0.97999999999999" data-time="191.77">[03:11.77]</span>Maria?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.55" data-time="192.75">[03:12.75]</span>Maria:Why did the bears bring the <span class="highlight">salmon</span> so far into the forest?<span class="time" data-times="2.85" data-time="196.3">[03:16.30]</span> Why not just eat the fish near the streams?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.65" data-time="199.15">[03:19.15]</span>Professor:Well, imagine several hungry bears looking for <span class="highlight">salmon</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.2" data-time="203.8">[03:23.80]</span>When one <span class="highlight">bear</span> catches a fish, it's not uncommon for another <span class="highlight">bear</span> to try stealing it. <span class="time" data-times="3.12" data-time="210">[03:30.00]</span>These confrontations can be <span class="highlight">pretty</span><span class="highlight">intense</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.58" data-time="213.12">[03:33.12]</span>So it's safer to bring it back into the forest, to a place where the <span class="highlight">bear</span> can eat undisturbed.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.74" data-time="219.7">[03:39.70]</span>Bred:Um, you said that the bears only eat half of each fish they catch? <span class="time" data-times="5.36" data-time="223.44">[03:43.44]</span>I mean if I were a <span class="highlight">bear</span> preparing to hibernate, I probably eat everything I can catch.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.8" data-time="228.8">[03:48.80]</span>Professor:Well, certain parts of a <span class="highlight">salmon</span> are more nourishing, fattier than others. <span class="time" data-times="9.1" data-time="233.6">[03:53.60]</span>It's actually more <span class="highlight">efficient</span> for a <span class="highlight">bear</span> to only eat some parts of the fish and then try catching another one, <span class="highlight">instead</span> of eating the whole fish.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.9" data-time="242.7">[04:02.70]</span>Ok. So after the scavengers have eaten the leftovers, only the fish's <span class="highlight">skeleton</span> remains. <span class="time" data-times="2.6" data-time="249.6">[04:09.60]</span>Now, <span class="highlight">salmon</span><span class="highlight">contain</span><span class="highlight">nitrogen</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.9" data-time="252.2">[04:12.20]</span>So their decomposing bodies as skeletons provide a lot of <span class="highlight">nitrogen</span> to the surrounding forest. <span class="time" data-times="4.3" data-time="259.1">[04:19.10]</span> Plants <span class="highlight">absorb</span> this <span class="highlight">nitrogen</span> which they need to grow. <span class="time" data-times="4.6" data-time="263.4">[04:23.40]</span> So the <span class="highlight">transfer</span> of this <span class="highlight">nitrogen</span> to the forest is important. <span class="time" data-times="6.3" data-time="268">[04:28.00]</span> Forest near streams with <span class="highlight">salmon</span> actually <span class="highlight">reach</span><span class="highlight">maturity</span> faster than other forests.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.2" data-time="274.3">[04:34.30]</span> Ok, so, why's all these important? <span class="time" data-times="2.65" data-time="277.5">[04:37.50]</span> Well, <span class="highlight">salmon</span> are in trouble. <span class="time" data-times="3.05" data-time="280.15">[04:40.15]</span>Some of their populations have gone <span class="highlight">extinct</span>.<span class="time" data-times="7.3" data-time="283.2">[04:43.20]</span> And most of the <span class="highlight">remaining</span> populations have been <span class="highlight">significantly</span> reduced by overfishing and <span class="highlight">environmental</span> challenges. <span class="time" data-times="9.9" data-time="290.5">[04:50.50]</span>Now, conservationists can try to prevent overfishing but, well, I mean you can see the interconnections <span class="highlight">within</span> this <span class="highlight">ecosystem</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.8" data-time="300.4">[05:00.40]</span>We've already talked about the importance of trees to <span class="highlight">salmon</span> and the <span class="highlight">negative</span> effect that something like logging can have. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="307.2">[05:07.20]</span>So you can see that protecting this <span class="highlight">ecosystem</span> is going to take a <span class="highlight">broad</span> effort.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the lecture mainly about?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

And the example from your reading was the forest ecosystem along the pacific coast of North America. Um, specifically the role of salmon.</p><p>Here, after teaching simple examples of interactions in ecosystems with examples of ants and rodents, the professor began to talk about the complex interactions in the textbooks, that is, the relationship between salmon, trees, and bears in the North American forest. The lecture fragment mainly talks about the interaction in this ecosystem. Option C is appropriate. Option A is a new method of ensuring the survival of forest ecosystems, Option B is the similarity between deserts and forest ecosystems, and Option D is a factor that protects salmon in forest systems. Select C.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor mention ants and rodents competing for food?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To make sure the students understand the different components of an ecosystem</p><p>B. To point out the limited resources available to organisms in a desert ecosystem</p><p>C. To illustrate how different species adapt to extreme temperatures</p><p>D. To provide an example of an easily understood interaction within an ecosystem</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The source of this question is:</p><p>Ah, there are certain species of ants and rodents sharing a desert ecosystem in Arizona. And they compete for the same plants to eat. And the competition affects not only the size of the ant and rodent populations, but also the number of eventual plants. Now, this interaction is easy to see, right? However, there are many other interactions within ecosystems that are not so apparent and require close examination.</p><p>The reason the professor mentioned ants and rodents is that their interactions are relatively simple to explain the concept of interaction in ecosystems. Option D is appropriate. Option A is to ensure that students understand the composition of the ecosystem, Option B is to indicate the limited resources available to desert system organisms, and Option C is to explain how different species adapt to extreme environments. Select D.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor, how do trees contribute to the successful spawning of salmon? Click on 2 answers</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They provide streams with nutrients that the salmon need.</p><p>B. They provide shade that keeps streams sufficiently cool.</p><p>C. They help salmon avoid predators by providing camouflage.</p><p>D. They reduce the amount of sediment entering streambeds.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="BD"><p>The source of this question is:</p><p>In order to spawn, salmon need cold, clear streams to ensure the survival of their eggs. And trees in the surrounding forest play an important role here. Their leaves provide shade from the Sun.</p><p>......</p><p>And the trees also help keep the soil on the banks of the stream in place. Salmon cannot spawn in streambeds clogged with sediment, dirt, from the surrounding area. They need a clean, graveled streambed.</p><p>Here, the professor mentioned two advantages of trees for the spawning of salmon: one is to block the sunlight that shines on the stream and keep the stream cool; the other is to keep the soil and water clean and clear. Option B and Option D meet these two points respectively. Option A is about the nutrients the trees need to feed the salmon into the stream. Option C is that they help the salmon to provide pretender pretender dislikes. Double-select BD.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What point does the professor make about bears carrying salmon away from streams?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It results in bears eating fewer fish.</p><p>B. It reduces the amount of food available to scavengers.</p><p>C. It improves the health of the surrounding trees.</p><p>D. It improves the water quality of the streams.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The source of this question is:</p><p>Plants absorb this nitrogen which they need to grow. So. The transfer of this nitrogen to the forest is important. Forest near streams with salmon can also only bring out maturity faster than other forests.</p><p>The professor mentioned that bears and other creatures eat the remaining salmon residue to provide nitrogen to the trees. Option C is appropriate. Option A says that the fish that causes the bear to eat less, Option B says that it will cause the food of the scavengers to decrease, and Option D says that it will make the water quality of the surrounding streams better, and it is not appropriate. Select C.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor imply about overfishing?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It is one of several reasons that the bear population has declined.</p><p>B. It is difficult to prevent in both oceans and streams.</p><p>C. It cannot be the sole focus for those working to prevent salmon depletion.</p><p>D. Its impact is minor compared to the problems caused by logging.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The source of this question is:</p><p>Now, conservationists can try to prevent overfishing but, well, I mean you can see the interconnections within this ecosystem. We've already talked about the importance of trees to salmon and a negative effect that something like logging can have. So you can see That protecting this ecosystem is going to take a broad effort.</p><p>The professor here pointed out that although overfishing is one of the causes of the crisis in salmon, the entire ecosystem is affected by the whole body, so if you really want to improve the living conditions of salmon, you have to be comprehensive. To work hard, option C is appropriate. Option A says that this is one of the reasons for the reduction in the number of bears. Option B says that it is difficult to prevent over-fishing in the ocean and streams together. Option D says that its impact and the impact of logging are small and inappropriate. . Select C.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does one of the students say this:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

To explain why bears eat so much in a short time span</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The source of this question is:</p><p>Bred:</p><p>Um, you said that the bears only eat half of each fish they catch? I mean if I were a bear preparing to hibernate, I probably eat everything I can catch.</p><p>Students here question the teacher's talk that the bear only eats half of the fish. He feels that if he is storing fat for hibernation, he should try to eat as much as he can, and eat all the fish that he can eat. Option B is appropriate. Option A is to support the professor's hypothesis. Option C is to explain why the bears are in conflict. Option D is to explain why it is inappropriate for a bear to eat so many things in a short time. Select B.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
