            <span class="time" data-times="5" data-time="1">[00:01.00]</span>Listen to part of a lecture in an <span class="underline">environmental</span> science class.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.5" data-time="6">[00:06.00]</span>Professor:Today we are going to begin discussing ecosystems.<span class="time" data-times="14.1" data-time="9.5">[00:09.50]</span> One important point I want to <span class="underline">emphasize</span> in the reading is that there are many interactions that take place <span class="underline">within</span> an <span class="underline">ecosystem</span>, interactions between animals, interactions between living and non-living things and so on. <span class="time" data-times="3.9" data-time="23.6">[00:23.60]</span>Now these interactions can be <span class="underline">fairly</span> simple and <span class="underline">straightforward</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.75" data-time="27.5">[00:27.50]</span>Ah, there are certain <span class="underline">species</span> of ants and rodents sharing a <span class="underline">desert</span><span class="underline">ecosystem</span> in Arizona. <span class="time" data-times="2.85" data-time="33.25">[00:33.25]</span>And they <span class="underline">compete</span> for the same plants to eat. <span class="time" data-times="9" data-time="36.1">[00:36.10]</span>And the competition influence is not only the size of the ant and <span class="underline">rodent</span> populations, but also the number of eventual plants. <span class="time" data-times="4" data-time="45.1">[00:45.10]</span>Now, this <span class="underline">interaction</span> is easy to see, right? <span class="time" data-times="8.4" data-time="49.1">[00:49.10]</span>However, there are many other interactions <span class="underline">within</span> ecosystems that are not so <span class="underline">apparent</span> and <span class="underline">require</span> closer examination.<span class="time" data-times="6.2" data-time="57.5">[00:57.50]</span> And the example from your reading was the forest <span class="underline">ecosystem</span><span class="underline">along</span> the <span class="underline">Pacific</span><span class="underline">coast</span> of North America. <span class="time" data-times="4" data-time="63.7">[01:03.70]</span>Um, <span class="underline">specifically</span> the role of <span class="underline">salmon</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="9" data-time="67.7">[01:07.70]</span>Ok, as you probably know, <span class="underline">salmon</span> are born in fresh water streams, they might ran to oceans where they spent most of their lives. <span class="time" data-times="5.45" data-time="76.7">[01:16.70]</span>And then they return to the same streams where they were born to <span class="underline">reproduce</span>, or <span class="underline">spawn</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.35" data-time="82.15">[01:22.15]</span>In order to <span class="underline">spawn</span>, <span class="underline">salmon</span> need cold, <span class="underline">clear</span> streams to ensure the <span class="underline">survival</span> of their eggs.<span class="time" data-times="4.1" data-time="89.5">[01:29.50]</span> And trees in the surrounding forest play an important role here. <span class="time" data-times="3" data-time="93.6">[01:33.60]</span> Their leaves provide <span class="underline">shade</span> from the Sun. <span class="time" data-times="6.05" data-time="96.6">[01:36.60]</span> When logging removes the trees, the streams are open to the Sun and the water becomes warmer. <span class="time" data-times="6.38" data-time="102.65">[01:42.65]</span> When the water warms up, the <span class="underline">concentration</span> of dissolved <span class="underline">oxygen</span> in the water decreases. <span class="time" data-times="3.84" data-time="109.03">[01:49.03]</span>And this reduces the <span class="underline">chance</span> that the <span class="underline">salmon</span> eggs will <span class="underline">survive</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.03" data-time="112.87">[01:52.87]</span>And the trees also help keep the soil on the banks of the <span class="underline">stream</span> in place. <span class="time" data-times="7.1" data-time="117.9">[01:57.90]</span><span class="underline">Salmon</span> cannot <span class="underline">spawn</span> in streambeds clogged with <span class="underline">sediment</span>, dirt, from the surrounding area. <span class="time" data-times="3.1" data-time="125">[02:05.00]</span>They need a clean, graveled streambed.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.4" data-time="128.1">[02:08.10]</span>Bred?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.1" data-time="130.5">[02:10.50]</span>Bred:I read that <span class="underline">salmon</span> also help keep <span class="underline">stream</span> healthy.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1" data-time="133.6">[02:13.60]</span>Professor:Right. <span class="time" data-times="4.2" data-time="134.6">[02:14.60]</span><span class="underline">Salmon</span><span class="underline">contribute</span> important nutrients like <span class="underline">carbon</span> and <span class="underline">phosphorus</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.5" data-time="138.8">[02:18.80]</span>And these nutrients <span class="underline">promote</span><span class="underline">diversity</span> in the <span class="underline">stream</span> environment. <span class="time" data-times="10.6" data-time="143.3">[02:23.30]</span> Ok, um, so <span class="underline">salmon</span> need trees to successfully <span class="underline">reproduce</span>, but surprisingly trees also need <span class="underline">salmon</span>.<span class="time" data-times="3.65" data-time="153.9">[02:33.90]</span> And bears play an important <span class="underline">intermediary</span> role. <span class="time" data-times="6.15" data-time="157.55">[02:37.55]</span>So in the autumn, bears are busy putting on extra-weight as they <span class="underline">prepare</span> to hibernate. <span class="time" data-times="7.6" data-time="163.7">[02:43.70]</span>Each <span class="underline">bear</span> catches an estimated 700 fish during the 45 days that the <span class="underline">salmon</span> are spawning.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.4" data-time="171.3">[02:51.30]</span>The bears catch the <span class="underline">salmon</span> in the streams and then they carry them back into the forest to eat. <span class="time" data-times="3.9" data-time="177.7">[02:57.70]</span>Sometimes as much as 800 meters from the streams. <span class="time" data-times="10.17" data-time="181.6">[03:01.60]</span>And since the bears only eat about half of each fish they catch, other animals like eagles, crows and insects feed on the leftovers.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="0.97999999999999" data-time="191.77">[03:11.77]</span>Maria?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.55" data-time="192.75">[03:12.75]</span>Maria:Why did the bears bring the <span class="underline">salmon</span> so far into the forest?<span class="time" data-times="2.85" data-time="196.3">[03:16.30]</span> Why not just eat the fish near the streams?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.65" data-time="199.15">[03:19.15]</span>Professor:Well, imagine several hungry bears looking for <span class="underline">salmon</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.2" data-time="203.8">[03:23.80]</span>When one <span class="underline">bear</span> catches a fish, it's not uncommon for another <span class="underline">bear</span> to try stealing it. <span class="time" data-times="3.12" data-time="210">[03:30.00]</span>These confrontations can be <span class="underline">pretty</span><span class="underline">intense</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.58" data-time="213.12">[03:33.12]</span>So it's safer to bring it back into the forest, to a place where the <span class="underline">bear</span> can eat undisturbed.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.74" data-time="219.7">[03:39.70]</span>Bred:Um, you said that the bears only eat half of each fish they catch? <span class="time" data-times="5.36" data-time="223.44">[03:43.44]</span>I mean if I were a <span class="underline">bear</span> preparing to hibernate, I probably eat everything I can catch.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.8" data-time="228.8">[03:48.80]</span>Professor:Well, certain parts of a <span class="underline">salmon</span> are more nourishing, fattier than others. <span class="time" data-times="9.1" data-time="233.6">[03:53.60]</span>It's actually more <span class="underline">efficient</span> for a <span class="underline">bear</span> to only eat some parts of the fish and then try catching another one, <span class="underline">instead</span> of eating the whole fish.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.9" data-time="242.7">[04:02.70]</span>Ok. So after the scavengers have eaten the leftovers, only the fish's <span class="underline">skeleton</span> remains. <span class="time" data-times="2.6" data-time="249.6">[04:09.60]</span>Now, <span class="underline">salmon</span><span class="underline">contain</span><span class="underline">nitrogen</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.9" data-time="252.2">[04:12.20]</span>So their decomposing bodies as skeletons provide a lot of <span class="underline">nitrogen</span> to the surrounding forest. <span class="time" data-times="4.3" data-time="259.1">[04:19.10]</span> Plants <span class="underline">absorb</span> this <span class="underline">nitrogen</span> which they need to grow. <span class="time" data-times="4.6" data-time="263.4">[04:23.40]</span> So the <span class="underline">transfer</span> of this <span class="underline">nitrogen</span> to the forest is important. <span class="time" data-times="6.3" data-time="268">[04:28.00]</span> Forest near streams with <span class="underline">salmon</span> actually <span class="underline">reach</span><span class="underline">maturity</span> faster than other forests.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.2" data-time="274.3">[04:34.30]</span> Ok, so, why's all these important? <span class="time" data-times="2.65" data-time="277.5">[04:37.50]</span> Well, <span class="underline">salmon</span> are in trouble. <span class="time" data-times="3.05" data-time="280.15">[04:40.15]</span>Some of their populations have gone <span class="underline">extinct</span>.<span class="time" data-times="7.3" data-time="283.2">[04:43.20]</span> And most of the <span class="underline">remaining</span> populations have been <span class="underline">significantly</span> reduced by overfishing and <span class="underline">environmental</span> challenges. <span class="time" data-times="9.9" data-time="290.5">[04:50.50]</span>Now, conservationists can try to prevent overfishing but, well, I mean you can see the interconnections <span class="underline">within</span> this <span class="underline">ecosystem</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.8" data-time="300.4">[05:00.40]</span>We've already talked about the importance of trees to <span class="underline">salmon</span> and the <span class="underline">negative</span> effect that something like logging can have. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="307.2">[05:07.20]</span>So you can see that protecting this <span class="underline">ecosystem</span> is going to take a <span class="underline">broad</span> effort.</p>
