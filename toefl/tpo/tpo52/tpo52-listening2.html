<span class="time" data-times="10" data-time="123.6">[02:03.60]</span>And if you look at the large heads of cabbage farther back, every <span class="highlight">detail</span>, every crinkle in each leaf, all the fruits, are so <span class="highlight">precise</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.2" data-time="133.6">[02:13.60]</span>They are almost like a <span class="highlight">sketch</span> you'd see in a <span class="highlight">field</span> guide. <span class="time" data-times="11.8" data-time="136.8">[02:16.80]</span>Peale and other painters of this <span class="highlight">era</span> used still-life painting as a way of exploring the natural world and satisfying their <span class="highlight">curiosity</span> about nature.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="9.4" data-time="148.6">[02:28.60]</span>So now we can take some time to discuss a little more of... more about the... the actual <span class="highlight">process</span> of still-life painting. <span class="time" data-times="6" data-time="158">[02:38.00]</span>Now, before you paint a single <span class="highlight">stroke</span>, you've got to plan the <span class="highlight">composition</span> of your painting. <span class="time" data-times="5.3" data-time="164">[02:44.00]</span>You know, the arrangement of the objects to make sure everything is set up the way you <span class="highlight">wanted</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.5" data-time="169.3">[02:49.30]</span> I remember a still-life piece I painted when I was in university. <span class="time" data-times="4.4" data-time="173.8">[02:53.80]</span>It was vegetables I think and I had created scratches of the <span class="highlight">setting</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.9" data-time="178.2">[02:58.20]</span>But then I realized the arrangement of the vegetables in a basket just, just didn't look right. <span class="time" data-times="1.6" data-time="185.1">[03:05.10]</span>So I had to start over. <span class="time" data-times="7.9" data-time="186.7">[03:06.70]</span>So I can say from experiment it's really important to make sure your arrangement is just right before you <span class="highlight">even</span> start painting.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.4" data-time="194.6">[03:14.60]</span>Now, what are some ways to make sure the <span class="highlight">composition</span> of your painting is the way you want it to be? <span class="time" data-times="9.7" data-time="201">[03:21.00]</span>Well, it's important in the still-life to make sure you're not overdoing the <span class="highlight">amount</span> of <span class="highlight">positive</span><span class="highlight">space</span>, the <span class="highlight">amount</span> of <span class="highlight">stuff</span> in your piece. <span class="time" data-times="4.6" data-time="210.7">[03:30.70]</span>The still-life really is not just about the <span class="highlight">subject</span> matter.<span class="time" data-times="6.3" data-time="215.3">[03:35.30]</span> If you make a really cluttered <span class="highlight">composition</span> with too much going on, it can <span class="highlight">throw</span> off your painting. <span class="time" data-times="3.7" data-time="221.6">[03:41.60]</span> That's something you notice in the James Peale painting. <span class="time" data-times="2.4" data-time="225.3">[03:45.30]</span> Notice how it really... you know it makes great use of <span class="highlight">negative</span><span class="highlight">space</span>, you can see how he <span class="highlight">sort</span> of embraces those little empty spots on the table. <span class="time" data-times="13.5" data-time="227.7">[03:47.70]</span>And that adds a really nice <span class="highlight">sense</span> of <span class="highlight">balance</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.6" data-time="241.2">[04:01.20]</span>Also, try to make your still-life look natural. <span class="time" data-times="9.9" data-time="244.8">[04:04.80]</span>If it looks contrived and if it's <span class="highlight">obvious</span> a person <span class="highlight">deliberately</span> arranged everything, it takes away from the <span class="highlight">simplicity</span> and the natural feel of the work. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="254.7">[04:14.70]</span>Basically the best still-life paintings are the ones where the objects don't look arranged for the painting at all, but that those tomatoes are near that cabbage on a table by <span class="highlight">accident</span>.</p></p></article></section><div id="question"><div id="question1"><p>What is the purpose of the lecture?</p><label class="my-label"><span>A.
