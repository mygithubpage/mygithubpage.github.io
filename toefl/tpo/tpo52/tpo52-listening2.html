          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3" data-time="3">[00:03.00]</span>Listen to part of a lecture in an art class.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.7" data-time="6">[00:06.00]</span>Professor:This week you are going to be studying something new, a painting in still-life. <span class="time" data-times="5.3" data-time="10.7">[00:10.70]</span>First I want to give you a little background that might be helpful when you start working. <span class="time" data-times="9" data-time="16">[00:16.00]</span>We spend a lot of time on portrays in this class and moving from painting people to painting objects, might feel like a big <span class="underline">shift</span>.<span class="time" data-times="12" data-time="25">[00:25.00]</span> But I think it's important for you to understand that you could <span class="underline">pack</span> just as much life and vibrancy and excitement into a painting of a bowl of fruit as you can into something more <span class="underline">dynamic</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.7" data-time="37">[00:37.00]</span>And, you know, still-lives don't just need to be <span class="underline">straightforward</span> representations. <span class="time" data-times="12.4" data-time="42.7">[00:42.70]</span>A lot of still-life painters really use the <span class="underline">simplicity</span> of the style to send a message or tell a story, <span class="underline">even</span> portrays sometimes include elements of still-life paintings. <span class="time" data-times="4.7" data-time="55.1">[00:55.10]</span>For example, in a <span class="underline">portray</span>, there might be a map, hanging on the wall.<span class="time" data-times="3.4" data-time="59.8">[00:59.80]</span> Or there might be some books on the table next to the <span class="underline">subject</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.3" data-time="63.2">[01:03.20]</span> These objects tell you something about the <span class="underline">subject</span> like maybe that person was well-educated.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.3" data-time="69.5">[01:09.50]</span> A big part of still-life painting is the use of those kinds of symbols. <span class="time" data-times="5.7" data-time="74.8">[01:14.80]</span>The objects you include can provide more contacts than help <span class="underline">convey</span> your message. <span class="time" data-times="8" data-time="80.5">[01:20.50]</span> I'd also like to show everyone an example of still-life that we can talk about a little and use to get some inspiration.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6" data-time="88.5">[01:28.50]</span>This is by James Peale, one of the true masters of the art of still-life.<span class="time" data-times="5.2" data-time="94.5">[01:34.50]</span>This piece is called Still-life, bowls, some apples and vegetables. <span class="time" data-times="5.8" data-time="99.7">[01:39.70]</span>And it's a really, really great example of what I'm going to be looking <span class="underline">forward</span> in your painting.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.94" data-time="105.5">[01:45.50]</span>Now, Peale did his work in the early 19th <span class="underline">century</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.86" data-time="109.44">[01:49.44]</span>And painters of that period approached still-life painting from a <span class="underline">scientific</span><span class="underline">perspective</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.36" data-time="115.3">[01:55.30]</span>Let's look at this painting to help you understand what I mean. <span class="time" data-times="4.94" data-time="118.66">[01:58.66]</span>See the red tomatoes in the <span class="underline">foreground</span> and how <span class="underline">vibrate</span> that color is? <span class="time" data-times="10" data-time="123.6">[02:03.60]</span>And if you look at the large heads of cabbage farther back, every <span class="underline">detail</span>, every crinkle in each leaf, all the fruits, are so <span class="underline">precise</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.2" data-time="133.6">[02:13.60]</span>They are almost like a <span class="underline">sketch</span> you'd see in a <span class="underline">field</span> guide. <span class="time" data-times="11.8" data-time="136.8">[02:16.80]</span>Peale and other painters of this <span class="underline">era</span> used still-life painting as a way of exploring the natural world and satisfying their <span class="underline">curiosity</span> about nature.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="9.4" data-time="148.6">[02:28.60]</span>So now we can take some time to discuss a little more of... more about the... the actual <span class="underline">process</span> of still-life painting. <span class="time" data-times="6" data-time="158">[02:38.00]</span>Now, before you paint a single <span class="underline">stroke</span>, you've got to plan the <span class="underline">composition</span> of your painting. <span class="time" data-times="5.3" data-time="164">[02:44.00]</span>You know, the arrangement of the objects to make sure everything is set up the way you <span class="underline">wanted</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.5" data-time="169.3">[02:49.30]</span> I remember a still-life piece I painted when I was in university. <span class="time" data-times="4.4" data-time="173.8">[02:53.80]</span>It was vegetables I think and I had created scratches of the <span class="underline">setting</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.9" data-time="178.2">[02:58.20]</span>But then I realized the arrangement of the vegetables in a basket just, just didn't look right. <span class="time" data-times="1.6" data-time="185.1">[03:05.10]</span>So I had to start over. <span class="time" data-times="7.9" data-time="186.7">[03:06.70]</span>So I can say from experiment it's really important to make sure your arrangement is just right before you <span class="underline">even</span> start painting.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.4" data-time="194.6">[03:14.60]</span>Now, what are some ways to make sure the <span class="underline">composition</span> of your painting is the way you want it to be? <span class="time" data-times="9.7" data-time="201">[03:21.00]</span>Well, it's important in the still-life to make sure you're not overdoing the <span class="underline">amount</span> of <span class="underline">positive</span><span class="underline">space</span>, the <span class="underline">amount</span> of <span class="underline">stuff</span> in your piece. <span class="time" data-times="4.6" data-time="210.7">[03:30.70]</span>The still-life really is not just about the <span class="underline">subject</span> matter.<span class="time" data-times="6.3" data-time="215.3">[03:35.30]</span> If you make a really cluttered <span class="underline">composition</span> with too much going on, it can <span class="underline">throw</span> off your painting. <span class="time" data-times="3.7" data-time="221.6">[03:41.60]</span> That's something you notice in the James Peale painting. <span class="time" data-times="2.4" data-time="225.3">[03:45.30]</span> Notice how it really... you know it makes great use of <span class="underline">negative</span><span class="underline">space</span>, you can see how he <span class="underline">sort</span> of embraces those little empty spots on the table. <span class="time" data-times="13.5" data-time="227.7">[03:47.70]</span>And that adds a really nice <span class="underline">sense</span> of <span class="underline">balance</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.6" data-time="241.2">[04:01.20]</span>Also, try to make your still-life look natural. <span class="time" data-times="9.9" data-time="244.8">[04:04.80]</span>If it looks contrived and if it's <span class="underline">obvious</span> a person <span class="underline">deliberately</span> arranged everything, it takes away from the <span class="underline">simplicity</span> and the natural feel of the work. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="254.7">[04:14.70]</span>Basically the best still-life paintings are the ones where the objects don't look arranged for the painting at all, but that those tomatoes are near that cabbage on a table by <span class="underline">accident</span>.</p>
