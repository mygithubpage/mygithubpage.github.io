First, if a house has many windows, it could offer the people who live in it better scenery to appreciate, whether it's a glorious city view or spectacular natural scenery. With this, while feeing quite tired after work, they could take a look at outside world and refresh their mind. Second, plenty of windows would make the interior environment bright, which is very essential to people's mood and health. When people are in a dark surrounding, they tend to be upset, impatient and depressed. On the contrary, brightness could bring them a better mood and in a long run would do good to their physical health as well. Therefore, having plenty of windows is a characteristic in a house or apartment that I value.</p></article></div></main></body></html>
