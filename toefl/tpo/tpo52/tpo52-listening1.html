            <span class="time" data-times="7" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Listen to a <span class="highlight">conversation</span> between a student and his <span class="highlight">creative</span> writing professor.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.25" data-time="7">[00:07.00]</span>Professor: John, listen. I can clearly see that you put a lot of time into your <span class="highlight">response</span> paper.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.95" data-time="12.25">[00:12.25]</span>John: I did! It took me forever. <span class="time" data-times="1.83" data-time="14.2">[00:14.20]</span>I rewrote it a <span class="highlight">dozen</span> times.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.17" data-time="16.03">[00:16.03]</span>Professor: And your hard work shows. <span class="time" data-times="2.63" data-time="18.2">[00:18.20]</span> <span class="highlight">Unfortunately</span>, it's a week late.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.87" data-time="20.83">[00:20.83]</span>John: I know. Sorry. <span class="time" data-times="3.4" data-time="22.7">[00:22.70]</span>I just got a little behind, you know, sports and homework. <span class="time" data-times="1.6" data-time="26.1">[00:26.10]</span>But I'm on top of things now.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.4" data-time="27.7">[00:27.70]</span>Professor: Glad to hear it!<span class="time" data-times="8.1" data-time="29.1">[00:29.10]</span> Now, as for our meeting today, I'd like to talk to all of my <span class="highlight">creative</span> writing students one on one at <span class="highlight">least</span> once during the <span class="highlight">term</span> and see how they're doing.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.9" data-time="37.2">[00:37.20]</span> John: I think I'm doing OK. Busy, you know, but other than that...</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="10.9" data-time="41.1">[00:41.10]</span> Professor: Well, I found <span class="highlight">through</span> the years that some of my assignments can be <span class="highlight">pretty</span> <span class="highlight">tough</span> for first year students like yourself, like the <span class="highlight">response</span> paper you just did, the explication of a Pablo Neruda poem. <span class="time" data-times="3" data-time="52">[00:52.00]</span> Emm...by the way, why did you choose "The Lemon"? <span class="time" data-times="2.6" data-time="55">[00:55.00]</span>It's an unusual choice. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.6" data-time="57.6">[00:57.60]</span>John: It was my favorite in the book of Neruda's poems. <span class="time" data-times="4" data-time="60.2">[01:00.20]</span>All the poems are about everyday objects and, you know, simple pleasures.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.1" data-time="64.2">[01:04.20]</span>Professor: Right, Elemental Odes, one of my favorites.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="10.5" data-time="67.3">[01:07.30]</span>John: I like how Neruda took things like fruit and vegetables and socks, and use metaphors and similes to <span class="highlight">describe</span> them as these wonderful <span class="highlight">mysterious</span> things, like in"The Lemon". <span class="time" data-times="6.6" data-time="77.8">[01:17.80]</span>He describes a lemon falling to Earth from the stars, and he compares a <span class="highlight">slice</span> of lemon to a stained glass window. <span class="time" data-times="1.3" data-time="84.4">[01:24.40]</span>It's so <span class="highlight">original</span>!</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2" data-time="85.7">[01:25.70]</span>Professor: Beautiful images, aren't they? <span class="time" data-times="3.45" data-time="87.7">[01:27.70]</span>Neruda didn't win the Nobel <span class="highlight">Prize</span> for <span class="highlight">literature</span> by <span class="highlight">accident</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.55" data-time="91.15">[01:31.15]</span>John: No, he didn't.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="11" data-time="92.7">[01:32.70]</span>Professor: Now, as you know, the paper was only the first half of the <span class="highlight">assignment</span>, and I'm concerned about your <span class="highlight">ability</span> to complete the <span class="highlight">second</span> part on time, considering how much time the first part took you. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.3" data-time="103.7">[01:43.70]</span>John: Actually, I finished it just before I came here.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.4" data-time="107">[01:47.00]</span>Professor: Excellent!</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.3" data-time="108.4">[01:48.40]</span>John: It was tricky, too. <span class="time" data-times="5" data-time="109.7">[01:49.70]</span>You know, having to write a poem inspired by "The Lemon", but in a completely different style.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1" data-time="114.7">[01:54.70]</span>Professor: Right!</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="8.4" data-time="115.7">[01:55.70]</span>John: In order to do that, I really had to study Neruda's style and read a lot of his <span class="highlight">stuff</span>, which was great, but "The Lemon" is free <span class="highlight">verse</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7" data-time="124.1">[02:04.10]</span>So to do the <span class="highlight">assignment</span>, I decided to use a <span class="highlight">strict</span> meter - iambic pentameter, to be as different as possible. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.95" data-time="131.1">[02:11.10]</span>Professor: So each <span class="highlight">line</span> of your poem has ten syllables and every other <span class="highlight">syllable</span> is stressed. <span class="time" data-times="1.35" data-time="137.05">[02:17.05]</span>Interesting choice! <span class="time" data-times="3.1" data-time="138.4">[02:18.40]</span>Iambic pentameter is certainly different from free <span class="highlight">verse</span>. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.33" data-time="141.5">[02:21.50]</span>John: It was hard for me though, because usually when I write a poem, I choose my own topic, and I just write. <span class="time" data-times="2.77" data-time="147.83">[02:27.83]</span>I don't worry about counting syllables or anything. <span class="time" data-times="4" data-time="150.6">[02:30.60]</span>So, I'm kind of hoping we won't have more assignments like this?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="154.6">[02:34.60]</span>Professor: Sorry to <span class="highlight">disappoint</span> you, but these assignments are designed to get you out of your comfort <span class="highlight">zone</span>, to get you reading and writing a wide <span class="highlight">variety</span> of poetic styles.</p>
