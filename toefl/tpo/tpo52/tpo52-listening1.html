              <p>The source of this question is:</p>
              <p>"Professor: Now, as you know, the paper was only the first half of the assignment, and I'm concerned about your ability to complete the second part on time, considering how much time the first part took you. "</p>
              <p>The title is the subject of the content. The professor's statement serves as a link between the two, and divides the structure of the dialogue into two parts. The first half of the conversation is talking about the first part of the student's homework: reading notes about Neruda's "Lemon" poem; and the second half of the conversation is about the second part of student work: from "Lemon" I was inspired to write a different poem. The entire conversation is centered on these two parts of the student's homework. Therefore, in the full text, the C option is correct.</p>
              <p>The A option was wrong because there was no mention in the dialogue about teaching challenges and questioning her students.</p>
              <p>Option B was wrong. Although the student's homework was late for a week, it was not the focus of the conversation.</p>
              <p>The D option is wrong, because the article only discusses the distinctive style of Neruda's poetry in the first half, but it is also not the focus of the article.</p>

              <p>This question is a detailed question. From the teaching of this sentence we know that the purpose of her regular conversation with students is to see how their homework is done. The "routinely" in the D option corresponds to "at least only during the term" in the original text; the "individually" in the D option is the synonym conversion of "one on one" in the original text. Therefore, the D option is correct.</p>
              <p>The A option was wrong, because although the professor said that the student's homework was very effective, it was not the main purpose of her talking to the student.</p>
              <p>The B option was wrong, because the hearing did not say that the professor worried that the student did not read a lot of poetry.</p>
              <p>The C option was wrong, because there was no mention in the listening source of the professor's book to borrow the student's poetry.</p>

              <p>The source of this question is:</p>
              <p>"John: It was my favorite in the book of Neruda's poems. All the poems are about everyday objects and, you know, simple pleasures.</p>
              <p>Professor: Right, Elemental Odes, one of my favorites.</p>
              <p>John: I like how Neruda took things like fruit and vegetables and socks, and use metaphors and similes to describe them as these wonderful mysterious things, like in "The Lemon". He describes a lemon falling to Earth from the stars, and he compares The slice of lemon to a stained glass window. It's so original!"</p>
              <p>This question is a detailed question. From the students' words, we know that the reason he likes Neruda's poetry is that Neruda describes life in common objects such as fruits, vegetables, and socks as metaphors and similes. Mysterious things. This creative method is very new. The "common objects" in the D option correspond to the "everyday objects" in the listening source; and the "unexpected ways" in the D option correspond to the "wonderful mysterious things" in the listening source. Therefore, the D option is correct.</p>
              <p>The A option was wrong, because Neruda didn't challenge himself in listening, limiting all poetry to fruit and vegetables.</p>
              <p>The B option was wrong, because hearing did not say that Neruda's poetry had many different styles.</p>
              <p>The C option was wrong, because no mention of color in the hearing made Neruda's poetry more memorable. The article only uses Neruda to compare the lemon slice to the stained glass window as an example to highlight that he described extraordinary food as extraordinary.</p>

              <p>John: In order to do that, I really had to study Neruda's style and read a lot of his stuff, which was great, but "The Lemon" is free verse. So to do the assignment, I decided to use a strict meter- -iambic pentameter, to be as different as possible."</p>
              <p>The title is organizational structure questions. From the source of this question, we know that the student mentions "five-steps to suppress the gesture" to explain how he organized his own poetry. So the B option is correct.</p>
              <p>The A option was wrong because the student did not say that his poem was longer than Lemon.</p>
              <p>The C option was wrong, because the student mentioned that "five-steps is not a step" is not to explain what he likes most about "lemon". On the contrary, "lemon" is actually a free poetry, and he did not use pentatonic gestures, so the C option is obviously wrong.</p>
              <p>The D option is wrong, because the purpose of the students is not to distinguish Neruda's poetry from other poets.</p>

              <span>Answer: </span>
              <span class="answer">A</span>
            </p>
            <div class="explanation">
              <p>The source of this question is:</p>
              <p>"Professor: Beautiful images, aren't they? Neruda didn't win the Nobel Prize for literature by accident.</p>
              <p>John: No, he didn't."</p>
              <p>The title is a sentence function. Professor said this sentence: Neruda did not happen to get the Nobel Prize for literature. Before the professor said this, the students said a lot of words about Neruda's novel poetic style. Therefore, the meaning of teaching this sentence is actually to say that Neruda's poetic style is very new and interesting, so he won the Nobel Prize for Literature, which is inevitable and well deserved. "By accident" means "incidentally, accidentally". Then "not accidental" means "necessary."Therefore, the A option is correct.</p>
              <p>The B option was wrong, because the professor's remarks were ambiguous, not pejorative, and she did not mean that Neruda should not have won the Nobel Prize for literature.</p>
              <p>The C option was wrong because the professor was not surprised that Neruda's poetry was less famous.</p>
              <p>The D option was wrong because Neruda was indeed awarded the Nobel Prize for literature.</p>
