First, with friends being around, people couldn't fully enjoy or appreciate films or concerts. While watching a movie or listening to a concert, what people want most is to indulge themselves in it and forget all the worries and troubles from the outside world. If their friends are nearby, they couldn't concentrate, not to mention enjoy what they are watching or listening to. Second, they may feel bored if they are not into the concerts or movies. What the group is going to watch or listen is up to the one in charge. For example, if one prefers action movie while the final decision made by the leader a romantic film, then this is definitely going to be a boring and killing experience to this person. Therefore, I wouldn't recommend people going to a movie or concert with friends.</p></article></div></main></body></html>
