            <span class="time" data-times="4" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Listen to part of a lecture in an archeology class. <span class="time" data-times="4" data-time="4">[00:04.00]</span>The professor has been discussing <span class="underline">ancient</span> Mayan <span class="underline">civilization</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="12" data-time="8">[00:08.00]</span>Professor: Now, as you remember from your reading, the Maya were an <span class="underline">ancient</span><span class="underline">civilization</span> which occupied in area corresponding to parts of modern-day Mexico and Central America. <span class="time" data-times="9.5" data-time="20">[00:20.00]</span>Early Mayan settlements <span class="underline">date</span> back over 3,000 years and say from about 600 to 900 C.E. <span class="time" data-times="8" data-time="29.5">[00:29.50]</span>The <span class="underline">civilization</span> was in what's considered a golden age of cultural achievement, what we call the <span class="underline">Classic</span> period.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="8" data-time="37.5">[00:37.50]</span>The period after this, after the <span class="underline">Classic</span> Period, is called the Postclassic period. <span class="time" data-times="7.8" data-time="45.5">[00:45.50]</span>Now it's long been thought that during the PostClassic period, Mayan <span class="underline">civilization</span> was in <span class="underline">decline</span>. <span class="time" data-times="16.7" data-time="53.3">[00:53.30]</span>But we're continuing to find new <span class="underline">evidence</span> that in certain areas Mayan <span class="underline">civilization</span> flourished right up to the end of the Postclassic period, what we <span class="underline">refer</span> to as the late Postclassic period. <span class="time" data-times="9.5" data-time="70">[01:10.00]</span> The late Postclassic corresponds to the period from the 1200s to 1500s, right until the arrival of the Spanish in the mid-1500s. <span class="time" data-times="14" data-time="79.5">[01:19.50]</span> A good example of a site which continued to <span class="underline">flourish</span><span class="underline">through</span> the late Postclassic is the inland Mayan <span class="underline">community</span> of Lamanai, located in what is today the country of Belize in Central America. <span class="time" data-times="6.6" data-time="93.5">[01:33.50]</span>Now, Lamanai is one of the largest and most <span class="underline">prominent</span> archeological sites in Belize. <span class="time" data-times="3.9" data-time="100.1">[01:40.10]</span>It was occupied for over 3000 years. <span class="time" data-times="6" data-time="104">[01:44.00]</span> That makes it the longest continually-occupied site by the <span class="underline">ancient</span> Maya. <span class="time" data-times="8.5" data-time="110">[01:50.00]</span>Large-scale <span class="underline">excavation</span> at Lamanai began back in 1974 under the leadership of a Canadian archeologist. <span class="time" data-times="6" data-time="118.5">[01:58.50]</span>The first <span class="underline">excavation</span> there was on a building that <span class="underline">dated</span> back to the late Postclassic period. <span class="time" data-times="5" data-time="124.5">[02:04.50]</span>When the <span class="underline">excavation</span> began, we didn't know much about Mayan life during that time.<span class="time" data-times="8" data-time="129.5">[02:09.50]</span> As I said, most people considered the Postclassic period as a time of <span class="underline">decline</span> that came after the so-called golden <span class="underline">era</span>.<span class="time" data-times="14" data-time="137.5">[02:17.50]</span> But during the first few years of <span class="underline">excavation</span>, the archeological team realized that Lamanai had continued to be an important center of <span class="underline">classic</span> Mayan <span class="underline">culture</span>, almost right up until the 1500s.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="8.5" data-time="151.5">[02:31.50]</span> Student: So basically, what you are saying is while other Mayan cities were collapsing or had already collapsed, Lamanai was one of those places that was <span class="underline">flourishing</span>?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="8.5" data-time="160">[02:40.00]</span> Professor: Uh huh...exactly! In fact, the <span class="underline">evidence</span> shows that one of the greatest periods of <span class="underline">construction</span> in the city occurred during the Postclassic. <span class="time" data-times="4.5" data-time="168.5">[02:48.50]</span> That's <span class="underline">definitely</span> not what was happening at neighboring sites during that time.<span class="time" data-times="11" data-time="173">[02:53.00]</span> And <span class="underline">consider</span> this, archeologists found <span class="underline">ceramic</span> artifacts from Lamanai's late Postclassic period at a recently-discovered site on an island off the <span class="underline">coast</span> of Belize. <span class="time" data-times="10" data-time="184">[03:04.00]</span>And in Lamanai they found objects that had been imported from parts of the <span class="underline">region</span> which <span class="underline"><span class="underline">correspond</span></span> to modern-day Mexico during the late Postclassic. <span class="time" data-times="3" data-time="194">[03:14.00]</span>What did those finds tell us?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.3" data-time="197">[03:17.00]</span>
            <span class="underline">Female</span> student: eh...the <span class="underline">trade</span> was still going on?<span class="time" data-times="6.7" data-time="199.3">[03:19.30]</span> So you probably still find the same Mayan social structure and <span class="underline">economic</span> practices, right?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="8.3" data-time="206">[03:26.00]</span>Professor: Yes. Now, these researchers and <span class="underline">subsequent</span> research teams have been helping us see a bigger picture. <span class="time" data-times="14.7" data-time="214.3">[03:34.30]</span>We now know that there was still a <span class="underline">widespread</span> trading network up and down a long <span class="underline">portion</span> of the <span class="underline">coast</span> of what is modern-day Mexico and Central America for more than two centuries after the golden <span class="underline">era</span> ended. <span class="time" data-times="2.5" data-time="229">[03:49.00]</span>Those finds are telling.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2" data-time="231.5">[03:51.50]</span>
            <span class="underline">Female</span> student: How big is Lamanai <span class="underline">overall</span>?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.2" data-time="233.5">[03:53.50]</span>Professor: Well, in all, 700 stone structures have been documented. <span class="time" data-times="6" data-time="238.7">[03:58.70]</span>It takes several life times and lots of <span class="underline">funding</span> to uncover all of them. <span class="time" data-times="5.9" data-time="244.7">[04:04.70]</span>Ok, if that's not a helpful <span class="underline">mental</span> picture...all right here's another <span class="underline">detail</span> that might help. <span class="time" data-times="7" data-time="250.6">[04:10.60]</span>There was once a <span class="underline">population</span> between 35 and 55 thousand there. <span class="time" data-times="5" data-time="257.6">[04:17.60]</span>The southernmost end of Lamanai had become the city center by the Postclassic period. <span class="time" data-times="10" data-time="262.6">[04:22.60]</span>It was there at the southern end that people continued to develop <span class="underline">technological</span> capabilities, especially in ceramics and <span class="underline">eventually</span> in metal work. <span class="time" data-times="5.7" data-time="272.6">[04:32.60]</span>The center of Lamanai society had <span class="underline">previously</span> been in the northern part of the city. <span class="time" data-times="6.3" data-time="278.3">[04:38.30]</span>We're not yet sure why the <span class="underline">focus</span> of life shifted southward only that it did.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.1" data-time="284.6">[04:44.60]</span>
            <span class="underline">Female</span> student: Was the <span class="underline">former</span> center, the one in the north smaller than the new one in the south? <span class="time" data-times="4.5" data-time="289.7">[04:49.70]</span>Like maybe the <span class="underline">population</span> grew so they needed more room and moved?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.6" data-time="294.2">[04:54.20]</span>Professor: Actually, the new city center was smaller. <span class="time" data-times="6.7" data-time="297.8">[04:57.80]</span>It's possible that's because the <span class="underline">population</span> had decreased by that point so they actually needed less room. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="304.5">[05:04.50]</span>In any case, the restructured <span class="underline">community</span> thrived.</p>
