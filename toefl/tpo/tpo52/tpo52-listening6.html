To familiarize students with the Mayan civilization in the Classic Period</p><p>B. To prepare students for an archaeology project about the Mayan civilization</p><p>C. To provide evidence for a point made in a previous class about the Mayan civilization</p><p>D. To call into question a common view about the decline of ancient Mayan civilization</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The source of this question is: The period after this, after the Classic period, is called the Postclassic period. Now it's long been thought that during the PostClassic period, Mayan civilization was in decline. But we're continuing to find new evidence that In certain areas Mayan civilization flourished right up to the end of the Postclassic period, what we refer to as the late Postclassic period.</p><p>This question is the main subject of the goal and asks the main content of the lecture. Although at the beginning it was the professor who introduced the golden age of the Maya culture, then afterwards he said that there is now archaeological evidence continuously being discovered, proving that some areas of the Postclassic Period have also continued to flourish. The later part of this article also proves that the pros and cons of the post-classical period is actually evidenced by the typical example of Lamanai. It is not empty-mouthed. So the correct answer is D: Questioning the traditional view of the decline of the ancient Maya civilization.</p><p>A wrong option. The professor did not want to let students understand the classical period through this lecture. This article focuses on the post-classical period.</p><p>B option is wrong. This lecture is just a period of introduction to the Mayan civilization. There is no relevant content of the archaeological project.</p><p>The C option is wrong. The professor did not mention the information of the previous class in the lecture. This option is purely out of nothing.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor discuss Lamanai in detail?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To present findings about one Mayan settlement from the Postclassic period</p><p>B. To describe the physical layout of the first Mayan settlements in Central America</p><p>C. To criticize the excavation methods used there during the 1970s</p><p>D. To note how the size of a typical Mayan settlement varied throughout its history</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The source of this question is: But we're continuing to find new evidence that in certain areas Mayan civilization flourished right up to the end of the Postclassic period, what we refer to as the late Postclassic period. The late Postclassic corresponds to the period From the 1200s to 1500s, right until the arrival of the Spanish in the mid-1500s. A good example of a site which continued to flourish through the late Postclassic is the inland Mayan community of Lamanai, located in what is today the country of Belize In Central America.</p><p>This question is a functional topic question. Ask the professor why he specifically mentioned Lamanai. Lamanai is an example given by the professor here. The general purpose is often related to the foregoing. Previous professors mentioned that new evidence is constantly being discovered, proving that they have been thriving during the post-classical period in some areas of the Mayan civilization. Later, we will follow Lamanai's example. Obviously, the professor wants to prove concrete examples for the idea of ​​prosperity and development. Therefore, the correct answer is A: Give some discoveries of a settlement in the Maya civilization in the post-classical period.</p><p>B option is wrong.The lecture did not mention that Lamanai was the first settlement of the Mayan civilization. The overall layout emerged at the end of the lecture and was not relevant to the questions asked here.</p><p>The C option is wrong. There is no relevant content that criticizes the archeologists' methods of excavation.</p><p>D option is wrong. The change in the size of the city of Lamanai occurred only at the end of the lecture. The relationship with the city is not great.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is one of the features that gives Lamanai special archaeological significance?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It was the first Mayan site in Belize to be excavated in modern times.</p><p>B. It was occupied by two distinct cultural groups during the Classic period.</p><p>C. It was continuously occupied by the Maya longer than any other site.</p><p>D. It had an economic structure that was distinct from that of other Mayan cities.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The source of this question is: It was occupied for over 3000 years. That makes it the longest of-occupied site by the ancient Maya.</p><p>This topic is a detailed question that examines students' ability to remember details. What is the biggest archaeological feature of this place in Lamanai? The professor mentioned that the place of Lamanai has more than 300 years of history. It is the longest period of time that the ancient Mayan civilization was occupied. So the correct answer is C: It takes longer than the rest of the Mayan civilization.</p><p>Option A is wrong. The lecture did not say that Lamanai was the first city to be mined and mined. Just mentioned that the first excavation in Lamanai was for an ancient building.</p><p>Option B is wrong. The text does not mention the relevant information of two different cultural groups in the era of classical culture.</p><p>Option D is wrong. The text does mention the economic structure, but it does not mention Lamanai's economic structure and its differences elsewhere.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor say that it would require "lots of funding" to uncover the stone structures that she discusses?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Because there are so many of them</p><p>B. Because very few archaeologists are given access to them</p><p>C. Because they are located on so many different islands</p><p>D. Because of difficult weather conditions in the region</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The source of this question is: Female student: How big is Lamanai overall?</p><p>Professor: Well, in all, 700 stone structures have been documented. It takes several life times and lots of funding to uncover all of them.</p><p>This question is a goal question. The question asked why the professor said that he needed a lot of "funds" to dig these stone sculptures. Goals need to go to the front to find relevant information. In the previous article, the students asked how large this area of ​​Lamanai is. The professor did not respond positively but said that 700 stone carvings were recorded in Lamanai. It takes many years and a lot of money to dig up all these stone carvings. In other words, the implication of the professor is that Lamanai is a very large place, and the number of stone carvings is very large. Therefore, she only said that it would take a lot of time and money to dig. The correct answer is A.</p><p>Option B is wrong. From nothing, the original did not mention that almost no archeologist could touch the information of the stone carving.</p><p>Option C is wrong. Error message. When referring to the trade network, the lecture mentioned the discovery of ceramics imported from the surrounding islands in Lamanai. However, it is not said that stone carvings were found on other surrounding islands.</p><p>Option D is wrong. The lecture did not mention information about weather conditions at all. It was out of nothing.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor, what can be inferred from the ceramic artifacts found on the island?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The island was the source of most of the pottery used at Lamanai.</p><p>B. Much of Lamanai's population relocated to the island during the Postclassic period.</p><p>C. The Mayan trading network remained strong during the Postclassic period.</p><p>D. The Maya developed new technological capabilities on the island.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The source of this question is:</p><p>Professor: And consider this, archeologists found ceramic artifacts from Lamanai's late Postclassic period at a recent-discovered site on an island off the coast of Belize. And in Lamanai they found objects that had been imported from parts of the region which correspond to modern- Day Mexico during the late Postclassic. What did those finds tell us?</p><p>The</p><p>Female student: eh...the trade was still going on? So you probably still find the same Mayan social structure and economic practices, right?</p><p>This question is an inference question. Topic asks what people can infer from Lamanai's ceramics found on the island? The lecture mentioned the discovery of Lanarai's ceramics on an island near Lamanai. In Lamanai, goods imported from other nearby areas were found. It can be seen that there was trade between Lamanai and the nearby area at that time. Choosing the correct answer is C. Maya civilization is still very active in business transactions in the post-classical period.</p><p>Option A is wrong. Its meaning and the meaning of the lecture just expressed the opposite. The source of ceramics that should be used on the island is Lamanai. The A option says that the source of pottery used by Lamanai is the nearby island.</p><p>Option B is wrong. From the original information, it can not be inferred that in the post-classical period, most of the population of Lamanai moved to the island.</p><p>Option D is wrong. From the original information, it cannot be inferred that the Maya people in post-classical period have developed new science and technology.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the student say this:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To request that the professor repeat the point she just made</p><p>B. To express his doubt about the period of time being discussed</p><p>C. To disagree with the professor's interpretation of the evidence about Lamanai</p><p>D. To find out if he correctly understands the professor's point</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The source of this question is: As I said, most people considered the Postclassic period as a time of decline that came after the so-called golden era. But during the first few years of excavation, the archeological team realized that Lamanai had continued to Be an important center of classic Mayan culture, almost right up until the 1500s.</p><p>The</p><p>Student: So basically, what you are saying is while other Mayan cities were collapsing or had already collapsed, Lamanai was one of those places that was flourishing?</p><p>This question is a heavy listening question. It is necessary to judge the true intention of the speaker based on the tone of the student. The above professor repeatedly emphasized an important message: Although other cities in the post-classical Mayan civilization may have declined, Lamanai is still prospering. Later students made a summary of the previous information of the professor and confirmed the previous information. The correct answer is D.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
