When the <span class="highlight">current</span> slows down, its <span class="highlight">competence</span> (how much it can carry) decreases and the <span class="highlight">stream</span> deposits the largest particles in the streambed. If <span class="highlight">current</span><span class="highlight">velocity</span> continues to <span class="highlight">decrease</span> - as a flood wanes, for example - finer particles <span class="highlight">settle</span> out on top of the large ones. Thus, a <span class="highlight">stream</span> sorts its <span class="highlight">sediment</span> according to size. A waning flood might <span class="highlight">deposit</span> a <span class="highlight">layer</span> of <span class="highlight">gravel</span>, overlain by sand and finally topped by <span class="highlight">silt</span> and <span class="highlight">clay</span>. Streams also <span class="highlight">sort</span><span class="highlight">sediment</span> in the downstream direction. Many mountain streams are choked with boulders and cobbles, but far downstream, their deltas are composed mainly of fine <span class="highlight">silt</span> and <span class="highlight">clay</span>. This downstream sorting is <span class="highlight question1">curious</span> because <span class="highlight">stream</span><span class="highlight">velocity</span> generally increases in the downstream direction. <span class="highlight">Competence</span> increases with <span class="highlight">velocity</span>, so a river should be able to <span class="highlight">transport</span> larger particles than its tributaries carry. One explanation for downstream sorting is that <span class="highlight">abrasion</span> wears away the boulders and cobbles to sand and <span class="highlight">silt</span> as the <span class="highlight">sediment</span> moves downstream over the years. Thus, only the fine <span class="highlight">sediment</span> reaches the <span class="highlight">lower</span> parts of most rivers.</p><p>A <span class="highlight">stream</span> deposits its <span class="highlight">sediment</span> in three environments: <span class="highlight">Alluvial</span> fans and deltas form where <span class="highlight">stream</span><span class="highlight">gradient</span> (<span class="highlight">angle</span> of incline) suddenly decreases as a <span class="highlight">stream</span> enters a <span class="highlight">flat</span><span class="highlight">plain</span>, a lake, or the sea; <span class="highlight">floodplain</span> deposits <span class="highlight"><span class="question4">accumulate</span></span> on a <span class="highlight">floodplain</span><span class="highlight">adjacent</span> to the <span class="highlight">stream</span><span class="highlight">channel</span>; and <span class="highlight">channel</span> deposits form in the <span class="highlight">stream</span><span class="highlight">channel</span> itself. Bars, which are <span class="highlight">elongated</span> mounds of <span class="highlight">sediment</span>, are <span class="highlight">transient</span> features that form in the <span class="highlight">stream</span><span class="highlight">channel</span> and on the banks. They commonly form in one year and <span class="highlight">erode</span> the next. Rivers used for <span class="highlight">commercial</span><span class="highlight">navigation</span> must be recharged frequently because bars <span class="highlight">shift</span> from year to year. <span class="question6">Imagine a winding <span class="highlight">stream</span>.</span> The water on the outside of the <span class="highlight">curve</span> moves faster than the water on the inside. The <span class="highlight">stream</span> erodes its outside bank because the <span class="highlight">current</span>'s inertia drives it into the outside bank. At the same time, the slower water on the inside point of the bend deposits <span class="highlight">sediment</span>, forming a point bar. A mid-channel bar is a sandy and gravelly <span class="highlight">deposit</span> that forms in the middle of a <span class="highlight">stream</span><span class="highlight">channel</span>.</p><p>Most streams flow in a single <span class="highlight">channel</span>. In <span class="highlight">contrast</span>, a braided <span class="highlight">stream</span> flows in many <span class="highlight">shallow</span>, interconnecting channels. A braided <span class="highlight">stream</span> forms where more <span class="highlight">sediment</span> is supplied to a <span class="highlight">stream</span> than it can carry. The <span class="highlight">stream</span> dumps the <span class="highlight">excess</span><span class="highlight">sediment</span>, forming mid-channel bars. The bars <span class="highlight">gradually</span> fill a <span class="highlight">channel</span>, forcing the <span class="highlight">stream</span> to overflow its banks and <span class="highlight">erode</span> new channels. As a result, a braided <span class="highlight">stream</span> flows <span class="question9">simultaneously</span> in several channels and shifts back and forth <span class="highlight">across</span> its <span class="highlight">floodplain</span>. Braided streams are <span class="highlight">common</span> in both deserts and <span class="highlight">glacial</span> environments because both produce <span class="highlight">abundant</span><span class="highlight">sediment</span>. A <span class="highlight">desert</span> yields large amounts of <span class="highlight">sediment</span> because it has little or no <span class="highlight">vegetation</span> to prevent <span class="highlight">erosion</span>. <span class="question8">Glaciers <span class="highlight">grind</span><span class="highlight">bedrock</span> into fine <span class="highlight">sediment</span>, which is carried by streams flowing from the <span class="highlight">melting</span> ice.</span> If a <span class="highlight">steep</span> mountain <span class="highlight">stream</span> flows onto a <span class="highlight">flat</span><span class="highlight">plain</span>, its <span class="highlight">gradient</span> and <span class="highlight">velocity</span><span class="highlight">decrease</span><span class="highlight">sharply</span>. As a result, it deposits most of its <span class="highlight">sediment</span> in a fan-shaped <span class="highlight">mound</span> called an <span class="highlight">alluvial</span> fan. <span class="highlight">Alluvial</span> fans are <span class="highlight">common</span> in many <span class="highlight">arid</span> and <span class="highlight">semiarid</span><span class="highlight">mountainous</span> regions.</p><p>A <span class="highlight">stream</span> also slows <span class="highlight"><span class="question10">abruptly</span></span> where it enters the still water of a lake or ocean. The <span class="highlight">sediment</span> settles out to form a nearly <span class="highlight">flat</span> landform called a <span class="highlight">delta</span>. Part of the <span class="highlight">delta</span> lies above water <span class="highlight">level</span>, and the <span class="highlight">remainder</span> lies <span class="highlight">slightly</span> below water <span class="highlight">level</span>. Deltas are commonly fan-shaped, resembling the Greek letter "delta" (?). Both deltas and <span class="highlight">alluvial</span> fans change rapidly. <span class="highlight">Sediment</span> fills channels (waterways), which are then abandoned while new channels develop as in a braided <span class="highlight">stream</span>. As a result, a <span class="highlight">stream</span> feeding a <span class="highlight">delta</span> or fan splits into many channels called distributaries. A large <span class="highlight">delta</span> may <span class="highlight">spread</span> out in this <span class="highlight">manner</span> until it covers thousands of <span class="highlight">square</span> kilometers. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> Most fans, however, are much smaller, covering a <span class="highlight">fraction</span> of a <span class="highlight">square</span> kilometer to a few <span class="highlight">square</span> kilometers. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> The Mississippi River has flowed <span class="highlight">through</span> seven different <span class="highlight">delta</span> channels during the past 5,000 to 6,000 years. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span> But in recent years, engineers have built great systems of levees (retaining walls) in attempts to stabilize the channels. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">curious</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. strange</p><p>B. rapid</p><p>C. seasonal</p><p>D. essential</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>This question is a vocabulary question.

We can find the keywords from the options, return to the original position and use the elimination method to solve the problem.</p><p>The A option, based on the keyword "boulders and cobbles", locates the phrase "Many mountain streams are choked with boulders and cobbles, but far downstream, their deltas are forming major of fine silt and clay." It means "Many mountain streams will be blocked by boulders and cobblestones, but further down the delta, the delta is mainly made up of fine mud and clay." But the A option says most of the particles in the mountain stream are Stacked up behind "boulders and cobbles". This is contradictory to the original, so the A option is the correct answer.</p><p>The B option, based on the keywords "atop" and "large", locates the third sentence of the first paragraph "If current velocity continues-as-a flood wanes, for example-finer particles settle out on top of the large ones." The small particles do push on the large particles, so the B option is in accordance with the original text, excluded.</p><p>The C option, based on the keyword "downstream", locates the phrase "Many mountain streams are choked with boulders and cobbles, but far downstream, their deltas are forming mainly of fine silt and clay." Pebbles and pebbles are blocked, while the downstream deltas are mainly built up of fine mud and clay.Obviously, the upstream boulders are larger than the downstream fine particles. Therefore, the C option is in accordance with the original text and excluded.</p><p>The D option locates the penultimate sentence "One explanation for flowing sorting is that abrasion wears away the boulders and cobbles to sand and silt as the sediment moves downstream over the years." As the sediment moves downstream, year after year The friction of the water flow grinds boulders and pebbles into sand and silt. The "eroded" in the option corresponds to "abrasion" in the original text, so the D option also complies with the original text and is excluded.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question4">accumulate</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. begin</p><p>B. appear</p><p>C. build up</p><p>D. spread</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" C"><p>"Accumulate" means "<span class="question4">accumulate</span>, <span class="question4">accumulate</span>."

Let's look at the options:</p><p>The A option "begin" means "begin" and does not match, so it is excluded.</p><p>The B option "appear" means "appear" and does not match the meaning, so it is excluded.</p><p>The C option "build up" means "build", meaning the closest, so it is the correct answer.</p><p>The D option "spread" means "spread" and does not match the meaning, so it is excluded.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 2, which of the following is true about bars in streams?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They start forming in the stream channel and then expand over the banks.</p><p>B. They seldom form in rivers that are used for commercial navigation.</p><p>C. They tend to grow longer each year.</p><p>D. They often last no more than a year.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The title is factual information. According to the keyword "bar" in the stem, we can locate the second sentence of the second sentence "Bars, which are elongated mounds of sediment, are transient features that form in the stream channel and on the banks." The content is all about introducing bars. Let's look at the options below:</p><p>Option A: The sand dam was initially formed in the channel and then extended to the shore. Wrong, because the text says "Bars, which are elongated mounds of sediment, are transient features that form in the stream channel and on the banks." The sand dam is a transient feature of sediments formed inside the river and on both sides of the river. Therefore, sand dams can be formed both in rivers and on shore. These two are in a parallel relationship, in no particular order. Therefore, the A option is inconsistent with the original and excluded.</p><p>Option B: Sand dams are rarely formed in the channels used to navigate. The mistake is because the article says "Rivers used for commercial navigation must be recharted frequently because bars shift from year to year." The rivers used for commercial navigation must be frequently reworked because sand dams change every year. This shows that sand dams are formed every year in the river that leads to navigation. Therefore, the B option is inconsistent with the original and excluded.C options: They grow every year. Wrong, because the text says "they commonly form in one year and erode the next." Sand dams usually form within a year and will be worn away in the next year. Their position may change, but it will not grow, because the second year has been consumed. Therefore, the C option is inconsistent with the original and excluded.</p><p>D option: They usually exist for no more than one year. Correctly, the reference to the C option "They commonly form in one year and erode the next." just can explain that the sand dam does not exist for more than one year. Therefore, the D option is in accordance with the original text and is the correct answer.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the author ask the reader to "<span class="highlight">Imagine a winding stream</span>"?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To explain how the presence of bars changes the speed and direction of water flow in a stream</p><p>B. To explain why bars are more common than alluvial fans or other types of sediment deposits</p><p>C. To illustrate the particular difficulties that commercial navigation faces on many rivers</p><p>D. To help explain how point bars are formed</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="Imagine a winding stream D"><p>This question is title of function. The question asked why the author would mention "imagine a meandering river." We first look at what the author wants us to imagine: "Imagine a winding stream. The water on the outside of the curve movement faster than......the slower water on the inside point of the bend deposits sediment, forming a point bar." The speed of the stream at the outer edge of the river is faster than the speed at the center of the river, and the effects of the flow at the outer edge of the river and the internal flow of water. From this we know that the water flow inside the river is slow, so it will precipitate sand and form a point dam. So from this passage, we can know how the point dam was formed. Therefore, the D option is correct here.</p><p>Option A: Explain how the dam changes the speed of the water flow and the direction of the flow. Wrong, because the article does not say that dams can change the direction of the speed of water flow. Therefore, the A option is not mentioned and excluded.</p><p>Option B: Explain why sand dams are more common than alluvial fans or other forms of sediments. Error, because again, this comparison relationship is not mentioned in the text, so B option is excluded.</p><p>Option C: Explain the difficulties encountered in commercial navigation in many rivers. Wrong, because the article only says that rivers used for commercial navigation must be frequently trimmed because sand dams change every year. There is no mention of difficulty in sailing. Therefore, the C option is not mentioned and excluded.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 3, all of the following are true of braided streams EXCEPT</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They shift back and forth on the floodplain as some of their channels fill with sediment and new ones are formed</p><p>B. They carry sediments that tend to be very similar in size.</p><p>C. They sometimes have mid-channel bars.</p><p>D. Some of their channels are created as a result of the overflow of other channels.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>This question is a negative factual information question. We can find the keywords from the options, return to the original position and use the elimination method to solve the problem.</p><p>In option A, according to the keyword "back and forth", the two words "The bars gradually fill a channel, forcing the stream to overflow its banks and erode new channels. As a result, a braided stream flows <span class="question9">simultaneously</span> in several channels And the shifts back and forth across its floodplain." In these two sentences, sandbars will fill the river gradually, forcing the water to overflow the embankment and eroding new river courses. As a result, the braided river flows <span class="question9">simultaneously</span> at multiple river courses and flows back and forth over the floodplain. So the A option is completely in line with the original text, so it is excluded.</p><p>Option B says that the size of the sediment carried by braided rivers is very similar. This is not mentioned in the text, so the B option is the correct answer.</p><p>In option C, the phrase "The stream dumps the excess sediment, forming mid-channel bars." is located according to the keyword "mid-channel bars". Because the braided river carries too much sediment, it forms a river heart. Sandbar. Therefore, the C option is in accordance with the original text and excluded.</p><p>In the D option, according to the keyword "overflow", the phrase "The bars gradually fill a channel, forcing the stream to overflow its banks and erode new channels." is blocked, so the river overflows the embankment and forms a new one. River, so the D option is in accordance with the original text, excluded.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the author include the information that "<span class="highlight">Glaciers grind bedrock into fine sediment, which is carried by streams flowing from the melting ice</span>"?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To give a reason why heavily sedimented braided streams are common in glacial environment</p><p>B. To explain why some mountain streams deposit most of their sediment in a fan-shaped mound</p><p>C. To identify the most common source of sediment in arid and semiarid mountainous regions</p><p>D. To help explain why glacial sediment decreases the gradient and velocity of steep mountain streams</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="Glaciers grind bedrock into fine sediment, which is carried by streams flowing from the melting ice A"><p>This question is title of function. Question Q: Why did the authors mention that "Glacier grinds the bedrock into tiny deposits that are carried by the stream formed by melting glaciers." This information? We find this sentence in the text and then look at its contextual content. Later, we are talking about the formation process of alluvial fans and have little to do with glaciers, so we look ahead. The previous sentence "A desert yields large amounts of sediment because it has little or no vegetation to prevent erosion." This sentence is to explain why the desert can produce a lot of sediment. Looking further ahead, the phrase "Braided streams are common in both deserts and glacial environments because both produced abundant sediment." is a saying that the braided river is common in deserts and glaciers because deserts and glaciers can produce a lot of Precipitate. At this point, the structure of this passage has become very clear: First, it shows that deserts and glaciers can produce a lot of sediments, and then explain why they can produce sediments in one sentence. So here's the A option: Explain why the braided river, which contains a lot of sediment, is common and correct in glacier environments.</p><p>Option B: Explain why some mountain streams will deposit sediment in the alluvial fan area.Wrong, because the relationship between the alluvial fan and the sentence stem is not big, is a new level of development below, so the B option is excluded.</p><p>Option C: Explains the most common sources of sediment in arid and semi-arid mountainous regions. Wrong, because the purpose of this sentence is not to explain the source of sediments in arid and semi-arid mountain regions, but to explain the connection between the glaciers and the braided rivers mentioned earlier and explain why braided rivers are in glacial environments. It's very common. Therefore, the C option is wrong.</p><p>Option D: Explain why glacial deposits reduce steep slopes and water velocity. Wrong, because the information is not mentioned in the text and is therefore excluded.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question9">simultaneously</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. in many directions</p><p>B. on the surface</p><p>C. at the same time</p><p>D. in a straight line</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" C"><p>This question is a vocabulary question.

"Abruptly" means "<span class="question10">abruptly</span>; accidentally." The lexical phrase "A stream also slows <span class="question10">abruptly</span> where it enters the still water of a lake or ocean." means "When the river sinks into the lake or the still water in the ocean, the water velocity will suddenly slow down." Here we come See options:</p><p>The A option "noticeably" means "conspicuously, obviously", meaning inconsistent, so it is excluded.</p><p>The B option "gradually" means "gradually, gradually," and the meaning does not match, so it is excluded.</p><p>The C option "suddenly" means "suddenly" and the meaning is correct, so it is the correct answer.</p><p>The D option "slightly" means "slightly" and does not match meaning, so it is excluded.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, what is true about river deltas?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

The last paragraph of the article is all about "delta", so we look at the options one by one to find the correct answer.</p><p>A option: The Delta will grow bigger and then smaller. In error, the text in the original words says "A large delta may spread out in this yet attitude to it covers thousands of square kilometers. Most fans, however, are much smaller, covering a fraction of a square kilometer to a few square kilometers." The meaning of this passage to be expressed is actually that the delta is of a large or small size, but it does not say that it will become larger and then smaller again. Therefore, A is inconsistent with the original and excluded.</p><p>Option B: The rivers in the Delta are somewhat active, but some rivers are blocked by silt. Corresponding to the original sentence "Sediment fills channels (waterways), which are then abandoned while new channels develop as in a braided stream." This sentence says that after some rivers are blocked, like a braided river, new river channels will form. . Therefore, the B option complies with the original text and is correct.</p><p>Option C: The delta is formed by rivers that are already braided before reaching the triangle. Errors, because it is clear that the text says that after the formation of the delta, the river will divert and form tributaries, so the logical order of C options is reversed and eliminated.</p><p>Option D: The delta formed in stationary amber is larger than the delta formed in the ocean. Wrong, because the article does not mention this kind of comparison at all.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, what are engineers trying to accomplish in the Mississippi delta?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

To increase the part of the delta that lies above water level</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The title is factual information. According to the keyword "engineers", the keyword "engineers" directly targets the last sentence of the article "But in recent years, engineers have built great systems of levees (retaining walls) in attempts to stabilize the channels." This sentence says that in recent years, engineers have built The embankment (retaining wall) system attempts to reinforce the river. Looking further ahead, the previous article states that in the past 5,000 to 6,000 years, seven deltas have formed in the Mississippi River. The "But" watch turns the relationship, so the purpose of the engineer's reinforcement of the river is obvious. It is hoped that the Mississippi River will no longer generate tributaries and form a new delta. Therefore, the B option: Let the Mississippi River flow in the existing river, right.</p><p>A option: expand the river. Wrong, because the word "but" has already appeared in the text as a logic word that indicates a turning point, and then expands the river and cannot be logically up.</p><p>Option C: Controls the amount of sediment carried by the Mississippi River to the delta. However, the article does not say that there is any connection between the reinforcement of the river and the control of the amount of sediment. Therefore, the C option is not mentioned and excluded.</p><p>D option: Increase the delta underwater section. Similarly, this information is not mentioned in the text and excluded.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>If the Mississippi River were not contained by such systems, it would probably abandon its present path and cut into the channel of a nearby river to the west..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>This question is a sentence insertion question. The sentence to be inserted means "if there is no such system to control the Mississippi, the Mississippi River will flow into the nearby river flowing to the west." It is obvious that this sentence assumes what would happen if there were no dam system. as a result of. Only the last sentence of the article referred to the dam system. The word "such" in the sentence to be inserted is a demonstrative pronoun, which is definitely referring to what has appeared in the preceding text. So the sentence is most suitable for inserting at D. The A, B and C sites have not mentioned the dyke system, so they are not suitable.</p></div></div><div id="question14" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>Rivers can carry all sizes of particles that they deposit in characteristic ways.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.Particles tend to be largest upstream and smallest downstream, probably because water flowing downstream erodes fine sediment from the larger particles.</p><p>B.Bars commonly shift from being point bars on a river bank to being mid-channel bars</p><p>C.Rivers that flow through arid and semiarid mountainous regions tend to form alluvial fans at bends in the river.</p><p>D.A wide variety of deposits, including bars, alluvial fans; and deltas, are formed as a result of an increase in the speed of the downstream current.</p><p>E.Deposits of sediment are found where flow velocity decreases, and when there is excessive sediment a stream may become braided, dividing into several channels.</p><p>F.Deltas, which are formed where streams enter lakes or the ocean, are naturally unstable landforms that can extend over a large area.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="AEF"><p>The title is a summary question. We look at the options in turn to find the correct answer.</p><p>The</p><p>Option A: The sediment particles are the largest upstream and the smallest downstream. This may be because the top-down stream grinds large particles into fine sediment. Corresponding to the first paragraph of the article, the first paragraph of the article referred to "Many mountain streams are choked with boulders and cobbles, but far downstream, their deltas are composed major of fine silt and clay.", and "One explanation for flowing sorting is that abrasion Wears away the boulders and cobbles to sand and silt as the sediment moves downstream over the years." These two sentences, so the A option is a summary of the first paragraph, correct.</p><p>The</p><p>Option B: The sand dam can usually be converted from a point dam on the river bank to a river dam. The concepts of "point bar" and "mid-channel bar" were proposed at the end of the second paragraph, but did not mention that the two could be interchanged. In addition, this information is detailed information and can be excluded directly.</p><p>The</p><p>Option C: Arid and semi-arid mountains will form alluvial fans at the river bay. Corresponding to the last sentence of the third paragraph, "Alluvial fans are common in many arid and semiarid mountainous regions." But this is detailed information, and the alluvial fan is not formed at the river bay. The article says, "If a steep mountain stream When a steep mountain stream flows onto a flat plain, it will precipitate sediment to form an alluvial fan.Therefore, the C option is excluded.</p><p>The</p><p>Option D: Many types of sediments, such as sand dams, alluvial fans, and deltas, are caused by increased flow rates in downstream rivers. The formation of these sediments is usually related to the slowdown of the river flow rate, so the D option contradicts the facts and excludes them.</p><p>The</p><p>Option E: Deposition occurs when the river speed is slowed down. When the river is carrying excessive sediment, it may form a braided river, forming multiple river courses. Corresponding to the third paragraph, the third paragraph mentioned "A braided stream forms where more sediment is supplied to a stream than it can carry.", so the E option is a summary of the third paragraph, correct.</p><p>The</p><p>The F option forms a delta when the river enters a lake or ocean. The delta is a less stable landscape that can extend a large area. Corresponds to the last paragraph. In the last paragraph, "Both deltas and alluvial fans change rapidly." The phrase "change rapidly" means that the delta landscape is not stable and will grow very quickly. In the last paragraph, "A large delta may spread out in this manner until it "Those thousands of square kilometers." Just what the F option says, the delta will extend a large area, so the F option is a summary of the last paragraph, correct.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
