The stone tools of the Natufians included many sickle-shaped cutting blades that show a <span class="highlight">pattern</span> of <span class="highlight">wear</span><span class="highlight">characteristic</span> of <span class="highlight">cereal</span> harvesting. Also, querns (hand mills) and other stone tools used for processing <span class="highlight">grain</span><span class="highlight">occur</span> in <span class="highlight">abundance</span> at Natufian sites, and <span class="question2">many such tools show signs of long, <span class="highlight">intensive</span> use.</span><span class="highlight">Along</span> with the <span class="highlight">sickle</span> blades are many grinding stones, <span class="highlight">primarily</span> mortars and pestles of <span class="highlight">limestone</span> or basalt. There is also <span class="highlight">evidence</span> that these heavy grinding stones were transported over long distances, more than 30 kilometers in some cases, and this is not something known to have been done by people of preceding periods. Fishhooks and weights for sinking fishing nets <span class="question3"><span class="highlight">attest</span> to</span> the growing importance of fish in the <span class="highlight">diet</span> in some areas. Stone vessels <span class="highlight">indicate</span> an increased need for containers, but there is no <span class="highlight">evidence</span> of Natufian <span class="highlight">clay</span> working or <span class="highlight">pottery</span>. <span class="question4">Studies of the teeth of Natufians also strongly suggest that these people <span class="highlight">specialized</span> in collecting cereals and may have been cultivating them and in the <span class="highlight">process</span> of domesticating them, but they were also still hunter-foragers who intensively hunted <span class="highlight">gazelle</span> and deer in more <span class="highlight">lush</span> areas and wild goats and equids in more <span class="highlight">arid</span> zones.</span></p><p>The Natufians had a different <span class="highlight">settlement</span><span class="highlight">pattern</span> from that of their predecessors. Some of their <span class="highlight">base</span> camps were far larger (over 1,000 <span class="highlight">square</span> meters) than any of those belonging to earlier periods, and they may have lived in some of these camps for half the year or <span class="highlight">even</span> more. In some of the camps, people made foundations and other architectural elements out of <span class="highlight">limestone</span> blocks. <span class="highlight">Trade</span> in <span class="highlight">shell</span>, <span class="highlight">obsidian</span>, and other commodities seems to have been on the rise, and anthropologists <span class="highlight">suspect</span> that the <span class="highlight">exchange</span> of perishables (such as skins, foodstuffs) and salt was also on the increase. With the growing importance of wild cereals in the <span class="highlight">diet</span>, salt probably became for the first time a near necessity: people who eat a lot of meat get many <span class="highlight">essential</span> salts from this <span class="highlight">diet</span>, but diets based on cereals can <span class="question6">be <span class="highlight">deficient</span> in</span> salts. Salt was probably also important as a food <span class="question7">preservative</span> in early villages.</p><p>As always, there is more to a <span class="highlight">major</span> cultural change than <span class="highlight">simply</span> a <span class="highlight">shift</span> in economics. The Natufians made (and <span class="highlight">presumably</span> wore) beads and pendants in many materials, including gemstones and <span class="highlight">marine</span> shells that had to be imported, and it is possible that this ornamentation actually <span class="question9">reflects</span> a growing <span class="highlight">sense</span> of <span class="highlight">ethnic</span><span class="highlight">identity</span> and perhaps some differences in <span class="highlight">personal</span> and group <span class="highlight">status</span>. Cleverly carved figurines of animals, women, and other subjects <span class="highlight">occur</span> in many sites, and Natufian period cave paintings have been found in Anatolia, Syria, and Iran. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> More than 400 Natufian burials have been found, most of them simple graves set in house floors. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> As archaeologist Belfer-Cohen notes, these burials may <span class="highlight">reflect</span> an <span class="highlight">ancestor</span><span class="highlight">cult</span> and a growing <span class="highlight">sense</span> of <span class="highlight">community</span><span class="highlight">emotional</span><span class="question10">ties</span> and attachment to a <span class="highlight">particular</span> place, and toward the end of the Natufian period, people in this area were making a <span class="highlight">strict</span> separation between living quarters and <span class="highlight">burial</span> grounds. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span> In <span class="highlight">contrast</span> with the <span class="highlight">Pleistocene</span> cultures of the Levant, Natufian <span class="highlight">culture</span> appears to have experienced <span class="highlight">considerable</span> social change. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p><p>The question of why the Natufians differed from their predecessors in these and other ways and why they made these first steps toward farming as a way of life remains unclear. There were <span class="highlight">climate</span> changes, of <span class="highlight">course</span>, and growing aridity and rising <span class="highlight">population</span> densities may have forced them to <span class="highlight">intensify</span> the <span class="highlight">exploitation</span> of cereals, which in turn might have <span class="highlight">stimulated</span> the <span class="highlight">development</span> of sickles and other tools and the <span class="highlight">permanent</span> communities that make <span class="highlight">agriculture</span><span class="highlight">efficient</span>. But precisely how these factors interacted with others at play is poorly understood.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>All of the following are mentioned in paragraph 1 as evidence that the Natufians may have engaged in the growing and processing of cereals and grains EXCEPT</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. tools with a specific pattern of wear</p><p>B. the widespread presence of grinding stones</p><p>C. the presence of clay containers</p><p>D. results from the analysis of Natufian teeth</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>This question is a negative factual information question. Which of the following is not evidence that Mrs. Natu is growing and processing cereals? Let's look at the options one by one:</p><p>A option: Tools with special signs of wear. According to the keyword "pattern of wear", the second sentence of the first paragraph is positioned "The stone tools of the Natufians included many sickle-shaped cutting blades that show a pattern of wear characteristic of cereal harvesting." The wife processed the grain evidence, so the A option was excluded.</p><p>Option B: Abundant appearance of grinding stones. According to the keyword "grinding stones", the phrase "Along with the sickle blades are many grinding stones, primarily mortars and pestles of limestone or basalt." Mrs. Natu uses processed grains, so the B option is excluded.</p><p>C option: The appearance of a clay container. According to the keyword "clay containers", the phrase "...but there is no evidence of Natufian clay working or pottery." shows that Mrs. Natur did not use clay or pottery to make vessels. Therefore, the C option contradicts the original and is the correct answer.</p><p>D option: analysis of the teeth of Mrs. Natu. According to the keyword "teeth", the phrase "Studies of the teeth of Natufians also strongly suggest that these people specialized on gathering cereals and may have been cultivating them and in the process of domesticating them..." The teeth were evidence that Mrs. Natu was growing and processing cereals, and the D option was excluded.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the author say that "<span class="highlight">many such tools show signs of long, intensive use</span>" in connection with Natufian agriculture?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To argue that the Natufian people consumed grains long before they included fish in their diet</p><p>B. To suggest that Natufian people could not replace their tools frequently because they had to travel very long distances to find grinding stones</p><p>C. To illustrate the sophistication of the Natufians in the design of stone tools</p><p>D. To support the claim that the archaeological record of the Natufian period shows clear evidence of agricultural origins</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="many such tools show signs of long, intensive use D"><p>This question is titled Rhetoric. The question asked why the authors mentioned that "these tools show signs of long-term, intensive use." First of all, let's look at the structure of the first paragraph. The first paragraph of the author first put forward the view of "we see clear evidence of agricultural origins." Afterwards, the traces of wear and tear of the sickle-shaped blades, the hand-push stones, and the grinding stone were mentioned. And so on, all of them are proof of Mrs. Natu's cultivation and processing of cereals. Therefore, the author mentioned that these stone tools show signs of long-term and intensive use. It is obviously to illustrate that in the archaeological records of the Naturov era, evidence of the origin of agriculture can be clearly seen, corresponding to the D option, so the D option is correct answer.</p><p>Option A: Shows that Mrs. Natu has consumed cereals much earlier than they had fish. According to the keyword "fish", the phrase "Fishhooks and weights for sinking fishing nets attest to the growing importance of fish in the diet in some areas." but the hooks and weights are not the subject of the sentence " Such tools refer to the tool, so the A option has nothing to do with the question.</p><p>Option B: Explain that Mrs. Natu does not change their tools often because they have to travel a long distance to find grinding stones.The phrase "There is also evidence that these heavy grinding stones were transported over long distances, more than 30 kilometers in some cases, and this is not something known to have been done by people of preceding periods." Explain that transporting the grinding stone from a long distance is something that early humans could not do. But this sentence is not the reason why Mrs. Natu does not often change their tools, so the "long-term, intensive use of" these stone tools. The original does not show that there is a causal relationship between the two.</p><p>C option: Explain that the stone tools made by Mrs. Natu are very delicate. Wrong, because the text did not mention this.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The phrase "<span class="highlight">attest to</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. symbolize</p><p>B. provide evidence of</p><p>C. are predictive of</p><p>D. coincide with</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="attest to B"><p>This question is a vocabulary question. "Attest to" means "verify; proof." The term "Fishhooks and weights for sinking fishing nets attest to the growing importance of fish in the diet in some areas." means "fish and weights used to sink fishing nets to prove that fish are eaten in some areas. The structure becomes more and more important." Let's look at the options:</p><p>A option: symbolize, meaning "symbol", meaning does not match, so ruled out.</p><p>Option B: provide evidence for, meaning "provide evidence", the closest meaning, it is the correct answer.</p><p>The C option: are predictive of, meaning "prediction", meaning inconsistent, so ruled out.</p><p>D option: coincide with, meaning "consistent with ...", meaning does not match, so ruled out.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Studies of the teeth of Natufians suggest the importance of cereals in their culture although they still hunted and foraged.</p><p>B. The Natufians specialized in collecting cereals and may have been in the process of domesticating certain animals.</p><p>C. Studies of the teeth of Natufians suggest that these people became hunter-foragers after they began domesticating cereals.</p><p>D. The Natufians' diet consisted mostly of cereals and lacked sufficient meat.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>This question is a sentence simplification question. First of all, let's look at the sentence that needs to be simplified. The sentence has the transitional logic word "but". The whole sentence means "The study of Mrs. Natu's teeth also strongly suggests that these people specialize in collecting cereals and may grow cereals. Or in the process of domesticating crops, but Mrs. Natu is still a hunter. They will focus on hunting antelope camps and deer in some of the more vegetated areas, hunting wild goats and horses in the more arid regions. "The following options look:</p><p>A: The study of Mrs. Natu's teeth proves that cereals are important in their culture, although they still make a living from hunting and hunting. "A option is complete, and the logic is in line with the original, so the A option is correct.</p><p>Option B: Mrs. Natu collects grain specifically and may domesticate certain animals. Wrong, because the text only refers to Mrs. Natur's domestication of crops, so the B option is inconsistent with the original. Secondly, the B option also lacks the main component of the original sentence, "Mr. Natu is still collecting and hunting," and lacks turning logic, so the B option is excluded.Option C: Studies of Mrs. Natu's teeth show that they began to become collectors after they had domesticated the grain. Wrong because, according to the language, Mrs. Natu has been collecting hunters before domesticating the grain. And the C option lacks turning logic, so the C option is excluded.</p><p>The D option: Mrs. Natu's food is mostly cereal and lacks enough meat. This sentence itself is not in line with the text, because the text says Mrs. Natur's "were also still hunter-foragers" after planting cereals, indicating that they will also hunt. The same D option also lacks turning logic and is therefore excluded.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Paragraph 2 suggests that compared with their predecessors, the Natufians</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. had smaller camps</p><p>B. had more permanent settlements</p><p>C. engaged in trade less often</p><p>D. had more meat in their diets</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The title is factual information. The subject asks Naughty and their ancestors, what are their characteristics?</p><p>A: Their camp is smaller. Wrong, according to the keyword "camp" to the second sentence of the second sentence "Some of their base camps were far larger (over 1,000 square meters) than any of those belongings to earlier periods..." It is much larger than any previous camp, so the A option is excluded.</p><p>Option B: They live longer. Correctly, also positioning the second paragraph of the second sentence "...and they may have lived in some of these camps for half the year or even more."Said that they will live in the camp for the first half or more, so the B option is correct answer.</p><p>Option C: They are less involved in trading. Wrong, according to the keyword "trade" to the second paragraph of the fourth sentence "Trade in shell, obsidian, and other commodities seems to have been on the rise ..." This phrase shows that Mrs. Natura is increasingly involved in trade In the middle, it contradicts the original and the C option is excluded.</p><p>D option: They eat more meat. The mistake is to position the phrase "With the growing importance of wild cereals in the diet, and the approach has begun for the first time a near necessity." Here is a description of the increasing importance of wild cereals in the daily diet in the Naturf culture. Salt may become almost a necessity for the first time. Therefore, Mrs. Natu should eat less meat than before, and increase the intake of cereals. Therefore, the D option contradicts the original and is excluded.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The phrase "<span class="highlight">be deficient in</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. consist mainly of</p><p>B. be balanced by</p><p>C. not have enough</p><p>D. have adequate</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="be deficient in C"><p>This question is a vocabulary question. "Be deficient in" means "lack of." The phrase "people who eat a lot of meat get many essential salts from this diet, but diets based on cereals can be deficient in salts." means "people who eat a lot of meat can get the necessary salt from the meat, However, grain-feeding may lead to a lack of salt." Let's look at options:</p><p>A option, consist mainly of, meaning "mainly ... constitute", meaning does not match, so ruled out.</p><p>The B option, be balanced by, means "balanced by."</p><p>The C option, not have enough, means "insufficient". The meaning is correct, so it is the correct answer.</p><p>The D option, have adequate, meaning "enough", the opposite is true, so ruled out.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question7">preservative</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. something that adds flavor to food</p><p>B. something that adds nutritional value to food</p><p>C. something that keeps food fresh</p><p>D. something that increases the trade value of food</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" C"><p>This question is a vocabulary question. "Preservative" means "<span class="question7">preservative</span>." The word "Salt was probably important as a food <span class="question7">preservative</span> in early villages." means "in the early villages, salt may be an important food <span class="question7">preservative</span>."</p><p>Let's look at the options below:</p><p>The A option means to add flavor to the food. It does not match, so it is excluded.</p><p>The B option means something that adds nutritional value to the food.</p><p>The C option means something that keeps food fresh, meaning that the answer is correct.</p><p>The D option means something that can increase the value of food trade. It does not match the meaning, so it is excluded.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 2, the abundance of wild cereals in the Natufian diet probably meant that the Natufians</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. had to move their settlements more often</p><p>B. needed to supplement their diets with salt</p><p>C. found it easy to store their food supplies</p><p>D. no longer needed meat to provide essential minerals</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>This question is a factual information question. What does the subject ask for in the abundant wild cereals in Mrs. Natu's diet? According to the keyword "wide cereal", it is positioned in the penultimate second paragraph "With the growing importance of wild cereals in the diet, the salt would became for the first time a near necessity...can be deficient in salts." The increase in the importance of wildlife in the diet indicates that salt will become a necessity for life, and Option B is correct.</p><p>A option: They need to move their settlement more often. Wrong, because the original did not mention this information.</p><p>Option C: They find it convenient to store food. Wrong, because the original text says "Salt was probably also important as a food <span class="question7">preservative</span> in early villages." Salt can help store food, and the importance of wild cereals in the diet has nothing to do with storing food, so the C option excludes .</p><p>D option: They no longer need meat to provide the necessary minerals. Wrong, because the increase in the importance of wild cereals in the diet does not mean that Mrs. Natur does not need meat. Secondly, in the first paragraph of the text, there was a mention of Mrs. Natu "were also still hunter-foragers", so the D option was excluded.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question9">reflects</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. indicates</p><p>B. causes</p><p>C. hides</p><p>D. prevents</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" A"><p>This question is a vocabulary question. The word "<span class="question9">reflects</span>" means "reflect; explanation." The lexical clause "...and it is possible that this ornamentation actually <span class="question9">reflects</span> a growing sense of ethnic identity and perhaps some differences in personal and group status." means "these materials need to be imported to obtain it. It <span class="question9">reflects</span> the enhancement of national identity, or <span class="question9">reflects</span> some differences in identity and ethnic status." Here we look at options:</p><p>A option: Indicates, meaning "instructions; shows", the closest meaning, it is the correct answer.</p><p>B option: causes, meaning "cause", meaning does not match, so ruled out.</p><p>C option: hides, meaning "hidden", does not match, so ruled out.</p><p>D option: prevents, meaning "to prevent", meaning does not match, so ruled out.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">ties</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. values</p><p>B. experiences</p><p>C. influences</p><p>D. connections</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>This question is a vocabulary question. The meaning of "ties" is "relationships; bonds"; the words "As archaeologist Belfer-Cohen notes, these burials may reflect an ancestor cult and a growing sense of community emotional ties and attachment to a particular place..." mean "According to the archaeologist Belfer-Cohen, these tombs may reflect an ancestral worship, an enhancement of the team's emotional bond of consciousness, and a dependence on special areas..." Let's look at the options:</p><p>A option: values, meaning "value", does not match, so ruled out.</p><p>The B option: experience, which means "experience", does not match, so it is excluded.</p><p>C option: influences, meaning "impact", meaning does not match, so ruled out.</p><p>D option: connections, meaning "contact, connection", the closest meaning, it is the correct answer.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>All of the following are mentioned in paragraph 3 as part of the cultural change experienced by the Natufians EXCEPT</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Technological advances</p><p>B. Personal ornamentation</p><p>C. Cave painting</p><p>D. Community burial sites</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>This question is a negative factual information question. Question Which of the following does not belong to Mr. Natu's cultural changes?</p><p>A option: technological progress. There is no mention of technological advances in the text, so the A option is the correct answer.</p><p>B option: personal decoration. According to the keyword "ornamentation", it is positioned to the third sentence of the second sentence "...and it is possible that this ornamentation actually <span class="question9">reflects</span> a growing sense of ethnic identity and perhaps some differences in personal and group status." .</p><p>C option: cave paintings. In the third paragraph, the phrase "...and Natufian period cave paintings have been found in Anatolia, Syria, and Iran." mentions that cave paintings were found in many places. Therefore, the C option is in accordance with the original text and excluded.</p><p>D option: Tomb site. The second half of the third paragraph was devoted to the site of caves. At the beginning, Lady Natur built the tomb on the floor, but later separated the living area from the tomb. Therefore, the D option was in accordance with the original text and excluded.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, which of the following may have helped push the Natufians toward farming as a way of life?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. At the same time as the Natufian population was increasing, the climate was becoming less hospitable.</p><p>B. The development of sickles and other tools made it possible for Natufians to exploit new kinds of cereals.</p><p>C. The climate changed during the Natufian period and produced conditions favorable to growing cereals.</p><p>D. Increasing competition from neighboring populations may have forced Natufians to grow cereals more intensively.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The title is factual information. Question: Which of the following might have prompted Mrs. Natu to use farming as a way of life? We positioned the fourth sentence of the first sentence according to the key information of the task "Toward farming as a way of life." The question of why the Natufians differed from their predecessors in these and other ways and why they made these first steps toward farming as a "the way of life changes, of course, and growing aridity and rising population densities may have forced them to intensify the exploitation of cereals," and the content of the article begins to elaborate on possible causes. The reason for the weather (drought) and the growing population density are the reasons that forced Mrs. Natu to step up the development and utilization of cereals. So the A option covers both of these reasons, so the A option is correct.</p><p>Option B: The development of sickles and other tools enabled Mrs. Natu to develop new crops. First of all, the development of sickles and other tools was ultimately due to bad weather and increased population density. Second, these tools did not allow Mrs. Natu to develop the use of the "new crop" option.</p><p>Option C: The weather in the Naturife era provided favorable conditions for growing crops. Wrong, because the original text mentioned that "growing aridity" means "increasingly severe drought." Therefore, the C option contradicts the original and excludes it.</p><p>D option: Naturov competes with neighboring countries, prompting Mrs. Natu to grow more grain. Wrong, because the article did not mention this.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Further evidence of an evolving cultural complexity comes from Natufian burials..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>This question is a sentence insertion question. The phrase with inserted sentences means "More evidence of progressive cultural complexity comes from the Natuf tomb." In this sentence, the key word we need to grasp is "burial". Then we took this sentence and read it in the original text. Before the A box, we talked about the evidence of other changes Naturov's culture experienced ï¿½ ornaments, cave paintings, etc. It's all about tombs. Therefore, the "further evidence" in the sentence to be inserted has a role that is consistent with the above and shows that the tomb contents mentioned below will provide more evidence of the cultural changes in Natuf. Therefore, the sentence is best inserted at A.</p></div></div><div id="question14" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>The Natufians differed from their predecessors in many ways - most significantly, in their move toward agriculture.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.The Natufians used tools to collect and process food, but their lack of containers suggests that they rarely had excess food to store.</p><p>B.The increase in salt in the Natufians' diet suggests that meat was becoming harder to find, perhaps because of climate change.</p><p>C.The Natufians engaged in trade and lived in large camps in which they sometimes built permanent structures.</p><p>D.Natufian culture developed somewhat differently in different regions, in part because of differences in the types and amount of food available from place to place.</p><p>E.Although their diet included meat from hunting, extensive evidence suggests that the Natufians consumed a lot of cereals and may even have been cultivating them.</p><p>F.Natufian art, personal ornamentation, and burial sites suggest cultural changes involving an increasing sense of ethnic identity and perhaps an ancestor cult.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="CEF"><p>The title is a summary question. Let's look at the options one by one to find the correct answer.</p><p>A. Option: Mrs. Natu uses tools to collect and process food, but they lack containers. This means they rarely have extra food for storage. Corresponding to the first paragraph of the article, the first half of the A option was correct, but the article did not say that they lacked a container stating that they had no extra food stored. The original text simply said "Stone carriers indicate an increased need for containers, but there is no evidence "The Natufian clay working or pottery." Explains that they did not make containers from clay or clay. Therefore, the A option is wrong.</p><p>The</p><p>Option B: The increase in salinity in Mrs. Natu's diet indicates that meat has become more difficult to obtain, which may be caused by weather changes. The "increased salinity" corresponds to the second paragraph, but at the end of the second paragraph, it is only said that Mrs. Natu has increased the proportion of cereals in the diet, so to add salt, it is not said that meat is more difficult to obtain. The "change in the weather" corresponds to the last paragraph. The change in weather is the reason that forced Mrs. Natu to use the agricultural lifestyle rather than the reason that meat is more difficult to obtain. Therefore, the B option is wrong.Option C: Mrs. Natu participates in trade and lives in large camps, where they sometimes build long-standing buildings. Corresponding to the second paragraph of the article, the C option is correct.</p><p>The</p><p>Option D: The development of Naturf culture is different in different regions, partly because of the different types and quantities of food in different regions. Error, because the full text did not mention this information.</p><p>The</p><p>E-option: Although Mrs. Natu's diet contains meat from hunting, there is ample evidence that Mrs. Natu will eat a lot of cereals and may even grow cereals. Corresponds to the contents of the second paragraph of the article, so the E option is correct.</p><p>The</p><p>F option: Natuf art, personal ornaments and tombs are all ethnic identity and ancestor worship. The F option corresponds to the third paragraph of the article, which is a summary of the third paragraph, so the F option is correct.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
