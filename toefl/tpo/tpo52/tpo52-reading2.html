The stone tools of the Natufians included many sickle-shaped cutting blades that show a <span class="highlight">pattern</span> of <span class="highlight">wear</span><span class="highlight">characteristic</span> of <span class="highlight">cereal</span> harvesting. Also, querns (hand mills) and other stone tools used for processing <span class="highlight">grain</span><span class="highlight">occur</span> in <span class="highlight">abundance</span> at Natufian sites, and <span class="question2">many such tools show signs of long, <span class="highlight">intensive</span> use. <span class="highlight"></span>Along</span> with the <span class="highlight">sickle</span> blades are many grinding stones, <span class="highlight">primarily</span> mortars and pestles of <span class="highlight">limestone</span> or basalt. There is also <span class="highlight">evidence</span> that these heavy grinding stones were transported over long distances, more than 30 kilometers in some cases, and this is not something known to have been done by people of preceding periods. Fishhooks and weights for sinking fishing nets <span class="highlight"><span class="question3">attest</span> to </span>the growing importance of fish in the <span class="highlight">diet</span> in some areas. Stone vessels <span class="highlight">indicate</span> an increased need for containers, but there is no <span class="highlight">evidence</span> of Natufian <span class="highlight">clay</span> working or <span class="highlight">pottery</span>. <span class="question4">Studies of the teeth of Natufians also strongly suggest that these people <span class="highlight">specialized</span> in collecting cereals and may have been cultivating them and in the <span class="highlight">process</span> of domesticating them, but they were also still hunter-foragers who intensively hunted <span class="highlight">gazelle</span> and deer in more <span class="highlight">lush</span> areas and wild goats and equids in more <span class="highlight">arid</span> zones.</span></p><p>The Natufians had a different <span class="highlight">settlement</span><span class="highlight">pattern</span> from that of their predecessors. Some of their <span class="highlight">base</span> camps were far larger (over 1,000 <span class="highlight">square</span> meters) than any of those belonging to earlier periods, and they may have lived in some of these camps for half the year or <span class="highlight">even</span> more. In some of the camps, people made foundations and other architectural elements out of <span class="highlight">limestone</span> blocks. <span class="highlight">Trade</span> in <span class="highlight">shell</span>, <span class="highlight">obsidian</span>, and other commodities seems to have been on the rise, and anthropologists <span class="highlight">suspect</span> that the <span class="highlight">exchange</span> of perishables (such as skins, foodstuffs) and salt was also on the increase. With the growing importance of wild cereals in the <span class="highlight">diet</span>, salt probably became for the first time a near necessity: people who eat a lot of meat get many <span class="highlight">essential</span> salts from this <span class="highlight">diet</span>, but diets based on cereals can <span class="question6">be <span class="highlight">deficient</span> in </span>salts. Salt was probably also important as a food <span class="question7">preservative </span>in early villages.</p><p>As always, there is more to a <span class="highlight">major</span> cultural change than <span class="highlight">simply</span> a <span class="highlight">shift</span> in economics. The Natufians made (and <span class="highlight">presumably</span> wore) beads and pendants in many materials, including gemstones and <span class="highlight">marine</span> shells that had to be imported, and it is possible that this ornamentation actually <span class="question9">reflects </span>a growing <span class="highlight">sense</span> of <span class="highlight">ethnic</span><span class="highlight">identity</span> and perhaps some differences in <span class="highlight">personal</span> and group <span class="highlight">status</span>. Cleverly carved figurines of animals, women, and other subjects <span class="highlight">occur</span> in many sites, and Natufian period cave paintings have been found in Anatolia, Syria, and Iran. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> More than 400 Natufian burials have been found, most of them simple graves set in house floors. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> As archaeologist Belfer-Cohen notes, these burials may <span class="highlight">reflect</span> an <span class="highlight">ancestor</span><span class="highlight">cult</span> and a growing <span class="highlight">sense</span> of <span class="highlight">community</span><span class="highlight">emotional</span><span class="question10">ties</span> and attachment to a <span class="highlight">particular</span> place, and toward the end of the Natufian period, people in this area were making a <span class="highlight">strict</span> separation between living quarters and <span class="highlight">burial</span> grounds. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span> In <span class="highlight">contrast</span> with the <span class="highlight">Pleistocene</span> cultures of the Levant, Natufian <span class="highlight">culture</span> appears to have experienced <span class="highlight">considerable</span> social change. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p><p>The question of why the Natufians differed from their predecessors in these and other ways and why they made these first steps toward farming as a way of life remains unclear. There were <span class="highlight">climate</span> changes, of <span class="highlight">course</span>, and growing aridity and rising <span class="highlight">population</span> densities may have forced them to <span class="highlight">intensify</span> the <span class="highlight">exploitation</span> of cereals, which in turn might have <span class="highlight">stimulated</span> the <span class="highlight">development</span> of sickles and other tools and the <span class="highlight">permanent</span> communities that make <span class="highlight">agriculture</span><span class="highlight">efficient</span>. But precisely how these factors interacted with others at play is poorly understood.</p></article></div><div id="question"><div id="question1"><p>All of the following are mentioned in paragraph 1 as evidence that the Natufians may have engaged in the growing and processing of cereals and grains EXCEPT</p><label class="my-label"><span>A. tools with a specific pattern of wear</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><label class="my-label"><span>B. the widespread presence of grinding stones</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><label class="my-label"><span>C. the presence of clay containers</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><label class="my-label"><span>D. results from the analysis of Natufian teeth</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><p><span>Answer: </span><span class="my-answer">C</span></p></div><div id="question2"><p>Why does the author say that "<span class="highlight">many such tools show signs of long, intensive use</span>" in connection with Natufian agriculture?</p><label class="my-label"><span>A.
