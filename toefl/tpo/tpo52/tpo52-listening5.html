The challenges researchers face in studying them</p><p>D. The function of their quasi-liquid layer</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="AD"><p>The source of this question is:</p><p>Anyway, snowflakes have a particular form, there's a six-sided center with six branches or arms that radiate out from it. But how did they get that way?</p><p>......</p><p>So, finally we get to the connection between snowflakes and ozone.</p><p>......</p><p>This question needs to be combined with the entire lecture. The first half of the lecture was about how snow was formed, and the latter half was about snow and ozone. Option A and Option D were appropriate. Option B is about how snowflakes are affected by the presence of ozone. Option C says that the challenges faced by researchers in the study of snowflakes are inappropriate. Double-select AD.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor say about the role of water vapor in snowflake formation?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Too much water vapor prevents the initial "dinner plate" from forming.</p><p>B. Water vapor's role in snowflake formation is not completely understood.</p><p>C. Water vapor molecules in snowflakes attract ice particles from the air.</p><p>D. Water vapor is necessary for snowflakes to be able to form branches.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The source of this question is:</p><p>Imagine this dinner plate is floating around in the wind, right? And when it encounters water vapor, molecules from that vapor attached to each of the six sides. You begin this development with six arms or branches radiating out from the center plate. The snowflake encounters water vapor, more molecules attached to it, leading to more and more complex structures.</p><p>The professor here mentioned that snowflakes are the water vapor in the air that freezes when they meet the main body of the snowflake hexagons, step by step forming a branch that radiates outwards, so water vapor is indispensable in the process of forming snowflakes. D is right. Option A means that too much water vapor will hinder the formation of the snowflake body sheet. Option B means that we do not fully understand the role of water vapor in the formation of snowflakes. Option C means that the water vapor in the snowflake will help to attract the air. Ice particles are not suitable. Select D.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What factor helps explain why no two snowflakes are alike?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They all freeze at different rates.</p><p>B. They all form in slightly different air temperatures.</p><p>C. They all begin with a different number of water molecules.</p><p>D. They all follow different paths through clouds.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The source of this question is:</p><p>And of course, each snowflake takes unique route through the clouds on its way down. And so the quantity of water vapor that it goes through is going to be unique for each one.</p><p>The professor here mentioned that because each snowflake has a different route of falling, the amount of water vapor that adheres to it is also different, so each piece of snowflake is unique, and Option D is appropriate. Option A says that they have different rates of ice, Option B says there is a slight difference in the temperature at which they are formed, and Option C says that they have different amounts of water molecules at the beginning. Select D.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>How do molecules in the quasi-liquid layer differ from those in other parts of the snowflake?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They are not held in place as tightly as other molecules.</p><p>B. They react with ozone to keep the layer from completely freezing.</p><p>C. They prevent ice crystals from forming additional branches.</p><p>D. They are thinner than other molecules.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The source of this question is:</p><p>But the bricks of water molecules, well, this top layer would be the quasi-liquid layer. And it wouldn't be completely frozen.</p><p>The professor here mentioned that the outermost water molecules are more easily moved than the internal water molecules because they are only exposed to one side of the surface. The option A is correct. Option B says that they react with ozone to prevent this layer from freezing completely. Option C says that they organize ice crystals into redundant branches. Option D says that they are thinner than other molecules and are not suitable. Select A.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor imply about ice crystals with a large number of branches?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They help block harmful radiation from the Sun.</p><p>B. They form as a result of complex reactions with ozone.</p><p>C. They contribute to a reduction in ground-level ozone.</p><p>D. They have a thinner quasi-liquid layer than ice crystals with fewer branches.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The source of this question is:</p><p>The the more branches you have in an ice crystal, the more quasi-liquid layer there is. The more quasi-liquid layer, the reaction and the more chemicals that reduce ground-level ozone.</p><p>The professor here mentioned that the more branches of ice crystals, the more liquid thin layers there are, and the more fluid-like thin layers, the more chemical reactions will cause the reduction of ground-level ozone content. Option C is appropriate. Option A says that they help us to withstand harmful solar radiation, Option B says that they are formed by a complex chemical reaction with ozone, and Option D says that they have a thinner liquid thin layer than the less branched ice crystals. Select C.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What can be inferred about the professor when he says this:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. He doubts that the students have understood his explanation.</p><p>B. He does not think that bricks are an ideal illustration of his point.</p><p>C. He is not sure that the information he has just given is accurate.</p><p>D. He thinks that the similarities between liquid and bricks are surprising.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The source of this question is:</p><p>The bricks in the wall, they have other bricks above and below them, and they are all locked each each. But that top layer, it only has a layer below it. Now this can only be taken so far because of course bricks don 't move at all. They are not liquid.</p><p>The professor here first wanted to compare bricks with snowflakes, but after describing the combination of bricks, he said that after all, the bricks were not liquid and the bricks themselves could not be moved. This shows that he actually felt bricks. The liquid thin layer of the analogy is not very suitable. Option B is correct. Option A is that he suspects that the student does not understand his explanation, Option C is that he is not sure that the information he is saying is correct, and Option D is that he thinks the similarity between the liquid and the brick is surprising. Suitable. Select B.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
