              <span class="time" data-times="4" data-time="1">[00:01.00]</span>Listen to part of a lecture in a chemistry class.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6" data-time="5">[00:05.00]</span>Professor: Ok, so, today we're going to talk about the <span class="highlight">Arctic</span>, <span class="highlight">ozone</span> depletion and snowflakes. <span class="time" data-times="2" data-time="11">[00:11.00]</span>And it's all related. <span class="time" data-times="2" data-time="13">[00:13.00]</span>Let's start with snowflakes.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.3" data-time="15">[00:15.00]</span>Now, I find snowflakes <span class="highlight">fascinating</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.1" data-time="17.3">[00:17.30]</span>To <span class="highlight">even</span> begin to understand them, you need to understand physics, chemistry, and <span class="highlight">mathematics</span>.<span class="time" data-times="6" data-time="23.4">[00:23.40]</span> <span class="highlight">Even</span> though there's been a lot of research, there're still actually a lot about snowflakes that we don't understand yet. <span class="time" data-times="1.7" data-time="29.4">[00:29.40]</span>Hard to believe, I know.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.2" data-time="31.1">[00:31.10]</span>Anyway, snowflakes have a <span class="highlight">particular</span> form, there's a six-sided center with six branches or arms that <span class="highlight">radiate</span> out from it.<span class="time" data-times="2" data-time="39.3">[00:39.30]</span> But how did they get that way? <span class="time" data-times="2.5" data-time="41.3">[00:41.30]</span> Well, you start with water <span class="highlight">vapor</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.2" data-time="43.8">[00:43.80]</span> You need a <span class="highlight">pretty</span> <span class="highlight">humid</span> <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.3" data-time="46">[00:46.00]</span>And that water <span class="highlight">vapor</span> condenses directly into ice, into an ice <span class="highlight">crystal</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.7" data-time="51.3">[00:51.30]</span>At this point it looks kind of like a thin dinner <span class="highlight">plate</span> that rather than being <span class="highlight">circular</span>, is hexagonal with six <span class="highlight">flat</span> edges.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.5" data-time="60">[01:00.00]</span>It's at this point in the <span class="highlight">process</span> were we begin to see why each <span class="highlight">snowflake</span> is <span class="highlight">unique</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.7" data-time="65.5">[01:05.50]</span>Imagine this dinner <span class="highlight">plate</span> is floating around in the wind, right? <span class="time" data-times="6.3" data-time="69.2">[01:09.20]</span>And when it encounters water <span class="highlight">vapor</span>, molecules from that <span class="highlight">vapor</span> attached to each of the six sides. <span class="time" data-times="5" data-time="75.5">[01:15.50]</span>You begin this <span class="highlight">development</span> with six arms or branches radiating out from the center <span class="highlight">plate</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7" data-time="80.5">[01:20.50]</span>Each time the <span class="highlight">snowflake</span> encounters water <span class="highlight">vapor</span>, more molecules attached to it, <span class="highlight">leading</span> to more and more <span class="highlight">complex</span> structures. <span class="time" data-times="4.6" data-time="87.5">[01:27.50]</span>And of <span class="highlight">course</span>, each <span class="highlight">snowflake</span> takes <span class="highlight">unique</span> <span class="highlight">route</span> <span class="highlight">through</span> the clouds on its way down. <span class="time" data-times="4.5" data-time="92.1">[01:32.10]</span>And so the <span class="highlight">quantity</span> of water <span class="highlight">vapor</span> that it goes <span class="highlight">through</span> is going to be <span class="highlight">unique</span> for each one.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.4" data-time="96.6">[01:36.60]</span>Now one important <span class="highlight">characteristic</span> of snowflakes is that they have something called a quasi-liquid <span class="highlight">layer</span>, the QLL. <span class="time" data-times="3.1" data-time="105">[01:45.00]</span>Our <span class="highlight">snowflake</span> is an ice <span class="highlight">crystal</span>, right? <span class="time" data-times="7.1" data-time="108.1">[01:48.10]</span>Well, we find a quasi-liquid <span class="highlight">layer</span> on the surface of ice is basically a thin <span class="highlight">layer</span> of water that's not completely frozen.<span class="time" data-times="5.4" data-time="115.2">[01:55.20]</span> And the existed <span class="highlight">temperature</span> is well below freezing, though thickness varies at different temperatures. <span class="time" data-times="5" data-time="120.6">[02:00.60]</span>Now this quasi-liquid <span class="highlight">layer</span>, it plays an important role on what we are going to talk about next.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.4" data-time="125.6">[02:05.60]</span>Ah, yes, Mary?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.8" data-time="127">[02:07.00]</span>Mary:How can <span class="highlight">liquid</span> exist below freezing? <span class="time" data-times="2.5" data-time="129.8">[02:09.80]</span>Why doesn't it <span class="highlight">freeze</span>?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7" data-time="132.3">[02:12.30]</span>Professor:Well, when water becomes ice, the molecules <span class="highlight">bond</span> together and it gets <span class="highlight">sort</span> of...locked in the place.<span class="time" data-times="2.3" data-time="139.3">[02:19.30]</span> They can't move around as much anymore.<span class="time" data-times="5" data-time="141.6">[02:21.60]</span> So each <span class="highlight">molecule</span> is surrounded by other molecules, and they are all locked together. <span class="time" data-times="2.9" data-time="146.6">[02:26.60]</span>But what about the <span class="highlight">exterior</span> of the ice? <span class="time" data-times="5.2" data-time="149.5">[02:29.50]</span>There is a <span class="highlight">layer</span> of water molecules on the surface, they attached molecules only on one side. <span class="time" data-times="1.6" data-time="154.7">[02:34.70]</span>So, they are a bit freer. <span class="time" data-times="2" data-time="156.3">[02:36.30]</span>They can move around a bit more. <span class="time" data-times="3.7" data-time="158.3">[02:38.30]</span>Think of a... think of a brick wall. <span class="time" data-times="6" data-time="162">[02:42.00]</span>The bricks in the wall, they have other bricks above and below them, and they are all locked against each other. <span class="time" data-times="4" data-time="168">[02:48.00]</span>But that top <span class="highlight">layer</span>, it only has a <span class="highlight">layer</span> below it. <span class="time" data-times="5.4" data-time="172">[02:52.00]</span>Now this can only be taken so far because of <span class="highlight">course</span> bricks don't move at all. <span class="time" data-times="1.2" data-time="177.4">[02:57.40]</span>They are not <span class="highlight">liquid</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.4" data-time="178.6">[02:58.60]</span>But the bricks of water molecules, well, this top <span class="highlight">layer</span> would be the quasi-liquid <span class="highlight">layer</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2" data-time="184">[03:04.00]</span>And it wouldn't be completely frozen. <span class="time" data-times="1.6" data-time="186">[03:06.00]</span>Does that make <span class="highlight">sense</span>?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.7" data-time="187.6">[03:07.60]</span>So, finally we get to the connection between snowflakes and <span class="highlight">ozone</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.2" data-time="192.3">[03:12.30]</span> <span class="highlight">Ozone</span> is a gas found in the <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span> of Earth. <span class="time" data-times="6.8" data-time="195.5">[03:15.50]</span>Now there is the <span class="highlight">ozone</span> found in the <span class="highlight">stratosphere</span> which is the <span class="highlight">layer</span> of the <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span> from 6 to 30 miles above the Earth. <span class="time" data-times="6" data-time="202.3">[03:22.30]</span>This is considered good <span class="highlight">ozone</span>, which occurs naturally and helps <span class="highlight">block</span> harmful <span class="highlight">radiation</span> from the Sun.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.9" data-time="208.3">[03:28.30]</span>But there is also ground-level <span class="highlight">ozone</span>.<span class="time" data-times="4.1" data-time="211.2">[03:31.20]</span> It's exactly the same gas but it's found closer to the surface of the Earth. <span class="time" data-times="7" data-time="215.3">[03:35.30]</span> This ground-level <span class="highlight">ozone</span> results from human activities, at high concentrations it can be a <span class="highlight">pollutant</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.3" data-time="222.3">[03:42.30]</span> Now <span class="highlight">snowflake</span>'s quasi-liquid <span class="highlight">layer</span> plays an important role in some <span class="highlight">complex</span> chemical reactions. <span class="time" data-times="3" data-time="227.6">[03:47.60]</span> We're going to be looking at these in <span class="highlight">detail</span> later today. <span class="time" data-times="4.14" data-time="230.6">[03:50.60]</span> But basically, these reactions cause certain chemicals to be released. <span class="time" data-times="3.46" data-time="234.74">[03:54.74]</span>And these chemicals reduce the <span class="highlight">amount</span> of ground-level <span class="highlight">ozone</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.4" data-time="238.2">[03:58.20]</span>So the more branches you have in an ice <span class="highlight">crystal</span>, the more quasi-liquid <span class="highlight">layer</span> there is. <span class="time" data-times="5.6" data-time="243.6">[04:03.60]</span>The more quasi-liquid <span class="highlight">layer</span>, the more reactions and the more chemicals that reduce ground-level <span class="highlight">ozone</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="249.2">[04:09.20]</span>So you can see why this is such an important system to study and understand.</p>
