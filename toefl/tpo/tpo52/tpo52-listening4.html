            <span class="time" data-times="6" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Listen to part of a <span class="underline">conversation</span> between a student and an employee at the <span class="underline">campus</span> store.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.85" data-time="6">[00:06.00]</span>Student:I'd like the <span class="underline">ceramic</span> coffee mugs you have on <span class="underline">display</span> at the other end of the store. <span class="time" data-times="1.35" data-time="10.85">[00:10.85]</span>Were they made by students?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.4" data-time="12.2">[00:12.20]</span>Employee:Oh, we only use certain suppliers, wholesalers who've been selected by the store manager.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.9" data-time="17.6">[00:17.60]</span>Student:Do you ever sell things made by students?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="7.3" data-time="20.5">[00:20.50]</span>Employee:We used preferred vendors only because......I mean if we said yes to one student, we'd have to say yes to any student who asks. <span class="time" data-times="1.9" data-time="27.8">[00:27.80]</span> And this store is only so big.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.6" data-time="29.7">[00:29.70]</span> Student:That's too bad because I made these <span class="underline">pretty</span><span class="underline">ceramic</span> bowls, I designed them myself, I'm a <span class="underline">studio</span> art <span class="underline">major</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.2" data-time="36.3">[00:36.30]</span>Anyway... um... I was hoping I could sell them here. <span class="time" data-times="3.15" data-time="39.5">[00:39.50]</span>You see I'm taking art 202, marketing your art. <span class="time" data-times="3.45" data-time="42.65">[00:42.65]</span>And for my final <span class="underline">project</span> I need to find a way to sell my own art work.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.5" data-time="46.1">[00:46.10]</span>Employee:Um... what about selling on <span class="underline">line</span>? <span class="time" data-times="2.9" data-time="48.6">[00:48.60]</span>A lot of art and crafts are marketed that way......</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.8" data-time="51.5">[00:51.50]</span>Student:I really don't have the computer skills or the time to <span class="underline">manage</span> a website.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.62" data-time="55.3">[00:55.30]</span>Employee:What about the emporium?<span class="time" data-times="1.68" data-time="56.92">[00:56.92]</span> You know, that gift shop <span class="underline">downtown</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.5" data-time="58.6">[00:58.60]</span> I've seen items by the <span class="underline">local</span> artists there.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.5" data-time="61.1">[01:01.10]</span>Student:The emporium buys directly from the artists?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.7" data-time="63.6">[01:03.60]</span>Employee:Well, they sell items on consignment.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.7" data-time="66.3">[01:06.30]</span>Student:Consignment... I think my professor mentioned that. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.6" data-time="70">[01:10.00]</span>Employee:Yeah, you give them some items to sell on your <span class="underline">behalf</span> and then you and the stores <span class="underline">split</span> the <span class="underline">purchase</span> price.<span class="time" data-times="3.5" data-time="76.6">[01:16.60]</span> But they wouldn't <span class="underline">pay</span> you anything up front if that's what you want. <span class="time" data-times="4" data-time="80.1">[01:20.10]</span>And you might need to provide your own <span class="underline">display</span> case.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.9" data-time="84.1">[01:24.10]</span>Student:Oh, I already have a <span class="underline">display</span> case, a <span class="underline">portable</span> one with three shelves. <span class="time" data-times="5.1" data-time="88">[01:28.00]</span>But aren't the shops that were... you know, just buy <span class="underline">stuff</span> from me outright? <span class="time" data-times="4.2" data-time="93.1">[01:33.10]</span>Because if not enough bowls were sold, how would I <span class="underline">recruit</span> the <span class="underline">cost</span> of my materials? <span class="time" data-times="2.4" data-time="97.3">[01:37.30]</span>They are not cheap and neither was the case.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.2" data-time="99.7">[01:39.70]</span>Employee:All the stores around here that sell <span class="underline">craft</span> items are small and independently owned, unlike the emporium. <span class="time" data-times="3.3" data-time="105.9">[01:45.90]</span>For them, selling on consignment lowers their risk. <span class="time" data-times="2.35" data-time="109.2">[01:49.20]</span>They don't get <span class="underline">stuck</span> with unsold items. <span class="time" data-times="1.65" data-time="111.55">[01:51.55]</span>They can return them to the owner. <span class="time" data-times="5" data-time="113.2">[01:53.20]</span>You just have to make sure you set the <span class="underline">retail</span> price high enough to make it <span class="underline">worth</span> you want. <span class="time" data-times="3" data-time="118.2">[01:58.20]</span>But you're right, consignment isn't for everyone. <span class="time" data-times="2.3" data-time="121.2">[02:01.20]</span>What about the <span class="underline">spring</span><span class="underline">craft</span><span class="underline">fair</span>? <span class="time" data-times="3" data-time="123.5">[02:03.50]</span>You know that outdoor <span class="underline">market</span> that's held on Saturdays? <span class="time" data-times="4.7" data-time="126.5">[02:06.50]</span>Plenty of <span class="underline">local</span> people sell their <span class="underline">stuff</span> there, ceramics, <span class="underline">jewelry</span>, <span class="underline">decorative</span> items. <span class="time" data-times="2.3" data-time="131.2">[02:11.20]</span>The vendor fee is <span class="underline">nominal</span> I believe.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.1" data-time="133.5">[02:13.50]</span>Student:Oh, yeah. I remember seeing that last year. <span class="time" data-times="3.5" data-time="136.6">[02:16.60]</span>All those tables lined up in that <span class="underline">vacant</span> lot on main street, right?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="7" data-time="140.1">[02:20.10]</span>Employee:Right. Since the <span class="underline">craft</span><span class="underline">fair</span>'s only a few blocks from <span class="underline">campus</span>, it seems like a good place for students to sell things.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.5" data-time="147.1">[02:27.10]</span>Student:Do you know how it works?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4" data-time="148.6">[02:28.60]</span>Employee:I think you just run to <span class="underline">space</span> and set up your table to <span class="underline">display</span> your bowls on. <span class="time" data-times="3" data-time="152.6">[02:32.60]</span>You'd set the prices and keep all the profits.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.7" data-time="155.6">[02:35.60]</span>Student:Seems doable. <span class="time" data-times="4.25" data-time="157.3">[02:37.30]</span>But... um... I don't have a car to <span class="underline">haul</span> everything down there.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.75" data-time="161.55">[02:41.55]</span>Employee:You could take the <span class="underline">campus</span> bus. It goes into town on weekends.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.7" data-time="165.3">[02:45.30]</span>Student:True... um... but I'd also have to sit there all day when I should be in the library or the <span class="underline">studio</span>... <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="172">[02:52.00]</span>I don't know, I <span class="underline">suppose</span> I could do my reading assignments between customers.</p>
