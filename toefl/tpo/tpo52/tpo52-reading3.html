            <b>Early Food Production in Sub-Saharan Africa</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>At the end of the <span class="underline">Pleistocene</span> (around 10,000 B.C.), the technologies of food production may have already been employed on the fringes of the rain forests of western and central Africa, where the <span class="underline">common</span> use of such <span class="underline">root</span> plants as the African yam led people to <span class="underline">recognize</span> the advantages of growing their own food. The yam can easily be resprouted if the top is replanted. This <span class="underline">primitive</span> form of "vegeculture" (<span class="underline">cultivation</span> of <span class="underline">root</span> and tree crops) may have been the <span class="underline">economic</span> tradition onto which the <span class="underline">cultivation</span> of summer <span class="underline">rainfall</span> <span class="underline">cereal</span> crops was grafted as it came into use south of the grassland areas on the Sahara's southern borders.</p>
          <p>As the Sahara dried up after 5000 B.C., <span class="underline">pastoral</span> peoples (<span class="underline">cattle</span> herders) moved southward <span class="underline">along</span> <span class="underline">major</span> watercourses into the savanna <span class="underline">belt</span> of West Africa and the Sudan. By 3000 B.C., just as <span class="underline">ancient</span> Egyptian <span class="underline">civilization</span> was coming into being <span class="underline">along</span> the Nile, they had settled in the heart of the East African highlands far to the south. The East African highlands are <span class="underline">ideal</span> <span class="underline">cattle</span> country and the home today of such famous cattle-herding peoples as the Masai. The highlands were inhabited by hunter-gatherers living around mountains near the plains until about 3300 B.C., when the first <span class="underline">cattle</span> herders appeared. These <span class="underline">cattle</span> people may have moved between fixed settlements during the wet and dry seasons, living off hunting in the dry months and their own <span class="underline">livestock</span> and <span class="underline">agriculture</span> during the rains.</p>
          <p>As was the case elsewhere, <span class="underline">cattle</span> were <span class="underline">demanding</span> animals in Africa. They required water at <span class="underline">least</span> every 24 hours and large tracts of <span class="underline">grazing</span> grass if herds of any size were to be maintained. The secret was the careful <span class="underline">selection</span> of <span class="underline">grazing</span> land, especially in environments where <span class="underline">seasonal</span> <span class="underline">rainfall</span> led to <span class="underline">marked</span> differences in graze <span class="underline">quality</span> <span class="underline">throughout</span> the year. <span class="underline">Even</span> <span class="underline">modest</span> <span class="underline">cattle</span> herds required plenty of land and <span class="underline">considerable</span> <span class="underline">mobility</span>. To <span class="underline">acquire</span> such land often required moving herds <span class="underline">considerable</span> distances, <span class="underline">even</span> from summer to winter pastures. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> At the same time, the <span class="underline">cattle</span> owners had to graze their <span class="underline">stock</span> in tsetse-fly-free areas <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> The only protection against human and animal sleeping sickness, a <span class="underline">disease</span> carried by the tsetse fly, was to <span class="underline">avoid</span> settling or farming such areas - a <span class="underline">constraint</span> <span class="underline">severely</span> limiting the movements of cattle-owning farmers in eastern and central Africa. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span> As a result, small <span class="underline">cattle</span> herds <span class="underline">spread</span> south rapidly in areas where they could be grazed. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span> Long before <span class="underline">cereal</span> <span class="underline">agriculture</span> took hold far south of the Sahara, some hunter-gatherer groups in the savanna woodlands of eastern and southern Africa may have acquired <span class="underline">cattle</span>, and perhaps other <span class="underline">domesticated</span> animals, by gift <span class="underline">exchange</span> or <span class="underline">through</span> raids on herding neighbors.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="underline">Contrary</span> to <span class="underline">popular</span> belief: there is no such <span class="underline">phenomenon</span> as "pure" pastoralists, a society that subsists on its herds alone. The Saharan herders who moved southward to <span class="underline">escape</span> <span class="underline">drought</span> were almost certainly also cultivating sorghum, millet; and other <span class="underline">tropical</span> <span class="underline">rainfall</span> crops. By 1500 B.C., <span class="underline">cereal</span> <span class="underline">agriculture</span> was <span class="underline">widespread</span> <span class="underline">throughout</span> the savanna <span class="underline">belt</span> south of the Sahara. Small farming communities dotted the grasslands and forest margins of eastern West Africa, all of them depending on what is called shifting <span class="underline">agriculture</span>. This form of <span class="underline">agriculture</span> involved clearing woodland, burning the felled <span class="underline">brush</span> over the cleared <span class="underline">plot</span>, mixing the ash into the soil, and then cultivating the prepared fields. After a few years, the soil was exhausted, so the farmer moved on, exploiting new woodland and leaving the abandoned fields to lie <span class="underline">fallow</span>. Shifting <span class="underline">agriculture</span>, often called slash-and-burn, was highly <span class="underline">adaptive</span> for savanna farmers without plows, for it allowed <span class="underline">cereal</span> farming with the <span class="underline">minimal</span> expenditure of energy.</p>
          <p>The <span class="underline">process</span> of clearance and burning may have seemed haphazard to the uninformed eye, but it was not. Except in <span class="underline">favored</span> areas, such as regularly inundated floodplains: <span class="underline">tropical</span> Africa's soils were of only <span class="underline">moderate</span> to low <span class="underline">fertility</span>. The art of farming was careful soil <span class="underline">selection</span>, that is, knowing which soils were light and easily cultivable, could be <span class="underline">readily</span> turned with small hoes, and would <span class="underline">maintain</span> their <span class="underline">fertility</span> over several years' planting, for <span class="underline">cereal</span> crops rapidly remove <span class="underline">nitrogen</span> and other nutrients from the soil. Once it had taken hold: slash-and-burn <span class="underline">agriculture</span> expanded its frontiers rapidly as village after village took up new lands, moving <span class="underline">forward</span> so rapidly that one expert has estimated it took a <span class="underline">mere</span> two centuries to cover 2,000 kilometers from eastern to southern Africa.</p>
