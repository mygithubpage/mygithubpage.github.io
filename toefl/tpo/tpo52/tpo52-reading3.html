The yam can easily be resprouted if the top is replanted. This <span class="highlight">primitive</span> form of "vegeculture" (<span class="highlight">cultivation</span> of <span class="highlight">root</span> and tree crops) may have been the <span class="highlight">economic</span> tradition onto which the <span class="highlight">cultivation</span> of summer <span class="highlight">rainfall</span><span class="highlight">cereal</span> crops was grafted as it came into use south of the grassland areas on the Sahara's southern borders.</p><p>As the Sahara dried up after 5000 B.C., <span class="highlight">pastoral</span> peoples (<span class="highlight">cattle</span> herders) moved southward <span class="highlight">along</span><span class="highlight">major</span> watercourses into the savanna <span class="highlight">belt</span> of West Africa and the Sudan. By 3000 B.C., just as <span class="highlight">ancient</span> Egyptian <span class="highlight">civilization</span> was coming into being <span class="highlight">along</span> the Nile, they had settled in the heart of the East African highlands far to the south. The East African highlands are <span class="highlight">ideal</span><span class="highlight">cattle</span> country and the home today of such famous cattle-herding peoples as the Masai. The highlands were inhabited by hunter-gatherers living around mountains near the plains until about 3300 B.C., when the first <span class="highlight">cattle</span> herders appeared. These <span class="highlight">cattle</span> people may have moved between fixed settlements during the wet and dry seasons, living off hunting in the dry months and their own <span class="highlight">livestock</span> and <span class="highlight">agriculture</span> during the rains.</p><p>As was the case elsewhere, <span class="highlight">cattle</span> were <span class="highlight">demanding</span> animals in Africa. They required water at <span class="highlight">least</span> every 24 hours and large tracts of <span class="highlight">grazing</span> grass if herds of any size were to be maintained. The secret was the careful <span class="highlight">selection</span> of <span class="highlight">grazing</span> land, especially in environments where <span class="highlight">seasonal</span><span class="highlight">rainfall</span> led to <span class="highlight">marked</span> differences in graze <span class="highlight">quality</span><span class="highlight">throughout</span> the year. <span class="highlight">Even</span><span class="highlight"><span class="question4">modest</span></span><span class="highlight">cattle</span> herds required plenty of land and <span class="highlight">considerable</span><span class="highlight">mobility</span>. To <span class="highlight">acquire</span> such land often required moving herds <span class="highlight">considerable</span> distances, <span class="highlight">even</span> from summer to winter pastures. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> At the same time, the <span class="highlight">cattle</span> owners had to graze their <span class="highlight">stock</span> in tsetse-fly-free areas <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> The only protection against human and animal sleeping sickness, a <span class="highlight">disease</span> carried by the tsetse fly, was to <span class="highlight">avoid</span> settling or farming such areas - a <span class="highlight">constraint</span><span class="highlight"><span class="question6">severely</span></span> limiting the movements of cattle-owning farmers in eastern and central Africa. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span> As a result, small <span class="highlight">cattle</span> herds <span class="highlight">spread</span> south rapidly in areas where they could be grazed. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span> Long before <span class="highlight">cereal</span><span class="highlight">agriculture</span> took hold far south of the Sahara, some hunter-gatherer groups in the savanna woodlands of eastern and southern Africa may have acquired <span class="highlight">cattle</span>, and perhaps other <span class="highlight">domesticated</span> animals, by gift <span class="highlight">exchange</span> or <span class="highlight">through</span> raids on herding neighbors.</p><p><span class="highlight">Contrary</span> to <span class="highlight">popular</span> belief: there is no such <span class="highlight">phenomenon</span> as "pure" pastoralists, a society that subsists on its herds alone. The Saharan herders who moved southward to <span class="highlight">escape</span><span class="highlight">drought</span> were almost certainly also cultivating sorghum, millet; and other <span class="highlight">tropical</span><span class="highlight">rainfall</span> crops. By 1500 B.C., <span class="highlight">cereal</span><span class="highlight">agriculture</span> was <span class="highlight">widespread</span><span class="highlight">throughout</span> the savanna <span class="highlight">belt</span> south of the Sahara. Small farming communities dotted the grasslands and forest margins of eastern West Africa, all of them depending on what is called shifting <span class="highlight">agriculture</span>. This form of <span class="highlight">agriculture</span> involved clearing woodland, burning the felled <span class="highlight">brush</span> over the cleared <span class="highlight">plot</span>, mixing the ash into the soil, and then cultivating the prepared fields. After a few years, the soil was exhausted, so the farmer moved on, <span class="question9">exploiting</span> new woodland and leaving the abandoned fields to lie <span class="highlight">fallow</span>. Shifting <span class="highlight">agriculture</span>, often called slash-and-burn, was highly <span class="highlight">adaptive</span> for savanna farmers without plows, for it allowed <span class="highlight">cereal</span> farming with the <span class="highlight">minimal</span> expenditure of energy.</p><p>The <span class="highlight">process</span> of clearance and burning may have seemed haphazard to the uninformed eye, but it was not.

In certain areas of western and central Africa, some people were already growing root plants such as yams.</p><p>B. The cultivation of cereal crops had already been used effectively and widely by people living on the fringes of ram forests.</p><p>C. Sophisticated forms of "vegeculture" were introduced for the first time in central and western Africa by people from the Sahara's southern borders.</p><p>D. The cultivation of root and tree crops replaced the cultivation of cereal crops because of decreasing summer rainfall in grassland areas.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The title is factual information. Topic Q Which of the following is correct regarding the early food production in the late epoch?</p><p>Option A: In some parts of West Africa and Central Africa, some people have begun planting rhizomes such as yam. According to the keywords "root plant" and "yams", we locate the common use of such root plants as the African yam led people to recognize the advantages of growing their own food. This sentence shows that at that time, humans had indeed begun to grow yam and other root crops. Therefore, the A option is correct.</p><p>Option B: People living on the edge of a tropical rainforest have efficiently and extensively planted cereal crops. Wrong, because the text mentions only the cultivation of root and tree plants. The cereal crop has not yet been planted at the time, so the B option contradicts the original. exclude.</p><p>Option C: The "vegetable cultivation" method was first introduced to the central and western parts of Africa by people from the southern borders of the Sahara Desert. Wrong, because the last sentence of the text only says "...as it came into use south of the grassland areas on the Sahara's southern borders." This planting technique has been used in the southern part of the Sahara Desert south of the steppes. However, it is not said that people in these areas have introduced this technology into Central and Western Africa. Therefore, the C option has not been mentioned and excluded.</p><p>Option D: The planting of root and tree plants replaced the planting of cereals, as the amount of precipitation in the grasslands has become less and less. This information was not mentioned in the original text and was ruled out.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Paragraph 2 mentions all of the following as developments in Sub-Saharan Africa from 5000 to 3000 B.C. EXCEPT</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The Sahara dried up.</p><p>B. Ancient Egyptian civilization started to form along the Nile.</p><p>C. The inhabitants of the East African highlands gave up hunting when cattle herders arrived.</p><p>D. Pastoral peoples moved through the savanna belt to settle in the East African highlands.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>This question is a negative factual information question. Question: Which of the following does not pertain to the development of sub-Saharan Africa from 5,000 BC to 3,000 BC? Let's look at the options one by one:</p><p>A option: The Sahara has dried up. The first sentence of the second paragraph says "As the Sahara dried up after 5000 B.C...." This sentence proves that the A option is in line with the original, so the A option is excluded.</p><p>Option B: Ancient Egyptian civilization originated in the Nile Valley. The second sentence of the second paragraph says "By 3000 B.C., just as ancient Egyptian civilization was coming into being along the Nile..." This sentence proves that the B option is in line with the original text, so the B option is excluded.</p><p>Option C: When the nomads arrived, the indigenous peoples of the East African Highlands gave up hunting. In the original text, "The highlands were inhabited by hunter-gatherers living around mountains near the plains until about 3300 BC, when the first cattle herders appeared." These words said that until about 3300 BC, the first batch of cattlemen appeared on the highlands. Lived by hunter-gatherers, they live in the mountains near the plains. However, there is no mention in the text that these aborigines gave up hunting after the arrival of the nomadic people. Therefore, the C option was not mentioned in the text and was the correct answer.</p><p>Option D: Nomads cross the savannah zone and settle in the highlands of East Africa. Corresponding to the second paragraph of paragraphs 1 and 2, "pastoral peoples (cattle herders) moved southward along major watercourses into the savanna belt of West Africa and the Sudan...settled in the heart of the East African highlands far to the south." The options are in accordance with the original text, so the D option is excluded.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the following can be inferred from paragraph 2 about the pastoral peoples in the East African Highlands around 3300 B.C.?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They lived around the mountains and rarely descended into the plains.</p><p>B. They relied on different food sources during dry months than they did during wet months.</p><p>C. Their settlements were larger than those of pastoral peoples in West Africa and the Sudan.</p><p>D. They obtained food from nearby hunter-gatherer communities during wet months.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>This question is a reasoning question. According to the key year "3300 BC" in the title, the phrase "The highlands were inhabited by hunter-gatherers living around mountains near the plains until about 3300 BC, when the first cattle herders appeared." Until about 3300 BC, when the first batch of cattlemen appeared, the highland was home to hunter-gatherers who lived in the mountains near the plains. The last sentence is also a description of the mode of life of the nomadic people after their arrival in the Highlands: during the dry season and the rainy season, these herders may move between fixed settlements, live in the hunting season during the dry season, and rely on animal husbandry and planting during the rainy season. .</p><p>A option: They live near the mountains and rarely go to the plains. This sentence describes the "hunter-gatherers" who originally lived on the high ground. It does not describe pastoral people, nor does it say that these "hunter-gatherers" rarely come to the plains. Therefore, the A option is directly excluded.</p><p>Option B: Their food sources in the dry season are more abundant than those in the rainy season. We can infer from the last sentence in the text that the B option is correct.The last sentence says: These nomadic people lived a hunt in the dry season, and depended on animal husbandry and planting during the rainy season. The food obtained from hunting is certainly richer, and depending on livestock and planting, the food source is relatively single, so the B option is correct.</p><p>Option C: Their settlements are larger than the nomads in West Africa and Sudan. There is no mention of settlement size information in the article, so the C option is excluded.</p><p>D option: In the rainy season, they get food from the nearby Aboriginal people who rely on hunting hygiene. This information is not mentioned in the text and is therefore excluded.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question4">modest</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. small</p><p>B. strong</p><p>C. good</p><p>D. typical</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" D"><p>This question is a vocabulary question. "<span class="question4">modest</span>" means "moderate; ordinary." The vocabulary sentence "Even <span class="question4">modest</span> cattle herds required plenty of land and much mobility." means "Even if it is a moderately-sized herd, it needs a lot of land and considerable mobility." Let's look at the options:</p><p>A option: small, meaning "small", meaning does not match, so ruled out.</p><p>B option: strong, meaning "strong", meaning does not match, so ruled out.</p><p>The C option: good, meaning "good", does not match, so it is excluded.</p><p>D option: typical, in addition to the "representative" meaning, there is "consistent; ordinary" meaning, so the closest meaning is the correct answer.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Paragraph 3 mentions all of the following as reasons that raising cattle in Africa was demanding EXCEPT:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Cattle had to drink frequently.</p><p>B. Cattle needed large areas of good-quality grazing grass.</p><p>C. Cattle required a great deal of movement from one season to the next.</p><p>D. Cattle suffered from sleeping sickness after the herds spread south.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>This question is a negative factual information question. Question Which one of the following is not the reason why cows in Africa are very demanding? Let's look at the options one by one:</p><p>A option: Cows need to drink water frequently. The second sentence of the third paragraph can be positioned "The required water at least every 24 hours and large tracts of grazing grass if herds of any size were to be maintained." This statement says that the cattle need to drink at least every 24 hours. Explain that the A option is in accordance with the original text.</p><p>Option B: Herds require a large amount of high-quality pasture. According to the keyword "grazing grass", it is also positioned to the second sentence of the third paragraph, so the B option is in line with the original text and is therefore excluded.</p><p>Option C: The herd needs to move a long distance when changing from one season to the next. The phrase "To acquire such land often required moving herds capable distances, even from summer to winter pastures." indicates that the cattle often need to move a considerable distance to migrate from the summer pasture to the winter pasture. So here the C option is in line with the original text, so it is excluded.</p><p>Option D: After the herd migrates to the south, it begins to suffer from sleeping sickness. However, the original text says that in order to avoid sleeping sickness, the herd rapidly migrated to the south. So the southern part is free of diseased tsetse flies. Therefore, the D option contradicts the original and is the correct answer.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question6">severely</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. gradually</p><p>B. permanently</p><p>C. indirectly</p><p>D. very seriously</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" D"><p>This question is a vocabulary question. "<span class="question6">severely</span>" means "seriously" and the phrase "...a restriction <span class="question6">severely</span> limiting the movements of cattle-owning farmers in eastern and central Africa." means "...herdsmen from East and Central Africa Say that this approach has <span class="question6">severely</span> limited their migration." Let's look at the options:</p><p>A option: gradually, meaning "gradually, gradually", meaning does not match, so ruled out.</p><p>B option: permanent, meaning "permanently, long-term unchanged", meaning does not match, so ruled out.</p><p>C option: indirectly, meaning "indirectly", does not match, so ruled out.</p><p>D option: very seriously, meaning "very serious", the meaning is consistent, it is the correct answer.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 3, the presence of the tsetse fly in eastern and central Africa caused which of the following?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. People in the sub-Saharan region began to focus more on the cultivation of cereal crops than in maintaining livestock.</p><p>B. Raids among neighboring cattle herders increased dramatically.</p><p>C. Cattle herders spread south where they could graze their stock in tsetse-fly-free areas.</p><p>D. Most hunter-gatherer groups limited their food collection to the tsetse-fly-free areas south of the Sahara.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The title is factual information. Question asked, What are the consequences of tsetse fly in East and Central Africa? According to the key word "tsetse fly" in the sentence, the third, last, second, third, and fourth sentence can be located. "At the same time, the cattle owners had to graze their stock in tsetse-fly-free areas ... As a Result, small cattle herds spread south rapidly in areas where they could be grazed." The three sentences are all about the consequences of tsetse fly and tsetse fly. The word "caused" in the question is asking the result, so we find the key word "as a result" in the text. The following content is the result, that is, a small part of the herd rapidly migrates to the southern region, where people can grazing. Corresponding C option is correct.</p><p>Option A: People in sub-Saharan Africa are starting to spend more time growing cereals than cattle. Wrong, because the article does not mention the comparative relationship between the two, people are growing cereals and cattle. Second, it is not the effect of tsetse flies.</p><p>Option B: The situation of robbery between the neighbors is getting worse. Corresponds to the last sentence of the third paragraph: "Long before cereal agriculture took hold far south of the Sahara...by gift exchange or through raids on herding neighbors." But this sentence is just to illustrate the way in which hunter-gatherers obtain livestock - as a gift exchange Or obtain these animals by grabbing grazing neighbors. This is not the effect of tsetse flies. Therefore, the B option is excluded.</p><p>Option D: Most hunter-gatherers limit their foraging range to the tsunami-infested areas of southern Sahara. Wrong, because the article did not mention this information.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Paragraph 4 indicates which of the following about shifting agriculture?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It allowed farmers to cultivate cereal crops without reducing the size of their herds.</p><p>B. It allowed farmers to cultivate a variety of crops at the same time.</p><p>C. It enabled farmers to cultivate crops with minimal equipment and effort.</p><p>D. It enriched the soil and produced large yields of crops over the years.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The title is factual information. Title Question Which of the following is correct regarding the round ploughing method mentioned in the fourth paragraph?</p><p>Option A: It allows farmers to grow grain without having to reduce their herd size. Wrong because the fourth paragraph did not mention this information.</p><p>Option B: It allows farmers to grow many kinds of crops at the same time. Wrong because the fourth paragraph did not mention this information. The article mentions only "The Saharan herders who moved southward to escape frost was very nearly also cultivating sorghum, millet; and other tropical rainfall crops." But this sentence says that the herdsmen moved south. They must also plant sorghum, millet and other tropical rainfall. crop. However, they did not say that they used the rotation method to cultivate these crops at the same time. Therefore, Option B was excluded.</p><p>Option C: It allows farmers to farm with minimal equipment and effort. According to the keyword "minimal" in the option, the last sentence of the fourth paragraph is positioned "Shifting agriculture, often called slash-and-burn, was highly adaptive for savanna farmers without plows, for it allowed cereal farming with the minimal expenditure of energy." This statement says that the rotational cultivation method, also known as "slash-and-burn", is highly applicable to peasants who have no plough in the savannah area because this method can consume the least amount of energy to grow the grain. So the C option meets the original text and is the correct answer.</p><p>Option D: It can fertilize the soil and produce a lot of food. Wrong because the fourth paragraph did not mention this information.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question9">exploiting</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. making use of</p><p>B. finding</p><p>C. destroying</p><p>D. looking for</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" A"><p>This question is a vocabulary question. "Exploiting" means "exploit; use." The phrase "After a few years, the soil was exhausted, so the farmer moved on, <span class="question9">exploiting</span> new woodland and leaving the abandoned fields to lie fallow." means "A few years later, the land was depleted of nutrients and the farmers Go ahead and open up new forest lands to let the original wasteland fallow." Let's take a look at the options:</p><p>A option: "making use of" means "use", the closest meaning, it is the correct answer.</p><p>B option:finding meaning "find", meaning does not match, so ruled out.</p><p>The C option: destroy means "destroy" and does not match, so it is excluded.</p><p>D option: Looking for meaning "find", meaning does not match, so ruled out.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question10">readily</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. completely</p><p>B. easily</p><p>C. properly</p><p>D. regularly</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>This question is a vocabulary question. "Readily" means "willfully; conveniently." The phrase "The art of farming was careful soil selection, that is, knowing which soils were light and easily cultivable, could be available turned with small hoes" means "the art of agriculture lies in the careful selection of land, that is to say , Know which soil is light soil, easy to cultivate, it is easy to use a small buns to turn seed." Here we look at options:</p><p>A option: complete means "completely; completely", meaning does not match, so ruled out.</p><p>The B option: easy means "simply". It means the correct answer.</p><p>The C option: properly means "appropriately; correctly."</p><p>D option: regularly means "regularly; regularly", meaning does not match, so ruled out.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>Select the TWO answer choices that, according to paragraph 5, indicate true statements about sub-Saharan slash-and-burn agriculture.

It involved regular flooding of the soils to improve fertility.</p><p>C. It was abandoned after being implemented intensively for two centuries.</p><p>D. It spread quickly once it took hold.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="AD"><p>The title is factual information. The question asked, which of the following two items is correct with respect to "slash and burn"?</p><p>A option: It consists of carefully choosing the cultivation land. According to the keyword "careful selection of soils," the phrase "The art of farming was careful soil selection, that is, knowing which soils were light and easily cultivable, could be <span class="question10">readily</span> turned with small hoes." In other words, the art of agriculture lies in the careful selection of land. That is to say, knowing which soils are light soils and are easy to cultivate, it is easy to use small buns to turn seed. So the A option complies with the original, correct.</p><p>Option B: It includes that river water often submerges the soil and enhances the fertility of the soil. The error, as stated in the text "Except in favored areas, such as regularly inundated floodplains: tropical Africa's soils were of only moderate to low fertility." means that in addition to the river floodplain, which is often flooded, the soil fertility in Africa is generally in the middle Or below. Therefore, the B option has nothing to do with "slash-and-burn", so it is excluded.</p><p>Option C: It was banned after two centuries of implementation. According to the keyword "two centuries", the article "...one expert has estimated it took a mere two centuries to cover 2,000 kilometers from eastern to southern Africa." means that one expert estimates that it only uses only For two centuries, it covered 2,000 square kilometers of land in East and West Africa. However, the text did not say that it was canceled, so the C option was inconsistent with the original text and was ruled out.</p><p>Option D: After being adopted, the "slash-and-burn" method spreads quickly. Correct, corresponds to the last sentence of the fifth paragraph. Therefore, the D option is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the following best describes the relationship of paragraph 5 to paragraph 4?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Both paragraphs compare the effectiveness of cereal agriculture and cattle herding as food-production strategies in the sub-Saharan regions.</p><p>B. Paragraph 5 challenges the ideas in paragraph 4 about the relative importance of shifting agriculture in the sub-Saharan regions.</p><p>C. Both paragraphs emphasize the idea that agricultural practices south of the Sahara took a very long time to develop.</p><p>D. Paragraph 5 provides further details about the practice of shifting agriculture south of the Sahara presented in paragraph 4.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The title is organizational structure questions. Question, what is the relationship between the fourth and fifth paragraphs? Let us first look at the contents of the fourth and fifth paragraphs. The fourth paragraph mainly talked about the herdsmen adopting the rotation cultivation method, ie, "slash and slash and burn", and cultivated with the least equipment and energy. The fifth paragraph further analyzed the advantages and dissemination of the "slash-and-burn" method. Let's look at the options below:</p><p>Option A: Both are comparing the effectiveness of grain agriculture and livestock husbandry as food production methods in sub-Saharan Africa. Wrong, because the 4th and 5th paragraphs are mainly for growing cereals, and there is no comparison between planting crops and animal husbandry, so the A option is excluded.</p><p>Option B: The fifth paragraph questions the view held in the fourth paragraph on the relative importance of rotation farming in the sub-Saharan region. Wrong, because there is no sign in the fifth paragraph to refute the argument in the fourth paragraph, so the B option is excluded.</p><p>Option C: Both paragraphs emphasize that agricultural production in the sub-Saharan region took a long time to develop. Wrong because neither the fourth or fifth paragraph emphasizes that agricultural production takes a long time to develop. Only the last sentence of the fifth paragraph states that the experts anticipate that the rotation farming method will cover 2000 square kilometers in East and West Africa in two centuries. soil of. However, this is to illustrate the rapid development of the wheel cultivation method, and it is not to emphasize that its development will take a long time. Therefore, the C option is excluded.</p><p>Option D: In the fourth paragraph, mention is made of the farming method in the sub-Saharan region. The fifth paragraph provides more details on this. Correct, in accordance with the original text of the chapter logic. Therefore, the D option is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Southern Africa was, however, relatively free of tsetse flies..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>This question is a sentence insertion question. The sentence to be inserted means: However, in West Africa, the number of tsetse flies is relatively small. Then we return to the original text. The contents between Boxes A and C are all to say that the herdsmen and livestock in East and Central Africa are affected by tsetse flies. And the phrase after the C box, "As a result, small cattle herds spread south rapidly in areas where they could be grazed." Says, as a result, the small herds rapidly migrate to the south, where people can grazing. "as a result" is a causal logic word, but the reason why the herd migrated to the south was not mentioned in the previous article.

Let's look at the options one by one to find the correct answer.</p><p>The</p><p>Option A: The production of food begins with the cultivation of rhizome plants, and then gradually cereal crops are also being planted. correct. The A option is a summary of the full text. The first paragraph mentions that people started planting root and tree crops, and then people used round ploughing to grow cereals, so the A option was correct.</p><p>The</p><p>Option B: In order to prevent people and livestock suffering from sleeping sickness, endangering pastoralists and herds, more and more herders are beginning to grow crops. The mistake, the first sentence of the fourth paragraph says "Contrary to popular belief: there is no such phenomenon as "pure" pastoralists, a society that subsists on its herds alone." This shows that herdsmen not only grazing but also plant crops. The article did not say that because of sleeping sickness, the herders did not grazing to plant crops. Both husbandry and cultivation are carried out simultaneously. Therefore, the B option contradicts the original and is excluded.</p><p>The</p><p>Option C: By 1500 BC, cereal agriculture had spread across the savannah belts in the sub-Saharan region, and round-farming cultivation was highly efficient and widely used by farmers. Correct, corresponding to the fourth and fifth paragraphs of the article.The fourth and fifth paragraphs discuss the benefits and spread of the rotation farming method, so the C option is correct.</p><p>The</p><p>Option D: Pastoralists searching for suitable pastures across the Sahara may also grow crops. Correctly, corresponding to the first sentence of the fourth paragraph, "Contrary to popular belief: there is no such phenomenon as "pure" pastoralists, a society that subsists on its herds alone." Explain that the herdsmen not only grazing, but also plant crops. The second sentence of the fourth paragraph also states that pastoralists will plant sorghum, millet and other tropical rainfall crops. Therefore, the D option is correct.</p><p>The</p><p>Option E: People living in hunting and gathering in East Africa and South Africa rely on looting neighbor's livestock to obtain cattle and other domestic animals. Corresponds to the last sentence of the third paragraph, but this is only the details, not the main content of the article, so it is not selected.</p><p>The</p><p>F option: The "slash-and-burn" method was first rejected by farmers because it required a lot of labor, but once the technology was improved, it gradually expanded to East Africa and South Africa. Wrong, because in the fourth and fifth paragraph, the turn cultivation method, that is, "slash-and-burn", was adopted by farmers. Therefore, the F option contradicts the original, and the "technical improvement" in the F option is not mentioned in the original text, so the F option is excluded.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
