            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.6" data-time="4.38">[00:04.38]</span>Professor:Now, Earth's <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span> is <span class="highlight">sort</span> of like a <span class="highlight">giant</span> weather machine, right?<span class="time" data-times="2.98" data-time="8.98">[00:08.98]</span> Uh...with <span class="highlight">air</span> and water being its key components. <span class="time" data-times="3.4" data-time="11.96">[00:11.96]</span>A machine powered by energy from the Sun. <span class="time" data-times="7.63" data-time="15.36">[00:15.36]</span>So we need to <span class="highlight">consider</span> the role that <span class="highlight">air</span>, or more <span class="highlight">specifically</span>, wind, plays in this machine. <span class="time" data-times="3.81" data-time="22.99">[00:22.99]</span>So wind is really nothing more than moving <span class="highlight">air</span>, right? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.28" data-time="26.8">[00:26.80]</span>Now, as <span class="highlight">air</span> is heated and becomes warmer, it expands, it becomes less <span class="highlight"><span class="highlight">dense</span></span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.52" data-time="32.08">[00:32.08]</span>When <span class="highlight">air</span> in a <span class="highlight">particular</span> area is heated, you get a <span class="highlight">concentration</span> of warm <span class="highlight">air</span> in an area of low <span class="highlight">pressure</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9.3" data-time="39.6">[00:39.60]</span>Likewise, when you get a <span class="highlight">concentration</span> of cold <span class="highlight">air</span>, that <span class="highlight">air</span>'s <span class="highlight">gonna</span> be very <span class="highlight"><span class="highlight">dense</span></span>, so it's <span class="highlight">gonna</span> create an area of high <span class="highlight">pressure</span>. <span class="time" data-times="10.97" data-time="48.9">[00:48.90]</span>If you have an area of high <span class="highlight">pressure</span> next to an area of low <span class="highlight">pressure</span>, the colder, high <span class="highlight">pressure</span> <span class="highlight">air</span> will start moving toward the area of low <span class="highlight">pressure</span>. Right? <span class="time" data-times="4.91" data-time="59.87">[00:59.87]</span>And the warmer <span class="highlight">air</span> will move away, rising above the cooler <span class="highlight">air</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.64" data-time="64.78">[01:04.78]</span>Okay?Uh...yes. Linda? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.08" data-time="67.42">[01:07.42]</span>Student:So wind is actually generated by the Sun? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.41" data-time="70.5">[01:10.50]</span>Professor:Well, Earth's <span class="highlight">rotation</span> plays a role. And there are other factors and we'll come back to all that. <span class="time" data-times="2.41" data-time="75.91">[01:15.91]</span>But, <span class="highlight">principally</span>, yes. <span class="time" data-times="7.41" data-time="78.32">[01:18.32]</span>The Sun creates the <span class="highlight">temperature</span> differential that creates the areas of high <span class="highlight">pressure</span> and low <span class="highlight">pressure</span> that create wind. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.23" data-time="85.73">[01:25.73]</span>Student:Um...l don't get what...how it causes a <span class="highlight">temperature</span> differential. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.75" data-time="90.96">[01:30.96]</span>Professor:Right. Good. This will take us to the role of wind in the <span class="highlight">climate</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.68" data-time="95.71">[01:35.71]</span>The key is that the Sun warms up different parts of Earth at different rates and to different degrees.<span class="time" data-times="7.26" data-time="103.39">[01:43.39]</span> For example, at sunrise, the land heats up faster than the ocean. <span class="time" data-times="2.77" data-time="110.65">[01:50.65]</span>That's why you get morning sea breezes. <span class="time" data-times="12.23" data-time="113.42">[01:53.42]</span>The <span class="highlight">air</span> over the water heats more slowly than <span class="highlight">air</span> overland, so during the early morning, it's cooler and denser than <span class="highlight">air</span> overland, so it moves in toward land. <span class="time" data-times="1.72" data-time="125.65">[02:05.65]</span>A sea <span class="highlight">breeze</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="12.49" data-time="127.37">[02:07.37]</span>What else?The Sun's energy is more <span class="highlight">intense</span> near the <span class="highlight">equator</span> than it is near the poles, so you've got masses of warmer <span class="highlight">air</span> over the <span class="highlight">equatorial</span> regions, <span class="time" data-times="3.89" data-time="139.86">[02:19.86]</span>and masses of cooler <span class="highlight">air</span> over Polar Regions. <span class="time" data-times="6.64" data-time="143.75">[02:23.75]</span>And these masses are <span class="highlight">constantly</span> interacting with each other, which is critically important for Earth's <span class="highlight">climate</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="17.13" data-time="150.39">[02:30.39]</span>One result of these interactions is that <span class="highlight">equatorial</span> <span class="highlight">air</span> masses move away from the <span class="highlight">equator</span> and in the <span class="highlight">process</span> those <span class="highlight">equatorial</span> winds actually take heat away from the <span class="highlight">equator</span> and <span class="highlight">transfer</span> it to some cooler part of Earth. <span class="time" data-times="11.29" data-time="167.52">[02:47.52]</span>And by redistributing this energy, the Sun's energy really, winds play a <span class="highlight">critical</span> role in maintaining a <span class="highlight">temperature</span> <span class="highlight">balance</span> from the poles to the <span class="highlight">equator</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.63" data-time="178.81">[02:58.81]</span>Now, winds also help Earth <span class="highlight">maintain</span> its <span class="highlight">balance</span> in another way: by transporting water from one part of Earth to another. <span class="time" data-times="7.94" data-time="189.44">[03:09.44]</span>Water's contained in the <span class="highlight">air</span> in the form of <span class="highlight">vapor</span>, mostly <span class="highlight">through</span> <span class="highlight">evaporation</span>, mostly from the oceans. <span class="time" data-times="11.7" data-time="197.38">[03:17.38]</span>So when the <span class="highlight">air</span> moves, itcarries the <span class="highlight">vapor</span> with it to some other parts of Earth, where it can <span class="highlight">deposit</span> it as rain or snow, or some other form of <span class="highlight">precipitation</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.84" data-time="209.08">[03:29.08]</span>Now, actually, the <span class="highlight">transfer</span> of heat and water by way of the wind are very closely related, <span class="time" data-times="7.99" data-time="216.92">[03:36.92]</span>because a <span class="highlight">primary</span> way that heat energy is transferred by wind is mediated by the <span class="highlight">process</span> of <span class="highlight">evaporation</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.21" data-time="224.91">[03:44.91]</span>What happens is that a certain <span class="highlight">amount</span> of heat energy is required to <span class="highlight">convert</span> <span class="highlight">liquid</span> water into <span class="highlight">vapor</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9.28" data-time="232.12">[03:52.12]</span>So when water evaporates from the ocean, it takes energy to <span class="highlight">convert</span> that water into a <span class="highlight">gaseous</span> form, into water <span class="highlight">vapor</span>.<span class="time" data-times="10.73" data-time="241.4">[04:01.40]</span> But that heat energy, that <span class="highlight">conversion</span> energy, doesn't <span class="highlight">raise</span> the <span class="highlight">temperature</span> of the water <span class="highlight">vapor</span> or the <span class="highlight">air</span>, it's just stored in the water <span class="highlight">vapor</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.45" data-time="252.13">[04:12.13]</span>Then later when the water <span class="highlight">vapor</span> converts back to <span class="highlight">liquid</span> water, that energy is released. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.9" data-time="259.58">[04:19.58]</span>So when water evaporates, energy is taken from the ocean, and it's stored in the water <span class="highlight">vapor</span>, in the <span class="highlight">air</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.19" data-time="269.48">[04:29.48]</span>Then the <span class="highlight">air</span>, the wind, transports the water <span class="highlight">vapor</span> to some other part of Earth. <span class="time" data-times="4.39" data-time="275.67">[04:35.67]</span>Then the water <span class="highlight">vapor</span> converts back into <span class="highlight">liquid</span> water. <span class="time" data-times="1.8" data-time="280.06">[04:40.06]</span>It rains, in other words. <span class="time" data-times="7.32" data-time="281.86">[04:41.86]</span>And the heat energy that was stored in the water <span class="highlight">vapor</span> is released into the new environment. Okay? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.9" data-time="289.18">[04:49.18]</span>So the <span class="highlight">transfer</span> of heat and the <span class="highlight">transfer</span> of water are very closely related. <span class="time" data-times="3.55" data-time="295.08">[04:55.08]</span>And what's the <span class="highlight">primary</span> <span class="highlight">vehicle</span> for this <span class="highlight">transfer</span>? <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="298.63">[04:58.63]</span>The wind! So wind is a very <span class="highlight">critical</span> <span class="highlight">element</span> in the redistribution of both the Sun's energy and Earth's water. </p>
