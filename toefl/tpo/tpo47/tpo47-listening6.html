Right? <span class="time" data-times="4.91" data-time="59.87">[00:59.87]</span>And the warmer <span class="highlight">air</span> will move away, rising above the cooler <span class="highlight">air</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.64" data-time="64.78">[01:04.78]</span>Okay?Uh...yes.

And there are other factors and we'll come back to all that. <span class="time" data-times="2.41" data-time="75.91">[01:15.91]</span>But, <span class="highlight">principally</span>, yes. <span class="time" data-times="7.41" data-time="78.32">[01:18.32]</span>The Sun creates the <span class="highlight">temperature</span> differential that creates the areas of high <span class="highlight">pressure</span> and low <span class="highlight">pressure</span> that create wind. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.23" data-time="85.73">[01:25.73]</span>Student:Um...l don't get what...how it causes a <span class="highlight">temperature</span> differential. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.75" data-time="90.96">[01:30.96]</span>Professor:Right. Good. This will take us to the role of wind in the <span class="highlight">climate</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.68" data-time="95.71">[01:35.71]</span>The key is that the Sun warms up different parts of Earth at different rates and to different degrees.<span class="time" data-times="7.26" data-time="103.39">[01:43.39]</span> For example, at sunrise, the land heats up faster than the ocean. <span class="time" data-times="2.77" data-time="110.65">[01:50.65]</span>That's why you get morning sea breezes. <span class="time" data-times="12.23" data-time="113.42">[01:53.42]</span>The <span class="highlight">air</span> over the water heats more slowly than <span class="highlight">air</span> overland, so during the early morning, it's cooler and denser than <span class="highlight">air</span> overland, so it moves in toward land. <span class="time" data-times="1.72" data-time="125.65">[02:05.65]</span>A sea <span class="highlight">breeze</span>. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="12.49" data-time="127.37">[02:07.37]</span>What else?The Sun's energy is more <span class="highlight">intense</span> near the <span class="highlight">equator</span> than it is near the poles, so you've got masses of warmer <span class="highlight">air</span> over the <span class="highlight">equatorial</span> regions, <span class="time" data-times="3.89" data-time="139.86">[02:19.86]</span>and masses of cooler <span class="highlight">air</span> over Polar Regions. <span class="time" data-times="6.64" data-time="143.75">[02:23.75]</span>And these masses are <span class="highlight">constantly</span> interacting with each other, which is critically important for Earth's <span class="highlight">climate</span>. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="17.13" data-time="150.39">[02:30.39]</span>One result of these interactions is that <span class="highlight">equatorial</span><span class="highlight">air</span> masses move away from the <span class="highlight">equator</span> and in the <span class="highlight">process</span> those <span class="highlight">equatorial</span> winds actually take heat away from the <span class="highlight">equator</span> and <span class="highlight">transfer</span> it to some cooler part of Earth. <span class="time" data-times="11.29" data-time="167.52">[02:47.52]</span>And by redistributing this energy, the Sun's energy really, winds play a <span class="highlight">critical</span> role in maintaining a <span class="highlight">temperature</span><span class="highlight">balance</span> from the poles to the <span class="highlight">equator</span>. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="10.63" data-time="178.81">[02:58.81]</span>Now, winds also help Earth <span class="highlight">maintain</span> its <span class="highlight">balance</span> in another way: by transporting water from one part of Earth to another. <span class="time" data-times="7.94" data-time="189.44">[03:09.44]</span>Water's contained in the <span class="highlight">air</span> in the form of <span class="highlight">vapor</span>, mostly <span class="highlight">through</span><span class="highlight">evaporation</span>, mostly from the oceans. <span class="time" data-times="11.7" data-time="197.38">[03:17.38]</span>So when the <span class="highlight">air</span> moves, itcarries the <span class="highlight">vapor</span> with it to some other parts of Earth, where it can <span class="highlight">deposit</span> it as rain or snow, or some other form of <span class="highlight">precipitation</span>. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.84" data-time="209.08">[03:29.08]</span>Now, actually, the <span class="highlight">transfer</span> of heat and water by way of the wind are very closely related, <span class="time" data-times="7.99" data-time="216.92">[03:36.92]</span>because a <span class="highlight">primary</span> way that heat energy is transferred by wind is mediated by the <span class="highlight">process</span> of <span class="highlight">evaporation</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.21" data-time="224.91">[03:44.91]</span>What happens is that a certain <span class="highlight">amount</span> of heat energy is required to <span class="highlight">convert</span><span class="highlight">liquid</span> water into <span class="highlight">vapor</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9.28" data-time="232.12">[03:52.12]</span>So when water evaporates from the ocean, it takes energy to <span class="highlight">convert</span> that water into a <span class="highlight">gaseous</span> form, into water <span class="highlight">vapor</span>.<span class="time" data-times="10.73" data-time="241.4">[04:01.40]</span> But that heat energy, that <span class="highlight">conversion</span> energy, doesn't <span class="highlight">raise</span> the <span class="highlight">temperature</span> of the water <span class="highlight">vapor</span> or the <span class="highlight">air</span>, it's just stored in the water <span class="highlight">vapor</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.45" data-time="252.13">[04:12.13]</span>Then later when the water <span class="highlight">vapor</span> converts back to <span class="highlight">liquid</span> water, that energy is released. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="9.9" data-time="259.58">[04:19.58]</span>So when water evaporates, energy is taken from the ocean, and it's stored in the water <span class="highlight">vapor</span>, in the <span class="highlight">air</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.19" data-time="269.48">[04:29.48]</span>Then the <span class="highlight">air</span>, the wind, transports the water <span class="highlight">vapor</span> to some other part of Earth. <span class="time" data-times="4.39" data-time="275.67">[04:35.67]</span>Then the water <span class="highlight">vapor</span> converts back into <span class="highlight">liquid</span> water. <span class="time" data-times="1.8" data-time="280.06">[04:40.06]</span>It rains, in other words. <span class="time" data-times="7.32" data-time="281.86">[04:41.86]</span>And the heat energy that was stored in the water <span class="highlight">vapor</span> is released into the new environment. Okay? </p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.9" data-time="289.18">[04:49.18]</span>So the <span class="highlight">transfer</span> of heat and the <span class="highlight">transfer</span> of water are very closely related. <span class="time" data-times="3.55" data-time="295.08">[04:55.08]</span>And what's the <span class="highlight">primary</span><span class="highlight">vehicle</span> for this <span class="highlight">transfer</span>? <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="298.63">[04:58.63]</span>The wind!

Various kinds of winds</p><p>B. Theories about recent changes in Earth's climate</p><p>C. The role of wind in regulating Earth's climate</p><p>D. The role of air in limiting the amount of the Sun's energy that reaches Earth</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The listening article first introduced the reason why the wind was formed because of the temperature difference. Then the reason why the temperature difference is introduced is that the land and sea have different heating rates and different areas receive different amounts of heat. Then the introduction of wind can transfer water and thus can transfer heat, and finally emphasize the importance of wind to adjust the earth's climate. Important, corresponding to Option C: The role of wind in regulating Earth's climate.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the lecture, what creates areas of high pressure and low pressure in the atmosphere?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The rotation of Earth</p><p>B. Wind moving from areas over water to areas over land</p><p>C. Differences in temperature at different places on Earth</p><p>D. Differences in concentrations of water vapor in different parts of the atmosphere</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>From 01:18 onwards, the teacher said: that creates the areas of high pressure and low pressure that create wind, which means that the answer to this question has already appeared. The teacher said: The Sun creates the temperature differential, indicating that the temperature difference leads to high and low pressure. Corresponding to option C: Differences in temperature at different places on Earth.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor, what are two reasons why all areas of Earth are not heated equally during daylight hours? Click on 2 answers.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Some regions of Earth receive more energy from the Sun than others.</p><p>B. The amount of energy emitted by the Sun varies in intensity over the course of the day.</p><p>C. The Sun heats stationary air faster than it heats moving air.</p><p>D. The Sun heats land faster than it heats water.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="AD"><p>Beginning at 01:35, the teacher said: The key is that the Sun warms up different parts of Earth at different rates and to different degrees, which means that the answer appears next. The teacher then said: For example, at sunrise, the land heats Up faster than the ocean, indicating that the land is hotter than the ocean, corresponding to option D: The Sun heats land faster than it heats water.</p><p>From 02:06 onwards, the teacher said, "What else, means that the answers are coming back. The teacher then said: The Sun's energy is more intense near the equator than it is near the poles, so you've got masses of warmer air over The equatorial regions, and masses of cooler air over Polar Regions, show that some regions of the earth receive more solar energy than other regions. Corresponding to Option A: Some regions of Earth receive more energy from the Sun than others.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>What are two benefits of wind mentioned by the professor? Click on 2 answers.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It transferred water across Earth</p><p>B. It shifts heat from some areas of Earth to others.</p><p>C. It helps maintain a constant rate of evaporation of ocean water.</p><p>D. It reduces the amount of the Sun's energy that is absorbed by the ocean.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="AB"><p>From 02:30 onwards, the teacher said: Now, winds also help Earth maintain its balance in another way, which means that the answer will appear later. The teacher then said: by transporting water from one part of Earth to another. It is the transfer of water. Corresponding to Option A: It transferred water across Earth. At the same time, this sentence: Now, winds also help Earth maintain its balance in another way. It also means that there has been a wind in front of it. One result of these interactions is that equatorial air masses move away from the equator and in the process those equatorial winds actually take heat away from the equator and transfer it to some cooler part of Earth, indicating that the wind can also transfer heat, corresponding to Option B :It shifts heat from some areas of Earth to others.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor imply about the heat stored in water vapor?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The heat is rarely transported by the wind.</p><p>B. The heat was drawn from the ocean during the evaporation process.</p><p>C. The heat's intensity depends on the altitude of the vapor.</p><p>D. The heat loses energy over time as it is stored in the vapor.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>From 03:52, the teacher said: But that heat energy, that conversion energy, doesn't raise the temperature of the water vapor or the air, it's just stored in the water vapor, which means that the answer to this question has already appeared. , the teacher said: So when water evaporates from the ocean, it takes energy to convert that water into a gaseous form, into water vapor, and the heat energy stored in the water vapor is actually the ocean that the water in the ocean turns into steam. The heat energy in the corresponding option B: The heat was drawn from the ocean during the evaporation process.</p></div></div><div class="replay" id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor mean when he says this:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.
