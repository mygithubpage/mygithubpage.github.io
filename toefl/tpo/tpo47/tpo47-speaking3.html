          <h4 class="w3-center">Professor Evaluations</h4>The university requires students to complete written evaluations of their professors at the end of each course taught during the semester. But current system is private, since only the professors actually read the evaluations once the students submit them. I suggest that the university publish these evaluation online for everyone to read. Both professors and students would benefit from having these evaluation published. Professor would feel more motivated to improve their teaching if they knew that their evaluations were publicly available to all students. In addition, prospective students could read the evaluation and make more informed decisions about which classes they want to take.
Sincerely,

        <h3>Listening Text</h3>
        <article>
          <p>Now listen to two students discussing the letter.</p>
          <p>Man:Did you see this?</p>
          <p>Woman:Yeah. But I don't think it'll work.</p>
          <p>Man:Why not?</p>
          <p>Woman:Well, I don't think professors would be too happy to have their teaching styles publicly criticized. Besides they might not even bother reading the online evaluations if they think there will be negative criticism in them.</p>
          <p>Man:You really think that will happen?</p>
          <p>Woman:Sure. And so the professor won't take them seriously or be influenced in any way. Nothing's going to change.</p>
          <p>Man:Okay. But at least students who might take their courses in the future will read them.</p>
          <p>Woman:That's true. But students who write the evaluations usually do it on the last day of class. And they're all in a hurry to leave. They don't want to bother spending much time on them, so they don't say anything specific or helpful about the professor or the course.</p>
          <p>Man:I see what you mean.</p>
          <p>Woman:So this whole idea may not work at all.</p>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>It is suggested by the student that the university should reveal the online evaluations of the professors to the public because the professors would have more motivations to prepare their lessons and students would have more information about what course to take. The woman in the conversation does not agree with the proposal. First of all, professors will not be happy with being criticized in the public, so they might not look at the assessments. Secondly, these estimations are done by students who are busy with their final examinations, which provides little practical and detailed information about courses. </p>
