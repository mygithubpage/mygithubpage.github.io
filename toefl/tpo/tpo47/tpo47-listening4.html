          <p>Listen to a conversation between a Student and his Professor.</p>
          <p>:Professor:This is not what I had in mind when I assigned a film review.</p>
          <p>:Student:It isn't?</p>
          <p>:Professor:No. What you wrote is a synopsis, a detailed summary of themovie, but it's not a review.</p>
          <p>:Student:It's not? I guess I'm a little confused cuz.Jsn't that what a filmreview does? You know, describe the film?</p>
          <p>:Professor:Sure. In part. But a good review has to do more. But this is probably not your fault. I'm starting to think that I should have explained the assignment better because...well...I got a lot of summaries and very few reviews.</p>
          <p>:Student:So it wasn't only me.</p>
          <p>:Professor:Hardly. I just assumed that everyone would know what to do.</p>
          <p>:Student:So...um...what else is a review supposed to do?</p>
          <p>:Professor:Well, it should also analyze the film, discuss its strengths and weaknesses, maybe compare it to other movies, even mention why the reviewer did or didn't like it.</p>
          <p>:Student:You mean it should have been more personal?</p>
          <p>:Professor:For starters, or maybe subjective is a better word than personal. Yes. It should have been more subjective.</p>
          <p>:Student:Maybe I could rewrite it? Professore: Well, I don't know about rewriting it. Too many people seemed to have missed the point. I think I may have to forgo evaluating this one. Instead maybe we'll just devote a class to discussing what it takes to write a good film review. Or maybe...hmm...you know, I have a colleague who writes film reviews for the local paper. Maybe I could ask her to come to class and describe what she does and then have everyone rewrite their reviews.</p>
          <p>:Student:So, she would talk about what a film review should be like, so we'd know what to do.</p>
          <p>:Professor:Well, more than that. A professional film reviewer gets to see movies sometimes before they are even released. They get advance copies - usually a video or DVD - to watch at home or they go to a movie as soon as it opens in the theaters.</p>
          <p>:Student:Um...seeing it on the big screen in a theater, doesn't that affect the experience?</p>
          <p>:Professor:Of course! Having other people there can...can affect the review, too.So, for the next assignment, I might ask everyone to review one of the films the film club shows every weekend at the theater on campus. There is no admission charge. They are free to Student:s and the movies are shown on Friday and Saturday nights, plus Sunday afternoon. So, everyone should be able to see one. Yeah, that should work.</p>
          <p>:Student:But for this time, will we have to rewrite our reviews?</p>
          <p>:Professor:Well, let's take it one thing at a time. Let me talk to my colleague. </p>
