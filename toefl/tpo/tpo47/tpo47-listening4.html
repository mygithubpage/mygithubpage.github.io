In part. <span class="time" data-times="2.12" data-time="22.67">[00:22.67]</span>But a good <span class="highlight">review</span> has to do more. <span class="time" data-times="2.4" data-time="24.79">[00:24.79]</span>But this is probably not your <span class="highlight">fault</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.11" data-time="27.19">[00:27.19]</span>I'm starting to think that I should have explained the <span class="highlight">assignment</span> better because...well...I got a lot of summaries and very few reviews. </p>

            <span class="time" data-times="7.28" data-time="42.71">[00:42.71]</span>Professor:Well, it should also <span class="highlight">analyze</span> the <span class="highlight">film</span>, discuss its strengths and weaknesses, maybe <span class="highlight">compare</span> it to other movies, <span class="time" data-times="3.04" data-time="49.99">[00:49.99]</span> <span class="highlight">even</span> <span class="highlight">mention</span> why the reviewer did or didn't like it. </p>

            <span class="time" data-times="1.77" data-time="53.03">[00:53.03]</span>Student:You mean it should have been more <span class="highlight">personal</span>? </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.55" data-time="54.8">[00:54.80]</span>Professor:For starters, or maybe subjective is a better word than <span class="highlight">personal</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.93" data-time="59.35">[00:59.35]</span>Yes. It should have been more subjective. </p>

          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.78" data-time="91.56">[01:31.56]</span>Student:So, she would talk about what a <span class="highlight">film</span> <span class="highlight">review</span> should be like, so we'd know what to do. </p>

            <span class="time" data-times="4.68" data-time="111.31">[01:51.31]</span>Student:Um...seeing it on the big <span class="highlight">screen</span> in a theater, doesn't that <span class="highlight">affect</span> the experience? </p>
