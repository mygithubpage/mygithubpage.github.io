They will not grow in very deep water, so a platform <span class="highlight">within</span> 30 to 40 meters of the surface is a necessary <span class="highlight"><span class="question2">prerequisite</span></span> for their <span class="highlight">development</span>. Their <span class="highlight">physical</span> structure is dominated by the skeletons of corals, which are <span class="highlight">carnivorous</span> animals living off <span class="highlight">zooplankton</span>. However, in <span class="highlight">addition</span> to corals there are <span class="highlight">enormous</span> quantities of <span class="highlight">algae</span>, some <span class="highlight">calcareous</span>, which help to build the reefs. The size of reefs is <span class="highlight">variable</span>. Some atolls are very large-Kwajelein in the Marshall Islands of the South <span class="highlight">Pacific</span> is 120 kilometers long and as much as 24 kilometers across-but most are very much smaller, and rise only a few meters above the water. The 2,000-kilometer <span class="highlight"><span class="question4">complex</span></span> of reefs known as the Great <span class="highlight">Barrier</span><span class="highlight">Reef</span>, which forms a <span class="highlight">gigantic</span> natural breakwater off the northeast <span class="highlight">coast</span> of Australia, is by far the greatest <span class="highlight">coral</span> structure on Earth.</p><p><span class="highlight">Coral</span> reefs have fascinated scientists for almost 200 years, and some of the most <span class="highlight"><span class="question6">pertinent</span></span> observations of them were made in the 1830s by Charles Darwin on the <span class="highlight">voyage</span> of the Beagle. He recognized that there were three <span class="highlight">major</span> kinds: fringing reefs, <span class="highlight">barrier</span> reefs, and atolls; and he saw that they were related to each other in a <span class="highlight">logical</span> and gradational <span class="highlight">sequence</span>. A fringing <span class="highlight">reef</span> is one that lies close to the <span class="highlight">shore</span> of some <span class="highlight">continent</span> or island. Its surface forms an <span class="highlight">uneven</span> and rather <span class="highlight">rough</span> platform around the <span class="highlight">coast</span>, about the <span class="highlight">level</span> of low water, and its outer <span class="highlight">edge</span> slopes downwards into the sea. Between the fringing <span class="highlight">reef</span> and the land there is sometimes a small <span class="highlight">channel</span> or <span class="highlight">lagoon</span>. When the <span class="highlight">lagoon</span> is wide and deep and the <span class="highlight">reef</span> lies at some distance from the <span class="highlight">shore</span> and rises from deep water it is called a <span class="highlight">barrier</span><span class="highlight">reef</span>. An <span class="highlight">atoll</span> is a <span class="highlight">reef</span> in the form of a ring or horseshoe with a <span class="highlight">lagoon</span> in the center.</p><p><span class="question8">Darwin s <span class="highlight">theory</span> was that the <span class="highlight">succession</span> from one <span class="highlight">coral</span><span class="highlight">reef</span> type to another could be achieved by the upward growth of <span class="highlight">coral</span> from a sinking platform, and that there would be a progression from a fringing <span class="highlight">reef</span>, <span class="highlight">through</span> the <span class="highlight">barrier</span><span class="highlight">reef</span><span class="highlight">stage</span> until, with the disappearance <span class="highlight">through</span> subsidence (sinking) of the central island, only a reef-enclosed <span class="highlight">lagoon</span> or <span class="highlight">atoll</span> would <span class="highlight">survive</span>.</span> A long time after Darwin put <span class="highlight">forward</span> this <span class="highlight">theory</span>, some deep boreholes were drilled in the <span class="highlight">Pacific</span> atolls in the 1950s. The <span class="highlight">drill</span> holes <span class="question10">passed <span class="highlight">through</span> more than a thousand meters of <span class="highlight">coral</span> before reaching the rock substratum of the ocean floor</span>, and indicated that the <span class="highlight">coral</span> had been growing upward for tens of millions of years as Earth's <span class="highlight">crust</span> subsided at a <span class="highlight">rate</span> of between 15 and 51 meters per million years. Darwin s <span class="highlight">theory</span> was <span class="highlight">therefore</span> proved basically correct. There are some <span class="highlight">submarine</span> islands called guyots and seamounts, in which subsidence <span class="highlight">associated</span> with sea-floor spreading has been too speedy for <span class="highlight">coral</span> growth to keep up.</p><p>Like mangrove swamps, <span class="highlight">coral</span> reefs are extremely important habitats. Their <span class="highlight">diversity</span> of <span class="highlight">coral</span> genera is greatest in the warm waters of the Indian Ocean and the western <span class="highlight">Pacific</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>Indeed, they have been called the <span class="highlight">marine</span><span class="highlight">version</span> of the <span class="highlight">tropical</span> rain forest, rivaling their <span class="highlight">terrestrial</span> counterparts in both richness of <span class="highlight">species</span> and biological <span class="highlight">productivity</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> They also have <span class="highlight">significance</span> because they provide coastal protection, opportunities for <span class="highlight">recreation</span>, and are <span class="highlight"><span class="question12">potential</span></span> sources of substances like medicinal drugs. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span> At present they are coming under a <span class="highlight">variety</span> of threats, of which two of the most important are dredging and the effects of increased siltation brought about by <span class="highlight">accelerated</span><span class="highlight">erosion</span> from neighboring land areas. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 1, all of the following are needed for the growth of coral reefs EXCEPT</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. a solid base to grow on</p><p>B. exposure to light</p><p>C. the presence of river-borne sediment</p><p>D. ocean temperatures of 21 ï¿½C or higher</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The original Coral reefs are found where the ocean water temperature is not less than 21 ï¿½C, indicating that the temperature can not be lower than 21 ï¿½C, corresponding to option D: 21 ï¿½C or higher, the original where there is a firm substratum, explain the basis must be Solid, corresponding to Option A: a solid base, the original seawater is not rendered too dark, indicating not too dark, corresponding to option B: light.

Darwin recognized that coral reefs achieved success by growing upward from a sinking land platform and becoming an atoll.</p><p>C. Darwin argued that as a coral reef grew up from a sinking island, it would become a fringing reef, then a barrier reef, and finally, with the disappearance of the island, an atoll.</p><p>D. Darwin's theory helped explain the disappearance of a number of islands by showing how coral reef growth caused them to sink below the ocean surface.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The crossed line means that coral reefs grow out of the sinking islands, then turn into skirt reefs, then into barrier reefs, and finally the island disappears into an atoll.

Darwin s theory was thus than a This shows that the Pacific atolls formed with the gradual increase of the earth's crust. This proves that Darwin's theory is correct. Therefore, the Pacific atoll was originally an island reef, corresponding to Option A: they were once fringing reefs around the coasts of islands.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the passage provide the information that the drill holes in the Pacific atolls |passed through more than a thousand meters of coral before reaching the rock substratum of the ocean floor|</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.
