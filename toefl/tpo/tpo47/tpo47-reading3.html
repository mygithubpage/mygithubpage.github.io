          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>An important environment that is more or less totally <span class="underline">restricted</span> to the intertropical <span class="underline">zone</span> is the <span class="underline">coral</span> <span class="underline">reef</span>. <span class="underline">Coral</span> reefs are found where the ocean water <span class="underline">temperature</span> is not less than 21 °C, where there is a <span class="underline">firm</span> substratum, and where the seawater is not rendered too dark by <span class="underline">excessive</span> amounts of river-borne <span class="underline">sediment</span>. They will not grow in very deep water, so a platform <span class="underline">within</span> 30 to 40 meters of the surface is a necessary <span class="underline">prerequisite</span> for their <span class="underline">development</span>. Their <span class="underline">physical</span> structure is dominated by the skeletons of corals, which are <span class="underline">carnivorous</span> animals living off <span class="underline">zooplankton</span>. However, in <span class="underline">addition</span> to corals there are <span class="underline">enormous</span> quantities of <span class="underline">algae</span>, some <span class="underline">calcareous</span>, which help to build the reefs. The size of reefs is <span class="underline">variable</span>. Some atolls are very large-Kwajelein in the Marshall Islands of the South <span class="underline">Pacific</span> is 120 kilometers long and as much as 24 kilometers across-but most are very much smaller, and rise only a few meters above the water. The 2,000-kilometer <span class="underline">complex</span> of reefs known as the Great <span class="underline">Barrier</span> <span class="underline">Reef</span>, which forms a <span class="underline">gigantic</span> natural breakwater off the northeast <span class="underline">coast</span> of Australia, is by far the greatest <span class="underline">coral</span> structure on Earth.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="underline">Coral</span> reefs have fascinated scientists for almost 200 years, and some of the most <span class="underline">pertinent</span> observations of them were made in the 1830s by Charles Darwin on the <span class="underline">voyage</span> of the Beagle. He recognized that there were three <span class="underline">major</span> kinds: fringing reefs, <span class="underline">barrier</span> reefs, and atolls; and he saw that they were related to each other in a <span class="underline">logical</span> and gradational <span class="underline">sequence</span>. A fringing <span class="underline">reef</span> is one that lies close to the <span class="underline">shore</span> of some <span class="underline">continent</span> or island. Its surface forms an <span class="underline">uneven</span> and rather <span class="underline">rough</span> platform around the <span class="underline">coast</span>, about the <span class="underline">level</span> of low water, and its outer <span class="underline">edge</span> slopes downwards into the sea. Between the fringing <span class="underline">reef</span> and the land there is sometimes a small <span class="underline">channel</span> or <span class="underline">lagoon</span>. When the <span class="underline">lagoon</span> is wide and deep and the <span class="underline">reef</span> lies at some distance from the <span class="underline">shore</span> and rises from deep water it is called a <span class="underline">barrier</span> <span class="underline">reef</span>. An <span class="underline">atoll</span> is a <span class="underline">reef</span> in the form of a ring or horseshoe with a <span class="underline">lagoon</span> in the center.</p>
          <p>Darwin s <span class="underline">theory</span> was that the <span class="underline">succession</span> from one <span class="underline">coral</span> <span class="underline">reef</span> type to another could be achieved by the upward growth of <span class="underline">coral</span> from a sinking platform, and that there would be a progression from a fringing <span class="underline">reef</span>, <span class="underline">through</span> the <span class="underline">barrier</span> <span class="underline">reef</span> <span class="underline">stage</span> until, with the disappearance <span class="underline">through</span> subsidence (sinking) of the central island, only a reef-enclosed <span class="underline">lagoon</span> or <span class="underline">atoll</span> would <span class="underline">survive</span>. A long time after Darwin put <span class="underline">forward</span> this <span class="underline">theory</span>, some deep boreholes were drilled in the <span class="underline">Pacific</span> atolls in the 1950s. The <span class="underline">drill</span> holes passed <span class="underline">through</span> more than a thousand meters of <span class="underline">coral</span> before reaching the rock substratum of the ocean floor, and indicated that the <span class="underline">coral</span> had been growing upward for tens of millions of years as Earth's <span class="underline">crust</span> subsided at a <span class="underline">rate</span> of between 15 and 51 meters per million years. Darwin s <span class="underline">theory</span> was <span class="underline">therefore</span> proved basically correct. There are some <span class="underline">submarine</span> islands called guyots and seamounts, in which subsidence <span class="underline">associated</span> with sea-floor spreading has been too speedy for <span class="underline">coral</span> growth to keep up.</p>
          <p>Like mangrove swamps, <span class="underline">coral</span> reefs are extremely important habitats. Their <span class="underline">diversity</span> of <span class="underline">coral</span> genera is greatest in the warm waters of the Indian Ocean and the western <span class="underline">Pacific</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>Indeed, they have been called the <span class="underline">marine</span> <span class="underline">version</span> of the <span class="underline">tropical</span> rain forest, rivaling their <span class="underline">terrestrial</span> counterparts in both richness of <span class="underline">species</span> and biological <span class="underline">productivity</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> They also have <span class="underline">significance</span> because they provide coastal protection, opportunities for <span class="underline">recreation</span>, and are <span class="underline">potential</span> sources of substances like medicinal drugs. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span> At present they are coming under a <span class="underline">variety</span> of threats, of which two of the most important are dredging and the effects of increased siltation brought about by <span class="underline">accelerated</span> <span class="underline">erosion</span> from neighboring land areas. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p>
