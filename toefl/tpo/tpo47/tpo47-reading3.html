They will not grow in very deep water, so a platform <span class="highlight">within</span> 30 to 40 meters of the surface is a necessary <span class="highlight"><span class="question2">prerequisite</span></span>for their <span class="highlight">development</span>. Their <span class="highlight">physical</span> structure is dominated by the skeletons of corals, which are <span class="highlight">carnivorous</span> animals living off <span class="highlight">zooplankton</span>. However, in <span class="highlight">addition</span> to corals there are <span class="highlight">enormous</span> quantities of <span class="highlight">algae</span>, some <span class="highlight">calcareous</span>, which help to build the reefs. The size of reefs is <span class="highlight">variable</span>. Some atolls are very large-Kwajelein in the Marshall Islands of the South <span class="highlight">Pacific</span> is 120 kilometers long and as much as 24 kilometers across-but most are very much smaller, and rise only a few meters above the water. The 2,000-kilometer <span class="highlight"><span class="question4">complex</span></span>of reefs known as the Great <span class="highlight">Barrier</span><span class="highlight">Reef</span>, which forms a <span class="highlight">gigantic</span> natural breakwater off the northeast <span class="highlight">coast</span> of Australia, is by far the greatest <span class="highlight">coral</span> structure on Earth.</p><p><span class="highlight">Coral</span> reefs have fascinated scientists for almost 200 years, and some of the most <span class="highlight"><span class="question6">pertinent</span></span>observations of them were made in the 1830s by Charles Darwin on the <span class="highlight">voyage</span> of the Beagle. He recognized that there were three <span class="highlight">major</span> kinds: fringing reefs, <span class="highlight">barrier</span> reefs, and atolls; and he saw that they were related to each other in a <span class="highlight">logical</span> and gradational <span class="highlight">sequence</span>. A fringing <span class="highlight">reef</span> is one that lies close to the <span class="highlight">shore</span> of some <span class="highlight">continent</span> or island. Its surface forms an <span class="highlight">uneven</span> and rather <span class="highlight">rough</span> platform around the <span class="highlight">coast</span>, about the <span class="highlight">level</span> of low water, and its outer <span class="highlight">edge</span> slopes downwards into the sea. Between the fringing <span class="highlight">reef</span> and the land there is sometimes a small <span class="highlight">channel</span> or <span class="highlight">lagoon</span>. When the <span class="highlight">lagoon</span> is wide and deep and the <span class="highlight">reef</span> lies at some distance from the <span class="highlight">shore</span> and rises from deep water it is called a <span class="highlight">barrier</span><span class="highlight">reef</span>. An <span class="highlight">atoll</span> is a <span class="highlight">reef</span> in the form of a ring or horseshoe with a <span class="highlight">lagoon</span> in the center.</p><p><span class="question8">Darwin s <span class="highlight">theory</span> was that the <span class="highlight">succession</span> from one <span class="highlight">coral</span><span class="highlight">reef</span> type to another could be achieved by the upward growth of <span class="highlight">coral</span> from a sinking platform, and that there would be a progression from a fringing <span class="highlight">reef</span>, <span class="highlight">through</span> the <span class="highlight">barrier</span><span class="highlight">reef</span><span class="highlight">stage</span> until, with the disappearance <span class="highlight">through</span> subsidence (sinking) of the central island, only a reef-enclosed <span class="highlight">lagoon</span> or <span class="highlight">atoll</span> would <span class="highlight">survive</span>. </span>A long time after Darwin put <span class="highlight">forward</span> this <span class="highlight">theory</span>, some deep boreholes were drilled in the <span class="highlight">Pacific</span> atolls in the 1950s. The <span class="highlight">drill</span> holes <span class="question10">passed <span class="highlight">through</span> more than a thousand meters of <span class="highlight">coral</span> before reaching the rock substratum of the ocean floor, </span>and indicated that the <span class="highlight">coral</span> had been growing upward for tens of millions of years as Earth's <span class="highlight">crust</span> subsided at a <span class="highlight">rate</span> of between 15 and 51 meters per million years. Darwin s <span class="highlight">theory</span> was <span class="highlight">therefore</span> proved basically correct. There are some <span class="highlight">submarine</span> islands called guyots and seamounts, in which subsidence <span class="highlight">associated</span> with sea-floor spreading has been too speedy for <span class="highlight">coral</span> growth to keep up.</p><p>Like mangrove swamps, <span class="highlight">coral</span> reefs are extremely important habitats. Their <span class="highlight">diversity</span> of <span class="highlight">coral</span> genera is greatest in the warm waters of the Indian Ocean and the western <span class="highlight">Pacific</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>Indeed, they have been called the <span class="highlight">marine</span><span class="highlight">version</span> of the <span class="highlight">tropical</span> rain forest, rivaling their <span class="highlight">terrestrial</span> counterparts in both richness of <span class="highlight">species</span> and biological <span class="highlight">productivity</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> They also have <span class="highlight">significance</span> because they provide coastal protection, opportunities for <span class="highlight">recreation</span>, and are <span class="highlight"><span class="question12">potential</span></span>sources of substances like medicinal drugs. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span> At present they are coming under a <span class="highlight">variety</span> of threats, of which two of the most important are dredging and the effects of increased siltation brought about by <span class="highlight">accelerated</span><span class="highlight">erosion</span> from neighboring land areas. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p></article></div><div id="question"><div id="question1"><p>According to paragraph 1, all of the following are needed for the growth of coral reefs EXCEPT</p><label class="my-label"><span>A. a solid base to grow on</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><label class="my-label"><span>B. exposure to light</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><label class="my-label"><span>C. the presence of river-borne sediment</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><label class="my-label"><span>D. ocean temperatures of 21 °C or higher</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><p><span>Answer: </span><span class="my-answer">C</span></p></div><div id="question2"><p>the word "<span class="highlight">prerequisite</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p><label class="my-label"><span>A. precaution</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><label class="my-label"><span>B. preparation</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><label class="my-label"><span>C. requirement</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><label class="my-label"><span>D. achievement</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><p><span>Answer: </span><span class="my-answer">C</span></p></div><div id="question3"><p>According to paragraph 1, algae are important because</p><label class="my-label"><span>A. they help build coral reefs</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><label class="my-label"><span>B. they are the dominant type of sea life living on the reefs</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><label class="my-label"><span>C. they compete with coral for zooplankton</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><label class="my-label"><span>D. they are an important source of food available to corals</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><p><span>Answer: </span><span class="my-answer">A</span></p></div><div id="question4"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">complex</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to?</p><label class="my-label"><span>A. extension</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><label class="my-label"><span>B. system</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><label class="my-label"><span>C. region</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><label class="my-label"><span>D. variety</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><p><span>Answer: </span><span class="my-answer">B</span></p></div><div id="question5"><p>According to paragraph 2, how did Charles Darwin contribute to the understanding of coral reefs?</p><label class="my-label"><span>A.
