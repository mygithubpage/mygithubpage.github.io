              <span class="time" data-times="4.99" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator:Listen to a <span class="underline">conversation</span> between a student and a music <span class="underline">director</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="0.86" data-time="4.99">[00:04.99]</span>Student:Miss Harper?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.31" data-time="5.85">[00:05.85]</span>Director:Yes, can I help you?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.14" data-time="7.16">[00:07.16]</span>Student:Hi, my name's Eric Paterson. <span class="time" data-times="1.62" data-time="9.3">[00:09.30]</span>I'm a <span class="underline">journalism</span> Student. <span class="time" data-times="2.13" data-time="10.92">[00:10.92]</span>I <span class="underline">wanted</span> to ask you about the <span class="underline">orchestra</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.62" data-time="13.05">[00:13.05]</span>Director:I'm sorry, Eric. But the <span class="underline">orchestra</span> is only open to music majors.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.08" data-time="16.67">[00:16.67]</span>Student:Really? Well, see-</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.25" data-time="18.75">[00:18.75]</span>Director:But the <span class="underline">policy</span> is changing next year. <span class="time" data-times="4.91" data-time="21">[00:21.00]</span>After that, if you've taken three music courses, you will be able to <span class="underline">audition</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.52" data-time="25.91">[00:25.91]</span>Student:Well, I have taken some music courses and I do play the double bass. <span class="time" data-times="2.27" data-time="30.43">[00:30.43]</span>So, maybe that's something to think about. <span class="time" data-times="2.98" data-time="32.7">[00:32.70]</span>But, actually, I was here about something else.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.42" data-time="35.68">[00:35.68]</span>Director:Oh, sorry. It's I... I get that question all the time. So...</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.82" data-time="39.1">[00:39.10]</span>Student:That's okay. The thing is I work for Magna - the school paper and I am reporting on last week's <span class="underline">concert</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.97" data-time="45.92">[00:45.92]</span>Now I went to it and I really enjoyed it, but now I'm looking for some background knowledge.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.27" data-time="50.89">[00:50.89]</span>Director:Well, I can <span class="underline">refer</span> you to some of the Students in the <span class="underline">orchestra</span> if you'd like a young musician's point of view.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.33" data-time="56.16">[00:56.16]</span>Student:Uh...l guess that might be helpful. <span class="time" data-times="4.39" data-time="58.49">[00:58.49]</span>But...um...l am really looking for a little bit of scholarly prospective.<span class="time" data-times="5.69" data-time="62.88">[01:02.88]</span> Some <span class="underline">history</span> of the music that was performed that evening, where it originated, how it's developed over time.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.18" data-time="68.57">[01:08.57]</span>Director:Well, some of our musicians kind of <span class="underline">specialize</span> in Appalachian music. <span class="time" data-times="2.38" data-time="72.75">[01:12.75]</span>In fact, that's part of the <span class="underline">reason</span> we performed it.<span class="time" data-times="2.24" data-time="75.13">[01:15.13]</span> So you really should talk to them, too. <span class="time" data-times="7.88" data-time="77.37">[01:17.37]</span>Okay, so we were playing Appalachian music from communities in the Appalachian Mountain regions of the United States.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="0.8" data-time="85.25">[01:25.25]</span>Student:All right.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.32" data-time="86.05">[01:26.05]</span>Director:Uh...Do you really think you can keep these all in your head?<span class="time" data-times="3.7" data-time="89.37">[01:29.37]</span>Student:Oh, don't worry. All I need are a few key facts. <span class="time" data-times="2.83" data-time="93.07">[01:33.07]</span>I'm sure I can keep them straight until I get back to my dorm.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.53" data-time="95.9">[01:35.90]</span>Director:So the music is generally based on folk ballads and <span class="underline">instrumental</span> dance tunes. <span class="time" data-times="5.38" data-time="101.43">[01:41.43]</span>It started with Scottish and Irish immigrants who brought over their styles of music. <span class="time" data-times="2.22" data-time="106.81">[01:46.81]</span>It's called Anglo-Celtic.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.01" data-time="109.03">[01:49.03]</span>Student:So, people brought their <span class="underline">musical</span> traditions with them.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.44" data-time="112.04">[01:52.04]</span>Director:Well, this Anglo-Celtic music was considered an important link to the past for these people, which you can see in the way that Appalachian singers sing ballads. <span class="time" data-times="4.05" data-time="120.48">[02:00.48]</span>They have <span class="underline">sort</span> of a nasal <span class="underline">quality</span> to them, like in Celtic ballads. <span class="time" data-times="7.83" data-time="124.53">[02:04.53]</span>In their new land, some of the lyrics were updated, you know, to <span class="underline">refer</span> the new locations and the occupations that settlers had in America. <span class="time" data-times="8.94" data-time="132.36">[02:12.36]</span>But at the same time, lots of ballads were still about castles and royalty, lords and ladies, <span class="underline">stuff</span> like that, which is what they were about originally.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.65" data-time="141.3">[02:21.30]</span>Student:Okay. And was that some <span class="underline">sort</span> of banjo I saw on <span class="underline">stage</span> during the performance?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.47" data-time="145.95">[02:25.95]</span>Director:Yes, we are lucky that one of our Student:s, Stewart Telford, has a nineteenth-century banjo, a real <span class="underline">antique</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.03" data-time="152.42">[02:32.42]</span>He's able to play in most of the <span class="underline">traditional</span> styles.<span class="time" data-times="7.8" data-time="155.45">[02:35.45]</span>Did you know that banjos are of African-American <span class="underline">origin</span> and that settlers in Appalachia adopted banjos for their folk music? <span class="time" data-times="4.74" data-time="163.25">[02:43.25]</span>They became very <span class="underline">common</span> in <span class="underline">traditional</span> Appalachian music <span class="underline">along</span> with guitars and violins, of <span class="underline">course</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.14" data-time="167.99">[02:47.99]</span>But if you want to learn about that banjo, talk to Stewart.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.51" data-time="171.13">[02:51.13]</span>Student:That's great, Miss Harper. Thanks a lot. <span class="time" data-times="3.82" data-time="173.64">[02:53.64]</span>Now, can you <span class="underline">recommend</span> any sources where I could look up more about this?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.63" data-time="177.46">[02:57.46]</span>Director:Sure, I have a great book. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="179.09">[02:59.09]</span>A Student: has it today, but you can borrow it tomorrow if you'd like.</p>
