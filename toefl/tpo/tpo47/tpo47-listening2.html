            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.79" data-time="4.02">[00:04.02]</span>Professor:So, um, in France, you have the French <span class="highlight">Academy</span>, which was created to uphold standards of <span class="highlight">literary</span> <span class="highlight">taste</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.43" data-time="10.81">[00:10.81]</span>It was a very <span class="highlight">conservative</span> <span class="highlight">organization</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.5" data-time="13.24">[00:13.24]</span>It tried to keep things a certain way...uh...<span class="highlight">resist</span> change. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.41" data-time="17.74">[00:17.74]</span>It dictated that French plays should <span class="highlight">neoclassical</span> in form, you know, have five acts, <span class="highlight">sophisticated</span> language, etc. <span class="time" data-times="3.92" data-time="26.15">[00:26.15]</span>But try as it might, it couldn't stop change. <span class="time" data-times="9.4" data-time="30.07">[00:30.07]</span>French drama was changing, though the <span class="highlight">transition</span> from <span class="highlight">neoclassical</span> drama to <span class="highlight">Romantic</span> drama was itself <span class="highlight">pretty</span> <span class="highlight">dramatic</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.84" data-time="39.47">[00:39.47]</span>Let's look at a play by Victor Hugo called Hernani, or as the French would say, Hernani. <span class="time" data-times="11.02" data-time="47.31">[00:47.31]</span>Although Hugo was a truly <span class="highlight">brilliant</span> writer of essays, poems, novels, and plays, uh, his play, Hernani, isn't a great play in and of itself. <span class="time" data-times="4.34" data-time="58.33">[00:58.33]</span>It's got a really confusing, convoluted storyline. <span class="time" data-times="10.5" data-time="62.67">[01:02.67]</span>Critics back then were unimpressed by it, though it's likely that their own feelings about how plays should be, <span class="highlight">neoclassical</span> or <span class="highlight">romantic</span>, affected their opinions about it. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.48" data-time="73.17">[01:13.17]</span>But its premiere in Paris, in 1830, was anything but ordinary. <span class="time" data-times="7.94" data-time="79.65">[01:19.65]</span>Hernani's opening night was probably one of the most important <span class="highlight">literary</span> events in 19th <span class="highlight">century</span> France! </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.54" data-time="87.59">[01:27.59]</span>What happened was...OK. Hugo was a Romanticist, right? <span class="time" data-times="10.14" data-time="92.13">[01:32.13]</span>He was part of a growing movement of young authors and artists who were rebelling against <span class="highlight">neoclassicism</span>, against the conventions of <span class="highlight">neoclassicism</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9.56" data-time="102.27">[01:42.27]</span>And what this meant is that Hugo <span class="highlight">opposed</span> the <span class="highlight">neoclassical</span> unities that French theater had <span class="highlight">inherited</span> from Greek drama. <span class="time" data-times="6.79" data-time="111.83">[01:51.83]</span>These unities were basically the <span class="highlight">unity</span> of time, <span class="highlight">space</span> and <span class="highlight">action</span>, <span class="time" data-times="10.82" data-time="118.62">[01:58.62]</span>meaning that the entire play consisted of just one main event that was unfolding in just one <span class="highlight">specific</span> place, usually in the <span class="highlight">course</span> of one day. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.99" data-time="129.44">[02:09.44]</span>And Hugo found this to be too constraining. He looked for inspiration in...well...OK. <span class="time" data-times="8.8" data-time="137.43">[02:17.43]</span>Hugo is from the 19th <span class="highlight">century</span>, but he looked to Shakespeare, several centuries in the past, long before <span class="highlight">neoclassicism</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.12" data-time="146.23">[02:26.23]</span>For example, in Shakespeare's play, A Midsummer Night's Dream, the play moves from indoors to outdoors, from the city to the forest, and back again. <span class="time" data-times="3.86" data-time="156.35">[02:36.35]</span>So there was a kind of <span class="highlight">mobility</span> in...in the use of <span class="highlight">space</span>. <span class="time" data-times="12.72" data-time="160.21">[02:40.21]</span>And...well...in A Midsummer Night's Dream, of <span class="highlight">course</span> the <span class="highlight">action</span> in that play takes place on a single summer's night, but in Shakespeare's other plays, in Hamlet, for example, time elapses. <span class="time" data-times="3.21" data-time="172.93">[02:52.93]</span>People travel; they go to other destinations. <span class="time" data-times="3.61" data-time="176.14">[02:56.14]</span>And the <span class="highlight">action</span> is not limited to one <span class="highlight">plot</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.46" data-time="179.75">[02:59.75]</span>Hugo also <span class="highlight">opposed</span> the <span class="highlight">neoclassical</span> <span class="highlight">insistence</span> on the separation of genres. <span class="time" data-times="8.31" data-time="185.21">[03:05.21]</span>For a neoclassicist, a play could only be <span class="highlight">dramatic</span> and high art, or <span class="highlight">comic</span>, well, light-hearted. <span class="time" data-times="4.07" data-time="193.52">[03:13.52]</span>And in either case, there was still a <span class="highlight">sense</span> of decorum. <span class="time" data-times="7.99" data-time="197.59">[03:17.59]</span>Characters might make jokes and get into silly situations, but they're still <span class="highlight">regular</span> people, like not in <span class="highlight">disguise</span> or anything. <span class="time" data-times="5.12" data-time="205.58">[03:25.58]</span>There's still a certain <span class="highlight">amount</span> of <span class="highlight">restraint</span> in a <span class="highlight">neoclassical</span> <span class="highlight">comedy</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.96" data-time="210.7">[03:30.70]</span>Again, earlier works by Shakespeare provided very different models that Hugo found more <span class="highlight">appealing</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.3" data-time="217.66">[03:37.66]</span>Many of Shakespeare's plays, <span class="highlight">even</span> the tragedies, <span class="highlight">contain</span> scenes with <span class="highlight">ridiculous</span>, <span class="highlight">outlandish</span> characters like clowns, <span class="time" data-times="10.71" data-time="225.96">[03:45.96]</span>so that many of the plays have both qualities: a serious <span class="highlight">dramatic</span> side and comedic scenes with the clowns that <span class="highlight">break</span> the drama. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.64" data-time="236.67">[03:56.67]</span>And Hugo, like other Romantics, was also <span class="highlight">opposed</span> to the <span class="highlight">artistic</span> rules that the neoclassicists had <span class="highlight">inherited</span> from the <span class="highlight">Enlightenment</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9.4" data-time="246.31">[04:06.31]</span>The Romantics <span class="highlight">wanted</span> a more passionate kind of theater and it was more rooted in the <span class="highlight">individual</span> and the <span class="highlight">individual</span> sensibility. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.88" data-time="255.71">[04:15.71]</span>Romanticism was <span class="highlight">political</span> as well, claiming that individuals, people, could <span class="highlight">govern</span> themselves, without the need for kings and queens. <span class="time" data-times="8.62" data-time="265.59">[04:25.59]</span>There was an <span class="highlight">ideological</span> struggle between a lot of young people, artists, people who <span class="highlight">wanted</span> change, and people who didn't. <span class="time" data-times="3.71" data-time="274.21">[04:34.21]</span>So of <span class="highlight">course</span> Romanticism was <span class="highlight">controversial</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.06" data-time="277.92">[04:37.92]</span>Now, Hernani was a play that incorporated these <span class="highlight">Romantic</span> conventions. <span class="time" data-times="7" data-time="283.98">[04:43.98]</span>Hugo suspected that <span class="highlight">neoclassical</span> audiences would be <span class="highlight">hostile</span> to this new form and the ideas it represented. <span class="time" data-times="8.8" data-time="290.98">[04:50.98]</span>So to protect himself, he rounded up his friends for opening night. And hundreds of them came to the theater that night. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="13.74" data-time="299.78">[04:59.78]</span>And Hugo writes about this arrival of the Romantics, these wild and bizarre characters and their <span class="highlight">outlandish</span> customs, which stupefied and infuriated the more <span class="highlight">conventional</span> theater-goers. <span class="time" data-times="16.48" data-time="313.52">[05:13.52]</span>So the play that night took forever to finish because it was interrupted many times and there were these debates in the <span class="highlight">audience</span>, between Hugo's friends and supporters, the Romantics, and the Neoclassicists, the supporters of the old school. <span class="time" data-times="1.95" data-time="330">[05:30.00]</span>Lots of interruptions! </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.41" data-time="331.95">[05:31.95]</span>And afterward, what had been a <span class="highlight">debate</span> inside the theater spilled out onto the street and there were fist fights. <span class="time" data-times="2.43" data-time="338.36">[05:38.36]</span>It was a complete free-for-all. <span class="time" data-times="4.13" data-time="340.79">[05:40.79]</span>And this went on for the next forty-five nights. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="344.92">[05:44.92]</span>Every night that the play was performed, there was this excitement and <span class="highlight">controversy</span> that was, was really an expression of the kinds of passions that...uh...differences of <span class="highlight">aesthetics</span> and <span class="highlight">political</span> opinions and <span class="highlight">taste</span> could give rise to. </p>
