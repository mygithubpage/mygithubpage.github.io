Bicycle? Automobile? Train? Explain why you enjoy it.</p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>I like to travel by bicycle most among the three transportation forms. One reason is to protect the environment because the practice can save fossil fuels and release no carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Another reason is to have more exercises since riding bicycles forms strong muscles in one's legs, which provides a valuable opportunity for stressful and sedentary office gentlemen and ladies to escape and breathe in the fresh air.</p></article></div></main></body></html>
