            <span class="time" data-times="4.7" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in a sports <span class="highlight">management</span> class.<span class="time" data-times="7.42" data-time="4.7">[00:04.70]</span>Professor:So, I want to end today with a topic that many of you have questions about when you come to see me during my office hours. <span class="time" data-times="5.38" data-time="12.12">[00:12.12]</span>A lot of you have told me you are <span class="highlight">specifically</span> interested in careers as coaches.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.5" data-time="17.5">[00:17.50]</span>Now, it doesn't matter what sport you are interested in coaching, volleyball, basketball, swimming...<span class="time" data-times="5.39" data-time="24">[00:24.00]</span>There are some considerations for all new coaches to think about as they plan their careers.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.32" data-time="29.39">[00:29.39]</span>A recent study, a <span class="highlight">survey</span> of high school head coaches, helped <span class="highlight">identify</span> some obstacles, <span class="time" data-times="5.75" data-time="35.71">[00:35.71]</span>some things that head coaches felt they were not prepared for as they began their careers. <span class="time" data-times="7.83" data-time="41.46">[00:41.46]</span>They were surveyed to <span class="highlight">determine</span> what things they would do differently if they were starting their careers over again. <span class="time" data-times="4.5" data-time="49.29">[00:49.29]</span>Based on their responses, several themes emerged.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6" data-time="53.79">[00:53.79]</span>The largest number of responses was in the area of relationships. <span class="time" data-times="10.03" data-time="59.79">[00:59.79]</span>79% of the coaches indicated that if they had to do it all over again, they would do things differently in this area. <span class="time" data-times="13.43" data-time="69.82">[01:09.82]</span>They said they'd <span class="highlight">deal</span> differently with <span class="highlight">assistant</span> coaches, parents, student athletes, school <span class="highlight">administration</span>, and, and <span class="highlight">pay</span> more <span class="highlight">attention</span> to those relationships.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="8.2" data-time="83.25">[01:23.25]</span>The <span class="highlight">second</span> most <span class="highlight">critical</span> area for these coaches was <span class="highlight">organization</span> and <span class="highlight">administration</span>. <span class="time" data-times="11.29" data-time="91.45">[01:31.45]</span>To them, this meant things like better managing their budgets, and delegating responsibilities, making sure that <span class="highlight">even</span> <span class="highlight">minor</span> things were taken <span class="highlight">care</span> of, <span class="time" data-times="4.32" data-time="102.74">[01:42.74]</span>like pre-game meals, those <span class="highlight">sort</span> of things.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.99" data-time="107.06">[01:47.06]</span>Student:Excuse me, professor, I know good <span class="highlight">nutrition</span> is important,<span class="time" data-times="6.21" data-time="111.05">[01:51.05]</span> but organizing pre-game meals isn't really something you <span class="highlight">consider</span> when you are thinking about going into coaching as a <span class="highlight">career</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.64" data-time="117.26">[01:57.26]</span>Professor:No, I guess not, Kenny, but it's more an example of paying <span class="highlight">attention</span> to the details, being organized.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.79" data-time="123.9">[02:03.90]</span>I do want to <span class="highlight">emphasize</span> that the <span class="highlight">profession</span> of coaching is about more than just wins and losses. <span class="time" data-times="12.41" data-time="130.69">[02:10.69]</span>In fact, winning is probably stressed too much. At its best, I'd say coaching, especially in high school and college, is about teaching life skills <span class="highlight">through</span> game <span class="highlight">strategy</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.28" data-time="143.1">[02:23.10]</span>Of <span class="highlight">course</span>, coaching requires a <span class="highlight">specialized</span> body of knowledge. <span class="time" data-times="2.62" data-time="147.38">[02:27.38]</span>If you coach tennis, you need to know the rules of tennis. <span class="time" data-times="4.38" data-time="150">[02:30.00]</span>If you are a football coach, you need to know all about football strategies. <span class="time" data-times="5.49" data-time="154.38">[02:34.38]</span>And those are the sorts of things that you'll get in your classes here at the university. <span class="time" data-times="9.77" data-time="159.87">[02:39.87]</span>But if coaches spend too much of their time on game <span class="highlight">strategy</span>, well, you see, maybe that's secondary too, to the knowledge and skills, <span class="time" data-times="11.23" data-time="169.64">[02:49.64]</span>you'll need for the other roles you'll <span class="highlight">undertake</span> as a coach, especially, as that <span class="highlight">survey</span> emphasized, skills in dealing with people, and, and <span class="highlight">administration</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="8.07" data-time="180.87">[03:00.87]</span>Student:But, how do you... how do you <span class="highlight">improve</span> in those areas, I mean, I'm <span class="highlight">gonna</span> be an <span class="highlight">assistant</span> coach at a high school beginning next month, and ...</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.15" data-time="188.94">[03:08.94]</span>Girl:Really? Nice going, Kenny!</p>

            <span class="time" data-times="2.61" data-time="191.09">[03:11.09]</span>Professor:Yes, that's wonderful!</p>

            <span class="time" data-times="1.77" data-time="193.7">[03:13.70]</span>Student:Thanks. I'm excited.</p>

            <span class="time" data-times="6.56" data-time="195.47">[03:15.47]</span>Professor:So, congratulations! Ok, well, to get better organized, <span class="time" data-times="7.92" data-time="202.03">[03:22.03]</span>one thing is take courses in business <span class="highlight">management</span> and not just the sports <span class="highlight">management</span> courses in the <span class="highlight">physical</span> education <span class="highlight">department</span>, <span class="time" data-times="2.97" data-time="209.95">[03:29.95]</span>other business and <span class="highlight">finance</span> courses. <span class="time" data-times="2.38" data-time="212.92">[03:32.92]</span>Oh, oh, but wait a <span class="highlight">minute</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.22" data-time="215.3">[03:35.30]</span>You said you are starting next month? <span class="time" data-times="2.06" data-time="217.52">[03:37.52]</span>What sport will you be coaching?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.36" data-time="219.58">[03:39.58]</span>Student:Uh, gymnastics, mainly.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="11.59" data-time="221.94">[03:41.94]</span>Professor:Okay, in my <span class="highlight">career</span>, I've learned, well, as part of building and maintaining strong relationships and working on administrative skills, <span class="time" data-times="5.6" data-time="233.53">[03:53.53]</span>you've got to <span class="highlight">consider</span> the other needs of your team beyond the sport itself.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="13.81" data-time="239.13">[03:59.13]</span>Remember, the team members are athletes and students, and remember, if you are enthusiastic about what you are doing, well, <span class="highlight">enthusiasm</span> is...is catching, right? <span class="time" data-times="3.35" data-time="252.94">[04:12.94]</span>You want team members to enjoy participating,</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="7.29" data-time="256.29">[04:16.29]</span>Student:Right, but what about <span class="highlight">setting</span> rules for your team, and, is it better to be <span class="highlight">strict</span> or not so <span class="highlight">strict</span>?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.55" data-time="263.58">[04:23.58]</span>Professor:Actually, I don't believe in having a lot of rules. <span class="time" data-times="3" data-time="267.13">[04:27.13]</span>And coaches often do have too many.<span class="time" data-times="4.52" data-time="270.13">[04:30.13]</span> I think that can get in the way of leadership and box you in. <span class="time" data-times="6.14" data-time="274.65">[04:34.65]</span>I think people sometimes set rules just to make things easier for themselves. <span class="time" data-times="6.11" data-time="280.79">[04:40.79]</span>That way maybe later they just can <span class="highlight">refer</span> to the rule and <span class="highlight">avoid</span> making a choice. <span class="time" data-times="2.88" data-time="286.9">[04:46.90]</span>You know that kind of person I'm talking about, right?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.19" data-time="289.78">[04:49.78]</span>But that's not to say the team shouldn't have any rules at all. Of <span class="highlight">course</span> they need some. <span class="time" data-times="10.24" data-time="295.97">[04:55.97]</span>So early in a <span class="highlight">season</span>, or when you first take a new job, <span class="highlight">establish</span> a few <span class="highlight">basic</span> ground rules for what is <span class="highlight">acceptable</span> and non-acceptable <span class="highlight">behavior</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.82" data-time="306.21">[05:06.21]</span>Girl:So, what are some good ones?</p>

            <span class="time" data-times="13.32" data-time="309.03">[05:09.03]</span>Professor:Well, a...a <span class="highlight">couple</span> rules a coach should have are: <span class="highlight">insist</span> that players be on time, and <span class="highlight">insist</span> that they practice hard, and give their best effort. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="322.35">[05:22.35]</span>And when you do <span class="highlight">establish</span> a rule, <span class="highlight">stick</span> to it.</p>
