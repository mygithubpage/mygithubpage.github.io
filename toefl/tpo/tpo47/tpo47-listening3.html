Long-distance seasonal migration of seabirds</p><p>B. Two major ways that seabirds navigate</p><p>C. A seabird that flies far in search of food</p><p>D. Reasons why seabirds often live on islands</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Listening articles first introduced that albatross is a bird that flies every day to go for food, and then introduces two factors in which their pups can survive. Then they introduce two possible ways of navigation. Finally, they emphasize that this bird is foraging. Flying a thousand miles of feat, corresponding to option C: A seabird that flies far in search of food.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor, what influences an albatross's choice of an island for nesting?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Air currents near the island</p><p>B. Availability of food on the island</p><p>C. Predators inhabiting the island</p><p>D. The number of albatross already nesting on the island</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>From 01:35 onwards, the teacher said: And second, they can't always nest on an island that's closest to the best feeding ground because because it means the answer is coming. The teacher then said: some of those islands have too many predators On them, indicating that such birds will consider predators when nesting, corresponding to option C: Predators....</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor, what helps albatross chicks survive despite the fact that their parents have to fly such long distances to find food? Click on 2 answers.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Albatross raise only one chick at a time.</p><p>B. Albatross forage only for foods that are exceptionally rich in nutrients.</p><p>C. Albatross store large quantities of food in the nest.</p><p>D. Albatross chicks are adapted to tolerate long intervals without food.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="AD"><p>Beginning at 01:03, the students said: Aren't the chicks gonna be pretty hungry most of the time, which means that the answers will appear later. The teacher then said: The chicks are capable of going for long periods of time without food. This type of bird will consider predators when building a nest, corresponding to option D: Albatross chicks...tolerate...without food.</p><p>From 02:10, the teacher continued: Another factor is albatross lay only one egg at a time. So when the parent returns with the food that one chick doesn't have to share it with a lot of other chicks. Birds raise only one bird at a time, corresponding to Option A: Albatross raise only one chick at a time.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor imply about theories that explain how albatross navigate?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They are based on studies of seabirds in captivity.</p><p>B. They are based on observation of albatross in the wild.</p><p>C. They are guesses that are not based on any evidence about birds.</p><p>D. They have not been confirmed by studies of albatross themselves.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>Beginning at 02:33, the students said: I mean, which direction to take to get to the food and how do they find their way back home, means that the answer will come soon. The teacher said: Good point. And the truth Is we are not sure.... So we're thinking that albatross could make make use of two different kinds of compasses..., stating that the two theories that apply to songbirds have not yet been confirmed on seabirds, corresponding to option D: Have not been confirmed by studies of albatross themselves.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor, why do some biologists doubt that magnetite helps birds navigate?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Its magnetic properties are quite weak.</p><p>B. It is found in young birds that cannot fly yet.</p><p>C. It is found in all albatross species.</p><p>D. It is in birds that do not migrate.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>From 03:06 onwards, the teacher said: The magnetic compass somehow makes use of Earth's magnetic field... But the problem is that, which means that the answer will come soon. The teacher continues: we've also found magnetite in non-migratory. The birds, which suggests that it may in fact serve a completely different function, not related to navigation at all, states that the problem of magnetic field theory is that there is also magnetite in the birds that do not migrate, corresponding to option D: It is in birds that Do not migrate.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor say this:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To emphasize how wasteful the albatross behavior is</p><p>B. To encourage students to reflect on how impressive the albatross behavior is</p><p>C. To signal that she is about to introduce a new topic</p><p>D. To find out whether the students have understood her explanations</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>From 04:00, the teacher said: So anyway, you know, think about it, how about if you had to go a a thousand miles every time you wanted to get a bite to eat, using an analogy approach to emphasize the albatross to foraging The long-range flying feat corresponds to Option B: To encourage students...how impressive the albatross behavior is.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
