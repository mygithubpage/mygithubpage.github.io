Yes, Bob? </p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.18" data-time="49.42">[00:49.42]</span>Student:But why don't they just build their <span class="highlight">nest</span> closer to their food <span class="highlight">supply</span>? <span class="time" data-times="9.14" data-time="54.6">[00:54.60]</span>I mean, for one thing, they must burn up a lot of energy flying back and forth and also the parents are <span class="highlight">gonna</span> have to be away from the <span class="highlight">nest</span> that much. <span class="time" data-times="2.74" data-time="63.74">[01:03.74]</span>Aren't the chicks <span class="highlight">gonna</span> be <span class="highlight">pretty</span> hungry most of the time? </p><p><span class="time" data-times="1.73" data-time="66.48">[01:06.48]</span>Professor:Ok, good question. <span class="time" data-times="4.52" data-time="68.21">[01:08.21]</span>The chicks are <span class="highlight">capable</span> of going for long periods of time without food, <span class="time" data-times="5.38" data-time="72.73">[01:12.73]</span>which works out nicely since as you point out, they may not get to eat that often. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.99" data-time="78.11">[01:18.11]</span>As far as the parents go, well, first, they typically can't get enough food in a single location. <span class="time" data-times="4.39" data-time="86.1">[01:26.10]</span>So they have to visit several places on the same foraging <span class="highlight">trip</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.07" data-time="90.49">[01:30.49]</span>And the locations of good foraging grounds <span class="highlight">tend</span> to be very far apart. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="9.19" data-time="95.56">[01:35.56]</span>And <span class="highlight">second</span>, they can't always <span class="highlight">nest</span> on an island that's closest to the best feeding ground because some of those islands have too many predators on them. <span class="time" data-times="3.95" data-time="104.75">[01:44.75]</span>Predators that would just love some little chicks to <span class="highlight">snack</span> on. <span class="time" data-times="3.23" data-time="108.7">[01:48.70]</span>So I don't think they have much choice. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.14" data-time="111.93">[01:51.93]</span>But it still works out because albatross fly using a <span class="highlight">technique</span> called <span class="highlight">dynamic</span> soaring, <span class="time" data-times="5.57" data-time="118.07">[01:58.07]</span>which enables them to cover very long distances while expending very little energy. <span class="time" data-times="2.48" data-time="123.64">[02:03.64]</span>If it weren't for that, you'd be right. <span class="time" data-times="4.07" data-time="126.12">[02:06.12]</span>They would probably burn up all their energy just flying back and forth. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.29" data-time="130.19">[02:10.19]</span>Another <span class="highlight">factor</span> is albatross <span class="highlight">lay</span> only one egg at a time. <span class="time" data-times="7.84" data-time="134.48">[02:14.48]</span>So when the parent returns with the food that one chick doesn't have to share it with a lot of other chicks.Yes, Nancy? </p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.84" data-time="142.32">[02:22.32]</span>Student:So you're saying that they might easily fly a thousand miles over the open ocean when they're looking for food? </p><p><span class="time" data-times="1.04" data-time="149.16">[02:29.16]</span>Professor:That's right. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.77" data-time="150.2">[02:30.20]</span>Student:Then how do they know how to get to the food? <span class="time" data-times="5.12" data-time="152.97">[02:32.97]</span>I mean, which direction to take to get to the food and how do they find their way back home? </p><p><span class="time" data-times="8.83" data-time="158.09">[02:38.09]</span>Professor:Good point. And the truth is we are not sure. It's very difficult to keep seabirds in <span class="highlight">captivity</span> where you can study them. <span class="time" data-times="3.29" data-time="166.92">[02:46.92]</span>And it's very difficult to study them in the wild, you know. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.59" data-time="170.21">[02:50.21]</span>But we think that a lot of what we've learnt about songbirds probably applies to seabirds as well. <span class="time" data-times="10.03" data-time="176.8">[02:56.80]</span>So we're thinking that albatross could make use of two different kinds of compasses if you will, a <span class="highlight">magnetic</span><span class="highlight">compass</span> and a <span class="highlight">celestial</span><span class="highlight">compass</span>. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.58" data-time="186.83">[03:06.83]</span>The <span class="highlight">magnetic</span><span class="highlight">compass</span> somehow makes use of Earth's <span class="highlight">magnetic</span><span class="highlight">field</span>, much the way a <span class="highlight">standard</span><span class="highlight">compass</span> does.<span class="time" data-times="8.1" data-time="193.41">[03:13.41]</span> But to prove this, we would have to find some kind of <span class="highlight">magnetic</span><span class="highlight">sensory</span> organ in birds. And we are not sure that we have.<span class="time" data-times="10.76" data-time="201.51">[03:21.51]</span> We have found in birds a <span class="highlight">mineral</span> called <span class="highlight">magnetite</span>, which we think might be somehow related to this, because <span class="highlight">magnetite</span> is a natural <span class="highlight">magnet</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9.3" data-time="212.27">[03:32.27]</span>But the problem is that we've also found <span class="highlight">magnetite</span> in non-migratory birds, which suggests that it may in fact serve a completely different <span class="highlight">function</span>, <span class="time" data-times="2.3" data-time="221.57">[03:41.57]</span>not related to <span class="highlight">navigation</span> at all. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="11.62" data-time="223.87">[03:43.87]</span>Um, and the other <span class="highlight">compass</span>, the <span class="highlight">celestial</span><span class="highlight">compass</span> makes use of the stars, more or less the same way humans have historically used the stars to <span class="highlight">navigate</span> in the open sea. <span class="time" data-times="3.99" data-time="235.49">[03:55.49]</span>So that's the way we think albatross <span class="highlight">navigate</span>. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="8.66" data-time="239.48">[03:59.48]</span>So anyway, you know, think about it, how about if you had to go a thousand miles every time you <span class="highlight">wanted</span> to get a bite to eat? </p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.07" data-time="248.14">[04:08.14]</span>Student:Yeah, and we <span class="highlight">complain</span> about having to walk all the way <span class="highlight">across</span><span class="highlight">campus</span> to get to the <span class="highlight">cafeteria</span>. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="253.21">[04:13.21]</span>Professor:Yeah. </p></p></article></section><div id="question"><div id="question1"><p>What does the professor mainly discuss?</p><label class="my-label"><span>A.
