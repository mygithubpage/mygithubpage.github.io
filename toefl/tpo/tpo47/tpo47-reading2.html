          <h4 class="w3-center">Termite Ingenuity</h4>
          <p>Termites, social insects which live in colonies that, in some <span class="highlight">species</span>, <span class="highlight">contain</span> 2 million individuals or more, are often incorrectly referred to as <span class="question1">white ants</span> But they are certainly not ants. Termites, unlike ants, have <span class="highlight">gradual</span> metamorphosis with only three life stage: egg, nymph, and adult. Ants and the other social members of their order, certain bees and wasps, have complete metamorphosis in four life stages; egg, <span class="highlight">larva</span>, pupa, and adult. The worker and soldier castes of social ants, bees, and wasps <span class="highlight">consist</span> of only females, all daughters of a single queen that mated soon after she matured and thereafter never mated again. The worker and soldier castes of termites <span class="highlight">consist</span> of both males and females, and the queen lives permanently with a <span class="highlight">male</span> <span class="highlight">consort</span>.</p>
          <p>Since termites are small and soft-bodied, they easily become desiccated and must live in <span class="highlight">moist</span> places with a high <span class="highlight">relative</span> <span class="highlight">humidity</span>. They do best when the <span class="highlight">relative</span> <span class="highlight">humidity</span> in their <span class="highlight">nest</span> is above 96 percent and the <span class="highlight">temperature</span> is <span class="highlight">fairly</span> high, an optimum of about 79°F for <span class="highlight">temperate</span> <span class="highlight">zone</span> <span class="highlight">species</span> and about 86°F for <span class="highlight">tropical</span> <span class="highlight">species</span>. <span class="highlight">Subterranean</span> termites, the <span class="highlight">destructive</span> <span class="highlight">species</span> that occurs commonly <span class="highlight">throughout</span> the eastern United States, <span class="highlight"><span class="question4">attain</span></span> these conditions by nesting in <span class="highlight">moist</span> soil that is in <span class="highlight">contact</span> with wood, their only food. The surrounding soil keeps the <span class="highlight">nest</span> <span class="highlight">moist</span> and tends to keep the <span class="highlight">temperature</span> at a more or less <span class="highlight">favorable</span> <span class="highlight">level</span>. When it is cold in winter, <span class="highlight">subterranean</span> termites move to burrows below the <span class="highlight">frost</span> <span class="highlight">line</span>.</p>
          <p>Some <span class="highlight">tropical</span> termites are more <span class="highlight"><span class="question5">ingenious</span></span> engineers, constructing huge above-ground nests with built-in "<span class="highlight">air</span> conditioning" that keeps the <span class="highlight">nest</span> <span class="highlight">moist</span>, at a <span class="highlight">constant</span> <span class="highlight">temperature</span>, and well supplied with <span class="highlight">oxygen</span>. Among the most architecturally <span class="highlight">advanced</span> of these termites is an African <span class="highlight">species</span>, Macrotermes natalensis. <span class="question6">Renowned</span> Swiss <span class="highlight">entomologist</span> Martin Luscher described the mounds of this fungus-growing <span class="highlight">species</span> as being as much as 16 feet tall, 16 feet in <span class="highlight">diameter</span> at their <span class="highlight">base</span>, and with a cement-like wall of soil mixed with <span class="highlight">termite</span> <span class="highlight">saliva</span> that is from 16 to 23 inches thick. The thick and <span class="question1">dense</span> wall of the <span class="highlight">mound</span> insulates the <span class="highlight">interior</span> microclimate from the variations in <span class="highlight">humidity</span> and <span class="highlight">temperature</span> of the outside <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span>. Several narrow and <span class="highlight">relatively</span> thin-walled ridges on the outside of the <span class="highlight">mound</span> <span class="highlight">extend</span> from near its <span class="highlight">base</span> almost to its top.</p>
          <p>According to Luscher, a medium-sized <span class="highlight">nest</span> of Macrotermes has a <span class="highlight">population</span> of about 2 million individuals. The <span class="highlight">metabolism</span> of so many termites and of the <span class="highlight">fungus</span> that they grow in their gardens as food helps keep the <span class="highlight">interior</span> of the <span class="highlight">nest</span> warm and supplies some <span class="highlight">moisture</span> to the <span class="highlight">air</span> in the <span class="highlight">nest</span>. The termites <span class="highlight">saturate</span> the <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span> of the <span class="highlight">nest</span>, bringing it to about 100 percent <span class="highlight">relative</span> <span class="highlight">humidity</span>, by carrying water up from the soil.</p>
          <p>But how is this well-insulated <span class="highlight">nest</span> ventilated? Its many occupants <span class="highlight">require</span> over 250 quarts of <span class="highlight">oxygen</span> (more than 1,200 quarts of <span class="highlight">air</span>) per day. How can so much <span class="highlight">oxygen</span> <span class="highlight">diffuse</span> <span class="highlight">through</span> the thick walls of the <span class="highlight">mound</span>? <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> <span class="highlight">Even</span> the pores in the wall are filled with water, which almost stops the <span class="highlight">diffusion</span> of gases. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> The answer lies in the <span class="highlight">construction</span> of the <span class="highlight">nest</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span> The <span class="highlight">interior</span> consists of a large central <span class="highlight">core</span> in which the <span class="highlight">fungus</span> is grown, below it is "cellar" of empty <span class="highlight">space</span>, above it is an "attic" of empty <span class="highlight">space</span>, and <span class="highlight">within</span> the ridges on the outer wall of the <span class="highlight">nest</span>, there are many small tunnels that connect the cellar and the attic. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>The warm <span class="highlight">air</span> in the <span class="highlight">fungus</span> gardens rises <span class="highlight">through</span> the <span class="highlight">nest</span> up to the attic. From the attic, the <span class="highlight">air</span> passes into the tunnels in the ridges and flows back down to the cellar. Gases, mainly <span class="highlight">oxygen</span> coming in and <span class="highlight">carbon</span> <span class="highlight">dioxide</span> going out, easily <span class="highlight">diffuse</span> into or out of the ridges, since their walls are thin and their surface area is large because they protrude far out from the wall of the <span class="highlight">mound</span>. Thus <span class="highlight">air</span> that flows down into the cellar <span class="highlight">through</span> the ridges is <span class="highlight">relatively</span> rich in <span class="highlight">oxygen</span>, and has lost much of its <span class="highlight">carbon</span> <span class="highlight">dioxide</span>. It supplies the <span class="highlight">nest</span>'s inhabitants with fresh <span class="highlight">oxygen</span> as it rises <span class="highlight">through</span> the fungus-growing area back up to the attic.</p>
