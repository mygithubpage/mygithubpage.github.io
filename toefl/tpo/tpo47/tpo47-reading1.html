Cultural influences were of three types: the bringing of objects, the <span class="highlight">transfer</span> of <span class="highlight">craft</span> workers, and the <span class="highlight">introduction</span> of <span class="highlight">massive</span><span class="highlight">civil</span><span class="highlight">architecture</span>. Many objects were not art in <span class="highlight">even</span> the broadest <span class="highlight">sense</span> and comprised <span class="highlight">utilitarian</span> items of clothing, utensils, and equipment. We should not <span class="highlight">underestimate</span> the social <span class="highlight">status</span><span class="highlight">associated</span> with such <span class="highlight question1">mundane</span> possessions which had not <span class="highlight">previously</span> been <span class="highlight">available</span>. The flooding of Britain with red-gloss <span class="highlight">pottery</span> form Gaul (modern-day France), decorated with scenes from <span class="highlight">Classical</span><span class="highlight">mythology</span>, probably brought many into <span class="highlight">contact</span> with the styles and <span class="highlight">artistic</span> concepts of the Greco-Roman world for the first time, whether or not the symbolism was understood. Mass-produced goods were accompanied by fewer more aesthetically <span class="highlight">impressive</span> objects such as statuettes. Such pieces perhaps first came with officials for their own <span class="highlight">religious</span> worship; others were then acquired by native leaders as <span class="highlight">diplomatic</span> gifts or by <span class="highlight">purchase</span>. Once seen by the natives, such objects created a <span class="highlight">fashion</span> which rapidly <span class="highlight">spread</span><span class="highlight">through</span> the province.</p><p>In the most <span class="highlight">extreme</span> instances, natives <span class="highlight">literally</span> bought the whole package of Roman <span class="highlight">culture</span>. The Fishbourne <span class="highlight">villa</span>, built in the third quarter of the first <span class="highlight">century</span> A.D., probably for the native <span class="highlight">client</span> king Cogidubnus, amply illustrates his Roman pretensions. It was constructed in the latest Italian style with imported marbles and <span class="highlight">stylish</span> mosaics. It was <span class="question4">lavishly</span> furnished with imported sculptures and other <span class="highlight">Classical</span> objects. A visitor from Rome would have recognized its owner as a <span class="highlight">participant</span> in the <span class="highlight">contemporary</span><span class="highlight">culture</span> of the <span class="highlight">empire</span>, not at all provincial in <span class="highlight">taste</span>. <span class="highlight">Even</span> if those from the <span class="highlight">traditional</span> families looked down on him, they would have been unable to dismiss him as uncultured. Although <span class="highlight">exceptional</span>, this demonstrates how new cultural symbols <span class="highlight">bound</span> provincials to the <span class="highlight">identify</span> of the Roman world.</p><p>Such examples established a <span class="highlight">standard</span> to be copied. One result was an <span class="highlight">influx</span> of <span class="highlight">craft</span> worker, particularly those skilled in <span class="highlight">artistic</span><span class="highlight">media</span> like stone-carving which had not existed before the <span class="highlight">conquest</span>. <span class="highlight">Civilian</span> workers came mostly from Gaul and Germany. The <span class="highlight">magnificent</span><span class="highlight">temple</span> built beside the <span class="highlight"><span class="question6">sacred</span></span><span class="highlight">spring</span> at Bath was constructed only about twenty years after the <span class="highlight">conquest</span>. Its <span class="highlight">detail</span> shows that it was carved by artists from northeast Gaul. In the <span class="highlight">absence</span> of a tradition of <span class="highlight">Classical</span> stone-carving and building, the <span class="highlight">desire</span> to develop Roman amenities would have been difficult to <span class="highlight">fulfill</span>. Administrators thus used their <span class="highlight">personal</span> contacts to put the Britons in touch with architects and masons. As many of the officials in Britain had strong links with Gaul, it is not surprising that early Roman Britain owes much to <span class="highlight">craft</span> workers from that area. <span class="highlight">Local</span> workshops did develop and stylistically <span class="highlight">similar</span> groups of <span class="highlight">sculpture</span> show how skills in this new <span class="highlight">medium</span> became <span class="highlight">widespread</span>. Likewise skills in the use of <span class="highlight">mosaic</span>, wall painting, <span class="highlight">ceramic</span> decoration, and metal-working developed <span class="highlight">throughout</span> the province with the eventual <span class="highlight">emergence</span> of characteristically Romano-British styles.</p><p>This art had a <span class="highlight">major</span><span class="highlight">impact</span> on the native peoples, and one of the most importance factors was a change in the <span class="highlight">scale</span> of buildings. <span class="question8">Pre-Roman Britain was highly localized, with people <span class="highlight">rarely</span> traveling beyond their own <span class="highlight">region</span>.</span> On occasion large groups amassed for war or <span class="highlight">religious</span> festivals, but society remained centered on small communities. <span class="highlight">Architecture</span> of this <span class="highlight">era</span> reflected this with <span class="highlight">even</span> the largest of the fortified towns and hill forts containing no more than clusters of medium-sized structures. The spaces inside <span class="highlight">even</span> the largest roundhouses were <span class="highlight"><span class="question9">modest</span></span>, and the use of rounded shapes and <span class="highlight">organic</span> building materials gave buildings a human <span class="highlight">scale</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>But the effect of Roman <span class="highlight">civil</span><span class="highlight">architecture</span> was <span class="highlight">significant</span>;the <span class="highlight">sheer</span> size of <span class="highlight">space</span> enclosed <span class="highlight">within</span> buildings like the basilica of London must have been astonishing. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> This was an <span class="highlight">architecture</span> of dominance in which <span class="highlight">subject</span> peoples were <span class="highlight">literally</span> made to feel small by buildings that epitomized <span class="highlight">imperial</span> power. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span> Supremacy was accentuated by the unyielding straight lines of both <span class="highlight">individual</span> buildings and planned settlements since these too provided a <span class="highlight">marked</span><span class="highlight">contrast</span> with the natural curvilinear shapes <span class="highlight">dominant</span> in the native <span class="highlight">realm</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">mundane</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. material</p><p>B. ordinary</p><p>C. valued</p><p>D. useful</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Mundane, ordinary secular.
