Julie.</p><p>Woman:Not too good. You know the student art exhibit next week?</p><p>Man:No. What's that?</p><p>Woman:It's where a few art students are chosen to show a piece of artwork in the student center for people to see.</p><p>Man:Oh! Cool. You were chosen?</p><p>Woman:Yeah. Except I just found out that I can't use the painting I did for it.</p><p>Man:Why not?</p><p>Woman:Because it's too big.I'm into working on a really large scale now. And the painting I did for this show is huge. It's like a three-meter wide canvas, but each artist only gets a small amount of wall space.</p><p>Man:The organizers can't make an exception?</p><p>Woman:No. They said it wouldn't be fair to the other students if they let me have more space.</p><p>Man:That's too bad. What are you going to do?</p><p>Woman:I don't know. I could give them an older painting. I do have one that's small enough.</p><p>Man:Great!</p><p>Woman:Yeah. It's a nice painting and all. It's just that I did it a while ago. My technique has improved a lot since then. So it wouldn't be my best work or anything. I don't think it's as good as what I'm doing now.</p><p>Man:Well, could you maybe do a new painting? A smaller one, by next week, for the show?</p><p>Woman:Yeah. I could. That would be something fresh, something I'd be more proud of. But I'm really busy right now. I've got some exams coming up that I really need to study for.</p></article><section id="question"><h4>Question</h4><p>Briefly summarize the problem the speakers are discussing. Then state which solution you would recommend. Explain the reasons for your recommendation. </p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>The girl is going to show her artwork in the student center for people to appreciate. The problem is that the painting she prepares for the exhibition is too large for the small amount of wall space. To solve the problem, the girl can either hand in her old small painting, or she could draw a new one that meets the criteria. I prefer the second solution. I believe by drawing a new picture, the girl is able to show her current painting level and what she draws may better suit the theme of the exhibition. On the other hand, although it might occupy some sleep hours to prepare for the coming examination and the exhibition at the same time, it would be worthwhile to see the better results eventually. </p></article></div></main></body></html>
