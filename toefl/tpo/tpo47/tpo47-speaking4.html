          <h4 class="w3-center">Reactance</h4>
          <p>People of all ages generally prefer to have as much freedom as possible in determining their behavior. When individuals feel that their actions are being unfairly limited, they often attempt to restore freedom by directly contradicting or opposing the rule of regulation that threatened their freedom. Both children and adults demonstrate behaviors that are the results of their urge to restore freedom. This reaction, termed "reactance" by psychologists, come from an individual's desire to reestablish freedom and control of a situation.</p>

          <p>Now listen to part of the lecture on this topic in the psychology class.</p>
          <p>Think about when you were a kid, imagine you like this one playground, you played there a lot and had lots of fun you know.Â Ok, now imagine that one day for no apparent reason, your parents said that they don't want you to play there anymore.Â You're not allowed to go there anymore.Â Of course, you're not going to like that one bits, it's not fair.Â And now that you are not allowed, you wanna play there even more than before.Â So you sneak over there anyway.Â You go to this playground despite your parents' rules.Â Here's another example. There was a town that passed a law that banned a sale of a certain kind of soup.Â There was an ingredient in the soup that was harmful for the environment.Â So stores weren't allowed to sell the soup anymore.Â Keep in mind that this ingredient had no effect whatsoever on this soup's ability to clean things.Â None.Â But people found out the upcoming restriction and got upset.Â They thought they should be able to buy whatever soup they wanted.Â It wasn't right to take the soup away.Â And wait before the law went into effect, what happened?Â People went and bought a whole lot of this particular soup, weigh more than they would have in another circumstance.</p>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>The reading passage introduces a term called "reactance", which is the reaction of direct opposition to unfair restrictions of behaviors in order to reestablish freedom and take control of a situation. The lecturer further illustrates this term by using the example of both children and adults. One example is that when a kid is not allowed to have fun on the playground by his parents for no apparent reason, he will have a stronger desire to go there than before, so it is more likely for him to sneak over there. Another example is that when a certain kind of soap was to be banned from sales for the subterfuge of environmental damage, an increasing number of people bought the soap the week before the law was put into effect.</p>
