          <p>Listen to part of a lecture in a history class.</p>
          <p>When early humans wanted to eat meat, they hunted wild animals.Â That's how humans got meat for thousands of years.Â But then around 10,000 years ago, humans began to domesticate animals that is they began to control animals, to feed them, to raise them.Â And the domestication of animals had a number of benefits for early humans.Â Let's talk about a couple of these benefits.Â </p>
          <p>One benefit of animal domestication was that it provide early humans with more consistent and reliable source of meat.Â When early humans hunted wild animals, sometimes they were able to find and catch the animals, but other times they weren't.Â So wild animals were not a reliable source of meat.Â But with domesticated animals, meat was always available.Â For example, goats, one of the first animals to be domesticated, they were easily controlled and organized into herds led by a person, a shepherd.Â So they could accompany groups of people as they moved from place to place.Â And whenever the people needed meat, they could eat the goats.Â They were always available.Â </p>
          <p>Another benefit of animal domestication was the domesticated animals could supply a variety of foods other than meat.Â When early humans hunted wild animals, the only kind of food they got was meat. But domesticated animals were able to supply in addition to meat, other kinds of food products.Â For example, let's take a look again at domesticated goats.Â Live goats produced milk. So early humans could collect the milk and drink it.Â And they could also process the milk and turn it into other kinds of food, like yogurt and cheese, which could be stored.</p>

          <p>The lecture talks about two benefits of animal domestication for early humans. The first advantage was that it offered early humans with a more constant source of meat. For example, goats were tractable, so they could move from one place to another with human migration. The goats were available to eat whenever and wherever the people needed meat whereas it relied more on luck to hunt wild animals. The second merit was that domesticated animals could supply a variety of foods besides meat. For instance, early humans could gather the goat milk and make it into other kinds of food such as yogurt and cheese, which could be preserved. By contrast, wild animals could furnish nothing but meat.</p>
