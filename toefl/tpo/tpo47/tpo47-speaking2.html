        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>I believe that people in the future will read fewer books than they do in the present. One obvious reason is that the rapid pace of life allows less time for employees to immerse themselves in a wide range of books. Another reason is that various entertainments such as video games, soap operas and outdoor activities will distract people from focusing on studying, even when they are in library. </p>
