I was thinking...you said <span class="highlight">domesticated</span> animals usually served some kind of purpose for humans, like horses could...uh...pull heavy loads, and dogs could hunt or <span class="highlight">herd</span> sheep, but cats, why were they ever <span class="highlight">domesticated</span>?<span class="time" data-times="3.32" data-time="43.78">[00:43.78]</span> I mean, <span class="highlight">mine</span> can't do much of anything.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.19" data-time="47.1">[00:47.10]</span>Professor: Interesting question. <span class="time" data-times="4.03" data-time="49.29">[00:49.29]</span>Cats don't <span class="highlight">seem</span> likely candidates for <span class="highlight">domestication</span>, do they? <span class="time" data-times="6.53" data-time="53.32">[00:53.32]</span>They actually <span class="highlight">lack</span> an important <span class="highlight">characteristic</span> that most animals that can be <span class="highlight">domesticated</span> have. <span class="time" data-times="7.15" data-time="59.85">[00:59.85]</span>Domesticable animals <span class="highlight">tend</span> to live in herds or packs, with <span class="highlight">clear</span> dominance hierarchies. <span class="time" data-times="5.12" data-time="67">[01:07.00]</span>Humans could easily take <span class="highlight">advantage</span> of this <span class="highlight">hierarchical</span> structure. <span class="time" data-times="8.88" data-time="72.12">[01:12.12]</span>By supplanting the alpha <span class="highlight">individual</span>, they could gain control of the whole group or of individuals as in the case of dogs. <span class="time" data-times="4.13" data-time="81">[01:21.00]</span>Cats in the wild, though, <span class="highlight">rarely</span> have this structure.<span class="time" data-times="3.14" data-time="85.13">[01:25.13]</span> For the most part, they are <span class="highlight">solitary</span> hunters. <span class="time" data-times="9.92" data-time="88.27">[01:28.27]</span>But as for their <span class="highlight">utility</span> to humans, well, it's helpful to think about when and where cat <span class="highlight">domestication</span> might have begun.<span class="time" data-times="1.52" data-time="98.19">[01:38.19]</span>Any ideas, Jim?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.03" data-time="99.71">[01:39.71]</span>Student: Well, I guess <span class="highlight">ancient</span> Egypt.<span class="time" data-times="4.05" data-time="102.74">[01:42.74]</span> I'm thinking of all those <span class="highlight">ancient</span> Egyptian paintings of cats.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="1.57" data-time="106.79">[01:46.79]</span>Professor: Good guess. <span class="time" data-times="10.39" data-time="108.36">[01:48.36]</span>Those paintings you mentioned do provide the oldest known depictions of full cat <span class="highlight">domestication</span>, where cats are, without question, <span class="highlight">household</span> companions.<span class="time" data-times="12.44" data-time="118.75">[01:58.75]</span> The paintings from about 3,600 years ago typically show cats in Egyptian homes poised under chairs, sometimes wearing collars, eating scraps of food out of bowls. <span class="time" data-times="9.32" data-time="131.19">[02:11.19]</span>But the Egyptians don't get credited for the early stages of cat <span class="highlight">domestication</span> where cats are just beginning to <span class="highlight">interact</span> with humans. <span class="time" data-times="6.69" data-time="140.51">[02:20.51]</span>There are signs of early <span class="highlight">domestication</span> as far back as 9,500 years ago!<span class="time" data-times="4.34" data-time="147.2">[02:27.20]</span>Recently, two graves were discovered on the Island of Cyprus.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="9.66" data-time="151.54">[02:31.54]</span>One was the grave of a human, buried with some tools, sea shells and other items, and nearby, a cat was buried in its own grave. <span class="time" data-times="7.11" data-time="161.2">[02:41.20]</span>Interestingly, the cat's body was oriented in the same westward direction as the human's body.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="10.5" data-time="168.31">[02:48.31]</span>Another <span class="highlight">notable</span> thing about the two bodies was that they were in an <span class="highlight">identical</span><span class="highlight">state</span> of <span class="highlight">preservation</span>, suggesting they had been buried at the same time. <span class="time" data-times="9.19" data-time="178.81">[02:58.81]</span>So we can <span class="highlight">assume</span> that humans had at <span class="highlight">least</span> some kind of relationship with cats as early as 9,500 years ago!</p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.97" data-time="188">[03:08.00]</span>Student: So cat <span class="highlight">domestication</span> began in Cyprus?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.76" data-time="191.97">[03:11.97]</span>Professor: Well, except cats weren't native to Cyprus.<span class="time" data-times="7.89" data-time="196.73">[03:16.73]</span> They were undoubtedly brought over to the island by boat probably from the nearby <span class="highlight">coast</span> of the Fertile <span class="highlight">Crescent</span> in the Middle East.<span class="time" data-times="7.26" data-time="204.62">[03:24.62]</span> In fact, <span class="highlight">extensive</span> DNA <span class="highlight">analysis</span> has now confirmed what archaeologists have believed for quite some time. <span class="time" data-times="16.35" data-time="211.88">[03:31.88]</span>All modern <span class="highlight">domesticate</span> cats arose from just one <span class="highlight">subspecies</span> of wild cat from that single location: the Fertile <span class="highlight">Crescent</span>, and not from any of the other four <span class="highlight">subspecies</span> of wild cats located in other areas <span class="highlight">throughout</span> the world. <span class="time" data-times="1.88" data-time="228.23">[03:48.23]</span><span class="highlight">Pretty</span> amazing, isn't it?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.32" data-time="230.11">[03:50.11]</span>Which brings us back to Jim's question: Why did it happen and how? <span class="time" data-times="13.12" data-time="236.43">[03:56.43]</span>Well, for years, researchers have pondered this question of cat <span class="highlight">domestication</span>, and the best I can do here is just a <span class="highlight">theory</span>, but tell me it doesn't make <span class="highlight">sense</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="16.35" data-time="249.55">[04:09.55]</span>In <span class="highlight">evolutionary</span> terms, early settlements and <span class="highlight">agriculture</span> in the Fertile <span class="highlight">Crescent</span> around 10,000 years ago created a completely new environment for any wild animals that were <span class="highlight">flexible</span> and <span class="highlight">curious</span> enough to <span class="highlight">exploit</span> it. <span class="time" data-times="13.27" data-time="265.9">[04:25.90]</span><span class="highlight">Mice</span> were attracted to these settlements, and cats, being obligate carnivores they must eat meat to <span class="highlight">thrive</span>,They were almost certainly drawn to the settlements by the <span class="highlight">mice</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.05" data-time="279.17">[04:39.17]</span>Over time, only the cats that could <span class="highlight">adapt</span> to living in human-dominated environments would have stayed and thrived.<span class="time" data-times="12.44" data-time="286.22">[04:46.22]</span> People probably encouraged them to <span class="highlight">stick</span> around and controlled the <span class="highlight">mice</span> in the <span class="highlight">field</span> and the granaries, and <span class="highlight">eventually</span>, their homes, and perhaps <span class="highlight">simply</span> grew to like their <span class="highlight">company</span> too.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.94" data-time="298.66">[04:58.66]</span>Student: Hmm...so in a way, the <span class="highlight">difference</span> with cats was that <span class="highlight">domestication</span> was their idea <span class="highlight">instead</span> of ours.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.27" data-time="306.6">[05:06.60]</span>But why do you <span class="highlight">suppose</span> only one of the five <span class="highlight">subspecies</span> was <span class="highlight">domesticated</span>? <span class="time" data-times="5.28" data-time="312.87">[05:12.87]</span>Were the others just not friendly enough towards humans?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="1.56" data-time="318.15">[05:18.15]</span>Professor: Well, no.<span class="time" data-times="14.58" data-time="319.71">[05:19.71]</span> In fact, at <span class="highlight">least</span> two of the other <span class="highlight">subspecies</span> are known to be <span class="highlight">relatively</span> friendly, but the Fertile <span class="highlight">Crescent</span><span class="highlight">subspecies</span> had, well, a head start because of its <span class="highlight">proximity</span> to the first human settlements.<span class="time" data-times="6.16" data-time="334.29">[05:34.29]</span> And as <span class="highlight">agriculture</span><span class="highlight">spread</span>, the tamed ancestors of this <span class="highlight">subspecies</span><span class="highlight">spread</span> with it. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="340.45">[05:40.45]</span>So they fill the <span class="highlight">niche</span> of home <span class="highlight">companion</span> in each <span class="highlight">region</span> they entered and effectively shut out the <span class="highlight">local</span><span class="highlight">subspecies</span> that were already there.</p></p></article></section><div id="question"><div
