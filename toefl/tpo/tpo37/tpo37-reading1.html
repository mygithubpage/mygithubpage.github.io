          <h4 class="w3-center">Thales And The Milesians</h4>
          <p>While many other observers and thinkers had laid the groundwork for science, Thales (circa 624 B.C.E-ca 547 B.C.E.), the best known of the earliest Greek philosophers, made the first steps toward a new, more <span class="highlight">objective</span> <span class="highlight">approach</span> to finding out about the world. He posed a very <span class="highlight">basic</span> question: "<span class="question1">What is the world made of?</span> " Many others had asked the same question before him, but Thales based his answer strictly on what he had observed and what he could <span class="highlight">reason</span> out-not on imaginative stories about the gods or the supernatural. He proposed water as the single <span class="highlight">substance</span> from which everything in the world was made and developed a model of the <span class="highlight">universe</span> with Earth as a <span class="highlight">flat</span> disk floating in water.</p>
          <p>Like most of the great Greek philosophers, Thales had an influence on others around <span class="question5">him</span>. His two best-known followers, though there were undoubtedly others who attained less <span class="highlight"><span class="question2">renown</span></span>, were Anaximander and Anaximenes. Both were also from Miletus (located on the southern <span class="highlight">coast</span> of present-day <span class="highlight">Turkey</span>) and so, like Thales, were members of the Milesian School. Much more is known about Anaximander than about Anaximenes, probably because Anaximander, who was born sometime around 610 B.C.E, ambitiously attempted to write a <span class="highlight"><span class="question3">comprehensive</span></span> <span class="highlight">history</span> of the <span class="highlight">universe</span>. As would later happen between another teacher-student pair of philosophers, Plato and <span class="highlight">Aristotle</span>, Anaximander disagreed with his teacher despite his <span class="highlight">respect</span> for him. He doubted that the world and all its contents could be made of water and proposed <span class="highlight">instead</span> a formless and unobservable <span class="highlight">substance</span> he called "apeiron" that was the <span class="highlight">source</span> of all matter.</p>
          <p>Anaximander's most important contributions, though, were in other areas. Although he did not accept that water was the <span class="highlight">prime</span> <span class="highlight">element</span>, he did believe that all life originated in the sea, and he was thus one of the first to <span class="highlight">conceive</span> of this important idea. Anaximander is credited with drawing up the first world map of the Greeks and also with recognizing that Earth's surface was curved.He believed, though, that the <span class="highlight">shape</span> of Earth was that of a <span class="highlight">cylinder</span> rather than the <span class="highlight">sphere</span> that later Greek philosophers would conjecture. Anaximander, observing the motions of the heavens around the polestar, was probably the first of the Greek philosophers to picture the sky as <span class="highlight">sphere</span> completely surrounding Earth-an idea that, <span class="question7">elaborated upon</span> later, would <span class="highlight">prevail</span> until the <span class="highlight">advent</span> of <span class="question8">the <span class="highlight">Scientific</span> <span class="highlight">Revolution</span> in the seventeenth <span class="highlight">century</span>.</span></p>
          <p>
            <span class="highlight">Unfortunately</span>, most of Anaximander's written <span class="highlight">history</span> of the <span class="highlight">universe</span> was lost, and only a few fragments <span class="highlight">survive</span> today. Little is known about his other ideas. <span class="highlight">Unfortunately</span>, too, most of the written work for Anaximenes, who may have been Anaximander's <span class="highlight">pupil</span>, has also been lost. <span class="question9">All we can say for certain about Anaximenes, who was probably born around 560 BCE, is that following in the tradition of Anaximander, he also disagreed with his mentor.</span> The world, according to Anaximenes, was not composed of either water or apeiron, but <span class="highlight">air</span> itself was the <span class="highlight">fundamental</span> <span class="highlight">element</span> of the <span class="highlight">universe</span>. Compressed, it became water and earth, and when rarefied or thinned out, it heated up to become fire. Anaximenes may have also been the first to study rainbows and <span class="highlight">speculate</span> upon their natural rather than supernatural cause.</p>
          <p>With the door opened by Thales and the other early philosophers of Milestus, Greek thinkers began to <span class="highlight">speculate</span> about the nature of the <span class="highlight">universe</span>. This <span class="highlight">exciting</span> burst of <span class="highlight">intellectual</span> <span class="highlight">activity</span> was for the most part purely <span class="highlight">creative</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> The Greeks, from Thales to Plato and <span class="highlight">Aristotle</span>, were philosophers and not scientists in today's <span class="highlight">sense</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> It is possible for anyone to create "ideas" about the nature and structure of the <span class="highlight">universe</span>, for <span class="highlight">instance</span>, and many times these ideas can be so <span class="highlight">consistent</span> and <span class="highlight">elaborately</span> structured, or just so apparently <span class="highlight">obvious</span>, that they can be <span class="highlight">persuasive</span> to many people. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>A <span class="highlight">scientific</span> <span class="highlight">theory</span> about the <span class="highlight">universe</span>, however, demands much more than the various observations and analogies that were woven together to form systems of reasoning, carefully constructed as they were, that would <span class="highlight">eventually</span> <span class="highlight"><span class="question12">culminate</span></span> in <span class="highlight">Aristotle</span>'s model of the world and the <span class="highlight">universe</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span> Without experimentation and <span class="highlight">objective</span>, <span class="highlight">critical</span> testing of their theories, the best these thinkers could hope to achieve was some internally <span class="highlight">consistent</span> speculation that covered all the bases and satisfied the demands of <span class="highlight">reason</span>. </p>

To the phenomenon and reasoning, not the imaginary story about God and supernatural. So this passage is mainly to explain how Thales's point of view differs from his predecessors' views. Option A is consistent.
