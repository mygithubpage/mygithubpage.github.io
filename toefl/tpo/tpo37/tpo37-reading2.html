            <b>Direct Species Translocation</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>It is becoming increasingly <span class="underline">common</span> for conservationists to move <span class="underline">individual</span> animals or entire <span class="underline">species</span> from one site to another. This may be either to <span class="underline">establish</span> a new <span class="underline">population</span> where a <span class="underline">population</span> of conspecifics (animals or plants belonging to the same <span class="underline">species</span>) has become <span class="underline">extinct</span> or to add individuals to an existing <span class="underline">population</span>. The <span class="underline">former</span> is termed reintroduction and the <span class="underline">latter</span> reinforcement. In both cases, wild individuals are captured in one location and translocated directly to another.</p>
          <p>Direct translocation has been used a wide <span class="underline">range</span> of plants and animals and was carried out to <span class="underline">maintain</span> populations as a <span class="underline">source</span> of food long before <span class="underline">conservation</span> was a <span class="underline">familiar</span> <span class="underline">term</span>. The number of translocations carried out under the <span class="underline">banner</span> of <span class="underline">conservation</span> has increased rapidly, and this has led to <span class="underline">criticism</span> of the <span class="underline">technique</span> because of the <span class="underline">lack</span> of evaluation of its efficacy and because of its <span class="underline">potential</span> disadvantages. The nature of translocation ranges from highly organized and researched national or international programs to as hoc releases of rescued animals by well- intentioned animal lovers. In a fragmented <span class="underline">landscape</span> where many populations and habitats are <span class="underline">isolated</span> from others, translocations can play an <span class="underline">effective</span> role in <span class="underline">conservation</span> strategies; they can increase the number of existing populations or increase the size, <span class="underline">genetic</span> <span class="underline">diversity</span>, and <span class="underline">demographic</span> <span class="underline">balance</span> of a small <span class="underline">population</span>, <span class="underline">consequently</span> increasing its chances of <span class="underline">survival</span>.</p>
          <p>Translocation clearly has a role in the recovery of <span class="underline">species</span> that have <span class="underline">substantially</span> declined and is the most likely <span class="underline">method</span> by which many <span class="underline">sedentary</span> <span class="underline">species</span> can <span class="underline">recover</span> all or part of their <span class="underline">former</span> <span class="underline">range</span>. However, against this is the <span class="underline">potential</span> for reinforcement translocations to <span class="underline">spread</span> <span class="underline">disease</span> from one <span class="underline">population</span> to another or to introduce deleterious or maladaptive genes to a <span class="underline">population</span>. Additionally, translocation of predators or competitors may have <span class="underline">negative</span> impacts on other <span class="underline">species</span>, resulting in an <span class="underline">overall</span> loss of <span class="underline">diversity</span>. Last but not <span class="underline">least</span> of these considerations is the effort and resources required in this type of <span class="underline">action</span>, which need to be justified by <span class="underline">evidence</span> of the likely benefits.</p>
          <p>Despite the large number of tranlocations that have taken place, there is surprisingly little <span class="underline">evidence</span> of the efficacy of such actions. This is <span class="underline">partly</span> because many translocations have not been strictly for <span class="underline">conservation</span>; neither have they been <span class="underline">official</span> nor legal, let alone <span class="underline">scientific</span> in their <span class="underline">approach</span>. Successful translocations <span class="underline">inevitably</span> get recorded and gain <span class="underline">attention</span>, whereas failures may never be recorded at all. This makes <span class="underline">appraisal</span> of the <span class="underline">method</span> very difficult. One key problem is a <span class="underline">definition</span> of success. Is translocation successful if the individuals <span class="underline">survive</span> the first week or a year, or do they need to <span class="underline">reproduce</span> for one or several generations? Whatever the answer, it is <span class="underline">clear</span> that a general <span class="underline">framework</span> is required to ensure that any translocation is justified, has a <span class="underline">realistic</span> <span class="underline">chance</span> of success, and will be properly monitored and evaluated for the <span class="underline">benefit</span> of future efforts.</p>
          <p>An example of <span class="underline">apparent</span> translocation success involves the threatened Seychelles warbler. This <span class="underline">species</span> was once confined to <span class="underline">Cousin</span> Island, one of the Seychelles islands, and reduced to 26 individuals. Careful <span class="underline">habitat</span> <span class="underline">management</span> increased this number to over 300 birds, but the single <span class="underline">population</span> remained <span class="underline">vulnerable</span> to <span class="underline">local</span> <span class="underline">catastrophic</span> events. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> The decision was taken to translocate individuals to two nearby islands to reduce this risk. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> The translocations took place in 1988 and 1990, and both have resulted in healthy <span class="underline">breeding</span> populations. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span> A successful translocation <span class="underline">exercise</span> also appears to have been achieved with red howler monkeys in French Guiana. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span> A howler <span class="underline">population</span> was translocated from a site <span class="underline">due</span> to be flooded for <span class="underline">hydroelectric</span> power <span class="underline">generation</span>. The <span class="underline">release</span> site was an area where <span class="underline">local</span> hunting had reduced the <span class="underline">density</span> of the <span class="underline">resident</span> howler <span class="underline">population</span>. Released troops of monkeys were kept under <span class="underline">visual</span> <span class="underline">observation</span> and followed by radio tracking of 16 females. Although the troops appeared to <span class="underline">undergo</span> <span class="underline">initial</span> problems, causing them to <span class="underline">split</span> up, all the tracked females settled into normal <span class="underline">behavioral</span> patterns.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="underline">Unfortunately</span>, the success stories are at <span class="underline">least</span> matched by accounts of failure. Reviewing translocation of amphibians and reptiles, researchers C.Kenneth Dodd and Richard A. Siegel concluded that most projects have not demonstrated success as <span class="underline">conservation</span> techniques and should not be advocated as though they were <span class="underline">acceptable</span> <span class="underline">management</span> and mitigation practices.</p>
