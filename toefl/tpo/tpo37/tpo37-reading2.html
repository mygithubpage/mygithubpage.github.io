This may be either to <span class="highlight">establish</span> a new <span class="highlight">population</span> where a <span class="highlight">population</span> of conspecifics (animals or plants belonging to the same <span class="highlight">species</span>) has become <span class="highlight">extinct</span> or to add individuals to an existing <span class="highlight">population</span>. The <span class="highlight">former</span> is termed reintroduction and the <span class="highlight">latter</span> reinforcement. In both cases, wild individuals are captured in one location and translocated directly to another.</p><p>Direct translocation has been used a wide <span class="highlight">range</span> of plants and animals and was carried out to <span class="highlight">maintain</span> populations as a <span class="highlight">source</span> of food long before <span class="highlight">conservation</span> was a <span class="highlight">familiar</span><span class="highlight">term</span>. The number of translocations carried out under the <span class="highlight">banner</span> of <span class="highlight">conservation</span> has increased rapidly, and this has led to <span class="highlight">criticism</span> of the <span class="highlight">technique</span> because of the <span class="highlight">lack</span> of evaluation of its <span class="question2">efficacy</span> and because of its <span class="highlight">potential</span> disadvantages. The nature of translocation ranges from highly organized and researched national or international programs to as hoc releases of rescued animals by well- intentioned animal lovers. In a fragmented <span class="highlight">landscape</span> where many populations and habitats are <span class="highlight">isolated</span> from others, translocations can play an <span class="highlight">effective</span> role in <span class="highlight">conservation</span> strategies; they can increase the number of existing populations or increase the size, <span class="highlight">genetic</span><span class="highlight">diversity</span>, and <span class="highlight">demographic</span><span class="highlight">balance</span> of a small <span class="highlight">population</span>, <span class="highlight">consequently</span> increasing its chances of <span class="highlight">survival</span>.</p><p>Translocation clearly has a role in the recovery of <span class="highlight">species</span> that have <span class="highlight"><span class="question4">substantially</span></span>declined and is the most likely <span class="highlight">method</span> by which many <span class="highlight">sedentary</span><span class="highlight">species</span> can <span class="highlight">recover</span> all or part of their <span class="highlight">former</span><span class="highlight">range</span>. However, against this is the <span class="highlight">potential</span> for reinforcement translocations to <span class="highlight">spread</span><span class="highlight">disease</span> from one <span class="highlight">population</span> to another or to introduce deleterious or maladaptive genes to a <span class="highlight">population</span>. Additionally, translocation of predators or competitors may have <span class="highlight">negative</span> impacts on other <span class="highlight">species</span>, resulting in an <span class="highlight">overall</span> loss of <span class="highlight">diversity</span>. Last but not <span class="highlight">least</span> of these considerations is the effort and resources required in this type of <span class="highlight">action</span>, which need to be justified by <span class="highlight">evidence</span> of the likely benefits.</p><p>Despite the large number of tranlocations that have taken place, there is surprisingly little <span class="highlight">evidence</span> of the efficacy of such actions. This is <span class="highlight">partly</span> because many translocations have not been strictly for <span class="highlight">conservation</span>; neither have they been <span class="highlight">official</span> nor legal, let alone <span class="highlight">scientific</span> in their <span class="highlight">approach</span>. Successful translocations <span class="highlight">inevitably</span> get recorded and gain <span class="highlight">attention</span>, whereas failures may never be recorded at all. This makes <span class="highlight"><span class="question6">appraisal</span></span>of the <span class="highlight">method</span> very difficult. One key problem is a <span class="highlight">definition</span> of success. Is translocation successful if the individuals <span class="highlight">survive</span> the first week or a year, or do they need to <span class="highlight">reproduce</span> for one or several generations? Whatever the answer, it is <span class="highlight">clear</span> that a general <span class="highlight">framework</span> is required to ensure that any translocation is justified, has a <span class="highlight">realistic</span><span class="highlight">chance</span> of success, and will be <span class="question7">properly </span>monitored and evaluated for the <span class="highlight">benefit</span> of future efforts.</p><p>An example of <span class="highlight">apparent</span> translocation success involves the threatened Seychelles warbler. This <span class="highlight">species</span> was once confined to <span class="highlight">Cousin</span> Island, one of the Seychelles islands, and reduced to 26 individuals. Careful <span class="highlight">habitat</span><span class="highlight">management</span> increased this number to over 300 birds, but the single <span class="highlight">population</span> remained <span class="highlight">vulnerable</span> to <span class="highlight">local</span><span class="highlight">catastrophic</span> events. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> The decision was taken to translocate individuals to two nearby islands to reduce this risk. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> The translocations took place in 1988 and 1990, and both have resulted in healthy <span class="highlight">breeding</span> populations. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span> A successful translocation <span class="highlight">exercise</span> also appears to have been achieved with red howler monkeys in French Guiana. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span> A howler <span class="highlight">population</span> was translocated from a site <span class="highlight">due</span> to be flooded for <span class="highlight">hydroelectric</span> power <span class="highlight">generation</span>. The <span class="highlight">release</span> site was an area where <span class="highlight">local</span> hunting had reduced the <span class="highlight">density</span> of the <span class="highlight">resident</span> howler <span class="highlight">population</span>. Released troops of monkeys were kept under <span class="highlight">visual</span><span class="highlight">observation</span> and followed by radio tracking of 16 females. Although the troops appeared to <span class="highlight">undergo</span><span class="highlight">initial</span> problems, causing them to <span class="highlight">split</span> up, all the tracked females settled into normal <span class="highlight">behavioral</span> patterns.</p><p><span class="highlight">Unfortunately</span>, the success stories are at <span class="highlight">least</span> matched by accounts of failure. Reviewing translocation of amphibians and reptiles, researchers C.Kenneth Dodd and Richard A. Siegel concluded that most projects have not demonstrated success as <span class="highlight">conservation</span> techniques and should not be advocated as though they were <span class="highlight">acceptable</span><span class="highlight">management</span> and mitigation practices.</p></article></div><div id="question"><div id="question1"><p>According to paragraph 1, what distinguishes reinforcement from reintroduction of animal species?</p><label class="my-label"><span>A.
