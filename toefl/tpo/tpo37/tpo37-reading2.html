This may be either to <span class="highlight">establish</span> a new <span class="highlight">population</span> where a <span class="highlight">population</span> of conspecifics (animals or plants belonging to the same <span class="highlight">species</span>) has become <span class="highlight">extinct</span> or to add individuals to an existing <span class="highlight">population</span>. The <span class="highlight">former</span> is termed reintroduction and the <span class="highlight">latter</span> reinforcement. In both cases, wild individuals are captured in one location and translocated directly to another.</p><p>Direct translocation has been used a wide <span class="highlight">range</span> of plants and animals and was carried out to <span class="highlight">maintain</span> populations as a <span class="highlight">source</span> of food long before <span class="highlight">conservation</span> was a <span class="highlight">familiar</span><span class="highlight">term</span>. The number of translocations carried out under the <span class="highlight">banner</span> of <span class="highlight">conservation</span> has increased rapidly, and this has led to <span class="highlight">criticism</span> of the <span class="highlight">technique</span> because of the <span class="highlight">lack</span> of evaluation of its <span class="question2">efficacy</span> and because of its <span class="highlight">potential</span> disadvantages. The nature of translocation ranges from highly organized and researched national or international programs to as hoc releases of rescued animals by well- intentioned animal lovers. In a fragmented <span class="highlight">landscape</span> where many populations and habitats are <span class="highlight">isolated</span> from others, translocations can play an <span class="highlight">effective</span> role in <span class="highlight">conservation</span> strategies; they can increase the number of existing populations or increase the size, <span class="highlight">genetic</span><span class="highlight">diversity</span>, and <span class="highlight">demographic</span><span class="highlight">balance</span> of a small <span class="highlight">population</span>, <span class="highlight">consequently</span> increasing its chances of <span class="highlight">survival</span>.</p><p>Translocation clearly has a role in the recovery of <span class="highlight">species</span> that have <span class="highlight"><span class="question4">substantially</span></span> declined and is the most likely <span class="highlight">method</span> by which many <span class="highlight">sedentary</span><span class="highlight">species</span> can <span class="highlight">recover</span> all or part of their <span class="highlight">former</span><span class="highlight">range</span>. However, against this is the <span class="highlight">potential</span> for reinforcement translocations to <span class="highlight">spread</span><span class="highlight">disease</span> from one <span class="highlight">population</span> to another or to introduce deleterious or maladaptive genes to a <span class="highlight">population</span>. Additionally, translocation of predators or competitors may have <span class="highlight">negative</span> impacts on other <span class="highlight">species</span>, resulting in an <span class="highlight">overall</span> loss of <span class="highlight">diversity</span>. Last but not <span class="highlight">least</span> of these considerations is the effort and resources required in this type of <span class="highlight">action</span>, which need to be justified by <span class="highlight">evidence</span> of the likely benefits.</p><p>Despite the large number of tranlocations that have taken place, there is surprisingly little <span class="highlight">evidence</span> of the efficacy of such actions. This is <span class="highlight">partly</span> because many translocations have not been strictly for <span class="highlight">conservation</span>; neither have they been <span class="highlight">official</span> nor legal, let alone <span class="highlight">scientific</span> in their <span class="highlight">approach</span>. Successful translocations <span class="highlight">inevitably</span> get recorded and gain <span class="highlight">attention</span>, whereas failures may never be recorded at all. This makes <span class="highlight"><span class="question6">appraisal</span></span> of the <span class="highlight">method</span> very difficult. One key problem is a <span class="highlight">definition</span> of success. Is translocation successful if the individuals <span class="highlight">survive</span> the first week or a year, or do they need to <span class="highlight">reproduce</span> for one or several generations? Whatever the answer, it is <span class="highlight">clear</span> that a general <span class="highlight">framework</span> is required to ensure that any translocation is justified, has a <span class="highlight">realistic</span><span class="highlight">chance</span> of success, and will be <span class="question7">properly</span> monitored and evaluated for the <span class="highlight">benefit</span> of future efforts.</p><p>An example of <span class="highlight">apparent</span> translocation success involves the threatened Seychelles warbler. This <span class="highlight">species</span> was once confined to <span class="highlight">Cousin</span> Island, one of the Seychelles islands, and reduced to 26 individuals. Careful <span class="highlight">habitat</span><span class="highlight">management</span> increased this number to over 300 birds, but the single <span class="highlight">population</span> remained <span class="highlight">vulnerable</span> to <span class="highlight">local</span><span class="highlight">catastrophic</span> events. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> The decision was taken to translocate individuals to two nearby islands to reduce this risk. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> The translocations took place in 1988 and 1990, and both have resulted in healthy <span class="highlight">breeding</span> populations. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span> A successful translocation <span class="highlight">exercise</span> also appears to have been achieved with red howler monkeys in French Guiana. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span> A howler <span class="highlight">population</span> was translocated from a site <span class="highlight">due</span> to be flooded for <span class="highlight">hydroelectric</span> power <span class="highlight">generation</span>. The <span class="highlight">release</span> site was an area where <span class="highlight">local</span> hunting had reduced the <span class="highlight">density</span> of the <span class="highlight">resident</span> howler <span class="highlight">population</span>. Released troops of monkeys were kept under <span class="highlight">visual</span><span class="highlight">observation</span> and followed by radio tracking of 16 females. Although the troops appeared to <span class="highlight">undergo</span><span class="highlight">initial</span> problems, causing them to <span class="highlight">split</span> up, all the tracked females settled into normal <span class="highlight">behavioral</span> patterns.</p><p><span class="highlight">Unfortunately</span>, the success stories are at <span class="highlight">least</span> matched by accounts of failure. Reviewing translocation of amphibians and reptiles, researchers C.Kenneth Dodd and Richard A. Siegel concluded that most projects have not demonstrated success as <span class="highlight">conservation</span> techniques and should not be advocated as though they were <span class="highlight">acceptable</span><span class="highlight">management</span> and mitigation practices.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 1, what distinguishes reinforcement from reintroduction of animal species?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Only reinforcement involves capturing wild individuals.</p><p>B. Only reinforcement involves adding individuals to an existing population.</p><p>C. Only reinforcement requires the use of conspecifics.</p><p>D. Only reinforcement can help once a population is extinct.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>This question needs to read through the first paragraph. According to the third sentence of the first paragraph, the first sentence is the definition of reintroduction, and the second sentence is the definition of reinforcement. Reintroduce refers to the migration of a species to another area. Reinforcement refers to the introduction of another species when an original species is extinct or has not yet been extinct. For Options A and C, the last sentence of the first paragraph of the article states that the concept of capturing animals and conspecifics is both. Option D, according to the definition of both, can help areas where species are extinct. Only option B's reinforcement relates to the introduction of new species based on the original species. Select B.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">efficacy</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. effectiveness</p><p>B. advantage</p><p>C. motivation</p><p>D. necessity</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>This sentence is based on the word under investigation and locates in the original sentence: The number of translocations carried out under the banner of conservation has increased rapidly, and this has led to criticism of the technique because of the lack of evaluation of its <span class="question2">efficacy</span> and because of Its potential disadvantages. The main meaning of this sentence is that more and more species are being migrated in the name of conservation, which leads to criticism of the lack of effectiveness of migration technology and the potential dangers involved. Efficacy here means effect. Option A means effect, option B means benefit, option C means motivation, and option D means necessity. Option A best fits the meaning of efficiency. Select A.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Paragraph 2 indicates all of the following about species translocation EXCEPT:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It was used to secure food sources before it was used for conservation purposes.</p><p>B. Its disadvantages have led to a decline in its use for conservation purposes.</p><p>C. It has been used successfully on a wide range of plants and animals.</p><p>D. The way in which it is carried out varies greatly.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The problem points of this question are distributed in the first half of the third paragraph. Option A is based on and was carried out to maintain populations as a source of food long, correct; Option B is based on The number of translocations carried out under the banner of conservation has increased rapidly, the use of translocation is increased rather than Reduced, Option B error; Option C is indeed widely used according to Direct translocation has been used a wide range of plants and animals; Option D is based on The nature of translocation ranges from highly organized and researched national or international programs To as hoc releases of rescued animals by well-intentioned animal lovers, translocation does have a variety of formal methods. Option D is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question4">substantially</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. temporarily</p><p>B. considerably</p><p>C. naturally</p><p>D. suddenly</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>This question is based on the vocabulary you are looking at. Go back to the sentence in the original text: Translocation clearly has a role in the recovery of species that have <span class="question4">substantially</span> declined and is the most likely method by which many sedentary species can recover all or part of their former range. The implication is that the species migration can help the recovery of those areas where the species are extremely dead, and help some immovable species recover their original size. Substantially mean here is great. The meaning of option A is temporary, option B is huge, option C is naturally low, and option D is abrupt. Option B best corresponds to the meaning of general, choose B.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Paragraph 3 answers all of the following questions about species translocation EXCEPT:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. In what type of situation can species translocation be an effective strategy for species conservation?</p><p>B. What are the potential advantages of species translocation as conservation strategy?</p><p>C. What are the potential problems that species translocation can cause?</p><p>D. How can the negative impact of the translocation of predators or competitors on other species be prevented?</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The problem-solving basis for this problem is distributed throughout the fifth paragraph. Option A and Option B are based on the first sentence of this paragraph: Translocation clearly has a role in the recovery of species that have <span class="question4">substantially</span> declined and is the most likely method by which many sedentary species can recover all or part of their former range. The words illustrate the use of translocation under what circumstances, as well as the role it can play. Later in the article However is behind all the hazards of translocation, Option C is correct. However, how Option D prevents negative influences was not mentioned in the entire paragraph.

Select C.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question7">properly</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. appropriately</p><p>B. externally</p><p>C. frequently</p><p>D. easily</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" A"><p>This question is based on the vocabulary in question and locates in the original sentence: Whatever the answer, it is clear that a general framework is required to ensure that any translocation is justified, has a realistic chance of success, and will be <span class="question7">properly</span> monitored and evaluated for the The general idea of this sentence is: Regardless of the answer, we need a general framework to ensure that any species migration is legal, is actually likely to be successful, can be <span class="question7">properly</span> monitored and evaluated The benefits of the future. The meaning of proper in this sentence is appropriate, appropriate, and appropriate. Option A is appropriate, Option B is external, Option C is frequent, and Option D is simple. Option A fits perfectly and chooses A.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the following can be inferred from paragraph 4 about translocation efforts?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Scientific approaches to translocation efforts have increased rapidly.</p><p>B. The current records of success and failure of translocation efforts are not reliable.</p><p>C. Illegal translocations have sometimes been more successful than the legal ones.</p><p>D. The importance of translocation efforts is becoming increasingly apparent as more of these efforts are documented.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>This question refers to the first half of the fourth paragraph of the original text. From Despite to being recorded at all, the general idea of this paragraph is that although there have been a large number of species migration phenomena, there is no evidence to prove the effect of these phenomena. Part of the reason is that many species migrations are not purely for the protection of nature and are not officially legal, so they are rarely scientific in their implementation. A successful migration must be noticed and recorded, but the failure may not be recorded at all. According to this section: Option A says that there are more and more scientific migration methods, and that there are not many mistakes and sciences; Option B says that existing records are not credible and correct; Option C says that illegal migration is more legitimate than migration The success rate is high. This article only said that there are more illegal than legal, and that there is no success rate; Option D says that more and more migrations have been recorded, and the original text says that basically no one recorded the failure. error. Select B.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 5, why did conservationists decide to translocate the Seychelles warbler from Cousin Island to two other islands?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They were unsuccessful in increasing the population of warblers on Cousin Island.</p><p>B. They warbles were originally native to all three islands.</p><p>C. They wanted to ensure that the warbler species would survive a disaster on Cousin Island.</p><p>D. They expected that human activity on Cousin Island would threaten the warblers.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The key words for this question are Seychelles warbler, Cousin Island and two other islands. According to these three words, this sentence:Careful habitat management increased this number to over 300 birds, but the single population yet vulnerable to local catastrophic events. The decision was taken to translocate individuals to two nearby islands to reduce this risk. The general meaning of the sentence is: Seychelles warbler this species was initially endangered, increased to more than 300 after human management, but this population is still no defensive ability for the local catastrophic events. So people decided to introduce them to two other neighboring islands to reduce the risk of extinction. Option A states that people have not succeeded in increasing the number of such birds. The mistake is to increase success. Option B says that this bird is a native of the three islands. It is wrong. The two adjacent islands are later. The talented introduction of the bird; Option C said that they wanted to ensure that the bird could survive the disaster on Cousin Island, right; Option D said human behavior on the Cousin Island would harm the bird, and the mistake was that natural disasters would threaten Their survival. Select C.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 5, why were the howler monkeys in French Guiana translocated?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Local hunting had dramatically reduced their population density.</p><p>B. Predators had significantly reduced the number of individuals.</p><p>C. The females of the species had lost their normal behavioral patterns.</p><p>D. Their original site was going to be significantly modified.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>This question is based on the keywords given by the word howler monkeys and French Guiana. Go to these two sentences: A successful translocation exercise also appears to have been achieved with red howler monkeys in French Guiana. A howler population was translocated from a site due to The second sentence is due to hydroelectric power generation. The second sentence is due to explain why: Hydroelectric power has caused floods and flooded the monkey's habitat. Option A says that the reason is hunting, but Option B says it is because the predator has a lot of prey, wrong; Option C says that the female monkey is misbehaving, not right; Option D matches, saying that the monkey's habitat has been greatly changed. Select D.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>In paragraph 6, the author mentions Dodd and Siegel's review of the translocation of amphibians and reptiles in order to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. help explain the strategies researches use to review translocation efforts.</p><p>B. support the claim that the successes of translocation as a conservation technique have been matched by its failures.</p><p>C. explain why the translocation of reptiles and amphibians is more difficult than that of other animals.</p><p>D. emphasize that translocation techniques have been tried in a limited number of situations.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>This question is based on the keyword keywords amphibians and reptiles positioning to the sixth paragraph, look at the sixth paragraph structure: the first sentence says Unfortunately, the success stories are at least matched by accounts of failure. Then the article begins to take amphibians and reptiles as examples To prove the point of view of the first sentence. Option B meets. Option A states the interpretive strategy. Option C says that explaining why amphibians and reptiles have migrated is more difficult. This is not mentioned in the original text. Option D stresses that the migration technology is used in certain scenarios and is not mentioned. Select B.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>This is not the only example of a large-scale translocation that had positive results..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>This question first analyzes the sentence that needs to be inserted: This is not the only example of a large-scale translocation that had positive results. The beginning of this indicates that the previous article definitely mentioned related things. Only example and not the previous sentence mentioned is also a example. One by one to try four positions that can be inserted, and found that the third position is more consistent. The sentence before this position writes a successful example. The latter sentence specifies the second example of the sentence that needs to be inserted. The positive and also in the two sentences also echo each other. Select C.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>Translocation is used for the reintroduction or reinforcement of species.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.Translocation is used in species conservation, but it can also bring about the spread of disease, introduction of maladaptive genes, and reduction of species diversity.</p><p>B.Until recently, most of the successful translocation efforts were carried out by well-intentioned animal lovers.</p><p>C.Even though there are accounts of successful translocations there have been many that have failed.</p><p>D.A fundamental problem in the evaluation of translocation is the lack of a framework that defines success and determines whether a translocation effort is justified.</p><p>E.It is relatively easy to justify translocation efforts involving species that have been seriously affected by predators or strong competitors, but these efforts are the most difficult to monitor.</p><p>F.Examples like the translocation of the Seychelles warbler and the red howler monkeys in French Guiana demonstrate that each species requires specific translocation approaches and techniques.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="ACD"><p>This question needs to analyze each option in turn. Option A said the good and bad species migration, summed up the second paragraph, you can; Option B mentioned that many successful migrations were implemented by well-meaning animal lovers, this is not mentioned; Option C says that even if it is indeed successful There are many migrations, but there are too many failures. Summarize the contents of the sixth paragraph of the fifth paragraph. Correctly, Option D says that the basic problem of assessing migration is the lack of a framework for the success of the decision, summarizing the contents of the fourth paragraph. You can choose; Option E says that the effect of the migration is easy to prove, wrong, the last sentence of the fourth paragraph is difficult to prove; Option F says that each species needs a specific migration path, which is not mentioned in this source text. .
