Use specific examples and details to support opinion.</p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>I agree that students will learn more if teachers are kind and friendly. First, kind teachers will gain students' love and respect. Just as the old saying goes: "Love me, love my dog." Students will be more willing to listen to the teachers they like in class. Second, when students are faced with difficult questions, they are more likely to ask teachers they consider nice to them. If they regard one teacher as a strict and bad-tempered person, they will avoid asking him questions. So kind and friendly teachers can actually help students to learn more knowledge.</p></article></div></main></body></html>
