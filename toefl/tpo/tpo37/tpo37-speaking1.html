Do you think this requirement is a good idea? Why or why not?</p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>I think let students to have cooking classes is a good idea. First, it is helpful for young kids to learn knowledge of nutrition and health. For example, if our schools teach students to identify junk food, students will avoid themselves to eat it in the future. In addition, cooking is a useful skill in our daily life. For example, we can cook for our family members on their birthday to give them a big surprise. Or we can cook together with our friends at weekends just to have fun. So it will benefit children a lot if they learn to cook at a young age.</p></article></div></main></body></html>
