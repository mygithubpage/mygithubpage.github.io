Up until then, painting, portraits, landscapes, were the way that realistic images were recorded; the image of a person's face, the painting of a mountain range, but with the invention of the camera, now there was this new piece of technology; this machine that took realistic images and this had an enormous effect on painting. One effect was that painters began using photographs as a tool; a tool to help them paint more realistically. Before the camera, it was extremely difficult to realistically depict a moving object in a painting, but now photography was able to capture fleeting moments; freeze them in time and painters were able to use these photographs as a basis for their paintings. For example, the legs of a horse as its running. Photography could now capture the exact position of a horse's legs in midair, which a painter could use to more realistically create a painting of horses galloping. Photography also affected painting in a more conceptual way. The fact that cameras could now perfectly record realistic images led some painters to change their style; to stop painting realistically and adopt a more abstract way of painting. An abstract style enabled painters to contrast their art with photography, to set their art apart from the art of photography. They didn't want their paintings to look anything like photographs. They wanted their art to be more imaginative, more abstract. For example, if a painter were painting people f he or she might not use natural skin tones for the skin and instead paint the people's skin unnatural colors, like green, purple, or blue, which of course is not realistic.</p></article><section id="question"><h4>Question</h4><p>Using points and examples from the lecture, explain two ways that photography affected painting. </p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>In this lecture, the professor talks about two ways in which photography affects painting. First is photography began to be used as a tool helping painters to paint much realistically because photography can capture freezing moments and these can be used as basis for paintings. Such as the pictures of horse legs as running. It can provide the exact position of horse legs to the painters. The second way is photography made painters to gradually adopt abstract style. They wanted to set them apart from photography. For example, when those painters painted human, they would use unnatural colors to depict people's skin such as blue and green which was different from natural colors. </p></article></div></main></body></html>
