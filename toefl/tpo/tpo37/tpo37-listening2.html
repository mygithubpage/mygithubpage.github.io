The differences between mineralization and weathering.</p><p>B. Processes that remove minerals from soil.</p><p>C. Factors affecting the fertility of soil.</p><p>D. Several processes involved in the creation of soil.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The problem of this question is:</p><p>Professor:</p><p>So, we all know soil. It's important to plant growth, right? And we know that there're different types of soil in different places and that some soils are more fertile than others. But what is soil? And how's it formed? Well , we're going to go into this in some depth, but for now let's just lay down the basics. The first words of the professor, especially But what is soil and how is it formed Is to analyze the composition and formation of soil. In conjunction with the full text of the article, we also know that this lecture did speak about the formation of soil. Option D is in accordance with the original text. The remaining three options are incomplete or unrelated. Select D.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>What differences does the professor point out between sand particles and clay minerals? Click on 2 answers</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They combine with organic matter in different ways.</p><p>B. They are formed by different types of weathering.</p><p>C. The rocks they come from have different levels of resistance to weathering.</p><p>D. Only sand particles have the same composition as the rock they come from.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="BD"><p>The professor mentioned two kinds of weathering when inorganic materials were weathered. One is physical and the other is chemical. The physical example is sand. The composition of the weathering process does not change; the examples of chemical are clay minerals. Changed. BD is correct. AC did not mention it and did not choose it. Corresponding author: Weathering can be either physical or chemical. Physical weathering, uh...that's when exposure to the elements over time causes a rock to break up and eventually disintegrate. Uh... of course, some rocks are more resistant to Physical weathering than others. If you think of the sand particles in soil, those are the result of physical weathering, and they have the same chemical composition as the original rock.</p><p>Now, chemical weathering, uh... that's the chemical breakup of rocks. It differs from physical weathering in that the chemical properties of the minerals are actually changed. The clay minerals you find in soil are the result of chemical weathering. Clay minerals are Called secondary minerals, because their composition has been altered.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor point out about the compounds found in organic matter?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They mineralized at different rates.</p><p>B. They may resist combining with minerals in the soil.</p><p>C. They occur in roughly equal amounts in plant tissue.</p><p>D. They contain chemicals that are also found in inorganic materials.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The question title is: And just as some rocks are more resistant than others to weathering, the compounds found in the soil's organic input resist mineralization at different rates. The compound cellulose is the major constituent of most plant tissue. It mineralizes quickly quickly . But there are woody substances in certain plants that strengthen the cell walls. They are found in smaller concentrations and their mineralization can take several years. This section roughly says that rocks are more resistant to weathering than other weathered materials. of. Cellulose, a major plant tissue, will weather very quickly. But other wood materials will weather for several years. So mainly talk about the different weathering rates of different materials. Option A is correct. The other three options are not based on the original text. Select A.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor mention the dark brown color of soil?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To explain that soil gets its color mainly from inorganic inputs.</p><p>B. To indicate that humans is more easily transformed than the other components of soil.</p><p>C. To show how the transformation and combination of inputs create the characteristics of soil.</p><p>D. To discuss how the characteristics of humans are changed by weathering.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The subject of this question is: Weathering and mineralization transform the inorganic and inorganic inputs in a number of ways. And it's partly from these transformations that soil gets its unique properties.</p><p>How does it work?</p><p>Uh... take the dark brown color of soil.</p><p>The dark brown color of soil appears here as an example. The purpose of its appearance needs to be seen above. The above mainly stated that weathering and mineralization transformed organic and inorganic matter that entered the soil in a few years. Just in these transformations the soil has got what it needs. How did this process happen? Take dark brown color soil as an example... So the dark brown soil here is to illustrate the process of this soil formation. Option C is in accordance with the original meaning. The other three options do not match. Select C.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor, how does water affect the composition of soil? Click on 2 answers</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It prevents new soil material from being incorporated.</p><p>B. It separates the components of soil into layers.</p><p>C. It causes chemical changes in the soil's organic material.</p><p>D. It can cause the loss of some of the soil material.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="BD"><p>The problem is: Water carries the more mobile materials from the upper level of soil to the lower levels. So the upper levels of the soil eventually get depleted of these materials, while the lower levels get enriched with them. And The distinct layers of soil as far down as the rock underlying the soil. And the materials that dissolve easily in water can get lost completely if the water carries them horizontally out of the soil and into rivers. This question asks the effects of water flow on the soil composition. There are two main effects: one is that water flows from the top to the bottom, and the minerals in the top layer of the soil are brought to the bottom layer. There are different levels of minerals in different depths of soil. There is also a mineral that is easily dissolved in water. As water enters the river, it is lost. Corresponds to Option B and Option D. The other two options have no basis in the original text. Double-select BD.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor say this:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To draw attention to the complexity of soil formation.</p><p>B. To stress the importance of organic matter in soil formation.</p><p>C. To imply that soil contains other, more important components.</p><p>D. To indicate one way soil can be formed.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The question title is: OK. So, what do you think? If I mix bits of rock with composted vegetables, will I get soil? The answer is no, because the formation of soil is a dynamic process. The professor asked, if I put stones and mixed plants together, can I get the soil? Obviously not. Because the formation of soil is a dynamic process. Option A is in line with the original text. Professors use this question to ask students to think about the composition and formation of soil. The remaining three options do not meet the original meaning. Select A.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
