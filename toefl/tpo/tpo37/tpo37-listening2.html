So, what do you think?<span class="time" data-times="4.96" data-time="40.96">[00:40.96]</span> If I mix bits of rock with composted vegetables, will I get soil?<span class="time" data-times="6.38" data-time="45.92">[00:45.92]</span> The answer is no, because the <span class="highlight">formation</span> of soil is a <span class="highlight">dynamic</span><span class="highlight">process</span>. <span class="time" data-times="11.8" data-time="52.3">[00:52.30]</span>It involves not only the <span class="highlight">initial</span> inputs, the <span class="highlight">raw</span> materials, but also the <span class="highlight">transformation</span> of those materials, and the movement of some of the materials and the loss of others. <span class="time" data-times="5.12" data-time="64.1">[01:04.10]</span>So, the inputs are bits of rock and <span class="highlight">organic</span> matter.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="10.77" data-time="69.22">[01:09.22]</span>Now, the bits of rock, the inorganic input to soil, uh...they come from the breakdown of rocks on Earth's surface <span class="highlight">through</span> a <span class="highlight">process</span> called <span class="highlight">weathering</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.91" data-time="79.99">[01:19.99]</span><span class="highlight">Weathering</span> can be either <span class="highlight">physical</span> or chemical. <span class="time" data-times="8.46" data-time="84.9">[01:24.90]</span><span class="highlight">Physical</span><span class="highlight">weathering</span>, uh...that's when <span class="highlight">exposure</span> to the elements over time causes a rock to <span class="highlight">break</span> up and <span class="highlight">eventually</span><span class="highlight">disintegrate</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.54" data-time="93.36">[01:33.36]</span>Uh... of <span class="highlight">course</span>, some rocks are more <span class="highlight">resistant</span> to <span class="highlight">physical</span><span class="highlight">weathering</span> than others.<span class="time" data-times="9.61" data-time="98.9">[01:38.90]</span>If you think of the sand particles in soil, those are the result of <span class="highlight">physical</span><span class="highlight">weathering</span>, and they have the same chemical <span class="highlight">composition</span> as the <span class="highlight">original</span> rock.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.17" data-time="108.51">[01:48.51]</span>Now, chemical <span class="highlight">weathering</span>, uh... that's the chemical breakup of rocks.<span class="time" data-times="6.84" data-time="114.68">[01:54.68]</span> It differs from <span class="highlight">physical</span><span class="highlight">weathering</span> in that the chemical properties of the minerals are actually changed. <span class="time" data-times="4.91" data-time="121.52">[02:01.52]</span>The <span class="highlight">clay</span> minerals you find in soil are the result of chemical <span class="highlight">weathering</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.01" data-time="126.43">[02:06.43]</span><span class="highlight">Clay</span> minerals are called secondary minerals, because their <span class="highlight">composition</span> has been altered.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.9" data-time="132.44">[02:12.44]</span>Okay. So we have weathered rock, which needs to be combined with <span class="highlight">organic</span> matter.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.73" data-time="139.34">[02:19.34]</span>So what does the <span class="highlight">organic</span> input <span class="highlight">consist</span> of?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.54" data-time="143.07">[02:23.07]</span>It's the remains of plants and animals, but mostly plants. <span class="time" data-times="7.47" data-time="148.61">[02:28.61]</span>Now, just as rocks are broken down by <span class="highlight">weathering</span>, the animal and plant residues are broken down, too. <span class="time" data-times="6.74" data-time="156.08">[02:36.08]</span>They're reduced to simple chemicals by microorganisms in a <span class="highlight">process</span> called <span class="highlight">mineralization</span>. <span class="time" data-times="12.02" data-time="162.82">[02:42.82]</span>And just as some rocks are more <span class="highlight">resistant</span> than others to <span class="highlight">weathering</span>, the compounds found in the soil's <span class="highlight">organic</span> input <span class="highlight">resist</span><span class="highlight">mineralization</span> at different rates. <span class="time" data-times="5.12" data-time="174.84">[02:54.84]</span>The <span class="highlight">compound</span><span class="highlight">cellulose</span> is the <span class="highlight">major</span><span class="highlight">constituent</span> of most plant <span class="highlight">tissue</span>.<span class="time" data-times="2.4" data-time="179.96">[02:59.96]</span> It mineralizes <span class="highlight">relatively</span> quickly. <span class="time" data-times="5.54" data-time="182.36">[03:02.36]</span>But there are woody substances in certain plants that strengthen the <span class="highlight">cell</span> walls. <span class="time" data-times="5.8" data-time="187.9">[03:07.90]</span>They are found in smaller concentrations and their <span class="highlight">mineralization</span> can take several years.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="9.04" data-time="193.7">[03:13.70]</span><span class="highlight">Weathering</span> and <span class="highlight">mineralization</span><span class="highlight">transform</span> the inorganic and <span class="highlight">organic</span> inputs in a number of ways.<span class="time" data-times="5.17" data-time="202.74">[03:22.74]</span> And it's <span class="highlight">partly</span> from these transformations that soil gets its <span class="highlight">unique</span> properties.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="1.59" data-time="207.91">[03:27.91]</span>How does it work?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.93" data-time="209.5">[03:29.50]</span>Uh... take the dark brown color of soil. <span class="time" data-times="12.74" data-time="212.43">[03:32.43]</span>After microorganisms have broken down the <span class="highlight">cellulose</span>, we're left with two things: the microbe's <span class="highlight">waste</span> and the more <span class="highlight">resistant</span> plant <span class="highlight">material</span> that microorganisms can't <span class="highlight">break</span> down easily. <span class="time" data-times="5.96" data-time="225.17">[03:45.17]</span>These materials <span class="highlight">ultimately</span> get transformed into a new <span class="highlight">material</span> called <span class="highlight">humus</span>.<span class="time" data-times="8.1" data-time="231.13">[03:51.13]</span> And when <span class="highlight">humus</span> is combined with the <span class="highlight">clay</span> minerals in soil, that's what gives soil its dark brown color. <span class="time" data-times="10.81" data-time="239.23">[03:59.23]</span>So now, if we've got <span class="highlight">clay</span> and <span class="highlight">humus</span>, these transformed materials, and we mix them together, we've got something very close to soil.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="9.46" data-time="250.04">[04:10.04]</span>But soil isn't <span class="highlight">static</span>, and there're still other processes that go into the <span class="highlight">formation</span> of soil: the movement and loss of materials. <span class="time" data-times="5.07" data-time="259.5">[04:19.50]</span>The soil in any location isn't a <span class="highlight">uniform</span> mixture.<span class="time" data-times="3.03" data-time="264.57">[04:24.57]</span>Its <span class="highlight">composition</span> varies with depth. <span class="time" data-times="5.01" data-time="267.6">[04:27.60]</span>You see, <span class="highlight">mineral</span> and <span class="highlight">organic</span> materials move <span class="highlight">through</span> soil <span class="highlight">vertically</span>.<span class="time" data-times="3.16" data-time="272.61">[04:32.61]</span>Some materials move more easily than others. <span class="time" data-times="5.36" data-time="275.77">[04:35.77]</span>Water carries the more <span class="highlight">mobile</span> materials from the upper <span class="highlight">level</span> of soil to the <span class="highlight">lower</span> levels.<span class="time" data-times="7.63" data-time="281.13">[04:41.13]</span>So the upper levels of the soil <span class="highlight">eventually</span> get <span class="highlight">depleted</span> of these materials, while the <span class="highlight">lower</span> levels get enriched with them. <span class="time" data-times="6.63" data-time="288.76">[04:48.76]</span>And that creates <span class="highlight">distinct</span> layers of soil as far down as the rock <span class="highlight">underlying</span> the soil. <span class="time" data-times="10.01" data-time="295.39">[04:55.39]</span>And the materials that <span class="highlight">dissolve</span> easily in water can get lost completely if the water carries them horizontally out of the soil and into rivers.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="305.4">[05:05.40]</span>Now, of <span class="highlight">course</span>, new <span class="highlight">mineral</span> and <span class="highlight">organic</span><span class="highlight">material</span> will be deposited at the surface and become incorporated into the soil, but you see how the processes of movement and loss <span class="highlight">contribute</span> to the <span class="highlight">formation</span> of soil.</p></p></article></section><div id="question"><div
