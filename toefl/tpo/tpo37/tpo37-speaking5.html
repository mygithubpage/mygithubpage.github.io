Except it's pretty far from campus. It's on the other side of town.</p><p>W: Oh, so you have a pretty long commute to campus then?</p><p>M: Yeah. And now can you believe it? My car broke down.</p><p>W: Oh wow. That's too bad.</p><p>M: Well, the car's pretty old so I'm not surprised it broke down. But it's gonna cost a lot of money to get it fixed. A lot more than I can afford right now.</p><p>W: So what are you gonna do? You need a car to get to campus, right?</p><p>M: Yeah. One option would be to borrow the money to fix the car. I talked to my brother, he's out of school and working now, and he said he'd loan me the money to get it fixed.</p><p>W: That's really nice of him.</p><p>M: Definitely. But if I borrow the money from him, I still have to pay it back pretty soon. That will be tough since I only have a part-time job.</p><p>W: Yeah that could take a while. Do you have any other options?</p><p>M: Well, I'm also thinking if I'm not fixing the car right now. Maybe try to save the money and take the bus or something.</p><p>W: So you can get the bus near your house?</p><p>M: Yeah. There's a bus stop a couple of blocks from my apartment. The trouble is, I have to change buses a couple of times. So it takes a really long time to get to campus. And a long time to get back home. I'd really have to adjust my schedule.</p><p>W: I see. That doesn't sound very convenient.</p></article><section id="question"><h4>Question</h4><p>Briefly summarize the problem the speakers are discussing. Then state which of the two solutions from the conversation you would recommend. Explain the reasons for your recommendation. </p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>In the conversation, the man is facing a problem that his new apartment is far from his university and his car broke down at the same time. Unfortunately, at present he has no money to fix it. He has two solutions now. One is he could borrow money from his friend to fix the car. But he will need to pay it back soon so he will get a part-time job. Second choice is he could change his schedule and take bus to school. However, he will change several buses and spend very long time if he choose this solution. I suppose the first solution is better. Because spending time on a part-time job is much meaningful than spending it on boring bus trips. Also, after fixing his car, it will also become convenient for him to go to supermarket or somewhere else.</p></article></div></main></body></html>
