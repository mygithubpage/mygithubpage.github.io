        <article>
          <p>Listen to a conversation between two students.</p>
          <p>Woman: Some might think you said you wanted to move off campus did you ever find an apartment.</p>
          <p>Man: Yeah I did.</p>
          <p>Woman: So how is it.</p>
          <p>Man: It's great except that it's pretty far from campus it's on the other side of town.</p>
          <p>Woman: So you have a pretty long commute to campus then.</p>
          <p>Man: Yeah and now can you believe it my car broke down.</p>
          <p>Woman: Oh wow that's too bad.</p>
          <p>Man: Well the course pretty old so I'm not surprised it broke down but it's gonna cost a lot of money to get it fixed a lot more than I can afford right now.</p>
          <p>Woman: So what are you gonna do you need a car to get to campus right.</p>
          <p>Man: Yeah one option would be to borrow the money to fix the car I talk to my brother he's out of school and working now and he said he loaned me the money to get it fixed.</p>
          <p>Woman: That's really nice of him.</p>
          <p>Man: Definitely but if I borrow the money from him I still have to pay it back pretty soon that'll be tough since I only have a part time job.</p>
          <p>Woman: Yeah that could take awhile do you have any other options.</p>
          <p>Man: Well I'm also thinking about not fixing the car right now maybe try to save the money and just take the bus or something.</p>
          <p>Woman: So you can get the bus near your house.</p>
          <p>Man: Yeah there's a bus stop a couple of blocks from my apartment trouble is I have to change buses a couple of times so it takes a really long time to get to campus and a long time to get back home I'd really have to adjust my schedule.</p>
          <p>Woman: I see that doesn't sound very convenient.</p>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>In the conversation, the man is facing a problem that his new apartment is far from his university and his car broke down at the same time. Unfortunately, at present he has no money to fix it. He has two solutions now. One is he could borrow money from his friend to fix the car. But he will need to pay it back soon so he will get a part-time job. Second choice is he could change his schedule and take bus to school. However, he will change several buses and spend very long time if he choose this solution. I suppose the first solution is better. Because spending time on a part-time job is much meaningful than spending it on boring bus trips. Also, after fixing his car, it will also become convenient for him to go to supermarket or somewhere else.</p>
