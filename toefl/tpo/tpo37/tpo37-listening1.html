I'm thinking of doing my research paper on this topic, if it's okay with you, of course.</p><p>The general idea of this period of students is: first ask the teacher if he has read an article on the Peruvian Feather and Crafts Exhibition, and then explain that he wants to do some research on this topic if the teacher is willing to do so. Option C is consistent with the question. There is no basis for the original three options. Select C.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the student mention that feathers were transported from the rain forest to the coast in ancient Peru?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To show that he is already thinking about the topic from an anthropological perspective.</p><p>B. To emphasize the similarities between feathers of rain forest birds and coastal birds' feathers.</p><p>C. To give an example of collaboration between two societies.</p><p>D. To compare the means of transportation used by ancient Peruvians to those used today.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The title of this question is:</p><p>Professor:</p><p>They sure are. I saw the exhibition a few days ago. But is that how how you'd approach Peruvian featherwork in your paper? As an art form? Remember you need to take an anthropological angle. Uh, look at this in a way that Tells us something about the people who made this featherwork and the societies they lived in.</p><p>Student:</p><p>Well, absolutely. I read that most of the really colorful feathers came from the rain forest and the societies who used them lived on the coast on the other side of the Andes Mountains, so the feathers had to be carried over the Andes. Featherwork was symbol of high status in ancient Peruvian societies.</p><p>The main meaning of these conversations is: When the teacher listens to the students to introduce the material they have found, he is reminded that he still needs to look for materials from the perspective of anthropology. The students immediately indicated that the materials for this angle were found by themselves, such as colorful feathers came from the rain forest and the societies. It is to prove that he did research from the perspective of anthropology. Option A fits the question. There is no basis for the original three options. Select A.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the student's attitude when he learns that the professor has done research in Peru?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. He is surprised that she is not more familiar with Peruvian featherwork.</p><p>B. He is disappointed that she had not mentioned this in class.</p><p>C. He is eager to hear the details of her experiences there.</p><p>D. He is hopeful that she will be able to help him with his paper.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The title of this question is:</p><p>Student:</p><p>I didn't know you did research in Peru. Maybe...do you think you would be able to help me with this paper?</p><p>This sentence tells us that the student was very pleasantly surprised when he learned that his teacher had gone to Peru for field trips, and he felt that the teacher might be able to give him some help with his research. Option D is consistent with the question. There is no basis for the original three options. Select D.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor, why have few researchers studied featherwork?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Most anthropologists consider featherwork to be of artistic value only.</p><p>B. Few pieces of featherwork have survived.</p><p>C. Featherwork gives little insight into local culture.</p><p>D. Only a small amount of featherwork was created.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The question is: You know, every few pieces of featherwork survive because feathers decay so quickly. Not many people have had the chance to study them up close.</p><p>This is two words that the professor said, meaning that very few feathers and handicrafts can be retained until now because they are too easy to break. So basically no one has the opportunity to study them carefully at close range. Therefore, there are fewer experts in this field. Option B is in accordance with the original text. The remaining three options have no basis in the original text. Select B.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>At the end of the conversation, what does the professor suggest the student do next?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Do some initial background reading on featherwork.</p><p>B. Contact one of her colleagues in Peru.</p><p>C. Attend an exhibition at a museum.</p><p>D. Choose a new research topic.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The title of this question is:</p><p>Professor:</p><p>And of course you can use the information you got at the exhibition as source material too. You've been to the exhibition, haven't you?</p><p>Student:</p><p>Uh, actually...not yet.</p><p>Professor:</p><p>Um...well, it would be a good idea if you went, don't you think?</p><p>It's good that you've done some background reading, but it will make more sense when you actually see the featherwork.</p><p>In the final dialogue, the professor asked if the students had already gone to the exhibition he mentioned at the beginning. The students said no. The professor will further persuade the students to look at it. It is best to look at the real objects of feather crafts. Option C is consistent with the question. The other three options do not meet the original meaning. Select C.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
