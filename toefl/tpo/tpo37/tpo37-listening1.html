            <span class="time" data-times="2.67" data-time="5.64">[00:05.64]</span>Professor: Well, Mathew. Good to see you.<span class="time" data-times="1.01" data-time="8.31">[00:08.31]</span> How can I help you?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.14" data-time="9.32">[00:09.32]</span>Student: Did you happen to read last weekend's art <span class="highlight">section</span> of the newspaper?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.45" data-time="12.46">[00:12.46]</span>Professor: Yes, I did. Why?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.71" data-time="14.91">[00:14.91]</span>Student: Well, you remember the article about an exhibition of <span class="highlight">ancient</span> featherwork pieces from Peru?<span class="time" data-times="4.62" data-time="19.62">[00:19.62]</span> I'm thinking of doing my research paper on this topic, if it's okay with you, of <span class="highlight">course</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.47" data-time="24.24">[00:24.24]</span>I've done some <span class="highlight">additional</span> reading about <span class="highlight">ancient</span> <span class="highlight">Peruvian</span> cultures, how they used brightly colored feathers to <span class="highlight">decorate</span> clothes and <span class="highlight">ceremonial</span> objects.<span class="time" data-times="2.88" data-time="31.71">[00:31.71]</span> From the pictures I'm seen, they are beautiful works of art.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.07" data-time="34.59">[00:34.59]</span>Professor: They sure are. <span class="time" data-times="2.03" data-time="35.66">[00:35.66]</span>I saw the exhibition a few days ago.<span class="time" data-times="3.56" data-time="37.69">[00:37.69]</span> But is that how you'd <span class="highlight">approach</span> <span class="highlight">Peruvian</span> featherwork in your paper? <span class="time" data-times="1.25" data-time="41.25">[00:41.25]</span>As an art form?<span class="time" data-times="3.19" data-time="42.5">[00:42.50]</span> Remember you need to take an anthropological <span class="highlight">angle</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.24" data-time="45.69">[00:45.69]</span>Uh, look at this in a way that tells us something about the people who made this featherwork and the societies they lived in.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="12.2" data-time="51.93">[00:51.93]</span>Student: Well, <span class="highlight">absolutely</span>. I read that most of the really colorful feathers came from the rain forest and the societies who used them lived on the <span class="highlight">coast</span> on the other side of the Andes Mountains, so the feathers had to be carried over the Andes. <span class="time" data-times="4.21" data-time="64.13">[01:04.13]</span>No <span class="highlight">wonder</span> featherwork was <span class="highlight">symbol</span> of high <span class="highlight">status</span> in <span class="highlight">ancient</span> <span class="highlight">Peruvian</span> societies.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.57" data-time="68.34">[01:08.34]</span>Professor: That's <span class="highlight">definitely</span> a long, dangerous <span class="highlight">trip</span> to make on foot.<span class="time" data-times="3.87" data-time="71.91">[01:11.91]</span> I do research down in Peru and I have made that <span class="highlight">trip</span>, but the easy way. <span class="time" data-times="1.46" data-time="75.78">[01:15.78]</span>I've flown and driven.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.2" data-time="77.24">[01:17.24]</span>Student: I didn't know you did research in Peru. <span class="time" data-times="4.13" data-time="79.44">[01:19.44]</span>Maybe...do you think you would be able to help me with this paper?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.32" data-time="83.57">[01:23.57]</span>Professor: I'll be happy to help if I can, but <span class="highlight">Peruvian</span> featherwork isn't my area of <span class="highlight">expertise</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.65" data-time="88.89">[01:28.89]</span>You know, every few pieces of featherwork <span class="highlight">survive</span> because feathers <span class="highlight">decay</span> so quickly. <span class="time" data-times="3.03" data-time="93.54">[01:33.54]</span>Not many people have had the <span class="highlight">chance</span> to study them up close. <span class="time" data-times="4.6" data-time="96.57">[01:36.57]</span>There is a <span class="highlight">handful</span> of experts out there who have, and I could try to <span class="highlight">contact</span> some of them.<span class="time" data-times="4.34" data-time="101.17">[01:41.17]</span> But I think your best <span class="highlight">bet</span> is to keep reading and finding more books and articles.<span class="time" data-times="4.39" data-time="105.51">[01:45.51]</span> And of <span class="highlight">course</span> you can use the information you got at the exhibition as <span class="highlight">source</span> <span class="highlight">material</span> too.<span class="time" data-times="2.77" data-time="109.9">[01:49.90]</span> You've been to the exhibition, haven't you?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.87" data-time="112.67">[01:52.67]</span>Student: Uh, actually...not yet.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.76" data-time="115.54">[01:55.54]</span>Professor: Um...well, it would be a good idea if you went, don't you think?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.7" data-time="119.3">[01:59.30]</span>It's good that you've done some background reading, but it will make more <span class="highlight">sense</span> when you actually see the featherwork. <span class="time" data-times="3.97" data-time="125">[02:05.00]</span>There's a lot of information <span class="highlight">available</span> there from book lists, tour guides. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="128.97">[02:08.97]</span>And you could <span class="highlight">even</span> ask to meet with the curator and ask for her insights.</p>
