Internal processes that help animals maintain constant metabolic rates.</p><p>B. Differences in how animals regulate their body temperatures.</p><p>C. Behaviors that help some animal species survive in extreme environments.</p><p>D. The difficulty of determining whether an animal is an endotherm or an ectotherm.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The problem of this question is:</p><p>Professor:</p><p>So, to review, who remembers how animals are classified in terms of body temperature? Mike?</p><p>Student:</p><p>Um, endotherms and ectotherms?</p><p>Professor:</p><p>Right! All animals are considered either endotherms or ectotherms. Therm-...that means heat, and the main thing that distinguishes endotherms from ectotherms is the source of body heat.</p><p>At the beginning of the lecture, it was clearly pointed out that this class will teach warm-blooded animals and warm-blooded animals (cold-blooded animals). This division is based on how they maintain their body temperature. The following content is also the difference between the two types of animal body temperature regulation. Option B is correct. The remaining three options do not provide a good overview of the text. Select B.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor, what is distinctive about brown fat?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It produces large amounts of triglyceride.</p><p>B. It provides fuel for muscle movement.</p><p>C. It produces heat without muscle movement.</p><p>D. It insulates internal organs from the cold.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The problem of this question is:</p><p>And then there's what's known as brown fat, like other kinds of fat, it stores triiodothyronine, but brown fat is unique because it chemically lots of heat even without muscle movement. That's the beneficial profit for small mammals in colder climates. What makes brown fat unique is that it can produce a lot of calories without muscle activity, which is important for small mammals in cold weather. Option C is in accordance with the original meaning. The remaining three options are not based on the original text. Select C.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor mention elephants?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To contrast them with small animals that live in extremely cold environments.</p><p>B. To show an important behavioral difference between two mammal species.</p><p>C. To emphasize that body size helps determine an animal's metabolic rate.</p><p>D. To indicate that endotherms may use behavior to help regulate body temperature.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The problem of this question is:</p><p>Professor:</p><p>Well, a human, you know, might put on a winter coat or jump in a swimming pool, or elephants, elephants might splash themselves with cold water when it's warm out, but for the most part, no. It's not what we endotherms do That keeps our temperatures within range, unlike ectotherms. Elephants splash themselves with cold water when they are hot. For example, mammals can regulate their own body temperature through some practices. Option D is in accordance with the original meaning. The other three options do not match. Select D.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor emphasize about the metabolic rate of ectotherms?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It is regulated by taking short, quick breaths.</p><p>B. It varies throughout the day.</p><p>C. It is much slower than the metabolic rate of endotherms.</p><p>D. It increases to help the animals survive a sudden drop in temperature.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The problem of this question is:</p><p>It's just that metabolism in ectotherms is so much lower. I mean, the metabolic rate of an endotherm, say, a mouse, is at least six or seven times that of an ectotherm of a similar size like a frog or a lizard. The sentence states the difference in metabolic efficiency between the two types of animals. Metabolic animals have a much lower metabolic rate than warm-blooded animals. The metabolic rate of a mouse's New City is six or seven times the same volume of warmed animals, such as frogs or lizards. Option C meets this meaning. The other three options do not match. Select C.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What happens to an ectotherm in a temperature chamber?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It regulates its temperature by behaving in certain ways.</p><p>B. It shivers when the chamber's temperature is lowered.</p><p>C. Its metabolism remains unchanged.</p><p>D. Its body temperature matches the temperature inside the chamber.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The problem of this question is:</p><p>So you put that same lizard in a temperature controlled chamber and gradually drop the temperature, say, 20 degrees, and here of course, the lizard can't go off to lie in the sun. So what happens?</p><p>Student:</p><p>Well, the lizard's body temperature drops too.</p><p>Professor:</p><p>Right...</p><p>Temperature-changing animals in the thermostat, for example, put the lizards in and gradually lower the temperature, and keep reducing the temperature by 20 degrees. We know that lizards do not heat up when the sun burns. Will they be frozen? The student will not answer, and the lizard's own body temperature will decrease. The teacher said yes. Therefore, the body temperature of cold-blooded animals can change according to changes in outside temperature. Option D is in accordance with the original meaning. The other three options do not match. Select D.</p></div></div><div class="replay" id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor says this:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To indicate that the student's assertion is correct.</p><p>B. To introduce a fact she thinks will surprise the student.</p><p>C. To point out the effectiveness of the frog's defense mechanisms.</p><p>D. To find out what the student knows about extreme environments.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The problem of this question is:</p><p>Student:</p><p>But an ectotherm probably wouldn't survive in a place where the temperatures got too low, right?</p><p>Professor:</p><p>Ever heard a frog being chased by a polar bear?</p><p>Student:</p><p>No.</p><p>Professor:</p><p>Well, there you are.</p><p>The main part of the re-hearing is that the student tentatively asks whether the warmed animal can not survive in a particularly cold place. The teacher asked him if he had seen the frog being chased by the polar bear. The student did not answer it. The teacher said it was. This means that polar bears are warm-blooded animals and they live in extremely cold places, and there are no frogs in extremely cold places. Warm-blooded animals cannot live. So it is a confirmation of the students' initial statement. Option A is correct. The remaining three options are misunderstood. Select A.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
