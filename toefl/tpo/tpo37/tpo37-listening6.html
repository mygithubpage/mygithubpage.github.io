            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.99" data-time="3.29">[00:03.29]</span>Professor: So, to <span class="highlight">review</span>, who remembers how animals are classified in terms of body <span class="highlight">temperature</span>? Mike?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.77" data-time="11.28">[00:11.28]</span>Student: Um, endotherms and ectotherms?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.27" data-time="14.05">[00:14.05]</span>Professor: Right! All animals are considered either endotherms or ectotherms. <span class="time" data-times="10.35" data-time="20.32">[00:20.32]</span>Therm-that means heat, and the main thing that distinguishes endotherms from ectotherms is the <span class="highlight">source</span> of body heat.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.3" data-time="30.67">[00:30.67]</span>So an <span class="highlight">endotherm</span>, endo- meaning <span class="highlight">internal</span>, an <span class="highlight">endotherm</span>'s body heat mainly comes from inside its body. <span class="time" data-times="4.18" data-time="39.97">[00:39.97]</span>It can <span class="highlight">generate</span> its own heat internally with its <span class="highlight">metabolism</span>. <span class="time" data-times="13.79" data-time="44.15">[00:44.15]</span>And an <span class="highlight">ectotherm</span>, ecto- meaning <span class="highlight">external</span>, an <span class="highlight">ectotherm</span> gets its body heat mainly from outside its own body, meaning from its environment, mostly from the sun's <span class="highlight">radiation</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.3" data-time="57.94">[00:57.94]</span>So we've got endotherms. <span class="time" data-times="3.86" data-time="60.24">[01:00.24]</span>Mammals and birds are the classes that fall under this <span class="highlight">category</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.1" data-time="64.1">[01:04.10]</span>And ectotherms, that's <span class="highlight">pretty</span> much everything else, including reptiles, amphibians, insects.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.01" data-time="72.2">[01:12.20]</span>Now, body <span class="highlight">temperature</span> is important. <span class="time" data-times="12.06" data-time="75.21">[01:15.21]</span>And if an animal's environment gets very hot or very cold, something needs to happen in order for the animal to <span class="highlight">maintain</span> its body <span class="highlight">temperature</span> <span class="highlight">within</span> its normal <span class="highlight">range</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.82" data-time="87.27">[01:27.27]</span>In endotherms, this is mostly <span class="highlight">physiological</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.55" data-time="91.09">[01:31.09]</span>The body changes its <span class="highlight">rate</span> of heat production.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.55" data-time="94.64">[01:34.64]</span>Okay, well, humans are endotherms. <span class="time" data-times="4.03" data-time="98.19">[01:38.19]</span>What does your body automatically do when it gets really cold?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="0.83" data-time="102.22">[01:42.22]</span>Student: Shiver?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.09" data-time="103.05">[01:43.05]</span>Professor: Right, shivering. <span class="time" data-times="10.03" data-time="105.14">[01:45.14]</span>In fact, any <span class="highlight">muscle</span> movement increases <span class="highlight">metabolism</span>, the <span class="highlight">process</span> that produces heat and keeps your body <span class="highlight">temperature</span> up when your surroundings get cold.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="14.89" data-time="115.17">[01:55.17]</span>And then there's what's known as brown fat, like other kinds of fat, it stores triiodothyronine, but brown fat is <span class="highlight">unique</span> because it chemically produces lots of heat <span class="highlight">even</span> without <span class="highlight">muscle</span> movement. <span class="time" data-times="3.87" data-time="130.06">[02:10.06]</span>That's especially <span class="highlight">beneficial</span> for small mammals in colder climates. <span class="time" data-times="7.99" data-time="133.93">[02:13.93]</span>And when an animal gets too hot, well, have you ever seen a dog cooling off by taking short, quick breaths? <span class="time" data-times="6.12" data-time="141.92">[02:21.92]</span>And humans, we <span class="highlight">sweat</span>, of <span class="highlight">course</span>, perspire, which also gets rid of body heat. <span class="time" data-times="4.23" data-time="148.04">[02:28.04]</span>These are <span class="highlight">automatic</span>, <span class="highlight">physiological</span> responses too. <span class="time" data-times="1.93" data-time="152.27">[02:32.27]</span>Yes, Sally?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.42" data-time="154.2">[02:34.20]</span>Student: So, in endotherms it's really not about <span class="highlight">behavior</span>, about doing things.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="14.28" data-time="161.62">[02:41.62]</span>Professor: Well, a human, you know, might put on a winter coat or jump in a swimming pool, or elephants, elephants might <span class="highlight">splash</span> themselves with cold water when it's warm out, but for the most part, no. <span class="time" data-times="6.88" data-time="175.9">[02:55.90]</span>It's not what we endotherms do that keeps our temperatures <span class="highlight">within</span> <span class="highlight">range</span>, unlike ectotherms.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.49" data-time="182.78">[03:02.78]</span>Student: Well, what about ectotherms, like frogs? <span class="time" data-times="2.04" data-time="187.27">[03:07.27]</span>They must have <span class="highlight">metabolism</span> too.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.44" data-time="189.31">[03:09.31]</span>Professor: Sure they do.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.49" data-time="190.75">[03:10.75]</span>It's just that <span class="highlight">metabolism</span> in ectotherms is so much <span class="highlight">lower</span>. <span class="time" data-times="13.22" data-time="195.24">[03:15.24]</span>I mean, the <span class="highlight">metabolic</span> <span class="highlight">rate</span> of an <span class="highlight">endotherm</span>, say, a mouse, is at <span class="highlight">least</span> six or seven times that of an <span class="highlight">ectotherm</span> of a <span class="highlight">similar</span> size like a frog or a <span class="highlight">lizard</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.2" data-time="208.46">[03:28.46]</span>An <span class="highlight">ectotherm</span> doesn't <span class="highlight">generate</span> nearly as much heat internally. <span class="time" data-times="4.81" data-time="212.66">[03:32.66]</span>So its body <span class="highlight">temperature</span> will <span class="highlight">tend</span> to equalize with the <span class="highlight">temperature</span> of its surroundings. <span class="time" data-times="3" data-time="217.47">[03:37.47]</span>And that's where <span class="highlight">behavior</span> comes in. <span class="time" data-times="4.63" data-time="220.47">[03:40.47]</span>Imagine a <span class="highlight">lizard</span>, okay, living in the <span class="highlight">desert</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.43" data-time="225.1">[03:45.10]</span>Now, a <span class="highlight">desert</span> gets very cold at night and very hot during the day. <span class="time" data-times="4.49" data-time="230.53">[03:50.53]</span>So what does the <span class="highlight">lizard</span> do to <span class="highlight">maintain</span> its body <span class="highlight">temperature</span>? <span class="time" data-times="11.03" data-time="235.02">[03:55.02]</span>Well, on a cold morning, it can warm itself by going to a sunny <span class="highlight">spot</span> and lying in the sun, and later if it gets too hot, it can seek out a cool place in the <span class="highlight">shade</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.31" data-time="246.05">[04:06.05]</span>It's by means of such <span class="highlight">behavior</span> that an <span class="highlight">ectotherm</span> like this <span class="highlight">lizard</span> regulates its <span class="highlight">temperature</span>. <span class="time" data-times="11.97" data-time="253.36">[04:13.36]</span>But you put that same <span class="highlight">lizard</span> in a <span class="highlight">temperature</span> controlled <span class="highlight">chamber</span> and <span class="highlight">gradually</span> <span class="highlight">drop</span> the <span class="highlight">temperature</span>, say, 20 degrees, and here of <span class="highlight">course</span>, the <span class="highlight">lizard</span> can't go off to lie in the sun. <span class="time" data-times="1.96" data-time="265.33">[04:25.33]</span>So what happens?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.08" data-time="267.29">[04:27.29]</span>Student: Well, the <span class="highlight">lizard</span>'s body <span class="highlight">temperature</span> drops too.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.89" data-time="270.37">[04:30.37]</span>Professor: Right, and this really slows down its <span class="highlight">metabolism</span>, which depends on <span class="highlight">temperature</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9.15" data-time="277.26">[04:37.26]</span> <span class="highlight">Even</span> that 20 degrees <span class="highlight">drop</span> in body <span class="highlight">temperature</span> though, the <span class="highlight">lizard</span> can <span class="highlight">survive</span> that no problem, and come out just fine when it warms up again. <span class="time" data-times="2.09" data-time="286.41">[04:46.41]</span>Ectotherms can do that.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.68" data-time="288.5">[04:48.50]</span>Student: But an <span class="highlight">ectotherm</span> probably wouldn't <span class="highlight">survive</span> in a place where the temperatures got too low, right?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.4" data-time="295.18">[04:55.18]</span>Professor: Ever heard a frog being chased by a <span class="highlight">polar</span> <span class="highlight">bear</span>?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="0.94000000000002" data-time="298.58">[04:58.58]</span>Student: No.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.82" data-time="299.52">[04:59.52]</span>Professor: Well, there you are. <span class="time" data-times="8" data-time="301.34">[05:01.34]</span>Now a mouse in the same situation, in the same <span class="highlight">temperature</span> <span class="highlight">chamber</span>, is just the <span class="highlight">opposite</span> of the <span class="highlight">lizard</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.6" data-time="309.34">[05:09.34]</span>When the <span class="highlight">temperature</span> goes down, the mouse's <span class="highlight">metabolism</span> goes up. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="313.94">[05:13.94]</span>Like any <span class="highlight">endotherm</span>, it starts producing more heat to keep its body <span class="highlight">temperature</span> <span class="highlight">stable</span>, same as it would do outside in a <span class="highlight">field</span>.</p>
