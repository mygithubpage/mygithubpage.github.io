I think this is unnecessary, and the university should remove the phones from student's rooms. Room phones are not needed since students all have phones we can use to make calls instead. Removing the room phones would also have a cost benefit for students, since we would save money if we didn't have to pay the cost of phone service for the rooms.</p></article><div><audio src="tpo37-speaking3.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></div><article id="listening-passage" class="passage"><h3>Listening Text</h3><p>Now listen to two students discussing the letter.</p><p>W: Hey Jimmy! Did you read this?</p><p>M: I did, yeah. What do you think about it?</p><p>W: I don't know. I don't think it'd be a very good idea.</p><p>M: Oh yeah? But it's true that a lot of us have our own phones.</p><p>W: Yeah, but it's good to have both. The service we get with our own phones isn't always reliable. Maybe it's because there're a lot of hills around here, but my service doesn't work that well in this area. A lot of times calls get cut off where the reception isn't good. I can't hear the person on the other line.</p><p>M: Yeah, I've had some friends say that too actually.</p><p>W: So it's good to have a backup option; something we can use if our own phones aren't working.</p><p>M: I see what you mean, but when you think of the money...</p><p>W: Well if I don't buy his argument there either because I don't know if you've noticed this on the housing bill we get from the university, but right now we only pay per call.</p><p>M: Oh really?</p><p>W: Yeah, so if you don't make many calls, you don't pay much. I mean, if you use it a lot of course you'll pay more, but students can avoid that if they just avoid using it as much as possible.</p><p>M: Oh, I see. Ok...</p><p>W: So, I think they should just keep it the way it is now.</p></article><section id="question"><h4>Question</h4><p>The woman express her opinion about the proposal described in the letter. Briefly summarize the proposal. Then state her opinion about the proposal and explain the reasons she gives for holding that opinion. </p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>In the letter it is proposed that the phone in students' rooms should be removed. First reason is students now all have their own phones so the room phones are unnecessary. Second reason is if school stops the phone service, students will no longer need to pay the phone fees so they will save some money. But the woman thinks it is not a good idea. On the one hand, she thinks students' phones are not reliable all the time. Sometimes the signals will be cut off or the reception will be bad. So room phones are necessary for students as a backup option. On the other hand, she points that students only need to pay when they use room phones. If they don't use the room phone, they need to pay nothing. So most of them only need to pay little money on this service. </p></article></div></main></body></html>
