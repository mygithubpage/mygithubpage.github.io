          <h4 class="w3-center">Room Phones Are Unnecessary</h4>
          <p>As part of the cost of student housing, students play to have phones in their dormitory rooms. I think this is unnecessary, and the university should remove the phones from student's rooms. Room phones are not needed since students all have phones we can use to make calls instead. Removing the room phones would also have a cost benefit for students, since we would save money if we didn't have to pay the cost of phone service for the rooms.</p>

          <p>Now listen to two students discussing the latter.</p>
          <p>Woman: Hey Jimmy did you read this.</p>
          <p>Man: I did yeah what do you think about it.</p>
          <p>Woman: I don't know I don't think ID be a very good idea.</p>
          <p>Man: Oh yeah but it's true that a lot of us have our own phones.</p>
          <p>Man: Yeah but it's good to have both.</p>
          <p>Woman: The service we get with our own phones isn't always reliable maybe it's because there are a lot of hills around here but my service doesn't work that well in this area a lot of times because get cut off for the reception isn't good.</p>
          <p>Woman: I can hear the person on the other line.</p>
          <p>Man: Yeah I've had some friends say that too actually.</p>
          <p>Woman: So it's good to have a back up option something we can use of our own phones aren't working.</p>
          <p>Man: I see what you mean but when you think of the money.</p>
          <p>Man: Well.</p>
          <p>Woman: I don't buy his argument there either because I don't know if you've noticed this on the housing bill we get from the university but right now we only pay per call.</p>
          <p>Man: Though really.</p>
          <p>Woman: Yeah so if you don't make many calls you don't pay much I mean if you use a lot of course you'll pay more but students can avoid that if they just avoid using it as much as possible.</p>
          <p>Man: Oh I see okay.</p>
          <p>Woman: So I think they should just keep it the way it is now.</p>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>In the letter it is proposed that the phone in students' rooms should be removed. First reason is students now all have their own phones so the room phones are unnecessary. Second reason is if school stops the phone service, students will no longer need to pay the phone fees so they will save some money. But the woman thinks it is not a good idea. On the one hand, she thinks students' phones are not reliable all the time. Sometimes the signals will be cut off or the reception will be bad. So room phones are necessary for students as a backup option. On the other hand, she points that students only need to pay when they use room phones. If they don't use the room phone, they need to pay nothing. So most of them only need to pay little money on this service.</p>
