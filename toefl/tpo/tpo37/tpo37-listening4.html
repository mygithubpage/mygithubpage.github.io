              <span class="time" data-times="5.38" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to a <span class="underline">conversation</span> between a student and a university theater manager.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.87" data-time="5.38">[00:05.38]</span>Student: I'm sorry if my email wasn't <span class="underline">clear</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2" data-time="8.25">[00:08.25]</span>It's probably best that we are meeting now. <span class="time" data-times="1.48" data-time="10.25">[00:10.25]</span>I have a lot of questions.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="0.89" data-time="11.73">[00:11.73]</span>Manager: So do I. <span class="time" data-times="3.78" data-time="12.62">[00:12.62]</span>But first let me say that I'm so glad that this tradition is continuing. <span class="time" data-times="4.6" data-time="16.4">[00:16.40]</span>I guess for the last twenty years now, every <span class="underline">senior</span> classes put on a Shakespeare Play.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.59" data-time="21">[00:21.00]</span>Student: It won't be anything like the drama <span class="underline">department</span>'s productions in the main theater, but we are really excited. <span class="time" data-times="1.73" data-time="26.59">[00:26.59]</span>We are doing "As You Like It" this year.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.24" data-time="28.32">[00:28.32]</span>Manager: Great! Let's start with the timing. <span class="time" data-times="4.63" data-time="30.56">[00:30.56]</span>You want the production to run on two <span class="underline">consecutive</span> nights, Thursday and Friday?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="0.86" data-time="35.19">[00:35.19]</span>Student: Right. <span class="time" data-times="1.54" data-time="36.05">[00:36.05]</span>The end of April will be best. <span class="time" data-times="1.83" data-time="37.59">[00:37.59]</span>Maybe the last Thursday and Friday? <span class="time" data-times="1.62" data-time="39.42">[00:39.42]</span>We are <span class="underline">flexible</span> with the dates.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.71" data-time="41.04">[00:41.04]</span>Manager: The only bookings at the small theater are some recitals in the beginning of the month, so I'll make sure to get it on the <span class="underline">calendar</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.61" data-time="47.75">[00:47.75]</span>But you other questions...let's see. <span class="time" data-times="2.56" data-time="50.36">[00:50.36]</span>You want to use fire on <span class="underline">stage</span>?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.06" data-time="52.92">[00:52.92]</span>Student: Well, our idea is to <span class="underline">reproduce</span> the conditions of an Elizabethan playhouse, make it as <span class="underline">authentic</span> as possible. <span class="time" data-times="3.03" data-time="58.98">[00:58.98]</span>And of <span class="underline">course</span>, they didn't have electric lights 500 years ago. <span class="time" data-times="3.92" data-time="62.01">[01:02.01]</span>So we thought if we had candles, a lot of candles actually...</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.33" data-time="65.93">[01:05.93]</span>Manager: To light the <span class="underline">stage</span>?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.34" data-time="67.26">[01:07.26]</span>Student: Yeah.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.76" data-time="68.6">[01:08.60]</span>Manager: Okay. Um...you'd need a <span class="underline">special</span> <span class="underline">permit</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.51" data-time="72.36">[01:12.36]</span>You could get one from the city <span class="underline">council</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.59" data-time="74.87">[01:14.87]</span>But for one thing, it's difficult and time-consuming to get <span class="underline">permission</span> and expensive. <span class="time" data-times="6.58" data-time="80.46">[01:20.46]</span>And it's not just a <span class="underline">permit</span>, you'll have to <span class="underline">pay</span> for an <span class="underline">inspection</span> and to have a fire marshal present at the shows.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.57" data-time="87.04">[01:27.04]</span>Student: That does <span class="underline">sound</span> expensive. <span class="time" data-times="5.17" data-time="88.61">[01:28.61]</span>If we had a <span class="underline">budget</span> like the drama <span class="underline">department</span>...but it looks like we'll have to <span class="underline">scale</span> back a bit.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.57" data-time="93.78">[01:33.78]</span>Manager: Are you charging <span class="underline">admission</span>?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.77" data-time="95.35">[01:35.35]</span>Student: There will be a small <span class="underline">admission</span> fee. <span class="time" data-times="3.95" data-time="97.12">[01:37.12]</span>In Shakespeare's time, if you paid a little more, you got a more comfortable seat. <span class="time" data-times="1.8" data-time="101.07">[01:41.07]</span>I don't see how we could do that though. <span class="time" data-times="2.09" data-time="102.87">[01:42.87]</span>I mean, all the seats are the same, right?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.33" data-time="104.96">[01:44.96]</span>Manager: Right. I guess you could charge more for the seats upfront, but it's a small theater.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.72" data-time="110.29">[01:50.29]</span>Student: And there isn't much <span class="underline">difference</span> between the front and the back.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.85" data-time="113.01">[01:53.01]</span>Manager: Anyway, for lighting, you could buy those electric lanterns that are made to look as if they had a natural <span class="underline">flame</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.84" data-time="118.86">[01:58.86]</span>Student: If that's the best we can do, not exactly <span class="underline">authentic</span>, though.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.69" data-time="122.7">[02:02.70]</span>Manager: But safer and less expensive. <span class="time" data-times="1.46" data-time="125.39">[02:05.39]</span>And about the food...</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.4" data-time="126.85">[02:06.85]</span>Student: Selling food was also done in Shakespeare's time. <span class="time" data-times="2.02" data-time="129.25">[02:09.25]</span>It's related to the candles actually. <span class="time" data-times="5.98" data-time="131.27">[02:11.27]</span>When the candles burn down, they stops the play so they can bring out new ones, and that's when they sold snacks. <span class="time" data-times="2.71" data-time="137.25">[02:17.25]</span>That's how the <span class="underline">custom</span> of having an intermission started.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.56" data-time="139.96">[02:19.96]</span>Manager: I always thought intermissions began as a way to change the <span class="underline">scenery</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.86" data-time="143.52">[02:23.52]</span>Student: Oh, speaking of <span class="underline">scenery</span>...do you have the <span class="underline">exact</span> dimensions of the <span class="underline">stage</span>?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="148.38">[02:28.38]</span>Manager: Sure.</p>
