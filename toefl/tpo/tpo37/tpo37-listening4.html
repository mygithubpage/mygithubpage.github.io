I guess for the last twenty years now, every senior classes put on a Shakespeare Play.</p><p>The beginning of this dialogue shows that the female students came to the teacher for further talk about what they said in their emails. The teacher said that the girls wanted to organize a Shakespearean theatrical performance. Option C is in accordance with the original meaning. The remaining three options are not based on the original text. Select C.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the student imply about the drama department's productions?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The drama department typically performs more traditional types of plays than the senior class does.</p><p>B.

If we had a budget like the drama department...but it looks like we'll have to scale back a bit.</p><p>Here I mentioned the cost of a lot of candles. The girls indicated that they were very expensive. If they could have the budget of the drama department, they would be able to afford the money. So they actually have no money, we must reduce the scale. These words tell us that the drama department has more resources. Option C is in accordance with the original meaning.

You could get one from the city council. But for one thing, it's difficult and time- consuming to get permission and expensive. And it's not just a permit, you'll Have to pay for an inspection and to have a fire marshal present at the shows.</p><p>This paragraph of dialogue is the teacher to tell the girls how to apply can point so many candles. The first thing is to go to the city council and ask for a permit. It is very expensive and difficult to do. And a permit is not enough, but also to spend money to ask a supervisor and a master of candles, to perform together. Therefore, it is unrealistic for girls to apply for permit. Option B follows the original meaning. The remaining three options do not have the basis in the original text. Select B.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>How does the student feel about the idea of charging more for some seats than for others?
