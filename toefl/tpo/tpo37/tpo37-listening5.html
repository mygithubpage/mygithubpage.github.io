data-times="4.28" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in an art <span class="highlight">history</span> class.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.38" data-time="4.28">[00:04.28]</span>Professor: I'm sure you've all heard of the Mona Lisa, the famous painting by Leonardo Da Vinci. <span class="time" data-times="6.51" data-time="9.66">[00:09.66]</span>The Mona Lisa is a <span class="highlight">portrait</span> of a woman and it's thought to be the <span class="highlight">portrait</span> of Lisa Gherardini but that's not certain. <span class="time" data-times="3.5" data-time="16.17">[00:16.17]</span>In fact, many things about the Mona Lisa <span class="highlight">remain</span> a mystery. <span class="time" data-times="10.71" data-time="19.67">[00:19.67]</span>For example, we don't know exactly who commissioned the painting or how long Da Vinci worked on it and there are actually many scholars who think the mystery makes the painting more interesting. <span class="time" data-times="7.1" data-time="30.38">[00:30.38]</span>I think it places unfortunate limits on our analyses, makes it hard to make strong arguments about the painting.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="11.29" data-time="37.48">[00:37.48]</span>Anyway, getting to the point: most people today might have never heard of the Mona Lisa, or of many other now famous works of art for that matter, if it hadn't been for Giorgio Vasari.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.18" data-time="48.77">[00:48.77]</span>Giorgio Vasari was an Italian painter, <span class="highlight">architect</span> and <span class="highlight">scholar</span>. <span class="time" data-times="14.52" data-time="52.95">[00:52.95]</span>In the mid fifteen hundreds, he wrote a book called Lives of the Most <span class="highlight">Eminent</span> Painters, Sculptors and Architects in which he describes, among many other things, the features of the Mona Lisa, including her famous smile. <span class="time" data-times="5.85" data-time="67.47">[01:07.47]</span>This book drew a lot of <span class="highlight">attention</span> to Da Vinci and <span class="highlight">significantly</span> increased the Mona Lisa's fame.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="11.97" data-time="73.32">[01:13.32]</span>As the title suggests, Lives of the Most <span class="highlight">Eminent</span> Painters, Sculptors and Architects includes biographies not only of Da Vinci but also of many other now famous Italian <span class="highlight">renaissance</span> artists. <span class="time" data-times="10.29" data-time="85.29">[01:25.29]</span>This was the first time that a European author had made the <span class="highlight">personal</span> lives of the artists a central <span class="highlight">component</span> of an art <span class="highlight">history</span> book and many a later author followed the example. <span class="time" data-times="4.76" data-time="95.58">[01:35.58]</span>The more important the artist in Vasari's view, the longer their biography in the book.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="18.15" data-time="100.34">[01:40.34]</span>And by far, the longest of the biographies, is that of Michelangelo, the painter of the Sistine <span class="highlight">Chapel</span> ceiling and <span class="highlight">sculptor</span> of the famous <span class="highlight">statue</span> of David, whose work Vasari adopted as his benchmark, his <span class="highlight">reference</span> point for evaluating everyone else's artwork.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="10.87" data-time="118.49">[01:58.49]</span>Many of the biographies are extremely detailed with all the <span class="highlight">basic</span> facts about where the artists were born, where they'd worked, who their teachers were and so on.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.07" data-time="129.36">[02:09.36]</span>But I read Vasari's book cover to cover almost every summer. <span class="time" data-times="15.31" data-time="133.43">[02:13.43]</span>I find it a great way to unwind during the summer <span class="highlight">break</span> and what keeps me coming back to it are the anecdotes, <span class="highlight">fascinating</span> anecdotes, that give you glimpses in the artist's private lives, their dreams, their fears, their virtues, their vices.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="18.29" data-time="148.74">[02:28.74]</span>In his book, Vasari also tackled, quite successfully I might add, the <span class="highlight">enormous</span> task of sorting out which works had been done by which artists, which works belong in the same <span class="highlight">stylistic</span> categories, which works belong in <span class="highlight">similar</span> categories in terms of <span class="highlight">quality</span> and so on, <span class="highlight">stuff</span> you take for granted today. <span class="time" data-times="4.7" data-time="167.03">[02:47.03]</span>But again, Vasari was the first European author to do that.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.9" data-time="171.73">[02:51.73]</span>A word of <span class="highlight">caution</span> though: Vasari was not at all averse to, how should I put it, modifying the facts. <span class="time" data-times="10.55" data-time="178.63">[02:58.63]</span>For example, in his book, he has a touching description of Da Vinci's death, in which Da Vinci dies in the arms of his last patron: The king of France, Francis the First.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.28" data-time="189.18">[03:09.18]</span>Now, Da Vinci did spend the last years of his life working in the <span class="highlight">court</span> of Francis the First. <span class="time" data-times="9.19" data-time="194.46">[03:14.46]</span>Vasari seemed to have overlooked a <span class="highlight">minor</span><span class="highlight">detail</span>, however, the well documented fact that the king was far away when Da Vinci breathed his last breath. <span class="time" data-times="3.45" data-time="203.65">[03:23.65]</span>But why let the fact stand in the way of a great story, right? <span class="time" data-times="9.87" data-time="207.1">[03:27.10]</span>Since Vasari's tales are, as I've said, so <span class="highlight">compelling</span> and because they have been repeated by so many <span class="highlight">subsequent</span> authors, they're still often taken at face value. <span class="time" data-times="1.26" data-time="216.97">[03:36.97]</span><span class="highlight">Even</span> today. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="218.23">[03:38.23]</span>No questions asked.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the lecture mainly about?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Vasari's efforts to prove a theory about the Mona Lisa.</p><p>B. Vasari's friendships with da Vinci and Michelangelo.</p><p>C. Experiences that shaped Vasari's approach to art history.</p><p>D. The influence of Vasari's book in the field of art history.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The question is: Anyway, getting to the point: most people today might have never heard of the Mona Lisa, or of many other now famous works of art for that matter, if it hadn't been for Giorgio Vasari. The meaning of these sentences is: If not Vasari, many people still do not know Mona Lisa or other famous works of art. Therefore, I mainly want to talk about the influence of the author Vasari on art history. Option D is in accordance with the original meaning. The remaining three options are not based on the original text. Select D.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the professor's attitude toward the mystery associated with the Mona Lisa?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. He is confident that most of the important questions about the painting will eventually be answered.</p><p>B. He is displeased that so little is known about the painting.</p><p>C. He thinks that certain theories about the painting are probably accurate.</p><p>D. He thinks the mystery has made the painting more famous than it deserves to be.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The question is: For example, we don't know exactly who commissioned the painting or how long Da Vinci worked on it and there are many many scholars who think the mystery makes the painting more interesting. I think it goes beyond painting On our analyses, it makes it hard to make strong arguments about the painting. The general idea of this paragraph is: For example, we cannot know exactly who made Mona Lisa for Leonardo da Vinci. How long did he paint? Some scholars believe that these mysteries Make Mona Lisa more interesting. I think that the lack of these materials has limited our analysis. We cannot draw a strong conclusion on this painting. Therefore, the professor is regretful about the mysteries of Mona Lisa. Option B follows the original meaning. The remaining three options are not based on the original text. Select B.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor, what was Vasari the first European writer to do? Click on 2 answers</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Take a biographical approach to art history.</p><p>B. Express negative opinions about popular artists.</p><p>C. Classify works of art in a systematic way.</p><p>D. Ask famous artists to comment on their own work.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="AC"><p>The problem of this question is:</p><p>As the title suggests, Lives of the Most Eminent Pointers, Sculptors and Architects includes biographies not only of Da Vinci but also of many other now famous Italian renaissance artists. This was the first time that a European author has made the personal lives of the artists a central component of an art history book and many a later author followed the example. The more important the artist in Vasari's view, the longer their biography in the book.</p><p>In his book, Vasari also tackled, quite successfully I might add, the enormous task of sorting out which works had been done by which artists, which works belong in the same stylistic categories, which works belong in similar categories in terms of quality and so On, stuff you take for today, but But again, Vasari was the first European author to do that.</p><p>The two paragraphs correspond to the two options for this question. The first paragraph mainly states that Vasari's biography first wrote about the personal life of the artist. The more important the artist, the greater the proportion of his personal experience in the book; the second paragraph says that Vasari did a great job. In his work, he classified the artist systematically according to his style. This is also the first time in history. Options A and C correspond to the main purpose of these two paragraphs. The other two options are not based on the original text. Double-select AC.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>How did Vasari treat Michelangelo's work in Lives of the most Eminent Painters, Sculptors, and architects?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. He considered Michelangelo's work second only to that of da Vinci.</p><p>B. He questioned whether Michelangelo had in fact painted all the paintings attributed to him.</p><p>C. He intentionally excluded any mention of Michelangelo's earliest works.</p><p>D. He used Michelangelo's work as a standard for judging the work of other artists.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The problem of this question is:</p><p>And by far, the longest of the biographies, is that of Michelangelo, the painter of the Sistine Chapel ceiling and sculptor of the famous statue of David, whose work Vasari adopted as his benchmark, his reference point for evaluating everyone else's artwork. The general idea is that Michelangelo's biography is the longest, and Vasari uses him as a benchmark for measuring other people's works. Option D is a synonym for the original text. The other three options are not. Select D.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What feature of Vasari's discussions of artists does the professor find most interesting?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The descriptions of towns where artists were born.</p><p>B. The information about artists work experience.</p><p>C. The details about artists personal lives.</p><p>D. The grouping of artists into specific movements.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The problem of this question is:</p><p>I find it a great way to unwind during the summer break and what keeps me coming back to it are theecdotes, fascinating anecdotes, that give you glimpses in the artist's private lives, their dreams, their fears, their virtues, their vices. It is the artist's anecdotes that the professor renews his interest in the biography. This allows the reader to understand the private life, dreams, fears, virtues, and vices of the famous masters. So the professor is interested in the artist's private life. Option C is in accordance with the original meaning. The other three options do not meet. Select C.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor mention da Vinci's death?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To point out an emotional difficulty that Vasari experienced when writing his book.</p><p>B. To explain why many scholars today find Vasari's book outdated.</p><p>C. To provide an example of an inaccurate story in Vasari's book.</p><p>D. To provide an example of a relationship between a famous artist and a wealthy patron.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The problem of this question is:</p><p>A word of caution though: Vasari was not at all averse to, how should I put it, modifying the facts. For example, in his book, he has a touching description of Da Vinci's death, in which Da Vinci dies in the arms of His last patron: The king of France, Francis the First. Professor said that it should be noted that Vasari will modify the facts. For example, when describing Leonardo's death, he wrote that Da Vinci died in the arms of a French king. The death of Da Vinci here appears as an example of how Vasari will change the facts. Option C is consistent with the question. The remaining three options are not based on the original text. Select C.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
