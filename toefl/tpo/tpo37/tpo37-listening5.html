            <span class="time" data-times="4.28" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in an art <span class="highlight">history</span> class.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.38" data-time="4.28">[00:04.28]</span>Professor: I'm sure you've all heard of the Mona Lisa, the famous painting by Leonardo Da Vinci. <span class="time" data-times="6.51" data-time="9.66">[00:09.66]</span>The Mona Lisa is a <span class="highlight">portrait</span> of a woman and it's thought to be the <span class="highlight">portrait</span> of Lisa Gherardini but that's not certain. <span class="time" data-times="3.5" data-time="16.17">[00:16.17]</span>In fact, many things about the Mona Lisa <span class="highlight">remain</span> a mystery. <span class="time" data-times="10.71" data-time="19.67">[00:19.67]</span>For example, we don't know exactly who commissioned the painting or how long Da Vinci worked on it and there are actually many scholars who think the mystery makes the painting more interesting. <span class="time" data-times="7.1" data-time="30.38">[00:30.38]</span>I think it places unfortunate limits on our analyses, makes it hard to make strong arguments about the painting.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="11.29" data-time="37.48">[00:37.48]</span>Anyway, getting to the point: most people today might have never heard of the Mona Lisa, or of many other now famous works of art for that matter, if it hadn't been for Giorgio Vasari.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.18" data-time="48.77">[00:48.77]</span>Giorgio Vasari was an Italian painter, <span class="highlight">architect</span> and <span class="highlight">scholar</span>. <span class="time" data-times="14.52" data-time="52.95">[00:52.95]</span>In the mid fifteen hundreds, he wrote a book called Lives of the Most <span class="highlight">Eminent</span> Painters, Sculptors and Architects in which he describes, among many other things, the features of the Mona Lisa, including her famous smile. <span class="time" data-times="5.85" data-time="67.47">[01:07.47]</span>This book drew a lot of <span class="highlight">attention</span> to Da Vinci and <span class="highlight">significantly</span> increased the Mona Lisa's fame.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="11.97" data-time="73.32">[01:13.32]</span>As the title suggests, Lives of the Most <span class="highlight">Eminent</span> Painters, Sculptors and Architects includes biographies not only of Da Vinci but also of many other now famous Italian <span class="highlight">renaissance</span> artists. <span class="time" data-times="10.29" data-time="85.29">[01:25.29]</span>This was the first time that a European author had made the <span class="highlight">personal</span> lives of the artists a central <span class="highlight">component</span> of an art <span class="highlight">history</span> book and many a later author followed the example. <span class="time" data-times="4.76" data-time="95.58">[01:35.58]</span>The more important the artist in Vasari's view, the longer their biography in the book.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="18.15" data-time="100.34">[01:40.34]</span>And by far, the longest of the biographies, is that of Michelangelo, the painter of the Sistine <span class="highlight">Chapel</span> ceiling and <span class="highlight">sculptor</span> of the famous <span class="highlight">statue</span> of David, whose work Vasari adopted as his benchmark, his <span class="highlight">reference</span> point for evaluating everyone else's artwork.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="10.87" data-time="118.49">[01:58.49]</span>Many of the biographies are extremely detailed with all the <span class="highlight">basic</span> facts about where the artists were born, where they'd worked, who their teachers were and so on.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.07" data-time="129.36">[02:09.36]</span>But I read Vasari's book cover to cover almost every summer. <span class="time" data-times="15.31" data-time="133.43">[02:13.43]</span>I find it a great way to unwind during the summer <span class="highlight">break</span> and what keeps me coming back to it are the anecdotes, <span class="highlight">fascinating</span> anecdotes, that give you glimpses in the artist's private lives, their dreams, their fears, their virtues, their vices.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="18.29" data-time="148.74">[02:28.74]</span>In his book, Vasari also tackled, quite successfully I might add, the <span class="highlight">enormous</span> task of sorting out which works had been done by which artists, which works belong in the same <span class="highlight">stylistic</span> categories, which works belong in <span class="highlight">similar</span> categories in terms of <span class="highlight">quality</span> and so on, <span class="highlight">stuff</span> you take for granted today. <span class="time" data-times="4.7" data-time="167.03">[02:47.03]</span>But again, Vasari was the first European author to do that.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.9" data-time="171.73">[02:51.73]</span>A word of <span class="highlight">caution</span> though: Vasari was not at all averse to, how should I put it, modifying the facts. <span class="time" data-times="10.55" data-time="178.63">[02:58.63]</span>For example, in his book, he has a touching description of Da Vinci's death, in which Da Vinci dies in the arms of his last patron: The king of France, Francis the First.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.28" data-time="189.18">[03:09.18]</span>Now, Da Vinci did spend the last years of his life working in the <span class="highlight">court</span> of Francis the First. <span class="time" data-times="9.19" data-time="194.46">[03:14.46]</span>Vasari seemed to have overlooked a <span class="highlight">minor</span> <span class="highlight">detail</span>, however, the well documented fact that the king was far away when Da Vinci breathed his last breath. <span class="time" data-times="3.45" data-time="203.65">[03:23.65]</span>But why let the fact stand in the way of a great story, right? <span class="time" data-times="9.87" data-time="207.1">[03:27.10]</span>Since Vasari's tales are, as I've said, so <span class="highlight">compelling</span> and because they have been repeated by so many <span class="highlight">subsequent</span> authors, they're still often taken at face value. <span class="time" data-times="1.26" data-time="216.97">[03:36.97]</span> <span class="highlight">Even</span> today. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="218.23">[03:38.23]</span>No questions asked.</p>
