On one hand were the buildings produced for the wealthy or for civic purposes, which tended to <span class="highlight">echo</span> the <span class="highlight">architecture</span> of the past and to use <span class="highlight">traditional</span> styles of ornamentation. On the other hand were purely <span class="highlight">utilitarian</span> structures, such as factories and <span class="highlight">grain</span> elevators, which employed modern materials such as <span class="highlight">steel</span> girders and <span class="highlight">plate</span> glass in an undisguised and <span class="highlight">unadorned</span><span class="highlight">manner</span>. Such buildings, however, were viewed in a <span class="highlight">category</span><span class="highlight">separate</span> from "fine" <span class="highlight">architecture</span>, and in fact were often designed by engineers and builders rather than architects. The <span class="highlight">development</span> of modern <span class="highlight">architecture</span> might in large part be seen as an <span class="highlight">adaptation</span> of this <span class="highlight">sort</span> of <span class="highlight">functional</span> building and its <span class="highlight question1">pervasive</span><span class="highlight">application</span> for daily use. Indeed, in this <span class="highlight">influential</span> book Toward a New <span class="highlight">Architecture</span>, the Swiss <span class="highlight">architect</span> Le Corbusier illustrated his text with <span class="question3">photographs of American factories and <span class="highlight">grain</span><span class="highlight">storage</span> silos, as well as ships, airplanes, and other <span class="highlight">industrial</span> objects.</span><span class="highlight">Nonetheless</span>, modern architects did not <span class="highlight">simply</span><span class="highlight">employ</span> these new materials in a strictly <span class="highlight">practical</span><span class="highlight">fashion</span>-they <span class="highlight">consciously</span> exploited their <span class="highlight">aesthetic</span> possibilities. For example, glass could be used to open up walls and <span class="highlight"><span class="question2">eliminate</span></span> their stone and brick <span class="highlight">masonry</span> because large spaces could now be spanned with <span class="highlight">steel</span> beams.</p><p>The <span class="highlight">fundamental</span> premise of modern <span class="highlight">architecture</span> was that the <span class="highlight">appearance</span> of the building should <span class="highlight"><span class="question5">exhibit</span></span> the nature of its materials and forms of <span class="highlight">physical</span> support. This often led to effects that looked <span class="highlight">odd</span> from a <span class="highlight">traditional</span> standpoint but that became hallmarks of modern <span class="highlight">architecture</span> for precisely this <span class="highlight">reason</span>. <span class="question6">For example, in <span class="highlight">traditional</span><span class="highlight">architecture</span>, stone or brick walls served a <span class="highlight">structural</span> role, but in a steel-beam building the walls were <span class="highlight">essentially</span> hung from the <span class="highlight">internal</span><span class="highlight">skeleton</span> of <span class="highlight">steel</span> beams, which meant that walls and corners no longer needed to be <span class="highlight">solid</span> but could be opened up in unexpected ways.</span> At the Fagus shoe factory in Germany, for example, German <span class="highlight">architect</span> Walter Gropius placed glass walls in the corners, effectively breaking open the box of <span class="highlight">traditional</span><span class="highlight">architecture</span> and creating a new <span class="highlight">sense</span> of light and openness. Similarly, <span class="highlight">steel</span> beams could be used to <span class="highlight">construct</span> balconies that projected out from the building without any support <span class="highlight">beneath</span> them. These <span class="highlight">dramatic</span> balconies quickly became a signature of modern architects such as <span class="highlight">Frank</span> Lloyd Wright. Wright's most <span class="highlight">dramatic</span> residence, Fallingwater, has balconies that thrust far out over a <span class="highlight">stream</span> in a way that seems to <span class="highlight">defy</span><span class="highlight">gravity</span>.</p><p>The ways in which new technology transformed architectural design are <span class="highlight">dramatically</span> illustrated <span class="highlight">through</span> the <span class="highlight">evolution</span> of the high-rise office building. After ten or twelve stories, <span class="highlight">masonry</span><span class="highlight">construction</span> reaches a <span class="highlight">maximum</span> possible height, since it runs into difficulties of compression and of inadequate <span class="highlight">lateral</span> strength to <span class="highlight">combat</span> wind shear. <span class="highlight">Steel</span><span class="highlight">construction</span>, on the other hand, can support a building of 50 or 100 stories without difficulty. Such buildings were so different from any <span class="highlight">previous</span> form of <span class="highlight">architecture</span> that they quickly acquired a new name-the <span class="highlight">skyscraper</span>.</p><p>From the standpoint of real <span class="highlight">estate</span> developers, the purpose of skyscrapers was to increase <span class="highlight">rental</span><span class="highlight">space</span> in <span class="highlight">valuable</span><span class="highlight">urban</span> locations. But to create usable high-rise buildings, a number of <span class="highlight">technical</span> challenges needed to be solved. One problem was getting people to the upper floors, since after five or six stories it becomes <span class="highlight">exhausting</span> to climb stairs. Updated and <span class="highlight">electrified</span> versions of the <span class="highlight">freight</span> elevator that had been introduced by Elisha Graves Otis in 1853 (several decades before <span class="highlight">skyscraper</span><span class="highlight">construction</span>) solved this problem. Another <span class="highlight">issue</span> was fire safety. The metal supporting buildings became <span class="highlight">soft</span> when <span class="highlight">exposed</span> to fire and collapsed <span class="highlight">relatively</span> quickly. (They could <span class="highlight">melt</span> at 2700 <span class="highlight">Fahrenheit</span>, whereas <span class="highlight">major</span> fires achieve temperatures of 3000degrees). However, when the metal is encased in fire-retardant materials, its <span class="highlight">vulnerability</span> to fire is much decreased. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> In Chicago, a system was developed for surrounding the metal components with <span class="highlight">hollow</span> tiles made from brick-like terra-cotta. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> Such tiles are <span class="question9">impervious to</span> fire. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>The terra-cotta tiles were used both to <span class="highlight">encase</span> the supporting members and as flooring. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span> A structure built with <span class="highlight">steel</span> beams protected by terra-cotta tiles was still three times lighter than a comparably sized building that used <span class="highlight">masonry</span><span class="highlight">construction</span>, so the weight of the tiles was not a problem. </p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">pervasive</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. innovation</p><p>B. skilled</p><p>C. eventual</p><p>D. widespread</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>This topic is based on the vocabulary in question and is located in the original sentence: The development of modern architecture might in large part be seen as an adaptation of this sort of functional building and its pervasive application for daily use.

The structural role of steel beams made it possible to hang stone or brick walls instead of using them for support as traditional architecture had.</p><p>B. Opening up walls and corners was unimportant in traditional architecture so walls and corners were solid until steel-beam buildings were designed.</p><p>C. In steel-beam buildings, the beams provide the structural support, so walls and comers can be opened up in ways not possible in traditional architecture.</p><p>D. In a steel-beam buildings the walls are essentially hung from the internal skeleton of steel beams, which means that stone and brick masonry are not needed.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The title finds the highlight: For example, in traditional architecture, stone or brick walls served a structural role, but in a steel-beam building the walls were essentially hung from the internal skeleton of steel beams, which meant that walls and corners No longer needed to be solid but could be opened up in unexpected ways. The general meaning of this sentence is: the traditional building is a stone and brick wall that acts as a supporting structure, but in a steel-supported building, the wall is Supported by the internal steel structure, this means that the walls and corners no longer need to be sturdy and can be opened in some unexpected ways. Option A says that the steel frame allows walls and corners to be made of stones and bricks, wrong; option B says that the open wall corners are not important, this text does not mention; Option C is a synonym for the sentence, correct; The second half of Option D says that stones and bricks are no longer needed. It should be a solid corner wall that is not needed.

The metal can be soft when exposed to fire and collapsed relatively quickly. Why the melting point of steel is taken into account - because steel has a lower melting point than rock and can withstand high temperatures, fire protection is important for a steel structure building. Option A is correct. Option B says how the steel was cast into Steel bars, Option C says that it is safe to have no steel frame construction, and Option D says that steel is not a good material in the building and it is not right. Select A.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, why were terra-cotta tiles used in buildings with steel beams?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Terra-cotta is lighter than steel.</p><p>B. Terra-cotta is a fire-retardant material.</p><p>C. Terra-cotta tiles were as cheap as bricks.</p><p>D. Terra-cotta tiles could be used for flooring.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>This topic is based on the keyword terra-cotta. The terra-cotta tiles were used both to encase the supporting members and as flooring. A structure built with steel beams protected by terra-cotta tiles was still three times lighter Than a comparably sized building that used masonry construction, so the weight of the tiles was not a problem. The central meaning of these two sentences is that the material terra-cotta can be both fire-proof and light enough. Option B meets this material is fireproof material, correct. Option A says that terra-cotta is lighter than steel and this is not mentioned in the original text; Option C says that this material is as inexpensive as bricks, and there is no mention; Option D says that this material can be used for flooring and there is no mention in the original.

The first sentence of the sentence indicates that the sentence and its preceding sentence are concessions. The former sentence must also be said to be fire-proof. thing. With this preset one by one to test each insertable position, find the last position is most suitable. In the first sentence in general, this tile is fireproof. The next sentence says that even the air inside can prevent the steel bar from being melted by the heat of the fire. Make up the logical relationship. Select C.</p></div></div><div id="question14" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>In the twentieth century, new materials and construction techniques contributed to a change in architectural style.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.At the end of the nineteenth century, the emphasis was on preserving and conserving historic civic buildings rather than on creating new large structures.</p><p>B.Modern architects did not accept the traditional distinction between "fine" architecture and buildings that used ordinary materials and a utilitarian design.</p><p>C.Steel construction opened up the possibility of very tall buildings, but these skyscrapers also required new technologies such as elevators and fireproofing.</p><p>D.In his influential book Toward a New Architecture, Le Corbusier argued that builders and engineers ought to lead a new revolution in building design.</p><p>E.Architects such as Walter Gropius and Frank Lloyd Wright used new materials like plate glass and steel beams to create buildings that emphasized openness, light, and a feeling of weightlessness.</p><p>F.Unprotected metal can withstand much more compression than traditional masonry but must be reinforced with terra-cotta tile or the like to combat wind shear.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="BCE"><p>This question needs to analyze each option in turn. Option A stated that at the end of the 19th century, protecting dwellings was more important than building new ones. This original text was not mentioned; Option B said that modern architecture has <span class="question2">eliminate</span>d the difference between traditional architecture and the construction of new materials and utilitarianism. Summarize the contents of the first paragraph, you can choose; Option C spoke about the advantages and disadvantages of the steel structure, summed up the contents of the third paragraph, can be selected; Option D is the content of the first paragraph, talk about Le Corbusier this person claims Innovations in architectural design are correct, but they are detailed and not selected.
