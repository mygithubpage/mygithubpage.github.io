            <b>Modern Architecture In The United States</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>At the end of the nineteenth <span class="underline">century</span>, there were basically two kinds of buildings in the United States. On one hand were the buildings produced for the wealthy or for civic purposes, which tended to <span class="underline">echo</span> the <span class="underline">architecture</span> of the past and to use <span class="underline">traditional</span> styles of ornamentation. On the other hand were purely <span class="underline">utilitarian</span> structures, such as factories and <span class="underline">grain</span> elevators, which employed modern materials such as <span class="underline">steel</span> girders and <span class="underline">plate</span> glass in an undisguised and <span class="underline">unadorned</span> <span class="underline">manner</span>. Such buildings, however, were viewed in a <span class="underline">category</span> <span class="underline">separate</span> from "fine" <span class="underline">architecture</span>, and in fact were often designed by engineers and builders rather than architects. The <span class="underline">development</span> of modern <span class="underline">architecture</span> might in large part be seen as an <span class="underline">adaptation</span> of this <span class="underline">sort</span> of <span class="underline">functional</span> building and its <span class="light"><span class="underline">pervasive</span></span> <span class="underline">application</span> for daily use. Indeed, in this <span class="underline">influential</span> book Toward a New <span class="underline">Architecture</span>, the Swiss <span class="underline">architect</span> Le Corbusier illustrated his text with photographs of American factories and <span class="underline">grain</span> <span class="underline">storage</span> silos, as well as ships, airplanes, and other <span class="underline">industrial</span> objects. <span class="underline">Nonetheless</span>, modern architects did not <span class="underline">simply</span> <span class="underline">employ</span> these new materials in a strictly <span class="underline">practical</span> <span class="underline">fashion</span>-they <span class="underline">consciously</span> exploited their <span class="underline">aesthetic</span> possibilities. For example, glass could be used to open up walls and <span class="underline">eliminate</span> their stone and brick <span class="underline">masonry</span> because large spaces could now be spanned with <span class="underline">steel</span> beams.</p>
          <p>The <span class="underline">fundamental</span> premise of modern <span class="underline">architecture</span> was that the <span class="underline">appearance</span> of the building should <span class="underline">exhibit</span> the nature of its materials and forms of <span class="underline">physical</span> support. This often led to effects that looked <span class="underline">odd</span> from a <span class="underline">traditional</span> standpoint but that became hallmarks of modern <span class="underline">architecture</span> for precisely this <span class="underline">reason</span>. For example, in <span class="underline">traditional</span> <span class="underline">architecture</span>, stone or brick walls served a <span class="underline">structural</span> role, but in a steel-beam building the walls were <span class="underline">essentially</span> hung from the <span class="underline">internal</span> <span class="underline">skeleton</span> of <span class="underline">steel</span> beams, which meant that walls and corners no longer needed to be <span class="underline">solid</span> but could be opened up in unexpected ways. At the Fagus shoe factory in Germany, for example, German <span class="underline">architect</span> Walter Gropius placed glass walls in the corners, effectively breaking open the box of <span class="underline">traditional</span> <span class="underline">architecture</span> and creating a new <span class="underline">sense</span> of light and openness. Similarly, <span class="underline">steel</span> beams could be used to <span class="underline">construct</span> balconies that projected out from the building without any support <span class="underline">beneath</span> them. These <span class="underline">dramatic</span> balconies quickly became a signature of modern architects such as <span class="underline">Frank</span> Lloyd Wright. Wright's most <span class="underline">dramatic</span> residence, Fallingwater, has balconies that thrust far out over a <span class="underline">stream</span> in a way that seems to <span class="underline">defy</span> <span class="underline">gravity</span>.</p>
          <p>The ways in which new technology transformed architectural design are <span class="underline">dramatically</span> illustrated <span class="underline">through</span> the <span class="underline">evolution</span> of the high-rise office building. After ten or twelve stories, <span class="underline">masonry</span> <span class="underline">construction</span> reaches a <span class="underline">maximum</span> possible height, since it runs into difficulties of compression and of inadequate <span class="underline">lateral</span> strength to <span class="underline">combat</span> wind shear. <span class="underline">Steel</span> <span class="underline">construction</span>, on the other hand, can support a building of 50 or 100 stories without difficulty. Such buildings were so different from any <span class="underline">previous</span> form of <span class="underline">architecture</span> that they quickly acquired a new name-the <span class="underline">skyscraper</span>.</p>
          <p>From the standpoint of real <span class="underline">estate</span> developers, the purpose of skyscrapers was to increase <span class="underline">rental</span> <span class="underline">space</span> in <span class="underline">valuable</span> <span class="underline">urban</span> locations. But to create usable high-rise buildings, a number of <span class="underline">technical</span> challenges needed to be solved. One problem was getting people to the upper floors, since after five or six stories it becomes <span class="underline">exhausting</span> to climb stairs. Updated and <span class="underline">electrified</span> versions of the <span class="underline">freight</span> elevator that had been introduced by Elisha Graves Otis in 1853 (several decades before <span class="underline">skyscraper</span> <span class="underline">construction</span>) solved this problem. Another <span class="underline">issue</span> was fire safety. The metal supporting buildings became <span class="underline">soft</span> when <span class="underline">exposed</span> to fire and collapsed <span class="underline">relatively</span> quickly. (They could <span class="underline">melt</span> at 2700 <span class="underline">Fahrenheit</span>, whereas <span class="underline">major</span> fires achieve temperatures of 3000degrees). However, when the metal is encased in fire-retardant materials, its <span class="underline">vulnerability</span> to fire is much decreased. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> In Chicago, a system was developed for surrounding the metal components with <span class="underline">hollow</span> tiles made from brick-like terra-cotta. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> Such tiles are impervious to fire. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>The terra-cotta tiles were used both to <span class="underline">encase</span> the supporting members and as flooring. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span> A structure built with <span class="underline">steel</span> beams protected by terra-cotta tiles was still three times lighter than a comparably sized building that used <span class="underline">masonry</span> <span class="underline">construction</span>, so the weight of the tiles was not a problem. </p>
