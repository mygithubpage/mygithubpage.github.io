            <b>Seventeenth-Century Dutch Agriculture</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>
            <span class="highlight">Agriculture</span> and fishing formed the <span class="highlight">primary</span> sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in the Netherlands in the seventeenth <span class="highlight">century</span>. Dutch <span class="highlight">agriculture</span> was modernized and <span class="highlight">commercialized</span> new crops and agricultural techniques raised levels of production so that they were <span class="question1">in <span class="highlight">line</span> with <span class="highlight">market</span> demands</span> and cheap <span class="highlight">grain</span> was imported annually from the Baltic <span class="highlight">region</span> in large quantities. According to estimates, about 120,000 tons of imported <span class="highlight">grain</span> fed about 600,000 people: that is about a third of the Dutch <span class="highlight">population</span>. <span class="question2">Importing the <span class="highlight">grain</span>, which would have been expensive and time consuming for the Dutch to have produced themselves, kept the price of <span class="highlight">grain</span> low and thus <span class="highlight">stimulated</span> <span class="highlight">individual</span> demand for other foodstuffs and consumer goods.</span></p>
          <p><span class="question3">Apart from </span>this, being able to give up labor-intensive <span class="highlight">grain</span> production freed both the land and the workforce for more <span class="highlight">productive</span> agricultural divisions. The peasants <span class="highlight">specialized</span> in <span class="highlight">livestock</span> <span class="highlight">husbandry</span> and <span class="highlight">dairy</span> farming as well as in cultivating <span class="highlight">industrial</span> crops and fodder crops: flax, madder, and rape were grown, as were tobacco, hops, and turnips. These products were bought mostly by <span class="highlight">urban</span> businesses. There was also a demand among <span class="highlight">urban</span> consumers for <span class="highlight">dairy</span> products such as <span class="highlight">butter</span> and cheese, which, in the sixteenth <span class="highlight">century</span>, had become more expensive than <span class="highlight">grain</span>. The high prices encouraged the peasants to <span class="highlight">improve</span> their animal <span class="highlight">husbandry</span> techniques; for example, they began feeding their animals indoors in order to <span class="highlight">raise</span> the milk <span class="highlight">yield</span> of their cows.</p>
          <p>In <span class="highlight">addition</span> to <span class="highlight">dairy</span> farming and cultivating <span class="highlight">industrial</span> crops, a third sector of the Dutch <span class="highlight">economy</span> reflected the way in which <span class="highlight">agriculture</span> was being modernized-horticulture.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>In the sixteenth <span class="highlight">century</span>, fruit and vegetables were to be found only in gardens belonging to wealthy people. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>This changed in the early part of the seventeenth <span class="highlight">century</span> when horticulture 
became accepted as an agricultural sector. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>Whole villages began to <span class="highlight">cultivate</span> fruit and vegetables. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>The produce was then transported by water to markets in the cities, where the <span class="highlight"><span class="question5">consumption</span> </span>
of fruit and vegetables was no longer <span class="highlight">restricted</span> to the wealthy</p>
          <p>As the demand for agricultural produce from both consumers and <span class="highlight">industry</span> increased, agricultural land became more <span class="highlight">valuable</span> and people tried to work the <span class="highlight">available</span> land more intensively and to reclaim more land from wetlands and lakes. In order to increase production on existing land, the peasants made more use of crop <span class="highlight">rotation</span> and, in <span class="highlight">particular</span>, began to <span class="highlight">apply</span> animal <span class="highlight">waste</span> to the soil regularly, rather than leaving the fertilization <span class="highlight">process</span> up to the <span class="highlight">grazing</span> <span class="highlight">livestock</span>. For the first time <span class="highlight">industrial</span> <span class="highlight">waste</span>, such as ash from the soap-boilers, was collected in the cities and sold in the country as <span class="highlight">artificial</span> <span class="highlight">fertilizer</span>. The increased <span class="highlight">yield</span> and price of land justified reclaiming and draining <span class="highlight">even</span> more land.</p>
          <p>The Dutch battle against the sea is <span class="highlight"><span class="question10">legendary</span>. </span>Noorderkwartier in Holland, with its <span class="highlight">numerous</span> lakes and stretches of water, was particularly <span class="highlight">suitable</span> for land <span class="highlight">reclamation</span> and one of the biggest projects undertaken there was the draining of the Beemster lake which began in 1608. The richest merchants in Amsterdam contributed money to reclaim a good 7,100 hectares of land. Forty-three windmills powered the <span class="highlight">drainage</span> pumps so that <span class="question8">they</span> were able to <span class="highlight">lease</span> the <span class="highlight">reclamation</span> to farmers as early as 1612, with the investors receiving <span class="highlight">annual</span> leasing payments at an <span class="highlight">interest</span> <span class="highlight">rate</span> of 17 percent. Land <span class="highlight">reclamation</span> continued, and between 1590 and 1665, almost 100,000 hectares were reclaimed from the wetland areas of Holland, Zeeland, and Friesland. However, land <span class="highlight">reclamation</span> decreased <span class="highlight">significantly</span> after the middle of the seventeenth <span class="highlight">century</span> because the price of agricultural products began to fall, making land <span class="highlight">reclamation</span> far less <span class="highlight">profitable</span> in the <span class="highlight">second</span> part of the <span class="highlight">century</span>.</p>
          <p>Dutch <span class="highlight">agriculture</span> was finally affected by the general agricultural crisis in Europe during the last two decades of the seventeenth <span class="highlight">century</span>. However, what is <span class="question11">astonishing </span>about this is not that Dutch <span class="highlight">agriculture</span> was affected by <span class="highlight">critical</span> phenomena such as a <span class="highlight">decrease</span> in sales and production, but the fact that the crisis appeared only <span class="highlight">relatively</span> late in Dutch <span class="highlight">agriculture</span>. In Europe as a whole, the <span class="highlight">exceptional</span> <span class="highlight">reduction</span> in the <span class="highlight">population</span> and the related fall in demand for <span class="highlight">grain</span> since the beginning of the seventeenth <span class="highlight">century</span> had caused the price of agricultural products to fall. Dutch peasants were able to <span class="highlight">remain</span> unaffected by this crisis for a long time because they had <span class="highlight">specialized</span> in <span class="highlight">dairy</span> farming <span class="highlight">industrial</span> crops, and horticulture. However, toward the end of the seventeenth <span class="highlight">century</span>, they too were overtaken by the general agricultural crisis.</p>
