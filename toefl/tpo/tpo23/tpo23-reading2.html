Dutch <span class="highlight">agriculture</span> was modernized and <span class="highlight">commercialized</span> new crops and agricultural techniques raised levels of production so that they were <span class="question1">in <span class="highlight">line</span> with <span class="highlight">market</span> demands</span> and cheap <span class="highlight">grain</span> was imported annually from the Baltic <span class="highlight">region</span> in large quantities. According to estimates, about 120,000 tons of imported <span class="highlight">grain</span> fed about 600,000 people: that is about a third of the Dutch <span class="highlight">population</span>. <span class="question2">Importing the <span class="highlight">grain</span>, which would have been expensive and time consuming for the Dutch to have produced themselves, kept the price of <span class="highlight">grain</span> low and thus <span class="highlight">stimulated</span><span class="highlight">individual</span> demand for other foodstuffs and consumer goods.</span></p><p><span class="question3">Apart from</span> this, being able to give up labor-intensive <span class="highlight">grain</span> production freed both the land and the workforce for more <span class="highlight">productive</span> agricultural divisions. The peasants <span class="highlight">specialized</span> in <span class="highlight">livestock</span><span class="highlight">husbandry</span> and <span class="highlight">dairy</span> farming as well as in cultivating <span class="highlight">industrial</span> crops and fodder crops: flax, madder, and rape were grown, as were tobacco, hops, and turnips. These products were bought mostly by <span class="highlight">urban</span> businesses. There was also a demand among <span class="highlight">urban</span> consumers for <span class="highlight">dairy</span> products such as <span class="highlight">butter</span> and cheese, which, in the sixteenth <span class="highlight">century</span>, had become more expensive than <span class="highlight">grain</span>. The high prices encouraged the peasants to <span class="highlight">improve</span> their animal <span class="highlight">husbandry</span> techniques; for example, they began feeding their animals indoors in order to <span class="highlight">raise</span> the milk <span class="highlight">yield</span> of their cows.</p><p>In <span class="highlight">addition</span> to <span class="highlight">dairy</span> farming and cultivating <span class="highlight">industrial</span> crops, a third sector of the Dutch <span class="highlight">economy</span> reflected the way in which <span class="highlight">agriculture</span> was being modernized-horticulture.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>In the sixteenth <span class="highlight">century</span>, fruit and vegetables were to be found only in gardens belonging to wealthy people. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>This changed in the early part of the seventeenth <span class="highlight">century</span> when horticulture 
became accepted as an agricultural sector. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>Whole villages began to <span class="highlight">cultivate</span> fruit and vegetables. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>The produce was then transported by water to markets in the cities, where the <span class="highlight"><span class="question5">consumption</span></span> 
of fruit and vegetables was no longer <span class="highlight">restricted</span> to the wealthy</p><p>As the demand for agricultural produce from both consumers and <span class="highlight">industry</span> increased, agricultural land became more <span class="highlight">valuable</span> and people tried to work the <span class="highlight">available</span> land more intensively and to reclaim more land from wetlands and lakes. In order to increase production on existing land, the peasants made more use of crop <span class="highlight">rotation</span> and, in <span class="highlight">particular</span>, began to <span class="highlight">apply</span> animal <span class="highlight">waste</span> to the soil regularly, rather than leaving the fertilization <span class="highlight">process</span> up to the <span class="highlight">grazing</span><span class="highlight">livestock</span>. For the first time <span class="highlight">industrial</span><span class="highlight">waste</span>, such as ash from the soap-boilers, was collected in the cities and sold in the country as <span class="highlight">artificial</span><span class="highlight">fertilizer</span>. The increased <span class="highlight">yield</span> and price of land justified reclaiming and draining <span class="highlight">even</span> more land.</p><p>The Dutch battle against the sea is <span class="highlight"><span class="question10">legendary</span></span>. Noorderkwartier in Holland, with its <span class="highlight">numerous</span> lakes and stretches of water, was particularly <span class="highlight">suitable</span> for land <span class="highlight">reclamation</span> and one of the biggest projects undertaken there was the draining of the Beemster lake which began in 1608. The richest merchants in Amsterdam contributed money to reclaim a good 7,100 hectares of land. Forty-three windmills powered the <span class="highlight">drainage</span> pumps so that <span class="question8">they</span> were able to <span class="highlight">lease</span> the <span class="highlight">reclamation</span> to farmers as early as 1612, with the investors receiving <span class="highlight">annual</span> leasing payments at an <span class="highlight">interest</span><span class="highlight">rate</span> of 17 percent. Land <span class="highlight">reclamation</span> continued, and between 1590 and 1665, almost 100,000 hectares were reclaimed from the wetland areas of Holland, Zeeland, and Friesland. However, land <span class="highlight">reclamation</span> decreased <span class="highlight">significantly</span> after the middle of the seventeenth <span class="highlight">century</span> because the price of agricultural products began to fall, making land <span class="highlight">reclamation</span> far less <span class="highlight">profitable</span> in the <span class="highlight">second</span> part of the <span class="highlight">century</span>.</p><p>Dutch <span class="highlight">agriculture</span> was finally affected by the general agricultural crisis in Europe during the last two decades of the seventeenth <span class="highlight">century</span>. However, what is <span class="question11">astonishing</span> about this is not that Dutch <span class="highlight">agriculture</span> was affected by <span class="highlight">critical</span> phenomena such as a <span class="highlight">decrease</span> in sales and production, but the fact that the crisis appeared only <span class="highlight">relatively</span> late in Dutch <span class="highlight">agriculture</span>. In Europe as a whole, the <span class="highlight">exceptional</span><span class="highlight">reduction</span> in the <span class="highlight">population</span> and the related fall in demand for <span class="highlight">grain</span> since the beginning of the seventeenth <span class="highlight">century</span> had caused the price of agricultural products to fall. Dutch peasants were able to <span class="highlight">remain</span> unaffected by this crisis for a long time because they had <span class="highlight">specialized</span> in <span class="highlight">dairy</span> farming <span class="highlight">industrial</span> crops, and horticulture. However, toward the end of the seventeenth <span class="highlight">century</span>, they too were overtaken by the general agricultural crisis.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>By indicating that production was |in line with market demands|the author means that Dutch farmers were able to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. exceed other European countries in agricultural production</p><p>B. produce crops mat were similar to those popular in other European countries</p><p>C. supply sufficient quantities of the agricultural products that the Dutch population wanted to buy</p><p>D. satisfy the demand for high quality agricultural products from the Baltic region</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C. Positioning to the second sentence with the words market demand, saying that agricultural modernization, commercialized crops, and advanced agricultural techniques have led to higher yields that can meet the needs of the market. Therefore, these people meet the market demand because of the high crop yields. , so the correct answer is c. Both a and b are not mentioned at all, and d is wrong, because the original text says that it was imported from baltic, not the baltic needs.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage (paragraph 1)? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Buying imported grain led to the Dutch demanding that other foodstuffs and consumer goods be imported.</p><p>B. Because the Dutch were able to import inexpensive grain, they had money available to create a demand for other food products and consumer goods.</p><p>C. Keeping the price of grain low was a primary goal of the Dutch at a time when they could not produce enough grain to provide for all their needs.</p><p>D. The demand for other foodstuffs and consumer goods forced the Dutch to import grain and other products at a time when maintaining low prices was especially important.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B removes the clause between the two commas, similar to the composition can be set aside to look at, get: import causes the price to decline, so stimulate demand. So the correct answer is B. Option a's import of other foods and c's primary goal did not say anything, and the structure of d is completely irrelevant to the original text, and the meaning is larger and wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The phrase "<span class="highlight"><span class="question3">Apart from</span></span>" in the passage (paragraph 2) is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Besides</p><p>B. Despite</p><p>C. As a result of</p><p>D. Instead of</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" A"><p>A, apart from: In addition to... (and...). A is besides... B is despite, C is the result of... D is not... but. So the correct answer is A's besides.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 2, the increases demands on Dutch agriculture made by urban consumers had which of the following results?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Seasonal shortages of the products consumers most wanted</p><p>B. Increased production of high-quality grain products</p><p>C. Raised prices charged by peasants to urban consumers</p><p>D. Different ways of caring for dairy-producing animals</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D. Use urban consumers as the key word to locate the penultimate sentence. Say that urban consumers need dairy products, and dairy products are much more expensive than cereals. But this sentence only says the phenomenon, but does not say the result. Look down. Saying that high prices have improved farmers' livestock raising techniques, the correct answer is D. A's shortage did not say that B's grain was abandoned in the original text, and C's high price was not collected by the farmers.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question5">consumption</span></span>" in the passage (paragraph 3) is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. sale</p><p>B. storage</p><p>C. exportation</p><p>D. utilization</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" D"><p>Consumption: Consumption, use. A is for sale, B is for storage, C is for export, D is for use, use. So the correct answer is D's utility.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 3, the modernization of agriculture in the Netherlands was evident in all of the following ways EXCEPT:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The production of fruits and vegetables became a commercial venture.</p><p>B. The wealthy stopped growing fruits and vegetables in their gardens and grew flowers instead.</p><p>C. Horticultural produce was transported to city markets by water.</p><p>D. Many more people were able to afford to eat fresh fruits and vegetables.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B EXCEPT questions, exclusion method. The A option did not have a good keyword and temporarily gave up; B's flower did not say that the original was saying that not only the rich people planted vegetables and fruits, but the rich did not change flowers, so B said anti-selection; C's city markets by water did the key The word is positioned to the last sentence, correct, not selected; at the same time, this sentence also says that the D option is correct and not selected; the penultimate sentence says that the entire village is growing fruits and vegetables, that is, A commercial venture, A correct, not selected .</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>Select the TWO answer choices that, according to paragraph 4, indicate two methods people used to increase the productivity of their land. To receive credit you must select TWO answers</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They planted different crops in different sections of the farm each year.</p><p>B. They used improved irrigation methods to increase the yield of crops.</p><p>C. They increased the use of fertilizers to supply more nutrients to plants.</p><p>D. They used new horticultural practices to produce different varieties of plants in the same section of the farm.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="AC"><p>A. Using the productivity to position the keywords to the second sentence, said that using animal waste and crop rotation to improve the productivity of the land, A's different crops in different sections and the original crop rotation are synonymous, correct, and C's fertilizer is The original animal is replaced by synonyms, so the correct answer is A and C. The original method of B and the new horticultural practices of D did not say.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">they</span>" in the passage (paragraph 5) refers to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. merchants</p><p>B. hectares</p><p>C. windmills</p><p>D. drainage pumps</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A they used to look at the subject and should choose windmills, but when they were discovered, they were wrong. Only people can escape the reclaimation. So the correct answer is the subject of the former sentence merchants, correct answer A.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 5, which of the following was an important reason why land-reclamation projects in the first half of the seventeenth century proceeded rapidly?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Windmills became powerful enough to run drainage pumps efficiently.</p><p>B. Merchants invested large amounts of money in reclamation.</p><p>C. High interest rates discouraged people from buying land already available.</p><p>D. Reclaimed land was much more suitable for agriculture than the existing land.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B uses the land-reclaimation projects in the first half of the seventeenth century as the key word to position the second sentence, saying that N is a place that is particularly suitable for land reclaimation. It also says that the biggest project was to line B water in 1608, but it always I didn't say the reason, I looked at it. The next sentence says that the rich merchants in Amsterdam gave money. This is the reason for land reclaimation, so the correct answer is B. A, C and D did not say.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question10">legendary</span></span>" in the passage (paragraph 5) is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. continuous</p><p>B. well documented</p><p>C. famous</p><p>D. expensive</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" C"><p>C <span class="question10">legendary</span>: <span class="question10">legendary</span>, <span class="question10">legendary</span>, famous.

A series of statements leading to a conclusion</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B. Ask the full text of the question, see the beginning of each paragraph. The first sentence of the first paragraph states that agriculture and fisheries are the most important parts of the Dutch economy in the seventeenth century. The second to fourth paragraphs all talk about the changes of agriculture. The fifth paragraph says that the land is built around the sea. The sixth paragraph says that the overall crisis Impact, the whole is centered on agriculture. Throughout each paragraph, it starts with the subject sentence and then exemplifies it later or demonstrates it in detail, so the correct answer is B. The original does not mention any theory, so A is wrong; C's problem/solution structure does not exist in the original; D's statement leads to the conclusion, the original does not reflect, the original narrative is a development process.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Some villages specialized in growing cabbages and carrots; others grew onions, mustard, and coriander; and still others produced fruit and cultivated trees in nurseries..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D can use villages as transition points to determine whether the answer is C or D. The entire insertion sentence lists the types of things planted in v illiage. This corresponds to the fruits and vegetables in the sentence before D, and the insertion sentence and C.
