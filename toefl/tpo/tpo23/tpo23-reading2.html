          <h4 class="w3-center">Seventeenth-Century Dutch Agriculture</h4>
          <p>
            <span class="highlight">Agriculture</span> and fishing formed the <span class="highlight">primary</span> sector of the <span class="highlight">economy</span> in the Netherlands in the seventeenth <span class="highlight">century</span>. Dutch <span class="highlight">agriculture</span> was modernized and <span class="highlight">commercialized</span> new crops and agricultural techniques raised levels of production so that they were <span class="question1">in <span class="highlight">line</span> with <span class="highlight">market</span> demands</span> and cheap <span class="highlight">grain</span> was imported annually from the Baltic <span class="highlight">region</span> in large quantities. According to estimates, about 120,000 tons of imported <span class="highlight">grain</span> fed about 600,000 people: that is about a third of the Dutch <span class="highlight">population</span>. <span class="question2">Importing the <span class="highlight">grain</span>, which would have been expensive and time consuming for the Dutch to have produced themselves, kept the price of <span class="highlight">grain</span> low and thus <span class="highlight">stimulated</span> <span class="highlight">individual</span> demand for other foodstuffs and consumer goods.</span></p>
          <p><span class="question3">Apart from</span> this, being able to give up labor-intensive <span class="highlight">grain</span> production freed both the land and the workforce for more <span class="highlight">productive</span> agricultural divisions. The peasants <span class="highlight">specialized</span> in <span class="highlight">livestock</span> <span class="highlight">husbandry</span> and <span class="highlight">dairy</span> farming as well as in cultivating <span class="highlight">industrial</span> crops and fodder crops: flax, madder, and rape were grown, as were tobacco, hops, and turnips. These products were bought mostly by <span class="highlight">urban</span> businesses. There was also a demand among <span class="highlight">urban</span> consumers for <span class="highlight">dairy</span> products such as <span class="highlight">butter</span> and cheese, which, in the sixteenth <span class="highlight">century</span>, had become more expensive than <span class="highlight">grain</span>. The high prices encouraged the peasants to <span class="highlight">improve</span> their animal <span class="highlight">husbandry</span> techniques; for example, they began feeding their animals indoors in order to <span class="highlight">raise</span> the milk <span class="highlight">yield</span> of their cows.</p>
          <p>In <span class="highlight">addition</span> to <span class="highlight">dairy</span> farming and cultivating <span class="highlight">industrial</span> crops, a third sector of the Dutch <span class="highlight">economy</span> reflected the way in which <span class="highlight">agriculture</span> was being modernized-horticulture.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>In the sixteenth <span class="highlight">century</span>, fruit and vegetables were to be found only in gardens belonging to wealthy people. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>This changed in the early part of the seventeenth <span class="highlight">century</span> when horticulture 
became accepted as an agricultural sector. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>Whole villages began to <span class="highlight">cultivate</span> fruit and vegetables. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>The produce was then transported by water to markets in the cities, where the <span class="highlight"><span class="question5">consumption</span></span> 
of fruit and vegetables was no longer <span class="highlight">restricted</span> to the wealthy</p>
          <p>As the demand for agricultural produce from both consumers and <span class="highlight">industry</span> increased, agricultural land became more <span class="highlight">valuable</span> and people tried to work the <span class="highlight">available</span> land more intensively and to reclaim more land from wetlands and lakes. In order to increase production on existing land, the peasants made more use of crop <span class="highlight">rotation</span> and, in <span class="highlight">particular</span>, began to <span class="highlight">apply</span> animal <span class="highlight">waste</span> to the soil regularly, rather than leaving the fertilization <span class="highlight">process</span> up to the <span class="highlight">grazing</span> <span class="highlight">livestock</span>. For the first time <span class="highlight">industrial</span> <span class="highlight">waste</span>, such as ash from the soap-boilers, was collected in the cities and sold in the country as <span class="highlight">artificial</span> <span class="highlight">fertilizer</span>. The increased <span class="highlight">yield</span> and price of land justified reclaiming and draining <span class="highlight">even</span> more land.</p>
          <p>The Dutch battle against the sea is <span class="highlight"><span class="question10">legendary</span></span>. Noorderkwartier in Holland, with its <span class="highlight">numerous</span> lakes and stretches of water, was particularly <span class="highlight">suitable</span> for land <span class="highlight">reclamation</span> and one of the biggest projects undertaken there was the draining of the Beemster lake which began in 1608. The richest merchants in Amsterdam contributed money to reclaim a good 7,100 hectares of land. Forty-three windmills powered the <span class="highlight">drainage</span> pumps so that <span class="question8">they</span> were able to <span class="highlight">lease</span> the <span class="highlight">reclamation</span> to farmers as early as 1612, with the investors receiving <span class="highlight">annual</span> leasing payments at an <span class="highlight">interest</span> <span class="highlight">rate</span> of 17 percent. Land <span class="highlight">reclamation</span> continued, and between 1590 and 1665, almost 100,000 hectares were reclaimed from the wetland areas of Holland, Zeeland, and Friesland. However, land <span class="highlight">reclamation</span> decreased <span class="highlight">significantly</span> after the middle of the seventeenth <span class="highlight">century</span> because the price of agricultural products began to fall, making land <span class="highlight">reclamation</span> far less <span class="highlight">profitable</span> in the <span class="highlight">second</span> part of the <span class="highlight">century</span>.</p>
          <p>Dutch <span class="highlight">agriculture</span> was finally affected by the general agricultural crisis in Europe during the last two decades of the seventeenth <span class="highlight">century</span>. However, what is <span class="question11">astonishing</span> about this is not that Dutch <span class="highlight">agriculture</span> was affected by <span class="highlight">critical</span> phenomena such as a <span class="highlight">decrease</span> in sales and production, but the fact that the crisis appeared only <span class="highlight">relatively</span> late in Dutch <span class="highlight">agriculture</span>. In Europe as a whole, the <span class="highlight">exceptional</span> <span class="highlight">reduction</span> in the <span class="highlight">population</span> and the related fall in demand for <span class="highlight">grain</span> since the beginning of the seventeenth <span class="highlight">century</span> had caused the price of agricultural products to fall. Dutch peasants were able to <span class="highlight">remain</span> unaffected by this crisis for a long time because they had <span class="highlight">specialized</span> in <span class="highlight">dairy</span> farming <span class="highlight">industrial</span> crops, and horticulture. However, toward the end of the seventeenth <span class="highlight">century</span>, they too were overtaken by the general agricultural crisis.</p>

              <p>C. Positioning to the second sentence with the words market demand, saying that agricultural modernization, commercialized crops, and advanced agricultural techniques have led to higher yields that can meet the needs of the market. Therefore, these people meet the market demand because of the high crop yields. , so the correct answer is c. Both a and b are not mentioned at all, and d is wrong, because the original text says that it was imported from baltic, not the baltic needs.</p>

The sixth paragraph says that the overall crisis Impact, the whole is centered on agriculture. Throughout each paragraph, it starts with the subject sentence and then exemplifies it later or demonstrates it in detail, so the correct answer is B.
