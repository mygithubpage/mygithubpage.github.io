A daily input of water, food, and energy of various kinds is matched by an <span class="highlight">output</span> of <span class="highlight">sewage</span>, <span class="highlight">solid</span><span class="highlight">waste</span>, <span class="highlight">air</span> pollutants, energy, and materials that have been transformed in some way. The quantities involved are <span class="highlight question1">enormous</span> Many aspects of this energy use <span class="highlight">affect</span> the <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span> of a city, particularly in the production of heat.</p><p>In winter the heat produced by a city can <span class="highlight">equal</span> or <span class="highlight"><span class="question2">surpass</span></span> the <span class="highlight">amount</span> of heat <span class="highlight">available</span> from the Sun. All the heat that warms a building <span class="highlight">eventually</span> transfers to the surrounding <span class="highlight">air</span>, a <span class="highlight">process</span> that is quickest where houses are poorly <span class="highlight">insulated</span>. But an <span class="highlight">automobile</span> produces enough heat to warm an <span class="highlight">average</span> house in winter, and if a house were perfectly <span class="highlight">insulated</span>, one adult could also produce more than enough heat to warm it. <span class="highlight">Therefore</span>, <span class="highlight">even</span> without any <span class="highlight">industrial</span> production of heat, an <span class="highlight">urban</span> area tends to be warmer than the countryside that surrounds it.</p><p>The burning of <span class="highlight">fuel</span>, such as by cars, is not the only <span class="highlight">source</span> of this increased heat. Two other factors <span class="highlight">contribute</span> to the higher <span class="highlight">overall</span><span class="highlight">temperature</span> in cities. The first is the heat <span class="highlight">capacity</span> of the materials that <span class="highlight">constitute</span> the city, which is typically dominated by <span class="highlight">concrete</span> and asphalt. During the day, heat from the Sun can be conducted into these materials and stored-to be released at night. But in the countryside materials have a <span class="highlight">significantly</span><span class="highlight">lower</span> heat <span class="highlight">capacity</span> because a <span class="highlight">vegetative</span><span class="highlight">blanket</span> prevents heat from easily flowing into and out of the ground. The <span class="highlight">second</span><span class="highlight">factor</span> is that <span class="highlight">radiant</span> heat coming into the city from the Sun is trapped in two ways: (1) by a continuing <span class="highlight">series</span> of <span class="highlight">reflection</span> among the <span class="highlight">numerous</span><span class="highlight">vertical</span> surfaces that buildings present and (2) by the dust <span class="highlight">dome</span>, the cloudlike <span class="highlight">layer</span> of polluted <span class="highlight">air</span> that most cities produce. Shortwave <span class="highlight">radiation</span> from the Sun passes <span class="highlight">through</span> the pollution <span class="highlight">dome</span> more easily than outgoing longwave <span class="highlight">radiation</span> does; the <span class="highlight">latter</span> is absorbed by the <span class="highlight">gaseous</span> pollutants of the <span class="highlight">dome</span> and reradiated back to the <span class="highlight">urban</span> surface.</p><p>Cities, then, are warmer than the surrounding <span class="highlight">rural</span> areas, and together they produce a <span class="highlight">phenomenon</span> known as the <span class="highlight">urban</span> heat island. Heat islands develop best under <span class="highlight">particular</span> conditions 
<span class="highlight">associated</span> with light winds, but they can form almost any time. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>The <span class="highlight">precise</span><span class="highlight"><span class="question7">configuration</span></span> of a heat island depends on several factors. 
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>For example, the wind can make a heat island <span class="highlight">stretch</span> in the direction it blows. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>When a heat island is well developed, 
variations can be <span class="highlight">extreme</span>; in winter, busy streets in cities can be 1.7? warmer than the side streets. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>Areas near traffic lights can be similarly warmer than the areas between them because of the effect of cars standing in traffic <span class="highlight">instead</span> of moving. 
The <span class="highlight">maximum</span> differences in <span class="highlight">temperature</span> between neighboring <span class="highlight">urban</span> and <span class="highlight">rural</span> environments is called the heat-island intensity for that <span class="highlight">region</span>. In general, the larger the city, the greater 
its heat-island intensity. The actual <span class="highlight">level</span> of intensity depends on such factors as the <span class="highlight">physical</span><span class="highlight">layout</span>, <span class="highlight">population</span><span class="highlight">density</span>, and <span class="highlight">productive</span> activities of a <span class="highlight">metropolis</span>.</p><p>The surface-atmosphere relationships inside <span class="highlight">metropolitan</span> areas produce a number of <span class="highlight">climatic</span> peculiarities. For one thing, the presence or <span class="highlight">absence</span> of <span class="highlight">moisture</span> is affected by the <span class="highlight">special</span> qualities of the <span class="highlight">urban</span> surface. With much of the built-up <span class="highlight">landscape</span><span class="highlight">impenetrable</span> by water, <span class="highlight">even</span><span class="highlight">gentle</span> rain runs off almost immediately from rooftops, streets, and <span class="highlight">parking</span> lots. Thus, city surfaces, as well as the <span class="highlight">air</span> above them, <span class="highlight">tend</span> to be drier between episodes of rain; with little water <span class="highlight">available</span> for the cooling <span class="highlight">process</span> of <span class="highlight">evaporation</span>, <span class="highlight">relative</span> humidities are usually <span class="highlight">lower</span>. Wind movements are also <span class="question11">modified</span> in cities because buildings increase the <span class="highlight">friction</span> on <span class="highlight">air</span> flowing around them. This <span class="highlight">friction</span> tends to slow the speed of winds, making them far less <span class="highlight">efficient</span> at dispersing pollutants. On the other hand, <span class="highlight">air</span><span class="highlight">turbulence</span> increases because of the effect of skyscrapers on <span class="highlight">airflow</span>. <span class="highlight">Rainfall</span> is also increased in cities. The cause appears to be in part greater <span class="highlight">turbulence</span> in the <span class="highlight">urban</span><span class="highlight">atmosphere</span> as hot <span class="highlight">air</span> rises from the built-up surface.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">enormous</span>" in the paragraph 1 is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. growing</p><p>B. frightening</p><p>C. very large</p><p>D. strictly controlled</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Enormous: huge.

Using warmed house and outside air keywords to locate the second sentence, saying that when the room is poorly insulated, the heat loss is fastest, so the speed of the loss should depend on the thermal insulation of the house, so the correct answer is b, other Did not say the answer.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 3, each of the following contributes to making urban areas warmer than the surrounding countryside EXCEPT</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. the fuel burned by motor vehicles</p><p>B. the capacity to store heat of the materials used in building a city</p><p>C. the easy flow of heat into the ground in city areas covered by vegetation</p><p>D. the repeated reflection of solar radiation back and forth among buildings</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C except questions, exclusion. A's motor vehicles do keyword positioning to the first sentence of the cars, saying that fuel combustion is not the only source, obviously a source, so a correct, not selected; b mentioned in the last paragraph, so it is correct, not selected (I The answer of version B is the same as the answer of B of the previous question. I doubt it is wrong, and if it is only according to the third paragraph of the question, the answer is wrong, but option c is also wrong. Who can tell me? Is swollen what's going on); c's vegetation is targeted to the fifth sentence, but said the country, did not say urban, so c wrong, election; d's reflection keyword positioning to the first of two ways Right, not selected.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 3, why do materials in the countryside have a lower heat capacity than materials in cities do?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The countryside in the Sun is the only important source of heat.</p><p>B. Construction materials in the city are not as good at keeping buildings warm as they are in the countryside.</p><p>C. In the countryside the solar heat that flows into the ground flows out again quickly.</p><p>D. Countryside vegetation prevents heat from being trapped in the ground.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D. Use the lower heat capacity keyword to locate the fifth sentence, saying that the heat capacity of the rural area is lower than that of the city because the vegetation cover makes heat not easy to enter or flow out of the surface. Therefore, the correct answer is d. A's only source, B's construction materials did not say, c said it, and the original is not that easy.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>How is paragraph 3 organized?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It describes two factors that contribute to the increased heat of cities and then provides two causes for the second factor.</p><p>B. It describes two causes discovered in an early analysis of the increased heat of cities.</p><p>C. It describes two factors that contribute to the increased heat of cities and two other factors that work against it.</p><p>D. It describes two well-established causes of the increased heat of cities and other two whose roles are less well understood.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A. Ask the whole paragraph. Look at the beginning and the second sentence. The first sentence says that motor vehicles are not the only factor. The second sentence says there are two other factors. Then the following text describes in detail what these two factors are. And when describing the second factor, they said two reasons. . So the correct answer is A. B's early analysis, B's work against it, and D's less well understood did not say, and A specifically mentioned two causes for the second factor.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question7">configuration</span></span>" in the paragraph 4 is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. location</p><p>B. history</p><p>C. temperature</p><p>D. shape</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" D"><p>D <span class="question7">configuration</span>: structure, shape. A is the position, B is the history, C is the temperature, D is the shape so the shape of D is the correct answer.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, what can explain the substantial differences in temperature between one area and other within a well-developed heat island?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The overall size of the heat island that includes the two reasons</p><p>B. The intensity of the heat island that includes the two areas</p><p>C. Differences between the two areas in the general level of activity, including traffic</p><p>D. Differences between the two areas in the insulation materials used in construction</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C Positioned to fifth and sixth sentences with difference and well-developed heat island double keywords, said that the well-developed heat island changes are very large. In winter, busy streets can be 17 degrees higher than those that are not busy, and later The location of the signal light is said to be hotter than the location without the signal light, and traffic is being said, so c is right, saying that the busy conditions of the city include traffic. A's size, b's intensity and d's insulation materials are not mentioned.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Paragraph 4 supports the idea that a city's heat-island intensity would increase if</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. the city went into an economic decline and lost population</p><p>B. the city's economy shifted from heavy industry to health care and education</p><p>C. there was an upward trend in the average age of the city's residents</p><p>D. repair work on the streets slowed traffic throughout the city</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D. Use intensity as the key word to locate the last three sentences. The bigger the intensity of the city, the stronger the intensity of the layout, the population density, and the productive activity. So the correct answer is d, and you can also get this answer from the previous question. A said that, if the population less intensity should be reduced; b shift and c age did not say.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 5, surfaces in the city are generally drier than surfaces in the countryside between periods of rainfall because</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. in the city gentle rain is much more common than heavy rain</p><p>B. high temperatures in the city speed up the process of evaporation</p><p>C. in the city there are longer periods of dry weather between episodes of rain</p><p>D. rainwater in the city cannot soak into most surfaces and quickly runs off</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D. Positioning to the third sentence with the keyword keyword rain, said that most buildings in the city are impervious. Even the smallest rain will flow away. This is the reason why the city's surface is dry. So the correct answer is d. a gentle rain much more common, b's speed up and c's long periods of dry weather</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question11">modified</span></span>" in the paragraph 5 is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. changed</p><p>B. blocked</p><p>C. increased</p><p>D. weakened</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" A"><p>A modify: Change. A is a change, B is a block, C is an increase, and D is a decrease. The correct answer is A's change.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 5, which of the following is a factor responsible for the greater air turbulence in urban environments?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The high speed of the winds travelling above cities</p><p>B. The greater rainfall totals recorded in cities</p><p>C. Attempts to reduce urban air pollution</p><p>D. The effects of tall buildings on airflow</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D. Positioned by air turbulence to the penultimate sentence, saying that the increase of air turbulence is due to high-rise buildings affecting the air flow, so the correct answer is d. The high speed of a, the rainfall of b, and the air pollution of c were not stated.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Another possibility is for the heat island to be stretched along the course of major rivers, since large waterways typically have a warming effect on the air directly above them..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C Two transition points, the pronoun another and the verb stretch. With stretch you can determine whether b or c is correct. But since there is another, there must be an example before, so the correct answer is that c is not b.</p></div></div><div id="question14" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>Cities create climatic conditions of their own through their physical structure and urban activities.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.The amount of heat produced in a city will be reduced when cities use the heat from cars to warm homes.</p><p>B.The built-up landscape of the city readily becomes a heat island, with greater water runoff and special climatic conditions such as low relative humidity and increased air turbulence.</p><p>C.The materials from which cities are built and the effects of pollution domes help make urban areas warmer than rural areas.</p><p>D.Cities tend to be warmer than their surrounding areas, in part because they produce heat by burning fuel for heating, powering vehicles, and industrial production.</p><p>E.In most cities, the heating that results from solar radiation is intensified by carbon dioxide, a gas that is present at very high concentrations in cities' atmospheres.</p><p>F.During periods without rainfall, the air in cities heats up and causes winds to slow down, with the result that pollutants are not dispersed.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="BCD"><p>The amount of BCD the amount option did not say, do not choose. The built-up option corresponds to the beginning of the fourth paragraph and the fifth paragraph, correct. The materials option corresponds to the second paragraph of the original second sentence, the correct .cities option corresponds to the original third paragraph , Correct.
