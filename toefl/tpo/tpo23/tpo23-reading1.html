          <h4 class="w3-center">Urban Climates</h4>
          <p>The city is an <span class="highlight">extraordinary</span> processor of <span class="highlight">mass</span> and energy and has its own <span class="highlight">metabolism</span>. A daily input of water, food, and energy of various kinds is matched by an <span class="highlight">output</span> of <span class="highlight">sewage</span>, <span class="highlight">solid</span> <span class="highlight">waste</span>, <span class="highlight">air</span> pollutants, energy, and materials that have been transformed in some way. The quantities involved are <span class="highlight question1">enormous</span> Many aspects of this energy use <span class="highlight">affect</span> the <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span> of a city, particularly in the production of heat.</p>
          <p>In winter the heat produced by a city can <span class="highlight">equal</span> or <span class="highlight"><span class="question2">surpass</span></span> the <span class="highlight">amount</span> of heat <span class="highlight">available</span> from the Sun. All the heat that warms a building <span class="highlight">eventually</span> transfers to the surrounding <span class="highlight">air</span>, a <span class="highlight">process</span> that is quickest where houses are poorly <span class="highlight">insulated</span>. But an <span class="highlight">automobile</span> produces enough heat to warm an <span class="highlight">average</span> house in winter, and if a house were perfectly <span class="highlight">insulated</span>, one adult could also produce more than enough heat to warm it. <span class="highlight">Therefore</span>, <span class="highlight">even</span> without any <span class="highlight">industrial</span> production of heat, an <span class="highlight">urban</span> area tends to be warmer than the countryside that surrounds it.</p>
          <p>The burning of <span class="highlight">fuel</span>, such as by cars, is not the only <span class="highlight">source</span> of this increased heat. Two other factors <span class="highlight">contribute</span> to the higher <span class="highlight">overall</span> <span class="highlight">temperature</span> in cities. The first is the heat <span class="highlight">capacity</span> of the materials that <span class="highlight">constitute</span> the city, which is typically dominated by <span class="highlight">concrete</span> and asphalt. During the day, heat from the Sun can be conducted into these materials and stored-to be released at night. But in the countryside materials have a <span class="highlight">significantly</span> <span class="highlight">lower</span> heat <span class="highlight">capacity</span> because a <span class="highlight">vegetative</span> <span class="highlight">blanket</span> prevents heat from easily flowing into and out of the ground. The <span class="highlight">second</span> <span class="highlight">factor</span> is that <span class="highlight">radiant</span> heat coming into the city from the Sun is trapped in two ways: (1) by a continuing <span class="highlight">series</span> of <span class="highlight">reflection</span> among the <span class="highlight">numerous</span> <span class="highlight">vertical</span> surfaces that buildings present and (2) by the dust <span class="highlight">dome</span>, the cloudlike <span class="highlight">layer</span> of polluted <span class="highlight">air</span> that most cities produce. Shortwave <span class="highlight">radiation</span> from the Sun passes <span class="highlight">through</span> the pollution <span class="highlight">dome</span> more easily than outgoing longwave <span class="highlight">radiation</span> does; the <span class="highlight">latter</span> is absorbed by the <span class="highlight">gaseous</span> pollutants of the <span class="highlight">dome</span> and reradiated back to the <span class="highlight">urban</span> surface.</p>
          <p>Cities, then, are warmer than the surrounding <span class="highlight">rural</span> areas, and together they produce a <span class="highlight">phenomenon</span> known as the <span class="highlight">urban</span> heat island. Heat islands develop best under <span class="highlight">particular</span> conditions 
<span class="highlight">associated</span> with light winds, but they can form almost any time. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>The <span class="highlight">precise</span> <span class="highlight"><span class="question7">configuration</span></span> of a heat island depends on several factors. 
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>For example, the wind can make a heat island <span class="highlight">stretch</span> in the direction it blows. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>When a heat island is well developed, 
variations can be <span class="highlight">extreme</span>; in winter, busy streets in cities can be 1.7? warmer than the side streets. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>Areas near traffic lights can be similarly warmer than the areas between them because of the effect of cars standing in traffic <span class="highlight">instead</span> of moving. 
The <span class="highlight">maximum</span> differences in <span class="highlight">temperature</span> between neighboring <span class="highlight">urban</span> and <span class="highlight">rural</span> environments is called the heat-island intensity for that <span class="highlight">region</span>. In general, the larger the city, the greater 
its heat-island intensity. The actual <span class="highlight">level</span> of intensity depends on such factors as the <span class="highlight">physical</span> <span class="highlight">layout</span>, <span class="highlight">population</span> <span class="highlight">density</span>, and <span class="highlight">productive</span> activities of a <span class="highlight">metropolis</span>.</p>
          <p>The surface-atmosphere relationships inside <span class="highlight">metropolitan</span> areas produce a number of <span class="highlight">climatic</span> peculiarities. For one thing, the presence or <span class="highlight">absence</span> of <span class="highlight">moisture</span> is affected by the <span class="highlight">special</span> qualities of the <span class="highlight">urban</span> surface. With much of the built-up <span class="highlight">landscape</span> <span class="highlight">impenetrable</span> by water, <span class="highlight">even</span> <span class="highlight">gentle</span> rain runs off almost immediately from rooftops, streets, and <span class="highlight">parking</span> lots. Thus, city surfaces, as well as the <span class="highlight">air</span> above them, <span class="highlight">tend</span> to be drier between episodes of rain; with little water <span class="highlight">available</span> for the cooling <span class="highlight">process</span> of <span class="highlight">evaporation</span>, <span class="highlight">relative</span> humidities are usually <span class="highlight">lower</span>. Wind movements are also <span class="question11">modified</span> in cities because buildings increase the <span class="highlight">friction</span> on <span class="highlight">air</span> flowing around them. This <span class="highlight">friction</span> tends to slow the speed of winds, making them far less <span class="highlight">efficient</span> at dispersing pollutants. On the other hand, <span class="highlight">air</span> <span class="highlight">turbulence</span> increases because of the effect of skyscrapers on <span class="highlight">airflow</span>. <span class="highlight">Rainfall</span> is also increased in cities. The cause appears to be in part greater <span class="highlight">turbulence</span> in the <span class="highlight">urban</span> <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span> as hot <span class="highlight">air</span> rises from the built-up surface.</p>

              <p>D. Use intensity as the key word to locate the last three sentences. The bigger the intensity of the city, the stronger the intensity of the layout, the population density, and the productive activity.
