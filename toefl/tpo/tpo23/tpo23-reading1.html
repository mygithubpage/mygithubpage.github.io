            <b>Urban Climates</b>
          </h4>
          <p>The city is an <span class="highlight">extraordinary</span> processor of <span class="highlight">mass</span> and energy and has its own <span class="highlight">metabolism</span>. A daily input of water, food, and energy of various kinds is matched by an <span class="highlight">output</span> of <span class="highlight">sewage</span>, <span class="highlight">solid</span> <span class="highlight">waste</span>, <span class="highlight">air</span> pollutants, energy, and materials that have been transformed in some way. The quantities involved are <span class="highlight question1">enormous</span> Many aspects of this energy use <span class="highlight">affect</span> the <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span> of a city, particularly in the production of heat.</p>
          <p>In winter the heat produced by a city can <span class="highlight">equal</span> or <span class="highlight question2">surpass</span> the <span class="highlight">amount</span> of heat <span class="highlight">available</span> from the Sun. All the heat that warms a building <span class="highlight">eventually</span> transfers to the surrounding <span class="highlight">air</span>, a <span class="highlight">process</span> that is quickest where houses are poorly <span class="highlight">insulated</span>. But an <span class="highlight">automobile</span> produces enough heat to warm an <span class="highlight">average</span> house in winter, and if a house were perfectly <span class="highlight">insulated</span>, one adult could also produce more than enough heat to warm it. <span class="highlight">Therefore</span>, <span class="highlight">even</span> without any <span class="highlight">industrial</span> production of heat, an <span class="highlight">urban</span> area tends to be warmer than the countryside that surrounds it.</p>
          <p>The burning of <span class="highlight">fuel</span>, such as by cars, is not the only <span class="highlight">source</span> of this increased heat. Two other factors <span class="highlight">contribute</span> to the higher <span class="highlight">overall</span> <span class="highlight">temperature</span> in cities. The first is the heat <span class="highlight">capacity</span> of the materials that <span class="highlight">constitute</span> the city, which is typically dominated by <span class="highlight">concrete</span> and asphalt. During the day, heat from the Sun can be conducted into these materials and stored-to be released at night. But in the countryside materials have a <span class="highlight">significantly</span> <span class="highlight">lower</span> heat <span class="highlight">capacity</span> because a <span class="highlight">vegetative</span> <span class="highlight">blanket</span> prevents heat from easily flowing into and out of the ground. The <span class="highlight">second</span> <span class="highlight">factor</span> is that <span class="highlight">radiant</span> heat coming into the city from the Sun is trapped in two ways: (1) by a continuing <span class="highlight">series</span> of <span class="highlight">reflection</span> among the <span class="highlight">numerous</span> <span class="highlight">vertical</span> surfaces that buildings present and (2) by the dust <span class="highlight">dome</span>, the cloudlike <span class="highlight">layer</span> of polluted <span class="highlight">air</span> that most cities produce. Shortwave <span class="highlight">radiation</span> from the Sun passes <span class="highlight">through</span> the pollution <span class="highlight">dome</span> more easily than outgoing longwave <span class="highlight">radiation</span> does; the <span class="highlight">latter</span> is absorbed by the <span class="highlight">gaseous</span> pollutants of the <span class="highlight">dome</span> and reradiated back to the <span class="highlight">urban</span> surface.</p>
          <p>Cities, then, are warmer than the surrounding <span class="highlight">rural</span> areas, and together they produce a <span class="highlight">phenomenon</span> known as the <span class="highlight">urban</span> heat island. Heat islands develop best under <span class="highlight">particular</span> conditions 
<span class="highlight">associated</span> with light winds, but they can form almost any time. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>The <span class="highlight">precise</span> <span class="highlight question7">configuration</span> of a heat island depends on several factors. 
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>For example, the wind can make a heat island <span class="highlight">stretch</span> in the direction it blows. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>When a heat island is well developed, 
variations can be <span class="highlight">extreme</span>; in winter, busy streets in cities can be 1.7? warmer than the side streets. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>Areas near traffic lights can be similarly warmer than the areas between them because of the effect of cars standing in traffic <span class="highlight">instead</span> of moving. 
The <span class="highlight">maximum</span> differences in <span class="highlight">temperature</span> between neighboring <span class="highlight">urban</span> and <span class="highlight">rural</span> environments is called the heat-island intensity for that <span class="highlight">region</span>. In general, the larger the city, the greater 
its heat-island intensity. The actual <span class="highlight">level</span> of intensity depends on such factors as the <span class="highlight">physical</span> <span class="highlight">layout</span>, <span class="highlight">population</span> <span class="highlight">density</span>, and <span class="highlight">productive</span> activities of a <span class="highlight">metropolis</span>.</p>
          <p>The surface-atmosphere relationships inside <span class="highlight">metropolitan</span> areas produce a number of <span class="highlight">climatic</span> peculiarities. For one thing, the presence or <span class="highlight">absence</span> of <span class="highlight">moisture</span> is affected by the <span class="highlight">special</span> qualities of the <span class="highlight">urban</span> surface. With much of the built-up <span class="highlight">landscape</span> <span class="highlight">impenetrable</span> by water, <span class="highlight">even</span> <span class="highlight">gentle</span> rain runs off almost immediately from rooftops, streets, and <span class="highlight">parking</span> lots. Thus, city surfaces, as well as the <span class="highlight">air</span> above them, <span class="highlight">tend</span> to be drier between episodes of rain; with little water <span class="highlight">available</span> for the cooling <span class="highlight">process</span> of <span class="highlight">evaporation</span>, <span class="highlight">relative</span> humidities are usually <span class="highlight">lower</span>. Wind movements are also <span class="question11">modified</span> in cities because buildings increase the <span class="highlight">friction</span> on <span class="highlight">air</span> flowing around them. This <span class="highlight">friction</span> tends to slow the speed of winds, making them far less <span class="highlight">efficient</span> at dispersing pollutants. On the other hand, <span class="highlight">air</span> <span class="highlight">turbulence</span> increases because of the effect of skyscrapers on <span class="highlight">airflow</span>. <span class="highlight">Rainfall</span> is also increased in cities. The cause appears to be in part greater <span class="highlight">turbulence</span> in the <span class="highlight">urban</span> <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span> as hot <span class="highlight">air</span> rises from the built-up surface.</p>
