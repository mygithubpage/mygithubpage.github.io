        <h3>Listening Text</h3>
        <article>
          <p>Narrator: Listen to a conversation between a student and the director of campus activities.</p>
          <p>:Student: I'm here 'cause... well, there's something I don't understand. I set an announcement for an event. And this morning I checked the events section of the university's website. And nothing, there is no mention of it.</p>
          <p>:Director: And when did you summit this request?</p>
          <p>:Student: Last Wednesday. I followed the instructions very carefully. I am sure it was Wednesday, because know announcements have be submitted three business days ahead of the posting day.</p>
          <p>:Director: And what's it for?</p>
          <p>:Student: A reading.</p>
          <p>:Director: A reading?</p>
          <p>:Student: Yes. A poetry reading.</p>
          <p>:Director: Oh, OK. When is it?</p>
          <p>:Student: In three days. It is an author from France we have been trying to get for a while. And now that he has finally agreed to come, no one will be there.</p>
          <p>:Director: Wow. This person is really coming all the way from France?</p>
          <p>:Student: Oh, no. He is teaching in New York City this year. We were able to sell him on the idea by promising there will be a nice size crowd. I felt confident about that because I know how enthusiastic our group is.</p>
          <p>:Director: And your group? Do you have a name?</p>
          <p>:Student: Um? Well, it is kind of a loose group, you know, just a bunch of students in the French department who are interested in French literature. There's no formal structure or anything. I guess you could call us the French Literature Reading Group.</p>
          <p>:Director: OK. And it is a recognized group? By the university, I mean.</p>
          <p>:Student: No</p>
          <p>:Director: OK.</p>
          <p>:Student: But the French Department is funding this, on the condition that we do all the legwork.</p>
          <p>:Director: All right. Hold on a second while I check. Well, it looks like we did receive your announcement last Wednesday. Uh, looks like the editors must have decided not to include your event in this week's listings.</p>
          <p>:Student: Not included? Why?</p>
          <p>:Director: Well, we don't post things automatically. We get so many requests that we couldn't possibly post them all. So events that are thought to be too specialized, without the potential for really wide appeal...</p>
          <p>:Student: Wow, I got to say that does surprise me. What am I going to do now? I mean, he really is quite famous. I really do think there would be a genuine interest beyond my group. It would be a shame if no one shows up because there isn't enough publicity. Is there anyone else I can talk to?</p>
          <p>:Director: I don't think that would do you much good since we are already working on next week's schedule. But maybe you could ask the French department to post the announcement on its website. And maybe you could approach some other departments as well, you know, relevant ones.</p>
          <p>:Student: I knew we should have done a poster. But everybody was like, oh, you can just post it online. In any event, thanks for your help. It's something to consider. </p>
