I work there Tuesday afternoons, but the bus schedule changed. The bus I was taking is leaving earlier now and I can't get to it in time because I've got chemistry class then.</p><p>(woman) Huh, yeah, they did change the bus schedule sometimes. It's inconvenient. So what are you gonna do?</p><p>(man) Well, I talked to my boss and she said I could change my work hours and work at night instead. I'd start late in the afternoon and work till around midnight. And there is a bus that'll get me down on time.</p><p>(woman) That sounds good. So you could just take a later bus to your job.</p><p>(man) Yeah, the only thing is if I worked late at night. I'll be really tired and I have class early the next morning.</p><p>(woman) Yeah, but do you have any other choice?</p><p>(man) Well, yeah, another option is just to ride my bike to work after chemistry. I'll be able to get to work on time so I could keep my same hours. It's not that far. It takes about 15 minutes.</p><p>(woman) Hmm, that might be nice plus you get some exercise but it'll be a bit uncomfortable riding your bike on days when there's bad weather.</p><p>(man) Yeah, I'll have to think about it.</p></article><section id="question"><h4>Question</h4><p>Briefly summarize the problem the speakers are discussing. Then state which solution you would recommend. Explain the reasons for your recommendation. </p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>Well, the woman's problem is that she could not get to her bus to work because the bus is rescheduled to an earlier time when she's got her chemistry class by then. Accordingly there are two solutions for the woman: first of all, she could change her work hours and work at night and second, she could ride her bike to work after her class. In my opinion, the woman should follow the second solution for some reasons. Firstly, she could use bike for a change of pace, especially after class because she could consider riding to work after class as a relaxation from study and in the meantime a mental preparation for her work. Besides, I think working late at night is rather a bad idea, since it's pretty dangerous to go home alone especially late at night. So I think the woman should ride to her work after class.
