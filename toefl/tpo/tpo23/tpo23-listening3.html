              <span class="time" data-times="5.09" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in an <span class="underline">environmental</span> science class. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.42" data-time="5.09">[00:05.09]</span>Professor: Basically, a cloud either contributes to the cooling of Earth's surface or to its heating.<span class="time" data-times="6.75" data-time="12.51">[00:12.51]</span>Earth's <span class="underline">climate</span> system is <span class="underline">constantly</span> trying to <span class="underline">strike</span> a <span class="underline">balance</span> between the cooling and warming effects of clouds. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.15" data-time="19.26">[00:19.26]</span>It's very close, but <span class="underline">overall</span> the <span class="underline">cumulative</span> effects of cloud is to cool Earth rather than heat it. <span class="time" data-times="9.97" data-time="26.41">[00:26.41]</span>And this <span class="underline">balance</span> between the <span class="underline">amount</span> of <span class="underline">solar</span> <span class="underline">radiation</span>, energy from the Sun, that's absorbed by Earth, and the <span class="underline">amount</span> that's reflected back into <span class="underline">space</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.17" data-time="36.38">[00:36.38]</span>We call this Earth's <span class="underline">radiation</span> <span class="underline">budget</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.12" data-time="39.55">[00:39.55]</span>And one way we keep <span class="underline">track</span> of the <span class="underline">radiation</span> <span class="underline">budget</span> is by looking at the <span class="underline">albedo</span> of the different surfaces on the <span class="underline">planet</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="11.55" data-time="47.67">[00:47.67]</span>A surface's <span class="underline">albedo</span> is the percentage of <span class="underline">incoming</span> <span class="underline">solar</span> energy, sunlight, that's reflected off that surface back into <span class="underline">space</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.12" data-time="59.22">[00:59.22]</span>Oceans have a low <span class="underline">albedo</span>, because they <span class="underline">reflect</span> very little energy. <span class="time" data-times="4.83" data-time="64.34">[01:04.34]</span>Most of the <span class="underline">solar</span> energy that reaches the ocean gets absorbed and heats the water. <span class="time" data-times="4.15" data-time="69.17">[01:09.17]</span>Um... rainforests also have low albedos. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.16" data-time="73.32">[01:13.32]</span>Well, by <span class="underline">contrast</span>, deserts and areas covered by ice and snow, these places have high albedos. <span class="time" data-times="5.23" data-time="80.48">[01:20.48]</span>And clouds, in general, cloud also have high albedos. <span class="time" data-times="6.06" data-time="85.71">[01:25.71]</span>That means that a large percentage of the <span class="underline">solar</span> energy clouds receive is reflected into <span class="underline">space</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.77" data-time="91.77">[01:31.77]</span>OK. Now, when we say that clouds have a high <span class="underline">albedo</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.9" data-time="96.54">[01:36.54]</span>We are talking about the effect of all the clouds on earth averaged together.<span class="time" data-times="5.73" data-time="101.44">[01:41.44]</span>But different types of clouds have different reflective properties, they have different albedos. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.87" data-time="107.17">[01:47.17]</span>Student: So which type of clouds cools Earth? <span class="time" data-times="1.3" data-time="112.04">[01:52.04]</span>And which type heat it? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.93" data-time="113.34">[01:53.34]</span>Professor: Well, high thin clouds <span class="underline">contribute</span> to heating while low thick clouds cool Earth. <span class="time" data-times="5.55" data-time="120.27">[02:00.27]</span>High thin clouds are very <span class="underline">transparent</span> to <span class="underline">solar</span> <span class="underline">radiation</span>, like, uh, <span class="underline">clear</span> <span class="underline">air</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.68" data-time="125.82">[02:05.82]</span>So they mostly <span class="underline">transmit</span> <span class="underline">incoming</span> <span class="underline">solar</span> energy down to Earth. <span class="time" data-times="1.84" data-time="130.5">[02:10.50]</span>There's not much <span class="underline">reflection</span> going at all.<span class="time" data-times="4.11" data-time="132.34">[02:12.34]</span>At the same time, these clouds <span class="underline">trap</span> in some of Earth's heat.<span class="time" data-times="4.35" data-time="136.45">[02:16.45]</span>Because of the trapped heat, these clouds have an <span class="underline">overall</span> heating effect. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.15" data-time="140.8">[02:20.80]</span>Student: Oh. OK. Since low thick clouds are not <span class="underline">transparent</span> to <span class="underline">radiation</span>... </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.35" data-time="146.95">[02:26.95]</span>Professor: Exactly. They <span class="underline">block</span> most of the <span class="underline">solar</span> energy so it never reaches Earth's surface. <span class="time" data-times="3.18" data-time="152.3">[02:32.30]</span>They <span class="underline">reflect</span> much of it back out into <span class="underline">space</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.65" data-time="155.48">[02:35.48]</span>Student: So that's how they <span class="underline">contribute</span> to cooling? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.26" data-time="158.13">[02:38.13]</span>Professor: Yep. And as I said earlier, this cooling effect predominates. <span class="time" data-times="5.4" data-time="162.39">[02:42.39]</span>Now, what if there was a <span class="underline">process</span> that could control the type of clouds that form? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.69" data-time="167.79">[02:47.79]</span>Student: Are you talking about controlling the weather? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.75" data-time="170.48">[02:50.48]</span>Professor: Well, I am not sure I would go that far. <span class="time" data-times="6.58" data-time="173.23">[02:53.23]</span>But we recently noticed an increase in cloud cover over an area of the ocean waters around <span class="underline">Antarctica</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.04" data-time="179.81">[02:59.81]</span>An increased area of low thick clouds, the type that reflects a large <span class="underline">portion</span> of <span class="underline">solar</span> energy back to <span class="underline">space</span> and cools the Earth. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.06" data-time="187.85">[03:07.85]</span>Well, the <span class="underline">reason</span> for this increased cloud cover, it turns out, is the exceptionally large <span class="underline">amount</span> of <span class="underline">microscopic</span> <span class="underline">marine</span> plants.<span class="time" data-times="13.41" data-time="196.91">[03:16.91]</span>Well, the <span class="underline">current</span> <span class="underline">hypothesis</span> is that these microorganisms produce a chemical, dimetho <span class="underline">sulfide</span> that interacts with the <span class="underline">oxygen</span> in the <span class="underline">air</span>, creating conditions that <span class="underline">lead</span> to the <span class="underline">formation</span> of the low thick clouds we observed. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.77" data-time="210.32">[03:30.32]</span>Well, that's true. <span class="time" data-times="2.39" data-time="212.09">[03:32.09]</span>It could have huge implications.<span class="time" data-times="3.3" data-time="214.48">[03:34.48]</span>So, maybe we are talking about controlling the weather.<span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="217.78">[03:37.78]</span> Perhaps, if the microorganisms near <span class="underline">Antarctica</span> really are <span class="underline">responsible</span>, perhaps we can <span class="underline">accelerate</span> the <span class="underline">process</span> somehow. </p>
