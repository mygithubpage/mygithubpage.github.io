Ways of identifying different types of clouds.</p><p>B. Recent research findings about the causes of global warming.</p><p>C. The impact of clouds on global temperatures.</p><p>D. The impact of human activity on cloud formation.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>When the professor came straight to the point, Basically prompted that the cloud would not only cool the surface of the Earth, but also warm the surface of the Earth. In combination with the full text, it was not difficult to select the C option.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor,what is Earth's radiation budget?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The average temperature difference between land masses and bodies of water.</p><p>B. The balance between incoming solar energy and reflected solar energy.</p><p>C. The percentage of incoming solar energy that gets trapped in clouds.</p><p>D. The portion of marine species that has been affected by global warming.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>And this balance between the amount of solar radiation, energy from the Sun, that's considered by Earth, and the amount that's reflected back into space. We call this Earth's radiation budget.</p><p>In fact, from the beginning of the balance of the professor, we must pay attention to, and finally began to explain the balance, must be a problem. In fact, what we are talking about is a balance called Earth's radiation budget.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor discuss albedo?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To point out that different surfaces have different reflective properties.</p><p>B. To suggest that the reflective surfaces on Earth should be increased.</p><p>C. To demonstrate how a cloud's thickness is measured.</p><p>D. To explain why clear air reflects a large amount of solar energy back to space.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>Well, by contrast, deserts and areas covered by ice and snow, these places have high albedos. And clouds, in general, cloud also have high albedos.</p><p>In front of the OK, Now is to attract everyone's attention, and then come out a BUT, indicating that the answer is behind. Nothing to say, albedo said a bunch, just to say that different types of clouds have different reflection ratios, A correct.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What can be inferred from the lecture about the effects of different types of clouds on Earth's climate?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Low,thick clouds increase ocean temperatures much more than high. thin clouds do.</p><p>B. The cooling effect of low,thick clouds is stronger overall than the heating effect of high,thin clouds.</p><p>C. The effect of low,thick clouds is understood better than the effect of high,thin clouds.</p><p>D. The effect of low,thick clouds is much more variable than the effect of high,thin clouds.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Student: Oh. OK. Since low thick clouds are not transparent to radiation...</p><p>Professor: Exactly. They block most of the solar energy so it never never Earth's surface. They reflect much of it back out into space.</p><p>In front of this professor said a bunch of, in fact, mainly to introduce the low thick cloud is cool the earth, the tall thin cloud is heat. This is a question and answer, is a question, before saying: low cloud will reflect most of the energy back, coupled with this cooling effect is predominate (advantage), so B can be inferred. This question has a certain degree of difficulty because it is necessary to extrapolate the relationship between the two kinds of cloud heat and cooling. This is not clearly stated in the text.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor say about microscopic plants in the ocean near Antarctica?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They have been raising the ocean's albedo.</p><p>B. Their population is increasing due to global warming.</p><p>C. They grow more rapidly when cloud cover is thin.</p><p>D. They produce a chemical that leads to cloud formation.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>Well, the current hypothesis is that these microorganisms produce a chemical, dimetho sulfide that interacts with the oxygen in the air, creating conditions that lead to the formation of the low thick clouds we observed.</p><p>This subject, the emphasis of the professor's emphasis is very obvious. At the end of the previous sentence, he specifically re-read it. The chemical of this sentence is also emphasized. It is this chemical that reacts with oxygen in the air, creating conditions that lead to the formation of low-thick clouds. Select D.</p></div></div><div class="replay" id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor say this?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To reintroduce a topic from a previous lecture.</p><p>B. To correct a common misunderstanding.</p><p>C. To encourage students to express their own opinions.</p><p>D. To revise his previous response to a student's question.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The former student asked, "Are you talking about controlling the weather", Professor, I think I can not say so much, and as a result, I blabla said a bunch and found that just answered the previous question, so I said maybe we are talking about controlling the weather . So the answer is D.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
