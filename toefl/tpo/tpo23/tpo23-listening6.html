            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.74" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in a choreography class. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.92" data-time="5.74">[00:05.74]</span>Professor: Now, when you think about choreography, well, uh, for your last <span class="underline">assignment</span>, you choreographed the dance that was performed on <span class="underline">stage</span> in front of live <span class="underline">audience</span>.<span class="time" data-times="3.16" data-time="16.66">[00:16.66]</span>Now, <span class="underline">screen</span> dance is very different. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.24" data-time="19.82">[00:19.82]</span>It is a dance <span class="underline">routine</span> you will be choreographing <span class="underline">specifically</span> to be viewed on a <span class="underline">screen</span>, on a computer <span class="underline">screen</span>, a TV <span class="underline">screen</span>, in a movie theater, any <span class="underline">screen</span>. <span class="time" data-times="11.27" data-time="30.06">[00:30.06]</span>So the question we have to ask is, what's the <span class="underline">difference</span> between choreography for a live performance and choreography for on-screen viewing? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.45" data-time="41.33">[00:41.33]</span>OK. Think for a <span class="underline">minute</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.5" data-time="43.78">[00:43.78]</span>When you see a movie, is it just a <span class="underline">film</span> of people <span class="underline">acting</span> on a <span class="underline">stage</span>? <span class="time" data-times="1.26" data-time="49.28">[00:49.28]</span>Of <span class="underline">course</span> not.<span class="time" data-times="4.77" data-time="50.54">[00:50.54]</span> Movies use a <span class="underline">variety</span> of camera angles and <span class="underline">creative</span> editing. <span class="time" data-times="9.78" data-time="55.31">[00:55.31]</span>Movies can <span class="underline">distort</span> time, slow movement down, or speed it up, show actors fading in and out of scenes, etc. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.02" data-time="65.09">[01:05.09]</span>All of these?All of these film-making techniques, things that can't be used in a live performance, are possible in a <span class="underline">screen</span> dance. <span class="time" data-times="14.15" data-time="75.11">[01:15.11]</span>Now, we'll cover these concepts in greater <span class="underline">detail</span> later, but you should be getting the idea that I don't want you to just <span class="underline">film</span> dancers on <span class="underline">stage</span> and turn it in as your <span class="underline">screen</span> dance <span class="underline">project</span>. <span class="time" data-times="1.99" data-time="89.26">[01:29.26]</span>Uh, Yes? Debbie. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.73" data-time="91.25">[01:31.25]</span>Student: But isn't something lost here, Professor Watson? <span class="time" data-times="6.92" data-time="96.98">[01:36.98]</span>I am a dancer, and when I <span class="underline">perform</span> on <span class="underline">stage</span>, I am so energized by the <span class="underline">audience</span>'s reactions, the applause. <span class="time" data-times="4.7" data-time="103.9">[01:43.90]</span>I actually, and for a lot of dancers, it, it really inspires us. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.01" data-time="108.6">[01:48.60]</span>Professor: You're right. <span class="time" data-times="4.06" data-time="109.61">[01:49.61]</span> <span class="underline">Screen</span> dance, which is a <span class="underline">relatively</span> new, isn't for everyone. <span class="time" data-times="8.66" data-time="113.67">[01:53.67]</span>Uh, some dancers may <span class="underline">seem</span> <span class="underline">reluctant</span> to <span class="underline">participate</span> in your <span class="underline">project</span>, because they do <span class="underline">thrive</span> on the immediacy of performing live. <span class="time" data-times="7.38" data-time="122.33">[02:02.33]</span>If this happens, you could point out that <span class="underline">screen</span> dance offers other ways for dancers to connect to their <span class="underline">audience</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.56" data-time="129.71">[02:09.71]</span>For example, dancers can express themselves, <span class="underline">even</span> change the whole mood of the <span class="underline">scene</span> <span class="underline">through</span> a <span class="underline">facial</span> expression. <span class="time" data-times="3.55" data-time="138.27">[02:18.27]</span>And you could <span class="underline">film</span> close-up shots of their faces. <span class="time" data-times="11.87" data-time="141.82">[02:21.82]</span> <span class="underline">Facial</span> expressions aren't as important in live performances generally, because the <span class="underline">choreographer</span> knows that someone in the back row of a theater may not be able to see a dancer's face clearly. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.97" data-time="153.69">[02:33.69]</span>Student: But? Um, I have never used a movie camera or edited <span class="underline">film</span> before. <span class="time" data-times="3.02" data-time="158.66">[02:38.66]</span>How will we learn everything we need to know to?  </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.17" data-time="161.68">[02:41.68]</span>Professor: Oh, don't worry. <span class="time" data-times="3.11" data-time="162.85">[02:42.85]</span>The cameras you will be using are <span class="underline">pretty</span> simple to <span class="underline">operate</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.93" data-time="165.96">[02:45.96]</span>And you'll get to play with the film-editing software several times before beginning your <span class="underline">project</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.46" data-time="171.89">[02:51.89]</span>You'll also have the option of working with a student in the <span class="underline">film</span> <span class="underline">department</span>, someone who's <span class="underline">familiar</span> with the technology. <span class="time" data-times="6.56" data-time="179.35">[02:59.35]</span>But the choreography and the end result will be your responsibility of <span class="underline">course</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.64" data-time="185.91">[03:05.91]</span>Student: Could you talk some more about the <span class="underline">film</span> - making techniques, you know, the ones that work best for <span class="underline">screen</span> dances? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.39" data-time="193.55">[03:13.55]</span>Professor: I'll show some of my favorite <span class="underline">screen</span> dances next week to give you a better idea. <span class="time" data-times="6.82" data-time="198.94">[03:18.94]</span>But, uh, OK. Here's one <span class="underline">technique</span> that can create the <span class="underline">illusion</span> of flow in a <span class="underline">screen</span> dance. <span class="time" data-times="6.13" data-time="205.76">[03:25.76]</span>You <span class="underline">film</span> the same dancer, entering and exiting the <span class="underline">frame</span> several times. <span class="time" data-times="4.56" data-time="211.89">[03:31.89]</span>Moving slowly at first, then faster and faster. <span class="time" data-times="16.28" data-time="216.45">[03:36.45]</span>Then in the editing room, you can digitally <span class="underline">manipulate</span> these images, like you might put five or ten or twenty copies of that same dancer meeting himself in the middle of the <span class="underline">screen</span>, to make it look like he is dancing with himself. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.96" data-time="232.73">[03:52.73]</span>
              <span class="underline">Obviously</span>, this can't be done in a live performance. <span class="time" data-times="8.86" data-time="236.69">[03:56.69]</span>Another example, in one <span class="underline">screen</span> dance I saw, the dancers <span class="underline">leap</span> <span class="underline">through</span> sheets of fire in a big abandoned building. <span class="time" data-times="2.85" data-time="245.55">[04:05.55]</span>Of <span class="underline">course</span>, the building wasn't really on fire. <span class="time" data-times="3.71" data-time="248.4">[04:08.40]</span>A <span class="underline">technique</span> called super-imposing was used. <span class="time" data-times="4.55" data-time="252.11">[04:12.11]</span>The dancers were filmed and layered in the editing room. <span class="time" data-times="2.35" data-time="256.66">[04:16.66]</span>The fire was added to the background. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.8" data-time="259.01">[04:19.01]</span>Student: That sounds <span class="underline">awesome</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.3" data-time="260.81">[04:20.81]</span>But if anyone can watch a dance on a computer <span class="underline">screen</span>, why would they <span class="underline">pay</span> to go see a live performance?<span class="time" data-times="4.01" data-time="266.11">[04:26.11]</span>What if <span class="underline">screen</span> dance got so <span class="underline">popular</span> that it replaced live dance? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.41" data-time="270.12">[04:30.12]</span>Professor: <span class="underline">Screen</span> dance is an <span class="underline">entirely</span> different type of <span class="underline">presentation</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.32" data-time="274.53">[04:34.53]</span>It could never <span class="underline">replicate</span> the immediacy, the kind of drama that live performance offers.<span class="time" data-times="2.91" data-time="280.85">[04:40.85]</span>There will be an <span class="underline">audience</span> for that. <span class="time" data-times="5.78" data-time="283.76">[04:43.76]</span>I think what <span class="underline">screen</span> dance will do, though, is <span class="underline">heighten</span> <span class="underline">awareness</span> of dance in general. <span class="time" data-times="2.36" data-time="289.54">[04:49.54]</span>Because it is a way? <span class="time" data-times="6.52" data-time="291.9">[04:51.90]</span>Uh, it can <span class="underline">reach</span> people in their homes, in their workplaces, at any time really.<span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="298.42">[04:58.42]</span>And if someone discovers that they love dance by watching a <span class="underline">screen</span> dance, there's a good <span class="underline">chance</span> they will get interested enough to buy a ticket to see a live performance. </p>
