            <b>Rock Art of the Australia Aborigines</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>Ever since European first explored Australia, people have been trying to understand the <span class="underline">ancient</span> rock drawings and cavings created by the Aborigines, the <span class="underline">original</span> inhabitants of the <span class="underline">continent</span>. Early in the nineteenth <span class="underline">century</span>, encounters with <span class="underline">Aboriginal</span> rock art tended to be <span class="light">infrequent</span> and open to speculative <span class="underline">interpretation</span>, but since the late nineteenth <span class="underline">century</span>, <span class="underline">awareness</span> of the <span class="underline">extent</span> and <span class="underline">variety</span> of Australian rock art has been growing. In the <span class="underline">latter</span> decades of the twentieth <span class="underline">century</span> there were intensified efforts to understand and <span class="underline">record</span> the <span class="underline">abundance</span> of Australian rock art.</p>
          <p>The <span class="underline">systematic</span> study of this art is a <span class="underline">relatively</span> new <span class="underline">discipline</span> in Australia. Over the past four decades new discoveries have steadily added to the body of knowledge.
The most <span class="underline">significant</span> <span class="underline">data</span> have come from a <span class="underline">concentration</span> on three <span class="underline">major</span> questions. First, what is the age of Australian rock art? <span class="underline">Second</span>, what is its <span class="underline">stylistic</span> <span class="underline">organization</span> 
and is it possible to <span class="underline">discern</span> a <span class="underline">sequence</span> or a <span class="underline">pattern</span> of <span class="underline">development</span> between styles? Third, is it possible to <span class="underline">interpret</span> accurately the <span class="underline">subject</span> matter of <span class="underline">ancient</span> rock art, bring 
to <span class="underline">bear</span> all <span class="underline">available</span> <span class="underline">archaeological</span> techniques and the knowledge of present-day <span class="underline">Aboriginal</span> informants? <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span></p>
          <p>The age of Australia's rock art is <span class="underline">constantly</span> being revised, and earlier datings have been proposed as the result of new discoveries. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>Currently, <span class="underline">reliable</span> <span class="underline">scientific</span> <span class="underline">evidence</span> dates the earliest creation of art on rock surfaces in Australia to somewhere between 30,000 and 50,000 years ago. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>This in itself is an almost incomprehensible <span class="underline">span</span> of generations, 
and one that makes Australia's rock art the oldest <span class="underline">continuous</span> art tradition in the world. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p>
          <p>Although the <span class="underline">remarkable</span> <span class="underline">antiquity</span> of Australia's rock art is now established, the sequences and meanings of its images have been widely debated. Since the mid-1970s, a reasonably <span class="underline">stable</span> picture has formed of the <span class="underline">organization</span> of Australian rock art. In order to create a <span class="underline">sense</span> of structure to this picture, researchers have relied on a <span class="underline">distinction</span> that still underlies the forms of much <span class="underline">indigenous</span> <span class="underline">visual</span> <span class="underline">culture</span>-a <span class="underline">distinction</span> between geometric and <span class="underline">figurative</span> elements. Simple geometric repeated patterns-circles, <span class="underline">concentric</span> circles, and lines-<span class="underline">constitute</span> the iconography (<span class="underline">characteristic</span> images) of the earliest rock-art sites found <span class="underline">across</span> Australia. The <span class="underline">frequency</span> with which certain simple motifs <span class="underline">appear</span> in these oldest sites has led rock-art researchers to <span class="underline">adopt</span> a <span class="underline">descriptive</span> <span class="underline">term</span>-the Panaramitee style-a <span class="underline">label</span> which takes its name from the <span class="underline">extensive</span> rock pavements at Panaramitee North in <span class="underline">desert</span> South Australia, which are covered with motifs pecked into the surface. Certain features of these engravings <span class="underline">lead</span> to the conclusion that they are of great age-geological changes had clearly happened after the designs had been made and <span class="underline">local</span> <span class="underline">Aboriginal</span> informants, when first questioned about them, seemed to know nothing of their origins. Furthermore, the designs were covered with "<span class="underline">desert</span> <span class="underline">varnish</span>," a <span class="underline">glaze</span> that develops on rock surfaces over thousands of years of <span class="underline">exposure</span> to the elements. The simple motifs found at Panaramitee are <span class="underline">common</span> to many rock-art sites <span class="underline">across</span> Australia. Indeed, sites with engravings of geometric shapes are also to be found on the island of Tasmania, which was separated from the mainland of the <span class="underline">continent</span> some 10,000 years ago.</p>
          <p>In the 1970s when the study of Australian <span class="underline">archaeology</span> was in an <span class="underline">exciting</span> <span class="underline">phase</span> of <span class="underline">development</span>, with the great <span class="underline">antiquity</span> of rock art becoming <span class="underline">clear</span>. Lesley Maynard, the archaeologist who coined the phrase "Panaramitee style," suggested that a <span class="underline">sequence</span> could be <span class="underline">determined</span> for Australian rock art, in which a geometric style gave way to a simple <span class="underline">figurative</span> style (outlines of figures and animals), followed by a <span class="underline">range</span> of <span class="underline">complex</span> <span class="underline">figurative</span> styles that, unlike the pan-Australian geometric tradition, tended to be much greater regional <span class="underline">diversity</span>. While accepting that this <span class="underline">sequence</span> fits the <span class="underline">archaeological</span> profile of those sites, which were occupied continuously over many thousands of years a number of writers have warned that the <span class="underline">underlying</span> <span class="underline">assumption</span> of such a <span class="underline">sequence</span>-a <span class="underline">development</span> from the simple and the geometric to the <span class="underline">complex</span> and naturalistic-obscures the cultural continuities in <span class="underline">Aboriginal</span> Australia, in which geometric symbolism remains fundamentally important. In this <span class="underline">context</span> the <span class="underline">simplicity</span> of a geometric <span class="underline">motif</span> may be more <span class="underline">apparent</span> than real. Motifs of seeming <span class="underline">simplicity</span> can encode <span class="underline">complex</span> meanings in <span class="underline">Aboriginal</span> Australia. And has not twentieth-century art shown that naturalism does not necessarily follow abstraction in some kind of predetermine <span class="underline">sequence</span>?</p>
