Early in the nineteenth <span class="highlight">century</span>, encounters with <span class="highlight">Aboriginal</span> rock art tended to be <span class="highlight question1">infrequent</span> and open to speculative <span class="highlight">interpretation</span>, but since the late nineteenth <span class="highlight">century</span>, <span class="highlight">awareness</span> of the <span class="highlight">extent</span> and <span class="highlight">variety</span> of Australian rock art has been growing. In the <span class="highlight">latter</span> decades of the twentieth <span class="highlight">century</span> there were intensified efforts to understand and <span class="highlight">record</span> the <span class="highlight">abundance</span> of Australian rock art.</p><p>The <span class="highlight">systematic</span> study of this art is a <span class="highlight"><span class="question3">relatively</span></span> new <span class="highlight">discipline</span> in Australia. Over the past four decades new discoveries have steadily added to the body of knowledge.
The most <span class="highlight">significant</span><span class="highlight">data</span> have come from a <span class="highlight">concentration</span> on three <span class="highlight">major</span> questions. First, what is the age of Australian rock art? <span class="highlight">Second</span>, what is its <span class="highlight">stylistic</span><span class="highlight">organization</span> 
and is it possible to <span class="highlight"><span class="question4">discern</span></span> a <span class="highlight">sequence</span> or a <span class="highlight">pattern</span> of <span class="highlight">development</span> between styles? Third, is it possible to <span class="highlight">interpret</span> accurately the <span class="highlight">subject</span> matter of <span class="highlight">ancient</span> rock art, bring 
to <span class="highlight">bear</span> all <span class="highlight">available</span><span class="highlight">archaeological</span> techniques and the knowledge of present-day <span class="highlight">Aboriginal</span> informants? <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span></p><p>The age of Australia's rock art is <span class="highlight">constantly</span> being <span class="question5">revised</span>, and earlier datings have been proposed as the result of new discoveries. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>Currently, <span class="highlight">reliable</span><span class="highlight">scientific</span><span class="highlight">evidence</span> dates the earliest creation of art on rock surfaces in Australia to somewhere between 30,000 and 50,000 years ago. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>This in itself is an almost incomprehensible <span class="highlight">span</span> of generations, 
and one that makes Australia's rock art the oldest <span class="highlight">continuous</span> art tradition in the world. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p><p>Although the <span class="highlight">remarkable</span><span class="highlight">antiquity</span> of Australia's rock art is now established, the sequences and meanings of its images have been widely debated. Since the mid-1970s, a reasonably <span class="highlight">stable</span> picture has formed of the <span class="highlight">organization</span> of Australian rock art. In order to create a <span class="highlight">sense</span> of structure to this picture, researchers have relied on a <span class="highlight">distinction</span> that still underlies the forms of much <span class="highlight">indigenous</span><span class="highlight">visual</span><span class="highlight">culture</span>-a <span class="highlight">distinction</span> between geometric and <span class="highlight">figurative</span> elements. Simple geometric repeated patterns-circles, <span class="highlight">concentric</span> circles, and lines-<span class="highlight">constitute</span> the iconography (<span class="highlight">characteristic</span> images) of the earliest rock-art sites found <span class="highlight">across</span> Australia. <span class="question6">The <span class="highlight">frequency</span> with which certain simple motifs <span class="highlight">appear</span> in these oldest sites has led rock-art researchers to <span class="highlight">adopt</span> a <span class="highlight">descriptive</span><span class="highlight">term</span>-the Panaramitee style-a <span class="highlight">label</span> which takes its name from the <span class="highlight">extensive</span> rock pavements at Panaramitee North in <span class="highlight">desert</span> South Australia, which are covered with motifs pecked into the surface.</span> Certain features of these engravings <span class="highlight">lead</span> to the conclusion that they are of great age-geological changes had clearly happened after the designs had been made and <span class="highlight">local</span><span class="highlight">Aboriginal</span> informants, when first questioned about them, seemed to know nothing of their origins. Furthermore, the designs were covered with "<span class="highlight">desert</span><span class="highlight">varnish</span>," a <span class="highlight">glaze</span> that develops on rock surfaces over thousands of years of <span class="highlight">exposure</span> to the elements. The simple motifs found at Panaramitee are <span class="highlight">common</span> to many rock-art sites <span class="highlight">across</span> Australia. Indeed, sites with engravings of geometric shapes are also to be found on the island of Tasmania, which was separated from the mainland of the <span class="highlight">continent</span> some 10,000 years ago.</p><p>In the 1970s when the study of Australian <span class="highlight">archaeology</span> was in an <span class="highlight">exciting</span><span class="highlight">phase</span> of <span class="highlight">development</span>, with the great <span class="highlight">antiquity</span> of rock art becoming <span class="highlight">clear</span>. Lesley Maynard, the archaeologist who coined the phrase "Panaramitee style," suggested that a <span class="highlight">sequence</span> could be <span class="highlight">determined</span> for Australian rock art, in which a geometric style gave way to a simple <span class="highlight">figurative</span> style (outlines of figures and animals), followed by a <span class="highlight">range</span> of <span class="highlight">complex</span><span class="highlight">figurative</span> styles that, unlike the pan-Australian geometric tradition, tended to be much greater regional <span class="highlight">diversity</span>. While accepting that this <span class="highlight">sequence</span> fits the <span class="highlight">archaeological</span> profile of those sites, which were occupied continuously over many thousands of years a number of writers have warned that the <span class="highlight">underlying</span><span class="highlight">assumption</span> of such a <span class="highlight">sequence</span>-a <span class="highlight">development</span> from the simple and the geometric to the <span class="highlight">complex</span> and naturalistic-obscures the cultural continuities in <span class="highlight">Aboriginal</span> Australia, in which geometric symbolism remains fundamentally important. In this <span class="highlight">context</span> the <span class="highlight">simplicity</span> of a geometric <span class="highlight">motif</span> may be more <span class="highlight">apparent</span> than real. Motifs of seeming <span class="highlight">simplicity</span> can encode <span class="highlight">complex</span> meanings in <span class="highlight">Aboriginal</span> Australia. And has not twentieth-century art shown that naturalism does not necessarily follow abstraction in some kind of predetermine <span class="highlight">sequence</span>?</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">infrequent</span>" in the passage (paragraph 1) is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. puzzling</p><p>B. uncommon</p><p>C. questionable</p><p>D. undocumented</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B infrequent: Uncommon, rare. A is confusing, B is not common, C is suspicious, and there is a problem. D is not recorded. So the correct answer is uncommon,</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 1, the twentieth-century approach to studying Australian rock art was different from earlier approaches because the twentieth-century approach</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. recognized that many different groups of Aborigines created Australian rock art</p><p>B. concentrated on a limited range of Aboriginal rock art</p><p>C. examined Aboriginal art from an Aboriginal rather than from a European perspective</p><p>D. focused more intensely on understanding and documenting rock art</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D. Positioning the last sentence in the 20th century. It is said that in the latter decades of the 20th century, people spent more time understanding and recording the rock art's abundance, so the correct answer is D, understanding and documenting. No other options have been said.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question3">relatively</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. completely</p><p>B. comparatively</p><p>C. apparently</p><p>D. particularly</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>B <span class="question3">relatively</span>: Relatively, related. A is completely, B is <span class="question3">relatively</span>, C is obviously, D is particularly, uniquely. So the correct answer is B's comparatively.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question4">discern</span></span>" in the passage (paragraph 2) is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. indicate</p><p>B. apply</p><p>C. identify</p><p>D. repeat</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" C"><p>C <span class="question4">discern</span>: Identify, identify.

Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave ways or leave out essential information</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The oldest rock art sites have simpler motifs than the best known sites of Panaramitee North.</p><p>B. Because motifs primarily associated with the Panaramitee region are common in the oldest sites the term Panaramitee style has become the general term for rock art of this type.</p><p>C. Because the Panaramitee style is so common in the older sites, researchers have described it most extensively.</p><p>D. The motifs carved in the rocky surface of the Panaramitee region make up the oldest form of rock art discovered in Australia.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B can be seen from the led...to structure of the original sentence, the main logic of the original sentence is cause and effect. The reason is the frequency with which certain patterns appear, and the researchers adopted the term "the Panaramitee style." Among these options, B option manifests such causal logic as because and covers the cause and result of the original sentence, so B is correct. The comparison logic of the A option is not in the original sentence, wrong; the result part of the C option does not match the original sentence, and is wrong; the logic and content of the D option are not consistent with the original sentence, and are wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, researchers have organized and structured Australian rock art by distinguishing between which of the following?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Images found at Panaramitee North and images found in other parts of Australia</p><p>B. Images found in a particular type of rock layer and images found in other types of rock layers</p><p>C. Images that have geometric elements and images that have figurative elements</p><p>D. Images that are typically found and image that are rarely found</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C locates the third and fourth sentences with structure and distinguish double keywords. Note that the original distinction and distinctness are the same thing, and the dash and the between can help us to locate, so the correct answer is C, which separates geometric and Figurative, nothing else said.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, all of the following are signs of the great age of the Panaramitee engravings EXCEPT:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The engravings consisted of simple animal drawings.</p><p>B. The engravings were covered with a layer of a substance known as "desert varnish".</p><p>C. Local Aborigines who were asked knew nothing about the origin of the engravings.</p><p>D. Geologic changes had occurred after the engravings were made.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>D can use the signs of the great age to narrow the scope of related content and narrow the scope of reading to the last four sentences, starting with Ceramic features.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the author include information about Tasmania in paragraph 4?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To provide evidence that the Panaramitee style is widespread and of great age</p><p>B. To prove that Aboriginal Australians could not have made the carvings in Tasmania</p><p>C. To indicate how researchers have determined how long ago Tasmania separated from the mainland</p><p>D. To illustrate the importance of geometric rock art to tourism in Tasmania</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A Tasmania is used as the key word to locate the last sentence, but the entire sentence is an example. Therefore, looking ahead, the first sentence says that the motif appearing at P is common throughout Australia, followed by Tasmania. The example, that is, Tasmania is nothing more than universal, so the answer is A, the other did not say.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 5, the complex figurative style differs from the geometric style in that the complex figurative style</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. varies significantly from region to region</p><p>B. is more meaningful</p><p>C. appears on only a few types of rocks</p><p>D. has changed little overtime</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A finds the difference between two styles. The second sentence not only mentions two styles, but also says the difference between the two, so it is the information. This sentence is different from the pan-Australia's geometric, figurative has more regional characteristics, that is to say there are differences in different regions, so the correct answer is A from region to region, the remaining three options did not say.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 5, Lesley Maynard made which of the following suggestions about Australian rock art?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. There were a pattern of human figures being represented in a more complex style than animal figures.</p><p>B. Australian archaeology should concentrate on determining the sequence of styles that led up to the Panaramitee style.</p><p>C. The great antiquity of Australian rock art would probably make it impossible to determine the ages of the various styles found in rock art.</p><p>D. The geometric style of Australian rock art was replaced by increasingly complex figurative styles.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D. Positioning the keyword to the second sentence with a person's name, said that Australian rock art has a sequence, first geometric, then simple figurative, and later a complex figurative, only d is replaced by a complex, is the correct answer. A and c did not say, b said sequence, but this order has been determined, not the determine b said, so b is not right.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>In paragraph 5, the author indicates that twentieth century art has shown that naturalism does not necessarily follow abstraction in some kind of predetermined sequence in order to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. emphasize that it may not be possible to determine what the figures in ancient rock art represent</p><p>B. suggest a reply to those who have questioned Maynard's interpretation of the sequence of Australian rock art</p><p>C. provide a counterexample to Maynard's interpretation of the sequence of Australian rock art</p><p>D. indicate that twentieth century art is more advanced than ancient rock art</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C This rhetorical topic is rather special. The rhetorical point mentioned by the author is in the last sentence. Looking ahead, the previous sentence is not the center. According to the common sense, the paragraph head should be seen. However, because this paragraph is not the center, it is not correct. Helpless only to look back, find the fourth last sentence, said that this order from simple to complex fuzzy the cultural continuity, that is to say the author said that naturalism may not follow the abstraction to explain this order wrong, before m said that this order, so The answer is c, providing a counterexample for m's interpretation. A and d did not say, b said anti.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>While a great deal of information exists, the answers to these questions are not yet definitive..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A transitional point is enough, it is the pronoun phrase these questions, the problems pointed out must have appeared in front, and there are several problems.
