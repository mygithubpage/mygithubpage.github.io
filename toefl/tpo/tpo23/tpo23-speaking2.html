        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>I prefer to spend free time alone doing activities like reading, thinking and writing. I value my free time very much because that's the time I can do whatever I like. I like reading and writing. By reading books, some masterpieces, I feel like I am talking with those great authors and masters. I enjoy great stories such as Robinson Crusoe, Boy's life and Catcher in the Rye. By writing, I can take down the meaningful moments and thoughts in my life. Also, I can write my own stories. Every time I work out a story, I feel great and eager to let others read it. Through reading and writing, I can better understand my life. Only by staying alone can I read, write and think.</p>
