          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="10.15" data-time="7.09">[00:07.09]</span>Professor: We have been talking about how sea animals find their way underwater, how they <span class="highlight">navigate</span>, and this brings up an interesting <span class="highlight">puzzle</span>, and one I'm sure you'll all enjoy. <span class="time" data-times="2.56" data-time="17.24">[00:17.24]</span>I mean, everybody loves dolphins, right? </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.86" data-time="19.8">[00:19.80]</span>And dolphins, well, they actually produce two types of sounds. <span class="time" data-times="5.99" data-time="24.66">[00:24.66]</span>Uh, one being the vocalizations you are probably all <span class="highlight">familiar</span> with, which they <span class="highlight">emit</span> <span class="highlight">through</span> their blowholes.<span class="time" data-times="7.33" data-time="30.65">[00:30.65]</span>But the one we are concerned with today is the rapid clicks that they use for echolocation, so they can <span class="highlight">sense</span> what is around them. <span class="time" data-times="6.19" data-time="37.98">[00:37.98]</span>These sounds, it has been found, are produced in the air-filled nasal sacs of the <span class="highlight">dolphin</span>. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.01" data-time="44.17">[00:44.17]</span>And the <span class="highlight">puzzle</span> is how does the click sounds get transmitted into the water? <span class="time" data-times="3.27" data-time="49.18">[00:49.18]</span>It's not as easy as it might <span class="highlight">seem</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.16" data-time="52.45">[00:52.45]</span>You see, the denser the <span class="highlight">medium</span>, the faster <span class="highlight">sound</span> travels.<span class="time" data-times="4.76" data-time="56.61">[00:56.61]</span>So <span class="highlight">sound</span> travels faster <span class="highlight">through</span> water than it does <span class="highlight">through</span> <span class="highlight">air</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.38" data-time="61.37">[01:01.37]</span>So what happens when a <span class="highlight">sound</span> wave um? OK. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="7.53" data-time="65.75">[01:05.75]</span>You've got a <span class="highlight">sound</span> wave traveling merrily <span class="highlight">along</span> <span class="highlight">through</span> one <span class="highlight">medium</span>, when suddenly, it hits a different <span class="highlight">medium</span>, what does <span class="highlight">gonna</span> happen then? <span class="time" data-times="7.78" data-time="73.28">[01:13.28]</span>Well, some of the energy is going to be reflected back, and some of it is going to be transmitted into the <span class="highlight">second</span> <span class="highlight">medium</span>. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="13.51" data-time="81.06">[01:21.06]</span>And, and , and if the two <span class="highlight">media</span> have really different densities, like <span class="highlight">air</span> and water, then most of the energy is going to be reflected back, very little of it will keep going, uh, get transmitted into the new <span class="highlight">medium</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.83" data-time="94.57">[01:34.57]</span>I mean, just think how little noise from the outside world actually reaches you when your head is underwater. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="7.37" data-time="100.4">[01:40.40]</span>So, how did the <span class="highlight">dolphin</span>'s clicks get transmitted from its air-filled nasal sacs into the ocean water? <span class="time" data-times="12.17" data-time="107.77">[01:47.77]</span>Because <span class="highlight">given</span> the <span class="highlight">difference</span> in <span class="highlight">density</span> between the <span class="highlight">air</span> in the nasal <span class="highlight">cavity</span> and the seawater, we'd <span class="highlight">expect</span> those sounds to just kind of go bouncing around inside the <span class="highlight">dolphin</span>'s head, which will do it no good at all. <span class="time" data-times="6.05" data-time="119.94">[01:59.94]</span>If it's going to <span class="highlight">navigate</span> it, needs those sounds to be <span class="highlight">broadcast</span> and bounced back from objects in its <span class="highlight">path</span>. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="7.65" data-time="125.99">[02:05.99]</span>Well, turns out dolphins have a structure in their foreheads, just in front of their nasal sacs, called a melon. <span class="time" data-times="7.63" data-time="133.64">[02:13.64]</span>Now, the melon is kind of a large sac-like <span class="highlight">pouch</span>, made up of fat <span class="highlight">tissue</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.04" data-time="141.27">[02:21.27]</span>And this fat <span class="highlight">tissue</span> has some rather <span class="highlight">fascinating</span> <span class="highlight">acoustical</span> properties.<span class="time" data-times="9.58" data-time="146.31">[02:26.31]</span>Most of the fat that you find in an animal's body is used for storing energy, but this fat, which you find in dolphins, and only in the melon and around the <span class="highlight">lower</span> <span class="highlight">jaw</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.57" data-time="155.89">[02:35.89]</span>This fat is very different, very rich in oil. <span class="time" data-times="3.51" data-time="159.46">[02:39.46]</span>And it turns out it has a very different purpose as well. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.21" data-time="162.97">[02:42.97]</span>Now, one way to um, <span class="highlight">modify</span> the <span class="highlight">overcome</span> this mismatch in the <span class="highlight">density</span> of <span class="highlight">air</span> and water would be?<span class="time" data-times="9.14" data-time="168.18">[02:48.18]</span>If you could <span class="highlight">modify</span> the <span class="highlight">velocity</span> of the <span class="highlight">sound</span> wave, the <span class="highlight">velocity</span> of the <span class="highlight">sound</span> wave, make it precisely <span class="highlight">match</span> the speed at which <span class="highlight">sound</span> travels <span class="highlight">through</span> water.<span class="time" data-times="5.21" data-time="177.32">[02:57.32]</span>And that's exactly what <span class="highlight">marine</span> biologists have discovered the melon does. <span class="time" data-times="7.79" data-time="182.53">[03:02.53]</span>Note that the bursa, these little projections at the <span class="highlight">rear</span> of the melon, are right up against the air-filled nasal sacs. <span class="time" data-times="5.52" data-time="190.32">[03:10.32]</span>And these bursa, it turns out, are what's <span class="highlight">responsible</span> for transferring <span class="highlight">sound</span> to the melon. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.42" data-time="195.84">[03:15.84]</span>The <span class="highlight">sound</span> waves are then transmitted by the bursa <span class="highlight">through</span> the melon. <span class="time" data-times="9.54" data-time="200.26">[03:20.26]</span>First <span class="highlight">through</span> a low <span class="highlight">velocity</span> <span class="highlight">core</span>, and then <span class="highlight">through</span> a high <span class="highlight">velocity</span> <span class="highlight">shell</span>, where their speed is increased before they are transmitted into the surrounding seawater. <span class="time" data-times="5.78" data-time="209.8">[03:29.80]</span>So now the signals can be efficiently transferred into the water, with <span class="highlight">minimal</span> <span class="highlight">reflection</span>. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="10.24" data-time="215.58">[03:35.58]</span>The only other place, this <span class="highlight">special</span> fatty <span class="highlight">tissue</span>, like that in the melon, the only other place is found in the <span class="highlight">dolphin</span>, is in the <span class="highlight">lower</span> <span class="highlight">jaw</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.57" data-time="225.82">[03:45.82]</span>Turns out that the <span class="highlight">lower</span> <span class="highlight">jaw</span>, well, it is made of a specially thin bone. <span class="time" data-times="5.38" data-time="231.39">[03:51.39]</span>And it is very <span class="highlight">sensitive</span> to vibrations, to <span class="highlight">sound</span> energy traveling <span class="highlight">through</span> the seawater. <span class="time" data-times="8.57" data-time="236.77">[03:56.77]</span>It turns out that the <span class="highlight">jaw</span> is <span class="highlight">primarily</span> <span class="highlight">responsible</span> for capturing and transferring returning <span class="highlight">sound</span> waves to the <span class="highlight">dolphin</span>'s <span class="highlight">inner</span> ear. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="8.66" data-time="245.34">[04:05.34]</span>So these rapid clicks that are sent out <span class="highlight">bounce</span> off objects, maybe a group of fish swimming over here, a boat coming from over there. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="254">[04:14.00]</span>The sounds <span class="highlight">bounce</span> off them and the <span class="highlight">lower</span> <span class="highlight">jaw</span> captures the returning sounds, making it possible for the <span class="highlight">dolphin</span> to <span class="highlight">sense</span> what's in the surrounding water and decide where to swim. </p>

              <p>In fact, this subject sentence is not really obvious, but after listening to the opening, combined with the full text, this question is not difficult to understand. The B option is somewhat confusing, but one of the dolphin's voices is used to locate, and communication is wrong. Still A correct.</p>

              <p>And the puzzle is how does the click sounds get transmitted into water. It's not easy as it might seem.

Although the positioning sentence may not completely summarize the options, a large paragraph from the positioning sentence illustrates the problem. Select D.</p>
