OK. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.53" data-time="65.75">[01:05.75]</span>You've got a <span class="highlight">sound</span> wave traveling merrily <span class="highlight">along</span><span class="highlight">through</span> one <span class="highlight">medium</span>, when suddenly, it hits a different <span class="highlight">medium</span>, what does <span class="highlight">gonna</span> happen then? <span class="time" data-times="7.78" data-time="73.28">[01:13.28]</span>Well, some of the energy is going to be reflected back, and some of it is going to be transmitted into the <span class="highlight">second</span><span class="highlight">medium</span>. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="13.51" data-time="81.06">[01:21.06]</span>And, and , and if the two <span class="highlight">media</span> have really different densities, like <span class="highlight">air</span> and water, then most of the energy is going to be reflected back, very little of it will keep going, uh, get transmitted into the new <span class="highlight">medium</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.83" data-time="94.57">[01:34.57]</span>I mean, just think how little noise from the outside world actually reaches you when your head is underwater. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.37" data-time="100.4">[01:40.40]</span>So, how did the <span class="highlight">dolphin</span>'s clicks get transmitted from its air-filled nasal sacs into the ocean water? <span class="time" data-times="12.17" data-time="107.77">[01:47.77]</span>Because <span class="highlight">given</span> the <span class="highlight">difference</span> in <span class="highlight">density</span> between the <span class="highlight">air</span> in the nasal <span class="highlight">cavity</span> and the seawater, we'd <span class="highlight">expect</span> those sounds to just kind of go bouncing around inside the <span class="highlight">dolphin</span>'s head, which will do it no good at all. <span class="time" data-times="6.05" data-time="119.94">[01:59.94]</span>If it's going to <span class="highlight">navigate</span> it, needs those sounds to be <span class="highlight">broadcast</span> and bounced back from objects in its <span class="highlight">path</span>. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.65" data-time="125.99">[02:05.99]</span>Well, turns out dolphins have a structure in their foreheads, just in front of their nasal sacs, called a melon. <span class="time" data-times="7.63" data-time="133.64">[02:13.64]</span>Now, the melon is kind of a large sac-like <span class="highlight">pouch</span>, made up of fat <span class="highlight">tissue</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.04" data-time="141.27">[02:21.27]</span>And this fat <span class="highlight">tissue</span> has some rather <span class="highlight">fascinating</span><span class="highlight">acoustical</span> properties.<span class="time" data-times="9.58" data-time="146.31">[02:26.31]</span>Most of the fat that you find in an animal's body is used for storing energy, but this fat, which you find in dolphins, and only in the melon and around the <span class="highlight">lower</span><span class="highlight">jaw</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.57" data-time="155.89">[02:35.89]</span>This fat is very different, very rich in oil. <span class="time" data-times="3.51" data-time="159.46">[02:39.46]</span>And it turns out it has a very different purpose as well. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.21" data-time="162.97">[02:42.97]</span>Now, one way to um, <span class="highlight">modify</span> the <span class="highlight">overcome</span> this mismatch in the <span class="highlight">density</span> of <span class="highlight">air</span> and water would be?<span class="time" data-times="9.14" data-time="168.18">[02:48.18]</span>If you could <span class="highlight">modify</span> the <span class="highlight">velocity</span> of the <span class="highlight">sound</span> wave, the <span class="highlight">velocity</span> of the <span class="highlight">sound</span> wave, make it precisely <span class="highlight">match</span> the speed at which <span class="highlight">sound</span> travels <span class="highlight">through</span> water.<span class="time" data-times="5.21" data-time="177.32">[02:57.32]</span>And that's exactly what <span class="highlight">marine</span> biologists have discovered the melon does. <span class="time" data-times="7.79" data-time="182.53">[03:02.53]</span>Note that the bursa, these little projections at the <span class="highlight">rear</span> of the melon, are right up against the air-filled nasal sacs. <span class="time" data-times="5.52" data-time="190.32">[03:10.32]</span>And these bursa, it turns out, are what's <span class="highlight">responsible</span> for transferring <span class="highlight">sound</span> to the melon. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.42" data-time="195.84">[03:15.84]</span>The <span class="highlight">sound</span> waves are then transmitted by the bursa <span class="highlight">through</span> the melon. <span class="time" data-times="9.54" data-time="200.26">[03:20.26]</span>First <span class="highlight">through</span> a low <span class="highlight">velocity</span><span class="highlight">core</span>, and then <span class="highlight">through</span> a high <span class="highlight">velocity</span><span class="highlight">shell</span>, where their speed is increased before they are transmitted into the surrounding seawater. <span class="time" data-times="5.78" data-time="209.8">[03:29.80]</span>So now the signals can be efficiently transferred into the water, with <span class="highlight">minimal</span><span class="highlight">reflection</span>. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="10.24" data-time="215.58">[03:35.58]</span>The only other place, this <span class="highlight">special</span> fatty <span class="highlight">tissue</span>, like that in the melon, the only other place is found in the <span class="highlight">dolphin</span>, is in the <span class="highlight">lower</span><span class="highlight">jaw</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.57" data-time="225.82">[03:45.82]</span>Turns out that the <span class="highlight">lower</span><span class="highlight">jaw</span>, well, it is made of a specially thin bone. <span class="time" data-times="5.38" data-time="231.39">[03:51.39]</span>And it is very <span class="highlight">sensitive</span> to vibrations, to <span class="highlight">sound</span> energy traveling <span class="highlight">through</span> the seawater. <span class="time" data-times="8.57" data-time="236.77">[03:56.77]</span>It turns out that the <span class="highlight">jaw</span> is <span class="highlight">primarily</span><span class="highlight">responsible</span> for capturing and transferring returning <span class="highlight">sound</span> waves to the <span class="highlight">dolphin</span>'s <span class="highlight">inner</span> ear. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="8.66" data-time="245.34">[04:05.34]</span>So these rapid clicks that are sent out <span class="highlight">bounce</span> off objects, maybe a group of fish swimming over here, a boat coming from over there. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="254">[04:14.00]</span>The sounds <span class="highlight">bounce</span> off them and the <span class="highlight">lower</span><span class="highlight">jaw</span> captures the returning sounds, making it possible for the <span class="highlight">dolphin</span> to <span class="highlight">sense</span> what's in the surrounding water and decide where to swim. </p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the lecture mainly about?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Parts of the dolphin's anatomy that allow it to navigate.</p><p>B. Two different types of communication used by dolphins.</p><p>C. The way that dolphins store air while swimming underwater.</p><p>D. The meanings of different signals used by dolphins.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>We have been talking about how how sea animals find their way underwater, how they navigate, and this brings up an interesting puzzle, and one I'm sure you'll all enjoy. I mean, everybody loves dolphins, right?</p><p>In fact, this subject sentence is not really obvious, but after listening to the opening, combined with the full text, this question is not difficult to understand. The B option is somewhat confusing, but one of the dolphin's voices is used to locate, and communication is wrong. Still A correct.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor discuss the speed at which sound travels?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To describe why sounds made under water can travel long distances.</p><p>B. To show why a person cannot hear a dolphin well when it is under water.</p><p>C. To compare the speed of two different sounds made by dolphins.</p><p>D. To explain how sound waves behave when crossing from one medium into another.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>And the puzzle is how does the click sounds get transmitted into water. It's not easy as it might seem. Having said this, the professor began to explain and said the speed of the sound. Later on, they say different media, so it's actually quite a good choice. Although the positioning sentence may not completely summarize the options, a large paragraph from the positioning sentence illustrates the problem. Select D.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the dolphin's melon?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. An oval-shaped bone that lets the dolphin hear sounds.</p><p>B. An organ made of fat tissue that helps a dolphin send sound waves.</p><p>C. An air-filled cavity that lets the dolphin breathe underwater.</p><p>D. An organ filled with water that helps the dolphin measure depth.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>And that's exactly what marine biologists have discovered the melon Note that the bursa, these little projections at the rear of the melon, are right up against the air-filled nasal sacs.</p><p>Well is a reminder, need to get everyone's attention, then say what called a melon. The science term appears, behind certainly must explain, ah, the explanation is the question! The sentence in front of them said that they need to spread these sound waves, so they chose B.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the dolphin's jaw able to do?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Send rapid clicking sounds into water.</p><p>B. Increase the speed of sounds.</p><p>C. Receive sound waves that have reflected off objects.</p><p>D. Force water through the nasal sacs and out the blowhole.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>It turns out that the jaw is fresh responsible for capturing and transferring returning sound waves to the dolphin's inner ear. The first two sentences have a professor pause and there is only only... this is the tip! Then this sentence says that the claws are mainly responsible for capturing the reflected sound waves, so we chose C</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>How does the professor organize the information in the lecture?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. By describing a phenomenon and the physical structures that make it possible.</p><p>B. By describing several of the dolphin's senses and their relative usefulness.</p><p>C. By contrasting how the dolphin makes two different types of sounds.</p><p>D. By describing an old theory and then a new theory.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>Need to grasp the full text of the first ~ said that the dolphins can make two sounds, and then led to a puzzle to explain, so that the place to send and receive sound waves. So picking A is no problem.</p></div></div><div class="replay" id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor say this:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To find out whether students are familiar with the lecture topic.</p><p>B. To mention a related topic that will not be discussed in detail.</p><p>C. To mention a common misconception about dolphin vocalizations.</p><p>D. To point out a primary function of dolphin blowholes.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Uh, one being the vocalizations you are probably all familiar with, which they emit through their blowholes.</p><p>Behind the but is the focus, here is just mentioned.
