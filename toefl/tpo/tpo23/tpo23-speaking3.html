        <article>
          <h4 class="w3-center">No More International News</h4>
          <p>For the past few years, the daily campus newspaper has included a one-page international news section covering a few of the major stories in world news. Starting next month, the section will be eliminated. One of the reasons the newspaper editors gave for the decision to cut the section is that other news sources are better able to provide wider and more up-to-date international news coverage. The editors also noted that the change would create space for a new calendar page that will list events and activities around campus.</p>

        <h3>Listening Text</h3>
        <article>
          <p>Now listen to two students discussing the article.</p>
          <p>(man) Hey, what do you think of this?</p>
          <p>(woman) You mean the editors' decision?</p>
          <p>(man) Right.</p>
          <p>(woman) I think they are right. It's the thing to do.</p>
          <p>(man) Really? Why?</p>
          <p>(woman) Well, hardly anyone reads that section.</p>
          <p>(man) You don't think so?</p>
          <p>(woman) Not really, I mean, they only cover stories and most people already know about them before they even get around to reading the campus paper.</p>
          <p>(man) True, if you get the local paper, or use the internet, you already know the major stories.</p>
          <p>(woman) Exactly, and the coverage's better. I think we should just stick with campus news and stuff.</p>
          <p>(man) So do you think what they're gonna replace with is better?</p>
          <p>(woman) Definitely, right now, how do you learn about what's happening on campus?</p>
          <p>(man) Mostly from posters in different buildings or in the student center.</p>
          <p>(woman) Right, the information is everywhere but it's hard to keep track of it. I see stuff posted but then I forget about it half the time. (man) So you're saying that with this new section?</p>
          <p>(woman) You could just cut it out from the newspaper and carry it around and check it anytime and know what's taking place when and where.</p>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>Well, according to the plan the daily campus newspaper will replace the world news section with a new calendar page that covers campus news events and activities. Accordingly, the woman agrees with the decision for two main reasons. First, she says there are no readers of the world news section simply because students already know about the major story before they get around to read the campus paper. Secondly, the woman thinks that most readers of the campus newspaper just stick to the campus news and stuff like that. Students get news about what's happening on campus mostly from the posters in different buildings or in the students' center, so they might easily forget about the information. However they could cut the campus news section from the paper, carry it around and check it whenever and where very they want. So the woman agrees with the decision for the reasons above.
