            <span class="time" data-times="17.84" data-time="98.8">[01:38.80]</span>Well, scientists have recently analyzed the inscriptions on the <span class="highlight">mechanism</span> and re-examine the other <span class="highlight">cargo</span> in the ship <span class="highlight">wreck</span>, and the <span class="highlight">evidence</span> makes an <span class="highlight">absolute</span> case that this <span class="highlight">device</span> dates back to <span class="highlight">ancient</span> Greece somewhere between 150 and 100 B.C.E. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="13.11" data-time="116.64">[01:56.64]</span>What makes that so <span class="highlight">fascinating</span> is that before we found the Antikythera <span class="highlight">Mechanism</span>, the earliest <span class="highlight">device</span> we had that could <span class="highlight">track</span> the Sun and moon like this was invented over 1,000 years later. <span class="time" data-times="4.58" data-time="129.75">[02:09.75]</span>So when this was first found, people <span class="highlight">literally</span> would not believe it. <span class="time" data-times="10.7" data-time="134.33">[02:14.33]</span>Some of my colleagues insisted it had to have been made well after 100 B.C.E, but this <span class="highlight">physical</span> <span class="highlight">evidence</span> was conclusive--it was that old. </p>

            <span class="time" data-times="7.82" data-time="145.03">[02:25.03]</span>Of <span class="highlight">course</span> part of what made this find so unusual is that the Antikythera <span class="highlight">Mechanism</span> is constructed of <span class="highlight">bronze</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.03" data-time="152.85">[02:32.85]</span>Now, it is not that <span class="highlight">bronze</span> was all that <span class="highlight">rare</span> in Greece then, it is just that <span class="highlight">bronze</span> was <span class="highlight">valuable</span> and could easily be recycled. <span class="time" data-times="7.42" data-time="160.88">[02:40.88]</span>It would have been <span class="highlight">relatively</span> easy for a person with knowledge of metals to <span class="highlight">melt</span> down <span class="highlight">bronze</span> objects and <span class="highlight">forge</span> them into? <span class="time" data-times="1.83" data-time="168.3">[02:48.30]</span>Well, say, coins. <span class="time" data-times="2.51" data-time="170.13">[02:50.13]</span> <span class="highlight">Bronze</span> was used to made money back then. <span class="time" data-times="4.36" data-time="172.64">[02:52.64]</span>Or <span class="highlight">mold</span> the <span class="highlight">bronze</span> into anything else of value for that matter. </p>

            <span class="time" data-times="7.23" data-time="177">[02:57.00]</span>We are very fortunate that the <span class="highlight">device</span> ended up under water, because <span class="highlight">otherwise</span> it probably would have ended up recycled into? <span class="time" data-times="1.44" data-time="184.23">[03:04.23]</span>Who knows what. <span class="time" data-times="4.33" data-time="185.67">[03:05.67]</span>Now, it was a <span class="highlight">challenge</span> to <span class="highlight">figure</span> out the Antikythera <span class="highlight">Mechanism</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.93" data-time="190">[03:10.00]</span>It spent over 2,000 years at the bottom of the sea before it was discovered. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.45" data-time="194.93">[03:14.93]</span>And <span class="highlight">even</span> after it was discovered, it was still a number of years before we really understood what it was. <span class="time" data-times="7.32" data-time="201.38">[03:21.38]</span>You see, the <span class="highlight">mechanism</span> had corroded underwater, and many of the gears were <span class="highlight">stuck</span> together in a <span class="highlight">mass</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.7" data-time="208.7">[03:28.70]</span>Cleaning it was only <span class="highlight">partly</span> successful. <span class="time" data-times="10.87" data-time="211.4">[03:31.40]</span>We could only get a good look at the structure of the gears after gamma-rays were used to see inside, very <span class="highlight">similar</span> to the way X-rays are used to see your bones. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.51" data-time="222.27">[03:42.27]</span>Now, once we got a good look inside, we saw a really <span class="highlight">complex</span> <span class="highlight">device</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.92" data-time="227.78">[03:47.78]</span>The many gears not only moved in a way that could <span class="highlight">indicate</span> the phases of the moon. <span class="time" data-times="5.86" data-time="232.7">[03:52.70]</span>The Antikythera <span class="highlight">Mechanism</span> also tracked both the <span class="highlight">lunar</span> year and the <span class="highlight">solar</span> year. <span class="time" data-times="6.77" data-time="238.56">[03:58.56]</span>Additionally, the gears also moved to <span class="highlight">match</span> the motions of the <span class="highlight">planet</span> and predicted eclipses. <span class="time" data-times="17.26" data-time="245.33">[04:05.33]</span>But one thing that is particularly <span class="highlight">notable</span> is that the <span class="highlight">mechanism</span> was so <span class="highlight">precise</span> that it <span class="highlight">even</span> took into <span class="highlight">account</span> a <span class="highlight">particular</span> <span class="highlight">irregularity</span> in the moon's <span class="highlight">orbit</span>, which requires some very <span class="highlight">complex</span> math to <span class="highlight">replicate</span> in <span class="highlight">mechanical</span> <span class="highlight">device</span>. </p>

              <p>But one thing that is particularly notable is that the mechanism was so precise that it even took into account a special irregularity in the moon's orbit, which requires some very complex math to replicate in mechanical device.</p>
              <p>The professor said one thing that is particularly noteworthy is that this machine is very accurate, that is, it uses it to measure a particularly irregular lunar orbit. With but, and emphasized sentences, there are special cases used twice. The explanation is more advanced than our imagination, choose C</p>
