part of a lecture in an <span class="highlight">archaeology</span> class. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="8.84" data-time="5.63">[00:05.63]</span>Professor: I was talking to one of my colleagues in the physics <span class="highlight">department</span> the other day, and we ended up discussing how one discovery can change everything. <span class="time" data-times="5.8" data-time="14.47">[00:14.47]</span>My <span class="highlight">colleague</span> mentioned how the <span class="highlight">theory</span> of relativity completely changed the <span class="highlight">field</span> of physics. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="8.4" data-time="20.27">[00:20.27]</span>At any rates, that <span class="highlight">conversation</span> got me thinking about <span class="highlight">archaeological</span> finds that really changed our understanding of <span class="highlight">ancient</span> civilizations. <span class="time" data-times="4.62" data-time="28.67">[00:28.67]</span>So I want to talk about the discovery of the Antikythera <span class="highlight">Mechanism</span>. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="8.7" data-time="33.29">[00:33.29]</span>The Antikythera <span class="highlight">Mechanism</span> was found a hundred years ago, under water in an <span class="highlight">ancient</span> Greek shipwreck in the <span class="highlight">Mediterranean</span> Sea. <span class="time" data-times="4.91" data-time="41.99">[00:41.99]</span>It was in extremely poor condition and in many corroded pieces. <span class="time" data-times="3.92" data-time="46.9">[00:46.90]</span>But once we figured out what it was and reconstructed it. <span class="time" data-times="5.38" data-time="50.82">[00:50.82]</span>Well, I <span class="highlight">simply</span> don't have the words to <span class="highlight">convey</span> how <span class="highlight">extraordinary</span> this find was. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="10.3" data-time="56.2">[00:56.20]</span>The Antikythera <span class="highlight">Mechanism</span> is a <span class="highlight">relatively</span> small <span class="highlight">device</span>, <span class="highlight">roughly</span> the size of a shoebox, made of gears fitted inside a wooden case. <span class="time" data-times="12.4" data-time="66.5">[01:06.50]</span>In its <span class="highlight">original</span><span class="highlight">state</span>, there were rotating dials and other indicators on the top, with letters and drawings showing the Sun, the phases of the moon and different constellations. <span class="time" data-times="4.56" data-time="78.9">[01:18.90]</span>Inside the box, <span class="highlight">bronze</span> gears would have rotated the displays. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="10.61" data-time="83.46">[01:23.46]</span>The displays, uh, the indicators of the Antikythera <span class="highlight">Mechanism</span>, would then move to show the <span class="highlight">motion</span> of the Sun and moon <span class="highlight">relative</span> to the planets and stars. <span class="time" data-times="4.73" data-time="94.07">[01:34.07]</span>The <span class="highlight">device</span> could be used to tell the different phases of the moon and much more. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="17.84" data-time="98.8">[01:38.80]</span>Well, scientists have recently analyzed the inscriptions on the <span class="highlight">mechanism</span> and re-examine the other <span class="highlight">cargo</span> in the ship <span class="highlight">wreck</span>, and the <span class="highlight">evidence</span> makes an <span class="highlight">absolute</span> case that this <span class="highlight">device</span> dates back to <span class="highlight">ancient</span> Greece somewhere between 150 and 100 B.C.E. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="13.11" data-time="116.64">[01:56.64]</span>What makes that so <span class="highlight">fascinating</span> is that before we found the Antikythera <span class="highlight">Mechanism</span>, the earliest <span class="highlight">device</span> we had that could <span class="highlight">track</span> the Sun and moon like this was invented over 1,000 years later. <span class="time" data-times="4.58" data-time="129.75">[02:09.75]</span>So when this was first found, people <span class="highlight">literally</span> would not believe it. <span class="time" data-times="10.7" data-time="134.33">[02:14.33]</span>Some of my colleagues insisted it had to have been made well after 100 B.C.E, but this <span class="highlight">physical</span><span class="highlight">evidence</span> was conclusive--it was that old. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.82" data-time="145.03">[02:25.03]</span>Of <span class="highlight">course</span> part of what made this find so unusual is that the Antikythera <span class="highlight">Mechanism</span> is constructed of <span class="highlight">bronze</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.03" data-time="152.85">[02:32.85]</span>Now, it is not that <span class="highlight">bronze</span> was all that <span class="highlight">rare</span> in Greece then, it is just that <span class="highlight">bronze</span> was <span class="highlight">valuable</span> and could easily be recycled. <span class="time" data-times="7.42" data-time="160.88">[02:40.88]</span>It would have been <span class="highlight">relatively</span> easy for a person with knowledge of metals to <span class="highlight">melt</span> down <span class="highlight">bronze</span> objects and <span class="highlight">forge</span> them into? <span class="time" data-times="1.83" data-time="168.3">[02:48.30]</span>Well, say, coins. <span class="time" data-times="2.51" data-time="170.13">[02:50.13]</span><span class="highlight">Bronze</span> was used to made money back then. <span class="time" data-times="4.36" data-time="172.64">[02:52.64]</span>Or <span class="highlight">mold</span> the <span class="highlight">bronze</span> into anything else of value for that matter. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.23" data-time="177">[02:57.00]</span>We are very fortunate that the <span class="highlight">device</span> ended up under water, because <span class="highlight">otherwise</span> it probably would have ended up recycled into? <span class="time" data-times="1.44" data-time="184.23">[03:04.23]</span>Who knows what. <span class="time" data-times="4.33" data-time="185.67">[03:05.67]</span>Now, it was a <span class="highlight">challenge</span> to <span class="highlight">figure</span> out the Antikythera <span class="highlight">Mechanism</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.93" data-time="190">[03:10.00]</span>It spent over 2,000 years at the bottom of the sea before it was discovered. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.45" data-time="194.93">[03:14.93]</span>And <span class="highlight">even</span> after it was discovered, it was still a number of years before we really understood what it was. <span class="time" data-times="7.32" data-time="201.38">[03:21.38]</span>You see, the <span class="highlight">mechanism</span> had corroded underwater, and many of the gears were <span class="highlight">stuck</span> together in a <span class="highlight">mass</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.7" data-time="208.7">[03:28.70]</span>Cleaning it was only <span class="highlight">partly</span> successful. <span class="time" data-times="10.87" data-time="211.4">[03:31.40]</span>We could only get a good look at the structure of the gears after gamma-rays were used to see inside, very <span class="highlight">similar</span> to the way X-rays are used to see your bones. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.51" data-time="222.27">[03:42.27]</span>Now, once we got a good look inside, we saw a really <span class="highlight">complex</span><span class="highlight">device</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.92" data-time="227.78">[03:47.78]</span>The many gears not only moved in a way that could <span class="highlight">indicate</span> the phases of the moon. <span class="time" data-times="5.86" data-time="232.7">[03:52.70]</span>The Antikythera <span class="highlight">Mechanism</span> also tracked both the <span class="highlight">lunar</span> year and the <span class="highlight">solar</span> year. <span class="time" data-times="6.77" data-time="238.56">[03:58.56]</span>Additionally, the gears also moved to <span class="highlight">match</span> the motions of the <span class="highlight">planet</span> and predicted eclipses. <span class="time" data-times="17.26" data-time="245.33">[04:05.33]</span>But one thing that is particularly <span class="highlight">notable</span> is that the <span class="highlight">mechanism</span> was so <span class="highlight">precise</span> that it <span class="highlight">even</span> took into <span class="highlight">account</span> a <span class="highlight">particular</span><span class="highlight">irregularity</span> in the moon's <span class="highlight">orbit</span>, which requires some very <span class="highlight">complex</span> math to <span class="highlight">replicate</span> in <span class="highlight">mechanical</span><span class="highlight">device</span>. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="10.81" data-time="262.59">[04:22.59]</span>You could say that the Antikythera <span class="highlight">Mechanism</span> was a very <span class="highlight">precise</span><span class="highlight">calendar</span>, which stands to reasons calendars were very important to <span class="highlight">ancient</span> peoples. <span class="time" data-times="6.37" data-time="273.4">[04:33.40]</span><span class="highlight">Religious</span> festivals had to be held at the right time of year, crops needed to be planted at the right time as well. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="279.77">[04:39.77]</span>And let's not forget that eclipses in <span class="highlight">planetary</span> motions had important <span class="highlight">symbolic</span> meanings.  </p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the lecture mainly about?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

An archaeological discovery that challenged an accepted historical view.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>At any rates, that conversation got me thinking about archaeological finds that really changed our understanding of ancient civilizations.</p><p>This question is very confusing, because everyone's attention should be completely attracted by the thing behind the AM. However, the AM thing is only for the purpose of illustrating which archaeological find has challenged everyone's attempts.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor,how did the Antikythera Mechanism work?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Dials on the device could be turned to calculate a ship's location at sea.</p><p>B. The device was used to operate a larger computing system.</p><p>C. A system of gears rotated the images located on the case.</p><p>D. Light from the Sun illuminated particular indicators on the case throughout the day.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Inside the box, bronze gears would have rotated the displays.</p><p>The professor paid attention to the paused content after the main sentence and said that AM is a very small device with a lot of gears. The focus is actually on the inside of the box.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the professor's attitude about the proposition that the Antikythera Mechanism is over two thousand years old?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.
