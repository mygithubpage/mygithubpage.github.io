              <span class="time" data-times="5.63" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in an <span class="underline">archaeology</span> class. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.84" data-time="5.63">[00:05.63]</span>Professor: I was talking to one of my colleagues in the physics <span class="underline">department</span> the other day, and we ended up discussing how one discovery can change everything. <span class="time" data-times="5.8" data-time="14.47">[00:14.47]</span>My <span class="underline">colleague</span> mentioned how the <span class="underline">theory</span> of relativity completely changed the <span class="underline">field</span> of physics. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.4" data-time="20.27">[00:20.27]</span>At any rates, that <span class="underline">conversation</span> got me thinking about <span class="underline">archaeological</span> finds that really changed our understanding of <span class="underline">ancient</span> civilizations. <span class="time" data-times="4.62" data-time="28.67">[00:28.67]</span>So I want to talk about the discovery of the Antikythera <span class="underline">Mechanism</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.7" data-time="33.29">[00:33.29]</span>The Antikythera <span class="underline">Mechanism</span> was found a hundred years ago, under water in an <span class="underline">ancient</span> Greek shipwreck in the <span class="underline">Mediterranean</span> Sea. <span class="time" data-times="4.91" data-time="41.99">[00:41.99]</span>It was in extremely poor condition and in many corroded pieces. <span class="time" data-times="3.92" data-time="46.9">[00:46.90]</span>But once we figured out what it was and reconstructed it. <span class="time" data-times="5.38" data-time="50.82">[00:50.82]</span>Well, I <span class="underline">simply</span> don't have the words to <span class="underline">convey</span> how <span class="underline">extraordinary</span> this find was. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.3" data-time="56.2">[00:56.20]</span>The Antikythera <span class="underline">Mechanism</span> is a <span class="underline">relatively</span> small <span class="underline">device</span>, <span class="underline">roughly</span> the size of a shoebox, made of gears fitted inside a wooden case. <span class="time" data-times="12.4" data-time="66.5">[01:06.50]</span>In its <span class="underline">original</span> <span class="underline">state</span>, there were rotating dials and other indicators on the top, with letters and drawings showing the Sun, the phases of the moon and different constellations. <span class="time" data-times="4.56" data-time="78.9">[01:18.90]</span>Inside the box, <span class="underline">bronze</span> gears would have rotated the displays. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.61" data-time="83.46">[01:23.46]</span>The displays, uh, the indicators of the Antikythera <span class="underline">Mechanism</span>, would then move to show the <span class="underline">motion</span> of the Sun and moon <span class="underline">relative</span> to the planets and stars. <span class="time" data-times="4.73" data-time="94.07">[01:34.07]</span>The <span class="underline">device</span> could be used to tell the different phases of the moon and much more. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="17.84" data-time="98.8">[01:38.80]</span>Well, scientists have recently analyzed the inscriptions on the <span class="underline">mechanism</span> and re-examine the other <span class="underline">cargo</span> in the ship <span class="underline">wreck</span>, and the <span class="underline">evidence</span> makes an <span class="underline">absolute</span> case that this <span class="underline">device</span> dates back to <span class="underline">ancient</span> Greece somewhere between 150 and 100 B.C.E. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="13.11" data-time="116.64">[01:56.64]</span>What makes that so <span class="underline">fascinating</span> is that before we found the Antikythera <span class="underline">Mechanism</span>, the earliest <span class="underline">device</span> we had that could <span class="underline">track</span> the Sun and moon like this was invented over 1,000 years later. <span class="time" data-times="4.58" data-time="129.75">[02:09.75]</span>So when this was first found, people <span class="underline">literally</span> would not believe it. <span class="time" data-times="10.7" data-time="134.33">[02:14.33]</span>Some of my colleagues insisted it had to have been made well after 100 B.C.E, but this <span class="underline">physical</span> <span class="underline">evidence</span> was conclusive--it was that old. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.82" data-time="145.03">[02:25.03]</span>Of <span class="underline">course</span> part of what made this find so unusual is that the Antikythera <span class="underline">Mechanism</span> is constructed of <span class="underline">bronze</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.03" data-time="152.85">[02:32.85]</span>Now, it is not that <span class="underline">bronze</span> was all that <span class="underline">rare</span> in Greece then, it is just that <span class="underline">bronze</span> was <span class="underline">valuable</span> and could easily be recycled. <span class="time" data-times="7.42" data-time="160.88">[02:40.88]</span>It would have been <span class="underline">relatively</span> easy for a person with knowledge of metals to <span class="underline">melt</span> down <span class="underline">bronze</span> objects and <span class="underline">forge</span> them into? <span class="time" data-times="1.83" data-time="168.3">[02:48.30]</span>Well, say, coins. <span class="time" data-times="2.51" data-time="170.13">[02:50.13]</span> <span class="underline">Bronze</span> was used to made money back then. <span class="time" data-times="4.36" data-time="172.64">[02:52.64]</span>Or <span class="underline">mold</span> the <span class="underline">bronze</span> into anything else of value for that matter. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.23" data-time="177">[02:57.00]</span>We are very fortunate that the <span class="underline">device</span> ended up under water, because <span class="underline">otherwise</span> it probably would have ended up recycled into? <span class="time" data-times="1.44" data-time="184.23">[03:04.23]</span>Who knows what. <span class="time" data-times="4.33" data-time="185.67">[03:05.67]</span>Now, it was a <span class="underline">challenge</span> to <span class="underline">figure</span> out the Antikythera <span class="underline">Mechanism</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.93" data-time="190">[03:10.00]</span>It spent over 2,000 years at the bottom of the sea before it was discovered. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.45" data-time="194.93">[03:14.93]</span>And <span class="underline">even</span> after it was discovered, it was still a number of years before we really understood what it was. <span class="time" data-times="7.32" data-time="201.38">[03:21.38]</span>You see, the <span class="underline">mechanism</span> had corroded underwater, and many of the gears were <span class="underline">stuck</span> together in a <span class="underline">mass</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.7" data-time="208.7">[03:28.70]</span>Cleaning it was only <span class="underline">partly</span> successful. <span class="time" data-times="10.87" data-time="211.4">[03:31.40]</span>We could only get a good look at the structure of the gears after gamma-rays were used to see inside, very <span class="underline">similar</span> to the way X-rays are used to see your bones. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.51" data-time="222.27">[03:42.27]</span>Now, once we got a good look inside, we saw a really <span class="underline">complex</span> <span class="underline">device</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.92" data-time="227.78">[03:47.78]</span>The many gears not only moved in a way that could <span class="underline">indicate</span> the phases of the moon. <span class="time" data-times="5.86" data-time="232.7">[03:52.70]</span>The Antikythera <span class="underline">Mechanism</span> also tracked both the <span class="underline">lunar</span> year and the <span class="underline">solar</span> year. <span class="time" data-times="6.77" data-time="238.56">[03:58.56]</span>Additionally, the gears also moved to <span class="underline">match</span> the motions of the <span class="underline">planet</span> and predicted eclipses. <span class="time" data-times="17.26" data-time="245.33">[04:05.33]</span>But one thing that is particularly <span class="underline">notable</span> is that the <span class="underline">mechanism</span> was so <span class="underline">precise</span> that it <span class="underline">even</span> took into <span class="underline">account</span> a <span class="underline">particular</span> <span class="underline">irregularity</span> in the moon's <span class="underline">orbit</span>, which requires some very <span class="underline">complex</span> math to <span class="underline">replicate</span> in <span class="underline">mechanical</span> <span class="underline">device</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.81" data-time="262.59">[04:22.59]</span>You could say that the Antikythera <span class="underline">Mechanism</span> was a very <span class="underline">precise</span> <span class="underline">calendar</span>, which stands to reasons calendars were very important to <span class="underline">ancient</span> peoples. <span class="time" data-times="6.37" data-time="273.4">[04:33.40]</span> <span class="underline">Religious</span> festivals had to be held at the right time of year, crops needed to be planted at the right time as well. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="279.77">[04:39.77]</span>And let's not forget that eclipses in <span class="underline">planetary</span> motions had important <span class="underline">symbolic</span> meanings.  </p>
