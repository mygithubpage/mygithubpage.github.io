To request permission to take an advanced course.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>That could actually solve my dilemma, uh, what I originally wanted to ask you ? um, I am working on my schedule schedule for next term, and I've got room for one more course, and I'd like to take more literature. Could I take your Master Writer Class on Joyce?</p><p>Students spent a long time with the professor and suddenly said that I wanted to come here.

It is organized in a predictable way.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>But Araby is easier because it's linear, the story unfold chronologically. The question is obvious. First of all, students ask why? The teacher answered a bunch of questions. He couldn't understand it and he had a relationship because BUT appeared! She said that the plot of Araby was straight-line and was developed in chronological order. So choosing D is organizing articles in a predictable way.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the professor's attitude when she discusses the master writer seminar?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.
