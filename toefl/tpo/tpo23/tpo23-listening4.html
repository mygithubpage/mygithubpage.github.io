              <span class="time" data-times="5.52" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to a <span class="underline">conversation</span> between a student and his English professor. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.98" data-time="5.52">[00:05.52]</span>Professor: Hi, Bob. How is it going?<span class="time" data-times="3.03" data-time="7.5">[00:07.50]</span> Are you enjoying the <span class="underline">Introduction</span> to <span class="underline">Literature</span> class? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.38" data-time="10.53">[00:10.53]</span>Bob: Yeah, it's great. <span class="time" data-times="4.88" data-time="11.91">[00:11.91]</span>Araby, that short story by James Joyce we read last week, it was <span class="underline">awesome</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.26" data-time="16.79">[00:16.79]</span>Professor: I'm glad you like it.<span class="time" data-times="2.64" data-time="18.05">[00:18.05]</span> Most of Joyce's work is very <span class="underline">complex</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.65" data-time="20.69">[00:20.69]</span>A lot of students say that he is hard to understand. <span class="time" data-times="13.68" data-time="23.34">[00:23.34]</span> <span class="underline">Normally</span>, you wouldn't tackle Joyce in an Intro class, but I'd like to give my first year students a <span class="underline">taste</span> of his style, his psychological <span class="underline">approach</span> to <span class="underline">literature</span>, because, mainly because it influenced other writers.<span class="time" data-times="3.37" data-time="37.02">[00:37.02]</span>I only wish we had more class time to discuss it. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.18" data-time="40.39">[00:40.39]</span>Bob: Me too. So why did you pick Araby <span class="underline">instead</span> of some other story? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.8" data-time="44.57">[00:44.57]</span>Professor: Well, um, first you should know that Araby is one of fifteen short stories by Joyce in a book called Dubliners. <span class="time" data-times="6.17" data-time="52.37">[00:52.37]</span>Uh, all the stories are related to one another, and they are set in the same time period. <span class="time" data-times="3.56" data-time="58.54">[00:58.54]</span>But Araby is the easiest one to follow. <span class="time" data-times="13.99" data-time="62.1">[01:02.10]</span>Though all the stories in the collection are written in <span class="underline">stream</span> of <span class="underline">consciousness</span>, which as you know, means they are told <span class="underline">through</span> the <span class="underline">narrator</span>'s thought, <span class="underline">through</span> an <span class="underline">inner</span> <span class="underline">monologue</span>, as <span class="underline">opposed</span> to dialogue or an <span class="underline">objective</span> description of events. <span class="time" data-times="6.23" data-time="76.09">[01:16.09]</span>But Araby is easier because it's <span class="underline">linear</span>, the story unfold chronologically. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.78" data-time="82.32">[01:22.32]</span>Bob: Still, I wish we could read whole novels by Joyce and discussed them in class. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.7" data-time="87.1">[01:27.10]</span>Professor: That's what happens in my Master Writer Class. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.68" data-time="89.8">[01:29.80]</span>Bob: Master Writer Class? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.52" data-time="91.48">[01:31.48]</span>Professor: Yeah, I teach one on Joyce every <span class="underline">spring</span>.<span class="time" data-times="5.95" data-time="94">[01:34.00]</span> It's such a <span class="underline">privilege</span>, spending an entire <span class="underline">term</span> diving into a single body of work. <span class="time" data-times="6.71" data-time="99.95">[01:39.95]</span>And my students, they bring so much <span class="underline">insight</span> to the table that it's easy to forget who the professor is. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.35" data-time="106.66">[01:46.66]</span>Bob: Oh, wow. That could actually solve my <span class="underline">dilemma</span>, uh, what I originally <span class="underline">wanted</span> to ask you? <span class="time" data-times="7.38" data-time="112.01">[01:52.01]</span>Um, I am working on my <span class="underline">schedule</span> for next <span class="underline">term</span>, and I've got room for one more <span class="underline">course</span>, and I'd like to take more <span class="underline">literature</span>.<span class="time" data-times="2.67" data-time="119.39">[01:59.39]</span> Could I take your Master Writer Class on Joyce? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.87" data-time="122.06">[02:02.06]</span>Professor: I'm sorry. I should have mentioned. <span class="time" data-times="3.6" data-time="124.93">[02:04.93]</span>Uh, Master Writer is an <span class="underline">advanced</span> <span class="underline">seminar</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.53" data-time="128.53">[02:08.53]</span>So students need to get a strong <span class="underline">foundation</span> in <span class="underline">literary</span> <span class="underline">theory</span> and <span class="underline">criticism</span> before I let them in the room. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.54" data-time="135.06">[02:15.06]</span>Bob: But I have gotten really good grades on all my paper so far, I'm sure I can keep up. <span class="time" data-times="1.65" data-time="139.6">[02:19.60]</span>Couldn't you make an <span class="underline">exception</span>? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.43" data-time="141.25">[02:21.25]</span>Professor: Your grades are excellent. <span class="time" data-times="9.92" data-time="143.68">[02:23.68]</span>But in our intro class, you are reviewing the basics, like plots, <span class="underline">setting</span> and <span class="underline">character</span> and getting your first real <span class="underline">exposure</span> to different <span class="underline">literary</span> styles. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.35" data-time="153.6">[02:33.60]</span>Bob: But why do I have to study different styles to understand Joyce's novels? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.06" data-time="157.95">[02:37.95]</span>Professor: There are a lot of little details involved in interpreting <span class="underline">literature</span>. <span class="time" data-times="1.78" data-time="162.01">[02:42.01]</span>And like with Joyce.<span class="time" data-times="2.59" data-time="163.79">[02:43.79]</span> His novels have very <span class="underline">unique</span> structures. <span class="time" data-times="5.63" data-time="166.38">[02:46.38]</span>The only way to <span class="underline">appreciate</span> how you meet there is by studying a <span class="underline">variety</span> of authors. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.77" data-time="172.01">[02:52.01]</span>Bob: Oh, OK. So could you suggest a different <span class="underline">literature</span> class then? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.18" data-time="177.78">[02:57.78]</span>Professor: Sure. There's doctor Clain's <span class="underline">course</span> on nineteenth-century novels.<span class="time" data-times="2.27" data-time="181.96">[03:01.96]</span> It's more focused than the class you're in now.<span class="time" data-times="5.22" data-time="184.23">[03:04.23]</span>But it will build on your <span class="underline">current</span> knowledge <span class="underline">base</span> and give you the background you need. <span class="time" data-times="5.93" data-time="189.45">[03:09.45]</span>That, plus a <span class="underline">couple</span> more foundational classes, and you will <span class="underline">definitely</span> be ready for my <span class="underline">seminar</span>. </p>
            <p>
