Some plates carry islands or continents, others form the seafloor. All are slowly moving because the plates <span class="highlight">float</span> on a denser sem-iliquid <span class="highlight">mantle</span>, the <span class="highlight">layer</span> between the <span class="highlight">crust</span> and Earth's <span class="highlight">core</span>. The plates have edges that are spreading ridges (where two plates are moving apart and new seafloor is being created), subduction zones (where two plates <span class="highlight">collide</span> and one plunges <span class="highlight">beneath</span> the other), or <span class="highlight">transform</span> faults (where two plates neither <span class="highlight"><span class="question2">converge</span></span> nor <span class="highlight">diverge</span> but merely move past one another). It is at the boundaries between plates that most of Earth's volcanism and earthquake <span class="highlight">activity</span><span class="highlight">occur</span>.</p><p>Generally speaking, the interiors of plates are geologically uneventful. However, there are exceptions. <span class="question3">A <span class="highlight">glance</span> at a map of the <span class="highlight">Pacific</span> Ocean reveals that there are many islands far out at sea that are actually volcanoes----many no longer active, some overgrown with coral----that originated from <span class="highlight">activity</span> at points in the <span class="highlight">interior</span> of the <span class="highlight">Pacific</span><span class="highlight">Plate</span> that forms the <span class="highlight">Pacific</span> seafloor.</span></p><p>How can <span class="highlight">volcanic</span><span class="highlight">activity</span><span class="highlight">occur</span> so far from a <span class="highlight">plate</span><span class="highlight">boundary</span>? The Hawaiian islands provide a very <span class="question4">instructive</span> answer. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>Like many other island groups, they form a <span class="highlight">chain</span>. 
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>The Hawaiian Islands <span class="highlight">Chain</span> extends northwest from the island of Hawaii. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>In the 1840s American <span class="highlight">geologist</span> James Daly observed that the different Hawaii islands <span class="highlight">seem</span> to share a <span class="highlight">similar</span> geologic
 <span class="highlight">evolution</span> but are progressively more <span class="question5">eroded</span>, and <span class="highlight">therefore</span> probable older, toward the northwest. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>Then in 1963, in the early days of the <span class="highlight">development</span> of the <span class="highlight">theory</span> of <span class="highlight">plate</span><span class="highlight">tectonics</span>. 
 Canadian geophysicist Tuzo Wilson realized that this age progression could result if the islands were formed on a surface <span class="highlight">plate</span> moving over a fixed <span class="highlight">volcanic</span><span class="highlight">source</span> in the <span class="highlight">interior</span>.
 Wilson suggested that the long <span class="highlight">chain</span> of volcanoes stretching northwest from Hawaii is <span class="highlight">simply</span> the surface expression of a long-lived <span class="highlight">volcanic</span><span class="highlight">source</span> located <span class="highlight">beneath</span> the <span class="highlight">tectonic</span><span class="highlight">plate</span> in the <span class="highlight">mantle</span>.
Today's most northwest island would have been the first to form. They as the <span class="highlight">plate</span> moved slowly northwest, new <span class="highlight">volcanic</span> islands would have forms as the <span class="highlight">plate</span> moved over the <span class="highlight">volcanic</span><span class="highlight">source</span>. 
 The most recent island, Hawaii, would be at the end of the <span class="highlight">chain</span> and is now over the <span class="highlight">volcanic</span><span class="highlight">source</span>.</p><p>Although this idea was not immediately accepted, <span class="question7">the dating of lavas in the Hawaii (and other) chains showed that their ages increase away from the presently active <span class="highlight">volcano</span></span>, just as Daly had suggested. Wilson's <span class="highlight">analysis</span> of these <span class="highlight">data</span> is now a central part of <span class="highlight">plate</span><span class="highlight">tectonics</span>. Most volcanoes that <span class="highlight">occur</span> in the interiors of plates are believed to be produced by <span class="highlight">mantle</span> plumes, columns of <span class="highlight">molten</span> rock that rise from deep <span class="highlight">within</span> the <span class="highlight">mantle</span>. A <span class="highlight">volcano</span> remains an active "hot <span class="highlight">spot</span>" as long as it is over the plume. The plumes apparently <span class="highlight">originate</span> at great depths, perhaps as deep as the <span class="highlight">boundary</span> between the <span class="highlight">core</span> and the <span class="highlight">mantle</span>, and many have been active for a very long time. The oldest volcanoes in the Hawaii hot-spot <span class="highlight">trail</span> have ages close to 80 million years. Other islands, including Tahiti and <span class="highlight">Easter</span> Islands in the <span class="highlight">pacific</span>, <span class="highlight">Reunion</span> and Mauritius in the India Ocean, and indeed most of the large islands in the world's oceans, owe their <span class="highlight">existence</span> to <span class="highlight">mantle</span> plumes.</p><p>The <span class="highlight">oceanic</span><span class="highlight">volcanic</span> islands and their hot-spot trails are thus especially useful for <span class="highlight">geologist</span> because they <span class="highlight">record</span> the past locations of the <span class="highlight">plate</span> over a fixed <span class="highlight">source</span>. They <span class="highlight">therefore</span><span class="highlight">permit</span> the <span class="highlight">reconstruction</span> of the <span class="highlight">process</span> of seafloor spreading, and <span class="highlight">consequently</span> of the geography of continents and of ocean basins in the past. For example, <span class="highlight">given</span> the <span class="highlight"><span class="question11">current</span></span><span class="highlight">position</span> of the <span class="highlight">Pacific</span><span class="highlight">Plate</span>, Hawaii is above the <span class="highlight">Pacific</span> Ocean hot <span class="highlight">spot</span>. So the <span class="highlight">position</span> of The <span class="highlight">Pacific</span><span class="highlight">Plate</span> 50 million years ago can be <span class="highlight">determined</span> by moving it such that a 50-million-year-oil <span class="highlight">volcano</span> in the hot-spot <span class="highlight">trail</span> sits at the location of Hawaii today. However because the ocean basins really are short-lived features on geologic times <span class="highlight">scale</span>, <span class="highlight">reconstruction</span> the world's geography by backtracking <span class="highlight">along</span> the hot-spot <span class="highlight">trail</span> works only for the last 5 percent or so of geologic time.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The author mentions "spreading ridges", "subduction zones", and "transform faults"in order to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. illustrate that the boundaries of tectonic plates are neat, thin lines</p><p>B. explain why some tectonic plates carry islands or continents while others form the seafloor</p><p>C. explain the complex nature of the edges of tectonic plates</p><p>D. provide examples of areas of tectonic plates where little geologic action occurs</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>This part of the original C describes the phenomenon of various types of edges, and explained in detail. The composition of the plate is also referred to as a jigsaw puzzle. It can be seen from two points that it is necessary to reflect its complexity. A is inconsistent with the original. The original does not explain B. The D text gives a place where the geologic action is common, rather than a little ~ occurs.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question2">converge</span></span>"in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. expand</p><p>B. form</p><p>C. rise</p><p>D. move closer</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" D"><p>R-consolidation: Aggregation and <span class="question2">converge</span>nce. The A option is expansion, the B option is formed, the C option is raised, and the D option is moved tighter. The D option is more suitable when it comes to word choice.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage paragraph 2? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Volcanic activity is responsible for the formation of the Pacific seafloor in the interior of the Pacific Plate.</p><p>B. Many volcanoes in the Pacific Ocean are no longer active and have become islands that support coral.</p><p>C. There are many islands in the Pacific Ocean that originated as volcanoes in the interior of the Pacific Plate.</p><p>D. The map of the Pacific Ocean reveals fewer volcanic islands than there truly are because many are no longer active and some are completely overgrown with coral.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The insertion part of the dash within this sentence can be ignored and is not the main logic. The main part of the sentence is that many of the islands are in fact volcanoes, and the origins are mentioned later. Only the C option covers the main content. The A option is far from the meaning of the original sentence. The content of the B option is not the core content of the original sentence, and the core content is omitted; the comparative relationship of the D option such as compare is not reflected in the original sentence, and the original sentence has no causal relationship.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question4">instructive</span></span>"in the passage (paragraph 3) is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. clear</p><p>B. detailed</p><p>C. informative</p><p>D. familiar</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" C"><p>C <span class="question4">instructive</span>: helpful, <span class="question4">instructive</span>, educational. A is clear, B is detailed, and D is familiar. Only C is helpful, educational, and consistent.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question5">eroded</span></span>"in the passage(paragraph 3)is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. worn down</p><p>B. scattered</p><p>C. developed</p><p>D. deserted</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" A"><p>A This saying says different islands seem to have undergone a similar evolutionary process, but some have been more... over time, so it may be more ancient. If islands experience a longer period of time, they should be "<span class="question5">eroded</span>" by seawater even more. So the answer is A, wear down wear. B is scattered, C is developed and mature, and D is abandoned.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>In paragraph 3, what is the relationship between the scientific contribution of James Daly and Tuzo Wilson?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Wilson provided an explanation for the observations made by Daly.</p><p>B. Wilson challenged the theory proposed by Daly.</p><p>C. Wilson found numerous examples of island chains that supported Daly's theory.</p><p>D. Wilson popularized the explanation of volcanic island formation formulated by Daly.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A Position according to the names of the two scientists. From the phrase in then in 1963, we can understand the relationship between the two, saying that during the period when plate theory was just beginning to develop, Tuzo Wilson discovered that ... then surely it made the theory of plates further developed. So B is wrong. Although C has a logical relationship, the article only gave an example of Hawaii Island. So C does not choose. D said that the explanation was popular. Before daly only gave theory and did not explain it, so it was wrong. A is not only logical, but also the description of wilson is correct. Select A.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the author provide the information that "<span class="highlight">the dating of lavas in the Hawaii and other chains showed that their ages increase away from the presently active volcano</span>"?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To point out differences between the Hawaii island chain and other volcanic island chains</p><p>B. To question the idea that all the islands in an island chain have been formed by volcanic activity</p><p>C. To explain why Wilson hypothesis was initially difficult to accept</p><p>D. To provide evidence in support of Daly's and Wilson's ideas about how the Hawaii islands were formed</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="the dating of lavas in the Hawaii and other chains showed that their ages increase away from the presently active volcano D"><p>D sentence modified: just as Daly had suggested. The fact that this fact is given by this sentence modification is to prove that Daly's theory mentioned in the previous paragraph is correct. It can also be seen from the twists and turns in the first half of the sentence that no one accepted his theory before. After the turning point, of course, it is a proof that his theory is based. And D options echo.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, which of the following is true of mantle plumes</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They exist close to the surface of tectonic plates.</p><p>B. They cause most of the volcanic activity that occurs in the interiors of plates.</p><p>C. They are rarely active for long period of time.</p><p>D. They get increasingly older away from the present hot spots.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B According to mantle plumes positioning, the first sentence can be located, saying that it is the cause of the volcanic eruption within the plate, read later you can see it first came from a deep place, followed by a long time. Therefore, A, C, and D are not correct. So correct answer B.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 5, volcanic islands help geologists to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. reconstruct past geography</p><p>B. detect changes in mantle plumes</p><p>C. measure the rigidity of tectonic plates</p><p>D. explain why the seafloor spreads</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A locates the second sentence of this paragraph. Although the D option is correct, A can include D, so choose A.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What can be inferred about the Pacific Plate from paragraph 5?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The hot spots on the Pacific Plate are much older than the ones located on the other tectonic plates.</p><p>B. Most of the volcanic sources beneath the Pacific Plate have become extinct.</p><p>C. The Pacific Plate has moved a distance equal to the length of the Hawaiian Island chain in the past 50 million years.</p><p>D. The Pacific Plate is located above fewer mantle plumes than other plates are.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Positioning for example, positioning sentence is almost the original meaning of option C conversion. A, B, D did not mention the original.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question11">current</span></span>"in the passage (paragraph 5) is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. original</p><p>B. ideal</p><p>C. relative</p><p>D. present</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" D"><p>D <span class="question11">current</span>: Now, <span class="question11">current</span>. A is original, B is ideal, C is relative, and D is now. According to the word meaning, the D option is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 5, why are geologists unable to trace back the entire geologic of continents from hot-spot trails?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Hot spots have existed for only about 5 percent of geologic time.</p><p>B. Hawaii did not exist 50 millions years ago.</p><p>C. Oceanic basins that contained old hot-spot trails disappeared a long time ago.</p><p>D. Hot-spot trails can be reconstructed only for island chains.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C locates the last sentence. It is said that the whole process of change cannot be traced because the ocean basin changes relatively quickly.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>This pattern remained unexplained for a long time..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The This pattern at the beginning of the sentence indicates that the pattern must have been discussed in the previous article, and that the central unexplained also implies what might be said below, and later someone explained the pattern. The three positions of ABC are obviously wrong. There is no discussion about pattern-related content in front of these points, and the three sentences constitute a complete example and cannot be divided. The position of D mentioned the construction theory of the continental section in front of it, but did not give an explanation. The sentence behind D gave the explanation given by another scientist many years later. So the D option is very suitable.</p></div></div><div id="question14" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>Although volcanic activity is concentrated on the edge of tectonic plates, such activity can occur in the interiors of plates as well.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.Our understanding of islands comes from Daly's and Wilson's observations of the Hawaiian Islands, which was later confirmed by plate-tectonic theory.</p><p>B.It has only recently been discovered that tectonic plates are closely fitting rather than loosely constructed, as geologists previously believed.</p><p>C.The hot-spot trails formed by volcanic island chains indicate the positions of tectonic plates as far back as the present ocean basins have existed.</p><p>D.Volcanic island chains such as the Hawaiian Islands form in the interior of a tectonic plate as the plate moves over a fixed volcanic source in the mantle.</p><p>E.Whereas volcanic islands formed by mantle plumes are typically small, most of the world's largest islands are formed at the edges of tectonic plates.</p><p>F.The Pacific Plate has existed for as long as the Hawaiian Islands have existed, namely for more than 80 million years.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="ACD"><p>ACD A is correct. The whole article is saying this. It has been said that the volcanic phenomenon in Hawaii Island proved the theory of continental plate structure. This long ago discovered it, when daly proposed it was closely fitting. C is correct. Corresponding to the last paragraph of the article, the E error is not selected. The article did not mention these volcanoes. F error. The last paragraph of the article mentioned that the ocean basin is a relatively short-lived existence. It does not exist for more than 80 million years.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
