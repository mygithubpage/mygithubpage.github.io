Some plates carry islands or continents, others form the seafloor. All are slowly moving because the plates <span class="highlight">float</span> on a denser sem-iliquid <span class="highlight">mantle</span>, the <span class="highlight">layer</span> between the <span class="highlight">crust</span> and Earth's <span class="highlight">core</span>. The plates have edges that are spreading ridges (where two plates are moving apart and new seafloor is being created), subduction zones (where two plates <span class="highlight">collide</span> and one plunges <span class="highlight">beneath</span> the other), or <span class="highlight">transform</span> faults (where two plates neither <span class="highlight"><span class="question2">converge</span></span>nor <span class="highlight">diverge</span> but merely move past one another). It is at the boundaries between plates that most of Earth's volcanism and earthquake <span class="highlight">activity</span><span class="highlight">occur</span>.</p><p>Generally speaking, the interiors of plates are geologically uneventful. However, there are exceptions. A <span class="highlight">glance</span> at a map of the <span class="highlight">Pacific</span> Ocean reveals that there are many islands far out at sea that are actually volcanoes----many no longer active, some overgrown with coral----that originated from <span class="highlight">activity</span> at points in the <span class="highlight">interior</span> of the <span class="highlight">Pacific</span><span class="highlight">Plate</span> that forms the <span class="highlight">Pacific</span> seafloor.</p><p>How can <span class="highlight">volcanic</span><span class="highlight">activity</span><span class="highlight">occur</span> so far from a <span class="highlight">plate</span><span class="highlight">boundary</span>? The Hawaiian islands provide a very <span class="question4">instructive </span>answer. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>Like many other island groups, they form a <span class="highlight">chain</span>. 
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>The Hawaiian Islands <span class="highlight">Chain</span> extends northwest from the island of Hawaii. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>In the 1840s American <span class="highlight">geologist</span> James Daly observed that the different Hawaii islands <span class="highlight">seem</span> to share a <span class="highlight">similar</span> geologic
 <span class="highlight">evolution</span> but are progressively more <span class="question5">eroded, </span>and <span class="highlight">therefore</span> probable older, toward the northwest. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>Then in 1963, in the early days of the <span class="highlight">development</span> of the <span class="highlight">theory</span> of <span class="highlight">plate</span><span class="highlight">tectonics</span>. 
 Canadian geophysicist Tuzo Wilson realized that this age progression could result if the islands were formed on a surface <span class="highlight">plate</span> moving over a fixed <span class="highlight">volcanic</span><span class="highlight">source</span> in the <span class="highlight">interior</span>.
 Wilson suggested that the long <span class="highlight">chain</span> of volcanoes stretching northwest from Hawaii is <span class="highlight">simply</span> the surface expression of a long-lived <span class="highlight">volcanic</span><span class="highlight">source</span> located <span class="highlight">beneath</span> the <span class="highlight">tectonic</span><span class="highlight">plate</span> in the <span class="highlight">mantle</span>.
Today's most northwest island would have been the first to form. They as the <span class="highlight">plate</span> moved slowly northwest, new <span class="highlight">volcanic</span> islands would have forms as the <span class="highlight">plate</span> moved over the <span class="highlight">volcanic</span><span class="highlight">source</span>. 
 The most recent island, Hawaii, would be at the end of the <span class="highlight">chain</span> and is now over the <span class="highlight">volcanic</span><span class="highlight">source</span>.</p><p>Although this idea was not immediately accepted, <span class="question7">the dating of lavas in the Hawaii (and other) chains showed that their ages increase away from the presently active <span class="highlight">volcano</span>, </span>just as Daly had suggested. Wilson's <span class="highlight">analysis</span> of these <span class="highlight">data</span> is now a central part of <span class="highlight">plate</span><span class="highlight">tectonics</span>. Most volcanoes that <span class="highlight">occur</span> in the interiors of plates are believed to be produced by <span class="highlight">mantle</span> plumes, columns of <span class="highlight">molten</span> rock that rise from deep <span class="highlight">within</span> the <span class="highlight">mantle</span>. A <span class="highlight">volcano</span> remains an active "hot <span class="highlight">spot</span>" as long as it is over the plume. The plumes apparently <span class="highlight">originate</span> at great depths, perhaps as deep as the <span class="highlight">boundary</span> between the <span class="highlight">core</span> and the <span class="highlight">mantle</span>, and many have been active for a very long time. The oldest volcanoes in the Hawaii hot-spot <span class="highlight">trail</span> have ages close to 80 million years. Other islands, including Tahiti and <span class="highlight">Easter</span> Islands in the <span class="highlight">pacific</span>, <span class="highlight">Reunion</span> and Mauritius in the India Ocean, and indeed most of the large islands in the world's oceans, owe their <span class="highlight">existence</span> to <span class="highlight">mantle</span> plumes.</p><p>The <span class="highlight">oceanic</span><span class="highlight">volcanic</span> islands and their hot-spot trails are thus especially useful for <span class="highlight">geologist</span> because they <span class="highlight">record</span> the past locations of the <span class="highlight">plate</span> over a fixed <span class="highlight">source</span>. They <span class="highlight">therefore</span><span class="highlight">permit</span> the <span class="highlight">reconstruction</span> of the <span class="highlight">process</span> of seafloor spreading, and <span class="highlight">consequently</span> of the geography of continents and of ocean basins in the past. For example, <span class="highlight">given</span> the <span class="highlight"><span class="question11">current</span><span class="highlight"></span>position</span> of the <span class="highlight">Pacific</span><span class="highlight">Plate</span>, Hawaii is above the <span class="highlight">Pacific</span> Ocean hot <span class="highlight">spot</span>. So the <span class="highlight">position</span> of The <span class="highlight">Pacific</span><span class="highlight">Plate</span> 50 million years ago can be <span class="highlight">determined</span> by moving it such that a 50-million-year-oil <span class="highlight">volcano</span> in the hot-spot <span class="highlight">trail</span> sits at the location of Hawaii today. However because the ocean basins really are short-lived features on geologic times <span class="highlight">scale</span>, <span class="highlight">reconstruction</span> the world's geography by backtracking <span class="highlight">along</span> the hot-spot <span class="highlight">trail</span> works only for the last 5 percent or so of geologic time.</p></article></div><div id="question"><div id="question1"><p>The author mentions "spreading ridges", "subduction zones", and "transform faults"in order to</p><label class="my-label"><span>A. illustrate that the boundaries of tectonic plates are neat, thin lines</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><label class="my-label"><span>B. explain why some tectonic plates carry islands or continents while others form the seafloor</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><label class="my-label"><span>C. explain the complex nature of the edges of tectonic plates</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><label class="my-label"><span>D. provide examples of areas of tectonic plates where little geologic action occurs</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><p><span>Answer: </span><span class="my-answer">C</span></p></div><div id="question2"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">converge</span>"in the passage is closest in meaning to</p><label class="my-label"><span>A. expand</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><label class="my-label"><span>B. form</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><label class="my-label"><span>C. rise</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><label class="my-label"><span>D. move closer</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><p><span>Answer: </span><span class="my-answer">D</span></p></div><div id="question3"><p>which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage paragraph 2?
