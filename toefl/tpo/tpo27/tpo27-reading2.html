          <h4 class="w3-center">The Formation of Volcanic Islands</h4>
          <p>Earth's surface is not made up of a single sheet of rock that forms a <span class="highlight">crust</span> but rather a number of "<span class="highlight">tectonic</span> plates" that fit closely, like the pieces of a gain <span class="highlight">jigsaw</span> <span class="highlight">puzzle</span>. Some plates carry islands or continents, others form the seafloor. All are slowly moving because the plates <span class="highlight">float</span> on a denser sem-iliquid <span class="highlight">mantle</span>, the <span class="highlight">layer</span> between the <span class="highlight">crust</span> and Earth's <span class="highlight">core</span>. The plates have edges that are spreading ridges (where two plates are moving apart and new seafloor is being created), subduction zones (where two plates <span class="highlight">collide</span> and one plunges <span class="highlight">beneath</span> the other), or <span class="highlight">transform</span> faults (where two plates neither <span class="highlight"><span class="question2">converge</span></span> nor <span class="highlight">diverge</span> but merely move past one another). It is at the boundaries between plates that most of Earth's volcanism and earthquake <span class="highlight">activity</span> <span class="highlight">occur</span>.</p>
          <p>Generally speaking, the interiors of plates are geologically uneventful. However, there are exceptions. <span class="question3">A <span class="highlight">glance</span> at a map of the <span class="highlight">Pacific</span> Ocean reveals that there are many islands far out at sea that are actually volcanoes----many no longer active, some overgrown with coral----that originated from <span class="highlight">activity</span> at points in the <span class="highlight">interior</span> of the <span class="highlight">Pacific</span> <span class="highlight">Plate</span> that forms the <span class="highlight">Pacific</span> seafloor.</span></p>
          <p>How can <span class="highlight">volcanic</span> <span class="highlight">activity</span> <span class="highlight">occur</span> so far from a <span class="highlight">plate</span> <span class="highlight">boundary</span>? The Hawaiian islands provide a very <span class="question4">instructive</span> answer. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>Like many other island groups, they form a <span class="highlight">chain</span>. 
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>The Hawaiian Islands <span class="highlight">Chain</span> extends northwest from the island of Hawaii. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>In the 1840s American <span class="highlight">geologist</span> James Daly observed that the different Hawaii islands <span class="highlight">seem</span> to share a <span class="highlight">similar</span> geologic
 <span class="highlight">evolution</span> but are progressively more <span class="question5">eroded</span>, and <span class="highlight">therefore</span> probable older, toward the northwest. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>Then in 1963, in the early days of the <span class="highlight">development</span> of the <span class="highlight">theory</span> of <span class="highlight">plate</span> <span class="highlight">tectonics</span>. 
 Canadian geophysicist Tuzo Wilson realized that this age progression could result if the islands were formed on a surface <span class="highlight">plate</span> moving over a fixed <span class="highlight">volcanic</span> <span class="highlight">source</span> in the <span class="highlight">interior</span>.
 Wilson suggested that the long <span class="highlight">chain</span> of volcanoes stretching northwest from Hawaii is <span class="highlight">simply</span> the surface expression of a long-lived <span class="highlight">volcanic</span> <span class="highlight">source</span> located <span class="highlight">beneath</span> the <span class="highlight">tectonic</span> <span class="highlight">plate</span> in the <span class="highlight">mantle</span>.
Today's most northwest island would have been the first to form. They as the <span class="highlight">plate</span> moved slowly northwest, new <span class="highlight">volcanic</span> islands would have forms as the <span class="highlight">plate</span> moved over the <span class="highlight">volcanic</span> <span class="highlight">source</span>. 
 The most recent island, Hawaii, would be at the end of the <span class="highlight">chain</span> and is now over the <span class="highlight">volcanic</span> <span class="highlight">source</span>.</p>
          <p>Although this idea was not immediately accepted, <span class="question7">the dating of lavas in the Hawaii (and other) chains showed that their ages increase away from the presently active <span class="highlight">volcano</span></span>, just as Daly had suggested. Wilson's <span class="highlight">analysis</span> of these <span class="highlight">data</span> is now a central part of <span class="highlight">plate</span> <span class="highlight">tectonics</span>. Most volcanoes that <span class="highlight">occur</span> in the interiors of plates are believed to be produced by <span class="highlight">mantle</span> plumes, columns of <span class="highlight">molten</span> rock that rise from deep <span class="highlight">within</span> the <span class="highlight">mantle</span>. A <span class="highlight">volcano</span> remains an active "hot <span class="highlight">spot</span>" as long as it is over the plume. The plumes apparently <span class="highlight">originate</span> at great depths, perhaps as deep as the <span class="highlight">boundary</span> between the <span class="highlight">core</span> and the <span class="highlight">mantle</span>, and many have been active for a very long time. The oldest volcanoes in the Hawaii hot-spot <span class="highlight">trail</span> have ages close to 80 million years. Other islands, including Tahiti and <span class="highlight">Easter</span> Islands in the <span class="highlight">pacific</span>, <span class="highlight">Reunion</span> and Mauritius in the India Ocean, and indeed most of the large islands in the world's oceans, owe their <span class="highlight">existence</span> to <span class="highlight">mantle</span> plumes.</p>
          <p>The <span class="highlight">oceanic</span> <span class="highlight">volcanic</span> islands and their hot-spot trails are thus especially useful for <span class="highlight">geologist</span> because they <span class="highlight">record</span> the past locations of the <span class="highlight">plate</span> over a fixed <span class="highlight">source</span>. They <span class="highlight">therefore</span> <span class="highlight">permit</span> the <span class="highlight">reconstruction</span> of the <span class="highlight">process</span> of seafloor spreading, and <span class="highlight">consequently</span> of the geography of continents and of ocean basins in the past. For example, <span class="highlight">given</span> the <span class="highlight"><span class="question11">current</span></span> <span class="highlight">position</span> of the <span class="highlight">Pacific</span> <span class="highlight">Plate</span>, Hawaii is above the <span class="highlight">Pacific</span> Ocean hot <span class="highlight">spot</span>. So the <span class="highlight">position</span> of The <span class="highlight">Pacific</span> <span class="highlight">Plate</span> 50 million years ago can be <span class="highlight">determined</span> by moving it such that a 50-million-year-oil <span class="highlight">volcano</span> in the hot-spot <span class="highlight">trail</span> sits at the location of Hawaii today. However because the ocean basins really are short-lived features on geologic times <span class="highlight">scale</span>, <span class="highlight">reconstruction</span> the world's geography by backtracking <span class="highlight">along</span> the hot-spot <span class="highlight">trail</span> works only for the last 5 percent or so of geologic time.</p>

              <p>D sentence modified: just as Daly had suggested. The fact that this fact is given by this sentence modification is to prove that Daly's theory mentioned in the previous paragraph is correct. It can also be seen from the twists and turns in the first half of the sentence that no one accepted his theory before. After the turning point, of course, it is a proof that his theory is based. And D options echo.</p>

              <p>The This pattern at the beginning of the sentence indicates that the pattern must have been discussed in the previous article, and that the central unexplained also implies what might be said below, and later someone explained the pattern. The three positions of ABC are obviously wrong. There is no discussion about pattern-related content in front of these points, and the three sentences constitute a complete example and cannot be divided. The position of D mentioned the construction theory of the continental section in front of it, but did not give an explanation. The sentence behind D gave the explanation given by another scientist many years later. So the D option is very suitable.</p>

This long ago discovered it, when daly proposed it was closely fitting. C is correct. Corresponding to the last paragraph of the article, the E error is not selected. The article did not mention these volcanoes. F error. The last paragraph of the article mentioned that the ocean basin is a relatively short-lived existence.
