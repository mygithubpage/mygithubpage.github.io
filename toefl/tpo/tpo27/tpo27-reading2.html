            <b>The Formation of Volcanic Islands</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>Earth's surface is not made up of a single sheet of rock that forms a <span class="underline">crust</span> but rather a number of "<span class="underline">tectonic</span> plates" that fit closely, like the pieces of a gain <span class="underline">jigsaw</span> <span class="underline">puzzle</span>. Some plates carry islands or continents, others form the seafloor. All are slowly moving because the plates <span class="underline">float</span> on a denser sem-iliquid <span class="underline">mantle</span>, the <span class="underline">layer</span> between the <span class="underline">crust</span> and Earth's <span class="underline">core</span>. The plates have edges that are spreading ridges (where two plates are moving apart and new seafloor is being created), subduction zones (where two plates <span class="underline">collide</span> and one plunges <span class="underline">beneath</span> the other), or <span class="underline">transform</span> faults (where two plates neither <span class="underline">converge</span> nor <span class="underline">diverge</span> but merely move past one another). It is at the boundaries between plates that most of Earth's volcanism and earthquake <span class="underline">activity</span> <span class="underline">occur</span>.</p>
          <p>Generally speaking, the interiors of plates are geologically uneventful. However, there are exceptions. A <span class="underline">glance</span> at a map of the <span class="underline">Pacific</span> Ocean reveals that there are many islands far out at sea that are actually volcanoes----many no longer active, some overgrown with coral----that originated from <span class="underline">activity</span> at points in the <span class="underline">interior</span> of the <span class="underline">Pacific</span> <span class="underline">Plate</span> that forms the <span class="underline">Pacific</span> seafloor.</p>
          <p>How can <span class="underline">volcanic</span> <span class="underline">activity</span> <span class="underline">occur</span> so far from a <span class="underline">plate</span> <span class="underline">boundary</span>? The Hawaiian islands provide a very instructive answer. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>Like many other island groups, they form a <span class="underline">chain</span>. 
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>The Hawaiian Islands <span class="underline">Chain</span> extends northwest from the island of Hawaii. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>In the 1840s American <span class="underline">geologist</span> James Daly observed that the different Hawaii islands <span class="underline">seem</span> to share a <span class="underline">similar</span> geologic
 <span class="underline">evolution</span> but are progressively more eroded, and <span class="underline">therefore</span> probable older, toward the northwest. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>Then in 1963, in the early days of the <span class="underline">development</span> of the <span class="underline">theory</span> of <span class="underline">plate</span> <span class="underline">tectonics</span>. 
 Canadian geophysicist Tuzo Wilson realized that this age progression could result if the islands were formed on a surface <span class="underline">plate</span> moving over a fixed <span class="underline">volcanic</span> <span class="underline">source</span> in the <span class="underline">interior</span>.
 Wilson suggested that the long <span class="underline">chain</span> of volcanoes stretching northwest from Hawaii is <span class="underline">simply</span> the surface expression of a long-lived <span class="underline">volcanic</span> <span class="underline">source</span> located <span class="underline">beneath</span> the <span class="underline">tectonic</span> <span class="underline">plate</span> in the <span class="underline">mantle</span>.
Today's most northwest island would have been the first to form. They as the <span class="underline">plate</span> moved slowly northwest, new <span class="underline">volcanic</span> islands would have forms as the <span class="underline">plate</span> moved over the <span class="underline">volcanic</span> <span class="underline">source</span>. 
 The most recent island, Hawaii, would be at the end of the <span class="underline">chain</span> and is now over the <span class="underline">volcanic</span> <span class="underline">source</span>.</p>
          <p>Although this idea was not immediately accepted, the dating of lavas in the Hawaii (and other) chains showed that their ages increase away from the presently active <span class="underline">volcano</span>, just as Daly had suggested. Wilson's <span class="underline">analysis</span> of these <span class="underline">data</span> is now a central part of <span class="underline">plate</span> <span class="underline">tectonics</span>. Most volcanoes that <span class="underline">occur</span> in the interiors of plates are believed to be produced by <span class="underline">mantle</span> plumes, columns of <span class="underline">molten</span> rock that rise from deep <span class="underline">within</span> the <span class="underline">mantle</span>. A <span class="underline">volcano</span> remains an active "hot <span class="underline">spot</span>" as long as it is over the plume. The plumes apparently <span class="underline">originate</span> at great depths, perhaps as deep as the <span class="underline">boundary</span> between the <span class="underline">core</span> and the <span class="underline">mantle</span>, and many have been active for a very long time. The oldest volcanoes in the Hawaii hot-spot <span class="underline">trail</span> have ages close to 80 million years. Other islands, including Tahiti and <span class="underline">Easter</span> Islands in the <span class="underline">pacific</span>, <span class="underline">Reunion</span> and Mauritius in the India Ocean, and indeed most of the large islands in the world's oceans, owe their <span class="underline">existence</span> to <span class="underline">mantle</span> plumes.</p>
          <p>The <span class="underline">oceanic</span> <span class="underline">volcanic</span> islands and their hot-spot trails are thus especially useful for <span class="underline">geologist</span> because they <span class="underline">record</span> the past locations of the <span class="underline">plate</span> over a fixed <span class="underline">source</span>. They <span class="underline">therefore</span> <span class="underline">permit</span> the <span class="underline">reconstruction</span> of the <span class="underline">process</span> of seafloor spreading, and <span class="underline">consequently</span> of the geography of continents and of ocean basins in the past. For example, <span class="underline">given</span> the <span class="underline">current</span> <span class="underline">position</span> of the <span class="underline">Pacific</span> <span class="underline">Plate</span>, Hawaii is above the <span class="underline">Pacific</span> Ocean hot <span class="underline">spot</span>. So the <span class="underline">position</span> of The <span class="underline">Pacific</span> <span class="underline">Plate</span> 50 million years ago can be <span class="underline">determined</span> by moving it such that a 50-million-year-oil <span class="underline">volcano</span> in the hot-spot <span class="underline">trail</span> sits at the location of Hawaii today. However because the ocean basins really are short-lived features on geologic times <span class="underline">scale</span>, <span class="underline">reconstruction</span> the world's geography by backtracking <span class="underline">along</span> the hot-spot <span class="underline">trail</span> works only for the last 5 percent or so of geologic time.</p>
