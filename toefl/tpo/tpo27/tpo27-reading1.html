In the <span class="highlight">second</span> half of the <span class="highlight">millennium</span>, in the south around the city of Uruk, there was an <span class="highlight">enormous</span> escalation in the area occupied by <span class="highlight">permanent</span> settlements. A large part of that increase took place in Uruk itself, which became a real <span class="highlight">urban</span> center surrounded by a set of secondary settlements. <span class="question1">While <span class="highlight">population</span> estimates are notoriously unreliable, scholars <span class="highlight">assume</span> that Uruk inhabitants were able to support themselves from the agricultural production of the <span class="highlight">field</span> surrounding the city, which could be reached with a daily <span class="highlight">commute</span>.</span> But Uruk's <span class="highlight">dominant</span> size in the entire <span class="highlight">region</span>, far <span class="question2">surpassing </span>that of other settlements, indicates that it was a regional center and a true city. Indeed, it was the first city in human <span class="highlight">history</span>.</p><p>The <span class="highlight">vast</span><span class="highlight">majority</span> of its <span class="highlight">population</span> remained active in <span class="highlight">agriculture</span>, <span class="highlight">even</span> those people living <span class="highlight">within</span> the city itself. But a small <span class="highlight">segment</span> of the <span class="highlight">urban</span> society started to <span class="highlight">specialize</span> in nonagricultural tasks as a result of the city's role as a regional center. <span class="highlight">Within</span> the <span class="highlight">productive</span> sector, there was a growth of a <span class="highlight">variety</span> of specialist craftspeople. Early in the Uruk period, the use of undecorated <span class="highlight">utilitarian</span><span class="highlight">pottery</span> was probably the result of <span class="highlight">specialized</span><span class="highlight">mass</span> production. In an early fourth-millennium <span class="highlight">level</span> of the Eanna <span class="highlight">archaeological</span> site at Uruk, a <span class="highlight">pottery</span> style appears that is most <span class="highlight">characteristic</span> of this <span class="highlight">process</span>, the so-called beveled-rim bowl. It is a rather <span class="highlight">shallow</span> bowl that was crudely made in a <span class="highlight">mold</span>; hence, in only a limited number of <span class="highlight">standard</span> sizes. For some unknown <span class="highlight">reason</span>, many were discarded, often still <span class="highlight"><span class="question4">intact</span>, </span>and thousands have been found all over the Near East. The beveled-rim bowl is one of the most telling <span class="highlight">diagnostic</span> finds for identifying an Uruk-period site. Of importance is the fact that it was produced rapidly in large amounts, most likely by specialists in a central location.</p><p>A <span class="highlight">variety</span> of <span class="highlight">documentation</span> indicates that certain goods, once made by a family member as one of many duties, were later made by skilled artisans. Certain images <span class="highlight">depict</span> groups of people, most likely women, involved in weaving textiles, an <span class="highlight">activity</span> we know from later third-millennium texts to have been <span class="highlight">vital</span> in the <span class="highlight">economy</span> and to have been centrally administered. Also, a <span class="highlight">specialized</span> metal-producing workshop may have been excavated in a small area at Uruk. It contained a number of channels lined by a <span class="highlight">sequence</span> of holes, about 50 centimeters deep, all showing burn marks and filled with ashes. This has been <span class="question8">interpreted </span>as the remains of a workshop where <span class="highlight">molten</span> metal was scooped up from the <span class="highlight">channel</span> and poured into molds in the holes. Some type of <span class="highlight">mass</span> production by specialists were involved here.</p><p>Objects themselves suggest that they were the work of skilled professionals. In the late Uruk period(3500-3100 B.C.E.), there first appeared a type of object that remained <span class="highlight">characteristic</span> 
for <span class="highlight">Mesopotamia</span><span class="highlight">throughout</span> its entire history: the <span class="highlight">cylinder</span><span class="highlight">seal</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>This was a small <span class="highlight">cylinder</span>, usually no more than 3 centimeters high and 2 centimeters in <span class="highlight">diameter</span>, of <span class="highlight">shell</span>, bone, faience 
(a glassy type of stoneware), or various types of stones, on which a <span class="highlight">scene</span> was carved into the surface. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>When rolled over a <span class="highlight">soft</span> material----primarily the <span class="highlight">clay</span> of bullae (round seals), tablets, 
or <span class="highlight">clay</span> lumps attached to boxes, jars, or door bolts----the <span class="highlight">scene</span> would <span class="highlight">appear</span> in <span class="highlight">relief</span>, easily <span class="highlight"><span class="question10">legible</span>. </span><span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>The <span class="highlight">technological</span> knowledge needed to carved it was far <span class="highlight">superior</span> to that for <span class="highlight">stamp</span> seals, 
which had happened in the early <span class="highlight">Neolithic</span> period (<span class="highlight">approximately</span> 10,000-5000 B.C.E.). <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>From the first <span class="highlight">appearance</span> of <span class="highlight">cylinder</span> seals, the carved scenes could be highly <span class="highlight">elaborate</span> and <span class="highlight">refined</span>, indicating 
the work of specialist stone-cutters. Similarly, the late Uruk period shows the first <span class="highlight">monumental</span> art, <span class="highlight">relief</span>, and statuary in the round, made with a <span class="highlight">degree</span> of mastery that only a <span class="highlight">professional</span> could 
have produced.</p></article></div><div id="question"><div id="question1"><p>which of the sentences below best express the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage?
