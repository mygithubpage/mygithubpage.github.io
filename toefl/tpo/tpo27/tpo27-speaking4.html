          <h4 class="w3-center">Swarm Intelligence</h4>
          <p>Some insect species live in large groups, or "swarms." Such swarms typically include several thousand individual insects. Living in swarms allows these insects to accomplish complex tasks together through complex behaviors. The behavior of the insects as a group demonstrates a greater level of complexity than the behavior of individual group members. This complex group behavior is called swarm intelligence. With swarm intelligence, each insect performs a simple instinctual behavior that is repeated by other individuals that results in a complex behavior. Insects swarms are able to accomplish tasks that individual insects would not be able to achieve.</p>

          <p>Now listen to part of a lecture on this topic in a business management class. </p>
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>(male professor) </p>
          <p>So, let me tell you about my own experiences when I was working for a computer company a couple of years ago. </p>
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>So, one day a co-worker and I suggested we should give our computers a design make-over: make them look more up-to-date. Market research was showing that new customers said they would be more interested in buying our computers if they looked cooler. Our technology was advanced but the outside design looked really old-fashioned. </p>
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>At first, more than half the group supported us. There were a few senior managers there who didn't support the design change. One of the senior manager said, "Our focus has always been on technology, changing the look is an unnecessary cost." Almost immediately, some of our supporters changed their minds! Even my co-worker changed his mind! When I asked him why after the meeting, he told me he didn't want to make a bad impression on the senior managers. He thought that disagreeing with them might jeopardize his chances of getting a promotion by not looking like a team-player. </p>
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>What about me? I hate to admit it, but, after a few hours of discussion, I started wondering if it was worth everyone's time to argue about this? As more people sided with the senior management, I started to feel that I was the only one holding up the vote. Everyone else seemed to think change wasn't necessary. I voted against my own idea in the end. </p>
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>So we unanimously decided to stay with the current old-looking design. But this decision ended up costing us a lot of money. That same year, our competitor came out with a new design that attracted some of our customers and prevented us from profiting from new customers. </p>
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>
          </p>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>The complex group behavior that insects living in a large group display to achieve a complex task together is called swarm intelligence. For example, a group of ants are walking on a branch of a tree when they discover food on another branch. But it seems impossible for any ant to reach the food since there's a huge space between the branch with the food and where they are. So they use their swarm intelligence to solve the problem. One ant walks till the end of the branch, attaching itself to it and stretches its body to allow another ant holds on to it, so one after another, the following ants repeat the same action by connecting each other to form a bridge so that the rest of the ants can cross the bridge and reach the food.
