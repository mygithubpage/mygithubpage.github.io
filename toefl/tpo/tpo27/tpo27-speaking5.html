        <article>
          <p>Listen to a conversation between two English professors.</p>
          <p>(man) Hi, Nancy, is something the matter?</p>
          <p>(woman) Oh, I just realized that I've got a scheduling conflict tomorrow.</p>
          <p>(man) What is it?</p>
          <p>(woman) Well, the poetry class I'm teaching meets at 4 o'clock. My students have a test next week so tomorrow's class is the review session. It's important.</p>
          <p>(man) OK?</p>
          <p>(woman) The other thing is my cousin's retirement party. But I just realized it also starts at 4 o'clock. I haven't realized it was starting at the exact same time as my class.</p>
          <p>(man) Oh, no! Well, I'm free tomorrow at 4, if you want, I could cover your class for you. Lead the review session.</p>
          <p>(woman) Really? What a generous offer!</p>
          <p>(man) I wouldn't mind. I mean, I haven't taught poetry for a few years. I am a little rusty.</p>
          <p>(woman) Well, I have some materials prepared and you could certainly use them. So it might be tough but you could do it.</p>
          <p>(man) I'll try anyway.</p>
          <p>(woman) Well, my other option is to go to the class. Do the review session myself and arrive late at the retirement party.</p>
          <p>(man) So you could prepare your students for the test yourself.</p>
          <p>(woman) I could and I know it'd be good for my students. It's just that I'd miss a lot of the party. My cousin and some others are giving speeches and I think it'll be really interesting. It'll be a shame to miss it."</p>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>Well, the woman's had a problem with her schedule. Actually, her poetry class conflicts with her cousin's retirement party. There are two solutions for the woman's problem: she could let the man cover her class and lead the review session, or she could arrive late for the party after finishing her poetry class. Well, I guess the second solution is a better one for some reasons. First, it'll be irresponsible for the woman to leave her students behind and go to a party. Reviewing classes are so important that the students usually need a summarization from their teacher to organize everything for the whole course and to get prepared for their finals. Second, a new teacher who may probably teach in a different style and cover different knowledge points wouldn't be a wise choice for a replacement as a leader of the review session. So the woman, I guess, should follow the second solution of the problem. (157 words)</p>
