          <p>Now listen to a conversation between two students. </p>
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>(man) Hey, Mary, how's your volunteer work going? You're still involved in that after-school program with the elementary kids? </p>
          <p>(woman) Yeah, but I've got a problem. I am supposed to be driving a bunch of them to the zoo tomorrow. (man) Yeah? </p>
          <p>(woman) And I was supposed to rent a van for the trip. But I waited too long to call the rental agency to reserve one. </p>
          <p>(man) Oh! </p>
          <p>(woman) Now it turns out they don't have any vans available for tomorrow. I don't know what to do? These kids will be really disappointed if their trip gets cancelled. (man) Hmmm, well, doesn't one of your friends on campus have a car? I mean, couldn't you borrow it for the day? </p>
          <p>(woman) Yeah, probably, but I'd need to borrow two cars or there wouldn't be enough space for all the kids. </p>
          <p>(man) Um, hum. </p>
          <p>(woman) That's why I was going to rent the van. And then I'd need to find somebody else to drive, too. I can't drive two cars by myself. </p>
          <p>(man) Yeah, that's true. Well, I am sure you can probably find a volunteer or if you wanted to save yourself the trouble of hunting down a second driver, what about public transportation? Check the bus schedule, I think there's a bus line that goes right past the zoo. </p>
          <p>(woman) Yeah, that's a possibility, but I don't know, it might be a real challenge supervising the kids on the bus. (man) Ha, ha... </p>
          <p>(woman) Sometimes they are a handful when they get excited. It's an option, though. </p>
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>Well, the woman's had a problem with her schedule. Actually, her poetry class conflicts with her cousin's retirement party. There are two solutions for the woman's problem: she could let the man cover her class and lead the review session, or she could arrive late for the party after finishing her poetry class. Well, I guess the second solution is a better one for some reasons. First, it'll be irresponsible for the woman to leave her students behind and go to a party. Reviewing classes are so important that the students usually need a summarization from their teacher to organize everything for the whole course and to get prepared for their finals. Second, a new teacher who may probably teach in a different style and cover different knowledge points wouldn't be a wise choice for a replacement as a leader of the review session. So the woman, I guess, should follow the second solution of the problem. (157 words)</p>
