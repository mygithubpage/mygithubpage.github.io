        <article>
          <p>Narrator: Listen to part of a conversation at the information desk in the library.</p>
          <p>:Librarian: Hi. Can I help you?</p>
          <p>:Student: Where do I go, besides the computers, to look for books on New Zealand?</p>
          <p>:Librarian: OK. You mean you don't want to use the computer?</p>
          <p>:Student: Well, I haven't had any luck on the computers here.</p>
          <p>:Librarian: OK. I mean the reason I am asking is you pretty much have to go to the computer to find out where a book is. But I can help you find it on the computer if you like.</p>
          <p>:Student: That would be great. I just spent half an hour and I couldn't find anything.</p>
          <p>:Librarian: I know how you feel. When I first started working here, I couldn't find anything either. So you are looking for information on New Zealand, is that right?</p>
          <p>:Student: Yes.</p>
          <p>:Librarian: Is it like travel information that you are looking for?</p>
          <p>:Student: Uh... No. Actually what I am looking for is information on a volcano in New Zealand.</p>
          <p>:Librarian: Oh. OK. Because I know a travel agency that specializes in tours in New Zealand and Australia.</p>
          <p>:Student: Oh. I'd love to go. I heard it's beautiful.</p>
          <p>:Librarian: Yeah.</p>
          <p>:Student: Maybe someday.</p>
          <p>:Librarian: Yup. OK. Let's see ... OK. If you want to search the library holdings and don't know the author's name or the exact title of the book or an article, you have to set up a keyword search.It is a special function. Then you can just type in some keywords and let the computer do the search.</p>
          <p>:Student: I see.</p>
          <p>:Librarian: OK. Oh, how about if we search for volcanoes and New Zealand.</p>
          <p>:Student: Sounds good.</p>
          <p>:Librarian: It's for a geology class?</p>
          <p>:Student: Mhmm.</p>
          <p>:Librarian: Ha! You must be from Professor Simpson's class.</p>
          <p>:Student: No.</p>
          <p>:Librarian: Oh. Well, he is a volcano expert, so I thought he might be teaching your class.</p>
          <p>:Student: No, I've heard he is really good though.</p>
          <p>:Librarian: Yeah. That's what everyone says. Do you know the name of the volcano?</p>
          <p>:Student: Mount Ruapehu.</p>
          <p>:Librarian: Can you spell that?</p>
          <p>:Student: Sure. It is R-U-A-P-E-H-U.</p>
          <p>:Librarian: OK. Mount Ruapehu. Let's see. So are you a geology major?</p>
          <p>:Student: Hem. Hardly.</p>
          <p>:Librarian: Let me guess, you have to take a science course and you don't want to have to deal with biology, chemistry or physics.</p>
          <p>:Student: Exactly. But it's actually turned out to be a pretty interesting class.</p>
          <p>:Librarian: Well, that's good. Um... does it have to be a book? Or could you use a journal article?</p>
          <p>:Student: Mhmm... no, either one would be fine.</p>
          <p>:Librarian: OK. Well, here's a journal article. Let me check to see if we have it.OK. We have the article, but it is from 2001. Is that OK, do you think?</p>
          <p>:Student: Well, I'd like to have a look at it. The focus is really on eruptions in the last five years, but it might have some useful background material.</p>
          <p>:Librarian: OK. Well, let's see what else we can find.</p>
          <p>:Student: Sounds good. </p>
