I mean the <span class="underline">reason</span> I am asking is you <span class="underline">pretty</span> much have to go to the computer to find out where a book is. <span class="time" data-times="2.99" data-time="24.29">[00:24.29]</span>But I can help you find it on the computer if you like. </p>

              <span class="time" data-times="6.02" data-time="47.37">[00:47.37]</span>Librarian: Oh. OK. Because I know a travel <span class="underline">agency</span> that specializes in tours in New Zealand and Australia. </p>

              <span class="time" data-times="8.38" data-time="78.77">[01:18.77]</span>Librarian: OK. Oh, how about if we search for volcanoes and New Zealand. </p>
