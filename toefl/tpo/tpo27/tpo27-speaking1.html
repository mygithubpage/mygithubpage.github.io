There are lots of rap parts in his songs, and this is one of the main reasons why I don't like him-that I'm not a big fan of rap music. For most of the time I don't understand what he is trying to say in his songs. They simply don't make sense to me.   The other thing is that he likes to show off a lot.

There's this one time that I watched a ceremony he hosted, he almost talked the whole time, which was even kind of embarrassing for his partner "</p></article></div></main></body></html>
