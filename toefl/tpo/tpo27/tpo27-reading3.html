            <b>Predator-Prey Cycles</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>How do predators <span class="underline">affect</span> populations of the <span class="underline">prey</span> animals? The answer is not as simple as might be thought. Moose reached Isle Royale in Lake <span class="underline">Superior</span> by <span class="underline">crossing</span> over winter ice and multiplied freely there in isolation without predators. When wolves later reached the island, naturalists widely assumed that the wolves would play a key role in controlling the moose <span class="underline">population</span>. Careful studies have demonstrated, however, that this is not the case. The wolves eat mostly old or diseased animals that would not <span class="underline">survive</span> long anyway. In general, the moose <span class="underline">population</span> is controlled by food <span class="underline">availability</span>, <span class="underline">disease</span> and other factors rather than by wolves.</p>
          <p>When <span class="underline">experimental</span> populations are set up under simple <span class="underline">laboratory</span> conditions, the <span class="underline">predator</span> often exterminates its pre and then becomes <span class="underline">extinct</span> itself, having nothing left to eat. However, if safe areas like those <span class="underline">prey</span> animals have in the wild are provided, the <span class="underline">prey</span> <span class="underline">population</span> drops to low <span class="underline">level</span> but not <span class="underline">extinction</span>. Low <span class="underline">prey</span> <span class="underline">population</span> levels then provide inadequate food for the predators, causing the <span class="underline">predator</span> <span class="underline">population</span> to <span class="underline">decrease</span>. When this occurs, the <span class="underline">prey</span> <span class="underline">population</span> can rebound. In this situation the <span class="underline">predator</span> and <span class="underline">prey</span> <span class="underline">population</span> may continue in this cyclical <span class="underline">pattern</span> for some time.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="underline">Population</span> cycles are <span class="underline">characteristic</span> of small mammals, and they sometimes <span class="underline">appear</span> to be brought about by predators. Ecologists studying hare populations have found that the North American snow shoe hare follows a <span class="underline">roughly</span> ten-year <span class="underline">cycle</span>. Its numbers fall tenfold to thirty in a <span class="underline">typical</span> <span class="underline">cycle</span>, and a hundredfold change can <span class="underline">occur</span>. Two factors <span class="underline">appear</span> to be generating the cycle: food plants and predators.</p>
          <p>The preferred foods of snowshoe hares are <span class="underline">willow</span> and <span class="underline">birch</span> twigs. As hare <span class="underline">density</span> increases, the <span class="underline">quantity</span> of these twigs decreases, forcing the hares to feed on low-quality high-fiber food. <span class="underline">Lower</span> birth rates, low <span class="underline">juvenile</span> survivorship, and low growth rates follow, so there is a corresponding <span class="underline">decline</span> in hare <span class="underline">abundance</span>. Once the hare <span class="underline">population</span> has declined, it takes two to three year for the <span class="underline">quantity</span> of twigs to <span class="underline">recover</span>.</p>
          <p>A key <span class="underline">predator</span> of the snowshoe hare is the Canada lynx. The Canada lynx shows a ten-year <span class="underline">cycle</span> of <span class="underline">abundance</span> that parallels the <span class="underline">abundance</span> <span class="underline">cycle</span> of hares. As hare numbers fall, so do lynx numbers, as their food <span class="underline">supply</span> <span class="underline">depleted</span>.</p>
          <p>What causes the predator-prey oscillations? Do increasing number of hares <span class="underline">lead</span> to overharvesting of plants, which in turn results in reduced hare populations, or do increasing numbers of lynx <span class="underline">lead</span> to overharvesting hares? <span class="underline">Field</span> experiments carried out by Charles Krebs and coworkers in 1992 provide an answer. Krebs investigated <span class="underline">experimental</span> plots in Canada's Yukon <span class="underline">territory</span> that contained hare populations. When food was added to those plots (no food effect) and predators were excluded (no <span class="underline">predator</span> effect) from an <span class="underline">experimental</span> area, hare numbers increased tenfold and stayed there-the <span class="underline">cycle</span> was lost. However, the <span class="underline">cycle</span> was retained if either of the factors was allowed to <span class="underline">operate</span> alone: if predators were excluded but food was not added (food effect alone), or if food was added in the presence of predators (<span class="underline">predator</span> effect alone). Thus both factors can <span class="underline">affect</span> the <span class="underline">cycle</span>, which, in practice, seems to be generated by <span class="underline">conjunction</span> of the two factors.</p>
          <p>Predators are an <span class="underline">essential</span> <span class="underline">factor</span> in maintaining communities that are rich and <span class="underline">diverse</span> in <span class="underline">species</span>. Without predators, the <span class="underline">species</span> that is the best competitor for food, <span class="underline">shelter</span>, 
nesting sites, and other <span class="underline">environmental</span> resources tends to <span class="underline">dominate</span> and <span class="underline">exclude</span> the <span class="underline">species</span> with which it competes. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>This <span class="underline">phenomenon</span> is known as "competitor exclusion". 
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>However, if the <span class="underline">community</span> contains a <span class="underline">predator</span> of the strongest competitor <span class="underline">species</span>, then the <span class="underline">population</span> of that competitor is controlled. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>Thus <span class="underline">even</span> the less <span class="underline">competitive</span> <span class="underline">species</span> are able to <span class="underline">survive</span>.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>For example, sea stars <span class="underline">prey</span> on a <span class="underline">variety</span> of bivalve mollusks and prevent these bivalves from monopolizing habitats on the sea floor. This opens up <span class="underline">space</span> for many other organisms. When sea stars are 
removed, <span class="underline">species</span> <span class="underline">diversity</span> falls <span class="underline">sharply</span>. <span class="underline">Therefore</span>, from the stand point of <span class="underline">diversity</span>, it is usually a mistake to <span class="underline">eliminate</span> a <span class="underline">major</span> <span class="underline">predator</span> from a <span class="underline">community</span>.</p>
