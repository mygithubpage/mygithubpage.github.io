The answer is not as simple as might be thought. Moose reached Isle Royale in Lake <span class="highlight">Superior</span> by <span class="highlight">crossing</span> over winter ice and multiplied freely there in isolation without predators. When wolves later reached the island, naturalists widely assumed that the wolves would play a key role in controlling the moose <span class="highlight">population</span>. Careful studies have demonstrated, however, that this is not the case. The wolves eat mostly old or diseased animals that would not <span class="highlight">survive</span> long anyway. In general, the moose <span class="highlight">population</span> is controlled by food <span class="highlight">availability</span>, <span class="highlight">disease</span> and other factors rather than by wolves.</p><p>When <span class="highlight">experimental</span> populations are set up under simple <span class="highlight">laboratory</span> conditions, the <span class="highlight">predator</span> often exterminates its pre and then becomes <span class="highlight">extinct</span> itself, having nothing left to eat. However, if safe areas like those <span class="highlight">prey</span> animals have in the wild are provided, the <span class="highlight">prey</span><span class="highlight">population</span> drops to low <span class="highlight">level</span> but not <span class="highlight">extinction</span>. Low <span class="highlight">prey</span><span class="highlight">population</span> levels then provide inadequate food for the predators, causing the <span class="highlight">predator</span><span class="highlight">population</span> to <span class="highlight">decrease</span>. When this occurs, the <span class="highlight">prey</span><span class="highlight">population</span> can <span class="question2">rebound</span>. In this situation the <span class="highlight">predator</span> and <span class="highlight">prey</span><span class="highlight">population</span> may continue in this cyclical <span class="highlight">pattern</span> for some time.</p><p><span class="highlight">Population</span> cycles are <span class="highlight">characteristic</span> of small mammals, and they sometimes <span class="highlight">appear</span> to be brought about by predators. Ecologists studying hare populations have found that the North American snow shoe hare follows a <span class="highlight"><span class="question5">roughly</span></span> ten-year <span class="highlight">cycle</span>. Its numbers fall tenfold to thirty in a <span class="highlight">typical</span><span class="highlight">cycle</span>, and a hundredfold change can <span class="highlight">occur</span>. Two factors <span class="highlight">appear</span> to be <span class="question6">generating</span> the cycle: food plants and predators.</p><p>The preferred foods of snowshoe hares are <span class="highlight">willow</span> and <span class="highlight">birch</span> twigs. As hare <span class="highlight">density</span> increases, the <span class="highlight">quantity</span> of these twigs decreases, forcing the hares to feed on low-quality high-fiber food. <span class="highlight">Lower</span> birth rates, low <span class="highlight">juvenile</span> survivorship, and low growth rates follow, so there is a corresponding <span class="highlight">decline</span> in hare <span class="highlight">abundance</span>. Once the hare <span class="highlight">population</span> has declined, it takes two to three year for the <span class="highlight">quantity</span> of twigs to <span class="highlight">recover</span>.</p><p>A key <span class="highlight">predator</span> of the snowshoe hare is the Canada lynx. The Canada lynx shows a ten-year <span class="highlight">cycle</span> of <span class="highlight">abundance</span> that parallels the <span class="highlight">abundance</span><span class="highlight">cycle</span> of hares. As hare numbers fall, so do lynx numbers, as their food <span class="highlight">supply</span><span class="highlight">depleted</span>.</p><p>What causes the predator-prey oscillations? Do increasing number of hares <span class="highlight">lead</span> to overharvesting of plants, which in turn results in reduced hare populations, or do increasing numbers of lynx <span class="highlight">lead</span> to overharvesting hares? <span class="highlight">Field</span> experiments carried out by Charles Krebs and coworkers in 1992 provide an answer. Krebs investigated <span class="highlight">experimental</span> plots in Canada's Yukon <span class="highlight">territory</span> that contained hare populations. When food was added to those plots (no food effect) and predators were excluded (no <span class="highlight">predator</span> effect) from an <span class="highlight">experimental</span> area, hare numbers increased tenfold and stayed there-the <span class="highlight">cycle</span> was lost. However, the <span class="highlight">cycle</span> was retained if either of the factors was allowed to <span class="highlight">operate</span> alone: if predators were excluded but food was not added (food effect alone), or if food was added in the presence of predators (<span class="highlight">predator</span> effect alone). Thus both factors can <span class="highlight">affect</span> the <span class="highlight">cycle</span>, which, in practice, seems to be generated by <span class="highlight"><span class="question8">conjunction</span></span> of the two factors.</p><p>Predators are an <span class="highlight">essential</span><span class="highlight">factor</span> in maintaining communities that are rich and <span class="highlight">diverse</span> in <span class="highlight">species</span>. Without predators, the <span class="highlight">species</span> that is the best competitor for food, <span class="highlight">shelter</span>, 
nesting sites, and other <span class="highlight">environmental</span> resources tends to <span class="highlight">dominate</span> and <span class="highlight">exclude</span> the <span class="highlight">species</span> with which it competes. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>This <span class="highlight">phenomenon</span> is known as "competitor exclusion". 
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>However, if the <span class="highlight">community</span> contains a <span class="highlight">predator</span> of the strongest competitor <span class="highlight">species</span>, then the <span class="highlight">population</span> of that competitor is controlled. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>Thus <span class="highlight">even</span> the less <span class="highlight">competitive</span><span class="highlight">species</span> are able to <span class="highlight">survive</span>.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>For example, sea stars <span class="highlight">prey</span> on a <span class="highlight">variety</span> of bivalve mollusks and prevent these bivalves from monopolizing habitats on the sea floor. This opens up <span class="highlight">space</span> for many other organisms. When sea stars are 
removed, <span class="highlight">species</span><span class="highlight">diversity</span> falls <span class="highlight">sharply</span>. <span class="highlight">Therefore</span>, from the stand point of <span class="highlight">diversity</span>, it is usually a mistake to <span class="highlight">eliminate</span> a <span class="highlight">major</span><span class="highlight">predator</span> from a <span class="highlight">community</span>.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>In paragraph 1, why does the author discuss the moose and wolves on Isle Royal?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To provide an example of predators moving to new habitats by following migrating prey</p><p>B. To show that the interactions between predator populations and prey populations are not always might be expected</p><p>C. To suggest that prey populations are more influenced by predation than food availability and disease</p><p>D. To argue that studies of geographically isolated populations tend not to be useful to naturalists</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B corresponds to the fourth sentence of the article, Careful studies...not the case. This sentence said in front of people that the wolf played an important role in controlling the number of deer controls. This sentence negates it and corresponds to the B option. A is not related to the original. C contradicts the last sentence in the first paragraph of the original text. D is not right.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question2">rebound</span></span>"in the passage (paragraph 2) is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. escape</p><p>B. recover</p><p>C. survive</p><p>D. resist</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>B rendezvous: <span class="question2">rebound</span>, pick up. A is to escape, B is to recover, C is to survive, and D is to resist. According to word meaning, choose B.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Paragraph 2 implies which of the following about experimental environments in which predators become extinct?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They may yield results that do not accurate predict changes of populations in the wild.</p><p>B. In these environments, the prey species is better adapted than the predator species.</p><p>C. These environments are appropriate only for studying small populations of predators and prey.</p><p>D. They are unrealistic because some predators are also the prey of other predators.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A uses experimental environments to locate the first sentence of the original text. The first sentence states that the experimental environments result in the predator destroying all the prey and eventually extinguish itself. However, it immediately appeared behind. It turns out that there has been a turning point, and later the text dismisses the previous view to a certain extent, saying that it will not be extinct in nature. So choose A. B is not related to the original theme. Although C has no obvious mistakes, it does not show a real theme. The emphasis is on the situation in real life. D did not mention the original text.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the following can be inferred from paragraphs 2 and 3 about the small mammals that experience population cycles?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Their population cycles are not affected by predators.</p><p>B. Their predators'populations periodically disappear.</p><p>C. They typically undergo ten-year cycles.</p><p>D. They have access to places safe from predators.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D Inferring from the contents of two paragraphs is a bit difficult, and there are no particularly good positioning words. You can use options to match the original text. Need a lot of reading. The A option corresponds to the last sentence of the third paragraph: Two factors appear to be <span class="question6">generating</span> the cycle: food plants and predators. One of the two factors that speaks of a population cycle is: Predator. So, A is wrong. B corresponds to the second sentence of the second paragraph: However, if safe areas like those prey animals have in the wild are provided, the prey population drops to low levels but not to extinction. Will not disappear, so the B option is wrong. C corresponds to the second sentence of the third paragraph: Ecologists studying hare populations have found that the North American snow shoe hare follows a detailed ten-year cycle. This sentence appears a ten-year cycle, but it is only a description of a hare, not Suitable for all mammals. D corresponds to the second sentence of the second paragraph: However, if safe areas like those prey animals have in the wild are provided, the prey population drops to low levels but not to extinction. Predator place. So choose D.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question5">roughly</span></span>"in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. usually</p><p>B. repeating</p><p>C. approximately</p><p>D. observable</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" C"><p>C <span class="question5">roughly</span>: <span class="question5">roughly</span>. A is normal, B is repeated, C is approximate, and D is observable. Choose C according to the word meaning.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question6">generating</span></span>"in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. producing</p><p>B. changing</p><p>C. speeding up</p><p>D. smoothing out</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" A"><p>A generate: make, happen, and produce. A is produced, B is changed, C is accelerated, and D is fade-out. According to the meaning of choice A.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, all of the following are true of the food of snowshoe hares EXCEPT</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The preferred food fore hares consists of willow and birch twigs.</p><p>B. High fiber food is the most nutritious for hares.</p><p>C. Depletion of the supply of willow and birch twigs cause low birth and growth rates.</p><p>D. The food supply takes two or three years to recover after a peak in hare population density.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B Exclude questions, option A corresponds to the first sentence, correct. Option B corresponds to the second sentence. The original saying high-fiber means low quality, so B is wrong. C corresponds to the third sentence, correct, not selected. D corresponds to the last sentence, correct, not selected.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question8">conjunction</span></span>"in the passage (paragraph 6) is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. determination</p><p>B. combination</p><p>C. alternation</p><p>D. transformation</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>B <span class="question8">conjunction</span>: The combination occurs at the same time. A is the decision, B is binding, C is alternate, and D is transformation. In terms of wording, B is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 5, which of the following statements best characterizes the abundance cycle of the Canada lynx?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It closely follows the cycle the snowshoe hare.</p><p>B. When the numbers of lynx fall, the numbers of snowshoe hares soon decrease.</p><p>C. When hare numbers decrease, lynx numbers increase.</p><p>D. It is not clearly related to the availability of lynx food.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A. The original text says that because the hare is a food for the Bobcats, the number of hares drops, and the number of bobcats will fall. So choose A. B's logical relationship is not correct. It is not that the hares follow the Bobcats. C is even more wrong. Both numbers increase and decrease at the same time. D does not meet the original text.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 6, which of the following was true of the hare population cycle in Krebs's experiment?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The effects of providing food while at the same time introducing predators cancelled each other, so there was no cycle.</p><p>B. The cycle existed when either the food supply was limited or there were predators.</p><p>C. There was a cycle when there were no predators and food was supplied.</p><p>D. If the hares had places to hide from the lynx, the hare population increased tenfold and then remained at that level.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B does not have particularly good positioning words, but the structure of the article is relatively simple. The specific conditions of the experiment are described in the middle of the paragraph. Then the experimental conclusion is drawn. The answer appears in the penultimate sentence of the original text: However, the cycle was retained if either of the factors Was allowed to operate alone: if predators were excluded but food was not added (food effect alone), or if food was added in the presence of predators (predator effect alone). Cycle. Corresponds to the B option, so B is correct. In the absence of both at the same time, there is no cycle. The two factors of the A option cancel each other. This relationship has not been demonstrated in the original text, so A is wrong. When C says that neither of the two factors exists, the cycle still exists. This contradicts the original. The D option is not related to either of the two factors. Do not choose.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 7, which of the following statements correctly characterizes the effect of sea stars on the ecosystem in which they are predators of bivalves?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Bivalve population are kept low, allowing species that compete with bivalves to survive.</p><p>B. The numbers of most species of bivalves are greatly reduced, leaving the bivalve species that is the strongest competitor to dominate among the survivors.</p><p>C. Biological diversity begins to decrease because many bivalve species disappear.</p><p>D. Sea stars dominate at first but then die off because of the depleted food supply.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A uses sea stars to navigate to the beginning of For example. For example, sea stars prey on a variety of bivalve mollusks and prevent these bivalves from monopolizing habitats on the sea floor. This opens up space for many other organisms. When sea stars are removed, species diversity falls sharply. Existence is a limitation to the bivalves, allowing other organisms to have room for survival. Meets the A option. B is not correct, B is inconsistent with the original; C is not right. After Bivalve's control, diversity should be raised; D is not right. The original does not say that Sea stars died.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 7, which of the following is true of the phenomenon of competitor exclusion?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It results in more diverse communities.</p><p>B. It requires the presence of predators.</p><p>C. It affects all competitions equally.</p><p>D. It happens only when there is a dominant competitor.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D Based on comporitor exclusion positioning, this phrase says this phenomenon, then the phenomenon description should be in front: Without predators, the species that is the best competitor for food, shelter, and other environmental resources tends to dominate and exclude the species with Which it competes. Looking forward you can see that this phenomenon is going to exist in the "best competitor" situation, this competitor is also tod to dominate, in line with D. A is not a direct effect of this phenomenon. Its direct role is to restrict other competitors. B, though correct, did not indicate its uniqueness. C did not mention it.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>As a result, there are not enough of the strong competitions to monopolize the environment's resources..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C here says as a result, which shows that the previous sentence of this sentence should be the reason for this result. And, you can use strong competitors to the text to locate those words in the discussion of related content. Obviously, C is the most appropriate. The strongest competitor is mentioned in the previous sentence of C, and the content of the discussion is the reason why the phenomenon of inserting a sentence occurs. A is obviously wrong. The content of this after the A appears in the previous sentence, and the close reference relationship should not be interrupted. The B option shows a turning point, so it is not appropriate to place it here. The D option is even more inappropriate. For example, it is obviously only followed by the examples given above and cannot be interrupted.</p></div></div><div id="question14" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>The relationships between predators and prey are complex.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.Studies of the interactions between wolves and moose on Isle Royale in Lake Superior reveal that wolf predation is not the primary factor controlling the moose population.</p><p>B.Ecologists are interested in studying predator-prey population cycles because understanding how predators and prey interact will allow better wildlife management programs</p><p>C.. Predators help maintain biological diversity by limiting populations of a dominant competitor species, thereby preventing that species from excluding others.</p><p>D.In predator-prey population cycles, predator populations increase or decrease following similar population changes in the species they prey on.</p><p>E.A species' population tends to rise and falls in a cycle pattern if the food supply for the population is limited, or if the population has a major predator.</p><p>F.The removal of sea stars reduces the diversity of the community in which they are predators, and is therefore a bad idea.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="CDE"><p>CDE A corresponds to the original 1-3 paragraph. Although up to the second paragraph is consistent with this option, but the third paragraph has already denied this. Wrong, do not choose. B is correct. But the original did not mention the purpose of the ecologists to study the relationship between predators and prey. Do not choose. C correct, choose. Corresponds to the last paragraph of the original text D correct, choose. The second paragraph of the original text has already expressed this sentence. The back is also repeated. E correct, choose. Corresponds to the original countdown</p><p>The second paragraph. The F option is missing a ring - a bivalve animal. Semantic expression is incomplete. Do not choose.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
