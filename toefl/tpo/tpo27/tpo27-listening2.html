of a lecture in a <span class="highlight">marine</span><span class="highlight">biology</span> class. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="11.17" data-time="4.72">[00:04.72]</span>Professor: So we have been <span class="highlight">fairly</span><span class="highlight">thorough</span> in our discussion about <span class="highlight">coral</span> reefs, which of <span class="highlight">course</span> are <span class="highlight">prominent</span>, <span class="highlight">oceanic</span> features made of hard <span class="highlight">limestone</span> skeletons produced by tiny <span class="highlight">coral</span> animals. <span class="time" data-times="12.62" data-time="15.89">[00:15.89]</span>We've gone over where <span class="highlight">coral</span> reefs are usually formed – <span class="highlight">along</span> the edges of <span class="highlight">shallow</span> ocean banks in <span class="highlight">tropical</span> or subtropical regions, and the fact that they are declining at an alarming <span class="highlight">rate</span>. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.73" data-time="28.51">[00:28.51]</span>But I don't want to leave you with the <span class="highlight">impression</span> that all is lost. <span class="time" data-times="6.19" data-time="32.24">[00:32.24]</span>There are several techniques being employed today that could prove useful in assuring the future of the reefs. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="8.89" data-time="38.43">[00:38.43]</span>Now, we've talked in depth about <span class="highlight">coral</span><span class="highlight">bleaching</span>, or whitening, which as you <span class="highlight">recall</span>, is a <span class="highlight">symptom</span> of ...well that the <span class="highlight">coral</span> is suffering. <span class="time" data-times="3.93" data-time="47.32">[00:47.32]</span>As you know, <span class="highlight">coral</span> is very <span class="highlight">sensitive</span> to water <span class="highlight">temperature</span>.<span class="time" data-times="7.29" data-time="51.25">[00:51.25]</span><span class="highlight">Even</span> though one or two <span class="highlight">degree</span> Celsius rise in sea surface <span class="highlight">temperature</span> for a <span class="highlight">relatively</span> short <span class="highlight">amount</span> of time can cause <span class="highlight">bleaching</span>. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="9.33" data-time="58.54">[00:58.54]</span>Recently, researchers have used <span class="highlight">data</span> collected by monitoring surface water temperatures to <span class="highlight">improve</span> the <span class="highlight">ability</span> of a <span class="highlight">reef</span> to <span class="highlight">recover</span> from <span class="highlight">bleaching</span>.<span class="time" data-times="11" data-time="67.87">[01:07.87]</span>One future possibility is that improved monitoring can help <span class="highlight">predict</span> where and when <span class="highlight">bleaching</span> will <span class="highlight">occur</span>, which might potentially enable us to mitigate its effects. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.44" data-time="78.87">[01:18.87]</span>And there's another <span class="highlight">technique</span> that's been experimented with to try to help <span class="highlight">coral</span> reefs <span class="highlight">recover</span> from <span class="highlight">bleaching</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.48" data-time="85.31">[01:25.31]</span>It's called <span class="highlight">coral</span> transplantation.<span class="time" data-times="12.2" data-time="88.79">[01:28.79]</span>This involves moving young <span class="highlight">coral</span> from a healthy <span class="highlight">reef</span> onto a degraded <span class="highlight">reef</span>, you know, in an <span class="highlight">attempt</span> to <span class="highlight">regenerate</span> the degraded <span class="highlight">reef</span> by encouraging young healthy <span class="highlight">coral</span> to take over.<span class="time" data-times="4.78" data-time="100.99">[01:40.99]</span>There has been some success with this, but it's still <span class="highlight">somewhat</span><span class="highlight">controversial</span>. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="10.01" data-time="105.77">[01:45.77]</span>Some scientists support it because, well for one thing, it means you don't have to <span class="highlight">rely</span> on the existing <span class="highlight">coral</span> to reestablish itself because it might not be able to. <span class="time" data-times="6.19" data-time="115.78">[01:55.78]</span>But in my opinion, transplanting <span class="highlight">coral</span> should only be used as ... well as a last <span class="highlight">resort</span>.<span class="time" data-times="14.5" data-time="121.97">[02:01.97]</span>I mean, this <span class="highlight">method</span> is not only costly but it's ... well <span class="highlight">even</span> if it's successful, it still fails to <span class="highlight">address</span> the <span class="highlight">ongoing</span> problem, the <span class="highlight">root</span> causes of the <span class="highlight">degradation</span>, which really is <span class="highlight">paramount</span> to devising an <span class="highlight">effective</span><span class="highlight">solution</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.08" data-time="136.47">[02:16.47]</span>So I don't really take comfort in the successes they have had with transplantation. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="8.31" data-time="141.55">[02:21.55]</span>Perhaps some more <span class="highlight">constructive</span> use of our time could be spent at researching corals that do <span class="highlight">survive</span>, like in areas known as refugia. <span class="time" data-times="6.17" data-time="149.86">[02:29.86]</span>Refugia are areas on the <span class="highlight">reef</span> that are seemingly, well <span class="highlight">resistant</span> to <span class="highlight">bleaching</span>.<span class="time" data-times="7.42" data-time="156.03">[02:36.03]</span>See, when <span class="highlight">coral</span> reefs experience <span class="highlight">bleaching</span>, it's <span class="highlight">rarely</span> a case of the whole <span class="highlight">reef</span> being affected. <span class="time" data-times="4.49" data-time="163.45">[02:43.45]</span>There are almost always pockets of <span class="highlight">coral</span> on the reefs that <span class="highlight">remain</span> unaffected.<span class="time" data-times="7.46" data-time="167.94">[02:47.94]</span>And these are often the <span class="highlight">lower</span> areas of the <span class="highlight">reef</span>, those located in deeper water, where temperatures are <span class="highlight">lower</span>. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="9.52" data-time="175.4">[02:55.40]</span>Now, we have <span class="highlight">evidence</span> that corals in these locations are able to <span class="highlight">escape</span> the <span class="highlight">destructive</span><span class="highlight">bleaching</span> that affects portions of the <span class="highlight">reef</span> in shallower or warmer water. <span class="time" data-times="6.03" data-time="184.92">[03:04.92]</span>So in my <span class="highlight">mind</span>, it's these refugia that are the key components of <span class="highlight">overall</span><span class="highlight">reef</span><span class="highlight">resilience</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.96" data-time="190.95">[03:10.95]</span>These should be the area of <span class="highlight">concentration</span> for researchers to <span class="highlight">locate</span> and protect those regions as a way to <span class="highlight">sustain</span><span class="highlight">coral</span> reefs. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="8.41" data-time="199.91">[03:19.91]</span>And we can also protect the reefs by protecting the surrounding ecosystems, like mangrove forests and seagrass beds. <span class="time" data-times="4.88" data-time="208.32">[03:28.32]</span>Both of these grow in coastal waters, often in the <span class="highlight">vicinity</span> of <span class="highlight">coral</span> reefs. <span class="time" data-times="3.38" data-time="213.2">[03:33.20]</span>By protecting these areas, we also protect the <span class="highlight">coral</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.59" data-time="216.58">[03:36.58]</span>Let's take, for example, the mangrove forests. <span class="time" data-times="8.23" data-time="220.17">[03:40.17]</span>Mangrove <span class="highlight">root</span> systems have the <span class="highlight">ability</span> to <span class="highlight">absorb</span> and well <span class="highlight">trap</span> sediments and pollutants in water that flows <span class="highlight">through</span> them before they enter the ocean. <span class="time" data-times="4.11" data-time="228.4">[03:48.40]</span>This of <span class="highlight">course</span> has <span class="highlight">beneficial</span> results for the nearby <span class="highlight">coral</span> reefs. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.48" data-time="232.51">[03:52.51]</span>And fishery's <span class="highlight">management</span> is another key <span class="highlight">strategy</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.93" data-time="235.99">[03:55.99]</span>Overfishing can be seriously <span class="highlight">disruptive</span> to <span class="highlight">coral</span>.<span class="time" data-times="2.2" data-time="239.92">[03:59.92]</span> Let me give you a <span class="highlight">couple</span> of examples.<span class="time" data-times="6.92" data-time="242.12">[04:02.12]</span>Overfishing certain <span class="highlight">species</span> of fish and <span class="highlight">shellfish</span> like snappers, barracudas and <span class="highlight">even</span> lobsters. <span class="time" data-times="5.88" data-time="249.04">[04:09.04]</span>Well, all of these creatures feed on snails, worms and other organisms that eat <span class="highlight">coral</span>. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.85" data-time="254.92">[04:14.92]</span>So depleting the number of lobsters, for example, means that we are adding to the threat of <span class="highlight">coral</span><span class="highlight">decline</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.63" data-time="260.77">[04:20.77]</span>Sea urchins are another example. <span class="time" data-times="3.6" data-time="263.4">[04:23.40]</span>They eat <span class="highlight">algae</span> and prevent it from overwhelming the <span class="highlight">coral</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="267">[04:27.00]</span>Since the disappearance of sea urchins from the waters up the <span class="highlight">coast</span> of South Florida, many <span class="highlight">coral</span> reefs there have been smothered by the uncontrolled growth of <span class="highlight">algae</span>. </p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1"
