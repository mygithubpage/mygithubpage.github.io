          <h4 class="w3-center">Switch to Electronic Textbooks</h4>
          <p>The university will begin switching From traditional-bound textbooks early next year. University students will be able to download the content of their required textbooks to a reading device and read the material directly from the device's screen. While the cost of the device is around $200, it is a one-time expense. Considering the rising cost of textbooks, students will save money in the long run since purchasing electronic books for their classes is much less expensive than buying regular textbooks. Furthermore, the university believe the device will be the an effective study aid because it is simple to operate and offers features such as highlighting of text and note-taking.</p>

        <article>
          <p>Now listen to two students discussing the opinion expressed in the letter. </p>
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>(man) Did you see Paul's letter in the paper about the new sculpture? </p>
          <p>(woman) Yeah, but it was totally unconvincing. His reasons for opposing the plan are just totally off. I am glad that we'll finally have some nice art on campus. I'd like to shake the donor's hand and say "thank you." (man) What do you mean the donor? </p>
          <p>(woman) You didn't know? An anonymous donor is paying the bill for most of the sculpture. </p>
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>(man) Not the university? </p>
          <p>(woman) No! His assumptions about who's paying are all wrong! </p>
          <p>(man) Still, I wonder if he has a point about the space it'll take up? </p>
          <p>(woman) Well, you know why Paul is upset. He and his friends are always out there on the lawn right where the sculpture will be, kicking around the soccer ball. Now they'll just have to use another part of the campus to play. </p>
          <p>(man) Oh! So he just doesn't want to have to move. </p>
          <p>(woman) Yeah! For him, it's sculpture versus convenience. </p>
          <p>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>Well, according to the plan the university is to switch from traditional-bound textbooks to electronic textbooks early next year for two reasons. However the woman disagrees with the plan for several reasons. Firstly, she believes that it's not realistic for the cost issue since it'll still cost the students a lot when they break their devices or when they wish to get the devices upgraded for some new features they want. Besides, she thinks that the device itself is not practical too, because the screen is too small so it's difficult for even the normal-sized-fingered students to handle the key pad or buttons, letting alone selecting or underlining and stuff like that. Finally she personally favors the traditional way of studying material because she thinks it's more comfortable. All in all, the woman disagrees with the plan for the reasons stated above.
