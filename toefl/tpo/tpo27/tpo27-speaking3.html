          <h4 class="w3-center">Switch to Electronic Textbooks</h4>The university will begin switching from traditional-bound textbooks to electronic textbooks early next year. University students will be able to download the content of their required textbooks to a reading device and read the material directly from the device's screen. While the cost of the device is around $200, it is a one-time expense. Considering the rising cost of textbooks, students will save money in the long run since purchasing electronic books for their classes is much less expensive than buying regular textbooks. Furthermore, the university believes the device will be an effective study aid because it is simple to operate and offers features such as highlighting of text and note-taking.</article>

        <h3>Listening Text</h3>
        <article>
          <p>Now listen to two students discussing the article.</p>
          <p>(woman) Oh, no, did you see this?</p>
          <p>(man) Yeah, why? You don't like the idea?</p>
          <p>(woman) Not at all!</p>
          <p>(man) How come?</p>
          <p>(woman) Well, the cost, for one thing, they are just not being realistic.</p>
          <p>(man) Even compare to the price of textbooks?</p>
          <p>(woman) Well, sure, textbooks aren't cheap, but do you think people are only gonna use one device the whole time they are at university? What happens if yours breaks? You have to buy a new one. Or they come out with some fancy new features. Wouldn't you want to get a new one then?</p>
          <p>(man) Yeah, I see what you mean. A lot of people would probably want to replace theirs with the latest version.</p>
          <p>(woman) Right! Maybe even every year and that can add up.</p>
          <p>(man) True, but, don't you agree it'll make studying and preparing for classes a lot easier?</p>
          <p>(woman) I don't think everybody is gonna think it's so great.</p>
          <p>(man) What do you mean?</p>
          <p>(woman) Well., it's only helpful if it's easy to use and, well, this thing is pretty small. It's only about 18 or 20 centimeters tall.</p>
          <p>(man) Oh, really? So that means the screen's pretty small.</p>
          <p>(woman) Right, and I heard that the key pad or control buttons, they are small, too. So if you have normal-sized fingers, it's not so easy to select an item or get it to function right, you know, to do stuff like highlighting or underlining.</p>
          <p>(man) I hadn't thought of that.</p>
          <p>(woman) So what good are all those fancy features if it's hard to use them? Besides, I like the old-fashioned way of studying material: writing notes on the page and underlining or highlighting important sections of the book. I'm more comfortable with that. "</p>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>Well, according to the plan the university is to switch from traditional-bound textbooks to electronic textbooks early next year for two reasons. However the woman disagrees with the plan for several reasons. Firstly, she believes that it's not realistic for the cost issue since it'll still cost the students a lot when they break their devices or when they wish to get the devices upgraded for some new features they want. Besides, she thinks that the device itself is not practical too, because the screen is too small so it's difficult for even the normal-sized-fingered students to handle the key pad or buttons, letting alone selecting or underlining and stuff like that. Finally she personally favors the traditional way of studying material because she thinks it's more comfortable. All in all, the woman disagrees with the plan for the reasons stated above.
