              <span class="time" data-times="13.12" data-time="5.76">[00:05.76]</span>Professor: So <span class="underline">musical</span> instruments evolved in ways that optimize their <span class="underline">acoustical</span> properties, how the <span class="underline">instrument</span> vibrates and sends those <span class="underline">vibration</span> <span class="underline">through</span> the <span class="underline">air</span> to our eardrums. </p>

              <span class="time" data-times="15.83" data-time="18.88">[00:18.88]</span>Now <span class="underline">professional</span> musicians are very <span class="underline">particular</span> about their instruments, they want instruments that help them fully express the <span class="underline">intent</span> of the <span class="underline">composer</span>, which of <span class="underline">course</span> translates into a more enjoyable listening experience for the <span class="underline">audience</span> members.<span class="time" data-times="6.64" data-time="34.71">[00:34.71]</span>Yet most <span class="underline">audience</span> members probably aren't <span class="underline">even</span> <span class="underline">aware</span> of how much the <span class="underline">instrument</span> matters.<span class="time" data-times="4.7" data-time="41.35">[00:41.35]</span>I mean, OK. Think about the last <span class="underline">concert</span> you attended. <span class="time" data-times="3.28" data-time="46.05">[00:46.05]</span>When you applauded, what went <span class="underline">through</span> your <span class="underline">mind</span>? </p>

              <span class="time" data-times="4.78" data-time="49.33">[00:49.33]</span>Student: I recently heard a violinist who totally blew me away. <span class="time" data-times="7.12" data-time="54.11">[00:54.11]</span>So when I applauded, I guess I was showing my <span class="underline">appreciation</span> for his skill, the hours of practicing he must have put in. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="0.95" data-time="61.23">[01:01.23]</span>Professor: And his violin? </p>

            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.25" data-time="73.61">[01:13.61]</span>Professor: I hope you do.<span class="time" data-times="2.93" data-time="74.86">[01:14.86]</span> But if your violin isn't as good as his... </p>

              <span class="time" data-times="4.97" data-time="81.68">[01:21.68]</span>Professor: As I said, tone <span class="underline">quality</span> differs from <span class="underline">instrument</span> to <span class="underline">instrument</span>. <span class="time" data-times="1.74" data-time="86.65">[01:26.65]</span>The question is why.<span class="time" data-times="6.22" data-time="88.39">[01:28.39]</span> Why does one <span class="underline">instrument</span> <span class="underline">sound</span> more beautiful than another, <span class="underline">even</span> if they look <span class="underline">identical</span>? </p>

              <span class="time" data-times="12.47" data-time="94.61">[01:34.61]</span>There's a particularly interesting case with an <span class="underline">extraordinary</span> <span class="underline">generation</span> of violins made in Northern Italy, in the city of Cremona, back in the late 1600s - early 1700s. <span class="time" data-times="5.23" data-time="107.08">[01:47.08]</span>These vintage Cremonese violins are considered the best in the world.<span class="time" data-times="5.35" data-time="112.31">[01:52.31]</span>But it's not like the makers of those violins were any more skilled than their modern-day counterparts. <span class="time" data-times="0.75" data-time="117.66">[01:57.66]</span>They weren't.<span class="time" data-times="6.54" data-time="118.41">[01:58.41]</span>Today's top violin makers can <span class="underline">pretty</span> much <span class="underline">replicate</span> all the <span class="underline">physical</span> attributes of a Cremonese violin. <span class="time" data-times="6.85" data-time="124.95">[02:04.95]</span>But it's generally thought that the <span class="underline">acoustical</span> <span class="underline">quality</span> of modern violins doesn't live up to the <span class="underline">quality</span> of the vintage ones. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.25" data-time="131.8">[02:11.80]</span>Student: So what attributes of the old violins have been replicated? </p>

              <span class="time" data-times="4.44" data-time="163.97">[02:43.97]</span>Student: How? Unless the trees that Cremonese used are still alive. </p>
