Some special techniques used by the makers of vintage Cremonese violins.</p><p>B. How the acoustical quality of the violin was improved over time.</p><p>C. Factors that may be responsible for the beautiful tone of Cremonese violins.</p><p>D. Some criteria that professional violinists use when selecting their instruments.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>So what attributes of the old violins have been replicated? The question begins with a question: Why does an instrument sound more beautiful than another even if they look identical? And the rest of the Lecture is to answer this question, so make sure the answer is C .</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor imply about the best modern violin makers?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They are unable to recreate the high quality varnish used by Cremonese violins makers.</p><p>B. Their craftsmanship is comparable to that of the Cremonese violins makers.</p><p>C. They use wood from the same trees that were used to make the Cremonese violins.</p><p>D. Many of them also compose music for the violin.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>They weren't. Today's top violin makers can pretty much replicate all the physical attributes of a Cremonese violin. Physical attributes refer to craftsmanship. In addition, it can also be seen from the following that the main relationship is wood, which has nothing to do with craftsmanship.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor discuss the growth cycle of tree?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To clarify how modern violin makers select wood.</p><p>B. To highlight a similarity between vintage and modern violins.</p><p>C. To explain why tropical wood cannot be used to make violins.</p><p>D. To explain what causes variations in density in a piece of wood.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>That is, the difference in growth cycle leads to the density differential, which explains why there are density differential .Trees, old trees that don't grow in the tropics fashionable seasonally, they grow faster early in the year in the springtime than they do later in the year.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What factor accounts for the particular density differential of the wood used in the Cremonese violins?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The trees that produced the wood were harvested in spring.</p><p>B. The trees that produced the wood grew in an unusually cool climate.</p><p>C. The wood was allowed to partially decay before being made into violins.</p><p>D. The wood was coated with a local varnish before it was crafted into violins.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>C is an obfuscation item and this is how to copy it. For Guqin, the approach is: Turns out the Cremonese violins were made from trees that grew during a little ice age when temperature across Europe is significantly lower than normal. In other words, Cremonese's wood was grown during the Little Ice Age. The weather is cold all year round.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The professor describes an experiment in which wood was exposed to a fungus before being made into a violin. What point does the professor make about the fungus?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It decomposes only certain parts of the wood.</p><p>B. It was found only in the forests of northern Italy.</p><p>C. It was recently discovered in a vintage Cremonese violin.</p><p>D. It decomposes only certain species of trees.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>He basically exposed the wood to a species of fungus, a mushroom........but this particular fungus nibbles away only at certain layers in the wood........as a result, the fungitreated wood Approach the woods of Cremonese wood. The professor said this particular fungus nibbles away only at certain layers in the wood, and the A option directly echoes.</p></div></div><div class="replay" id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor say this:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To find out how much exposure students have had to live classical music.</p><p>B. To use student experiences to support his point about audience members.</p><p>C. To indicated that instruments are harder to master than audience members realize.</p><p>D. To make a point about the beauty of violin music.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>OK. Think about the last concert you attended. When you applauded, what went through your mind? The professor said that most of the audience did not notice the problem of the instrument. The girl said yes, she did not pay attention. So when the professor said these things, he was right to prove this point.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
