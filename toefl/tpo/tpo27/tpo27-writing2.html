        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>Whether a person should take a job offer immediately or wait for a better option largely depends on his/her position in the job market. While those who practice occupations needed urgently by the market can wait for their dream job, on balance, people who don't have the similar advantages should not take the risks.First, for job seekers who get high market value, they can afford to wait for better opportunities. People who are highly skilled, or experienced in certain fields are exactly what the markets needs nowadays. They get what it takes to generate wealth for their employers. Therefore, they should not get low balled in the hiring process, even in a tough economy. For those elites, they never have to compromise with the second best. If they and an employer have wildly different ideas about what their background is worth, they can keep waiting for the perfection. Because they never have to worry about remaining unemployed for too long. If one cannot know it from concrete examples, one can deduce it from general principles. We rarely see the most valuable NBA player of the year have to make do with the offer he doesn't favor in the first place. Next, for the job seekers who have relatively low market value, they had better take a secure job offer as soon as they have the chance. When I pursued my master degree, I had to juggle between two temp jobs to cover my living expense. Majoring in communication and technology, I am a multimedia wizard with a certificate on video producing. There were always lots of hiring ads calling for video photographer on Craigslist, so I could be particular about the shooting location and the payment before I decided to take the tasks. Meanwhile I also worked as a server on night shift in some sushi bar. However, as an inexperienced waitress, frankly speaking, I did not have lots of options. Servers live on tips, and an inexperienced waitress can seen as the pain in the neck in a restaurant. At the time my wage was always the lowest, but I could not afford to stay in my apartment earning nothing at all. People should be flexible enough to adapt to the changes in the job market. Only when one becomes strong enough, he/she will have the leverage to negotiate with potential employers. For new college graduates, despite the shining diploma they have printed on their CVs, they may not have the specific kinds experience and skills the market requires. However, those graduates should thinking thoroughly before they take a job offer. For them, we are not only talking about one, two, three years or longer of those graduates lives. We're talking about the launch of their career. A sound decision will make that launch a successful one, while a poor one could lead long time, if it's not lifelong, disappointment. In sum, whether to take a less-than-perfect job offer or wait for a job that they might like better is not an easy question to answer, because the right decision depends entirely on one's situation. While people who have the leverage such as experience and unique skills can afford to take the risk, people who have relatively low market value should take what they can have as soon as possible. </p>
