Parents should be involved in the process of helping their children to choose a university.
Use specific reasons and details in your response.</p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>"As for me, I think though parents should be involved when kids are choosing a university, they should not decide which university their kid attends.   Firstly, kids have their own preference and interests. I mean, by the time when they're about to attend college, they've grown into an adult, and they know how to make choices. So parents can't decide whether they attend a small college or a big one, or whether they attend college near their hometown or in a city far away from home.   Secondly, kids are more likely to enjoy the life in the college they selected on their own, which is actually a good thing for their future. "</p></article></div></main></body></html>
