            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.44" data-time="3.35">[00:03.35]</span>Professor: Your reading for today touched on <span class="underline">dinosaur</span> fossils from the <span class="underline">Mesozoic</span> <span class="underline">era</span>, which ended about 65 million years ago. <span class="time" data-times="2.89" data-time="10.79">[00:10.79]</span>Today we will be discussing the sauropods.<span class="time" data-times="7.97" data-time="13.68">[00:13.68]</span>I think our discussion of sauropods will <span class="underline">illustrate</span> what we can learn by comparing the <span class="underline">fossil</span> <span class="underline">record</span> to modern animals. <span class="time" data-times="9.27" data-time="21.65">[00:21.65]</span>By fossils, we mean traces of <span class="underline">prehistoric</span> animals such as bones, which become mineralized, or impressions of bones or organs that are left in stone. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.53" data-time="30.92">[00:30.92]</span>Now sauropods were among the largest animals to exist ever!<span class="time" data-times="4.33" data-time="35.45">[00:35.45]</span> They were larger than blue whales, which are the largest animals alive today. <span class="time" data-times="5.23" data-time="39.78">[00:39.78]</span>They weigh up to one hundred tons, twenty times as much as elephants. <span class="time" data-times="3.48" data-time="45.01">[00:45.01]</span>Also, they were an extremely successful kind of <span class="underline">dinosaur</span>.<span class="time" data-times="7.02" data-time="48.49">[00:48.49]</span> There's <span class="underline">evidence</span> of sauropods in the <span class="underline">fossil</span> <span class="underline">record</span> for an unusually long time, over one hundred million years. <span class="time" data-times="3.38" data-time="55.51">[00:55.51]</span>So, why were sauropods so successful? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.63" data-time="58.89">[00:58.89]</span>Biologically speaking, sauropods shouldn't have been successful. <span class="time" data-times="8.31" data-time="63.52">[01:03.52]</span>Large animals like elephants, say, they <span class="underline">require</span> much more food and energy and have fewer <span class="underline">offspring</span> than smaller animals. <span class="time" data-times="3.1" data-time="71.83">[01:11.83]</span>This makes maintaining a <span class="underline">population</span> harder. <span class="time" data-times="3.34" data-time="74.93">[01:14.93]</span>The largest animals today don't live on land. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.86" data-time="78.27">[01:18.27]</span>But in the ocean where food is easier to find, a blue whale, for <span class="underline">instance</span>, can eat up to 8,000 pounds of food a day. <span class="time" data-times="2.8" data-time="86.13">[01:26.13]</span>And they give birth only once every few years. <span class="time" data-times="8.21" data-time="88.93">[01:28.93]</span>We also know that body heat, that... well, large animals can't easily get rid of <span class="underline">excess</span> body heat. <span class="time" data-times="3.19" data-time="97.14">[01:37.14]</span>But for an oceangoing whale, that's not a problem. <span class="time" data-times="3.28" data-time="100.33">[01:40.33]</span>For a 100-ton land animal, it can be. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.97" data-time="103.61">[01:43.61]</span>For years, we have assumed it was the <span class="underline">abundant</span> plant life of the <span class="underline">Mesozoic</span> that allowed these giants to <span class="underline">thrive</span>. <span class="time" data-times="11.2" data-time="110.58">[01:50.58]</span>However, we now know that since <span class="underline">oxygen</span> levels were much <span class="underline">lower</span> in the <span class="underline">Mesozoic</span> than we assumed, there was much less plant life for sauropods to eat than we thought. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="13.73" data-time="121.78">[02:01.78]</span>So now, well, we are looking at other... we are, we are trying to understand the <span class="underline">biology</span> of sauropods, comparing their fossils to the <span class="underline">anatomy</span> of modern animals to get a better idea of how they lived. <span class="time" data-times="5.48" data-time="135.51">[02:15.51]</span>What we've found is that sauropods were experts at conserving energy. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.13" data-time="140.99">[02:20.99]</span>They had <span class="underline">enormous</span> stomach <span class="underline">capacity</span>, the <span class="underline">ability</span> to <span class="underline">digest</span> food over a long period, converting it to energy at a slower pace, <span class="underline">saving</span> it for later. <span class="time" data-times="6.92" data-time="151.12">[02:31.12]</span>For animals with small stomachs, it takes lots of energy to <span class="underline">constantly</span> look for food and then <span class="underline">digest</span> it.<span class="time" data-times="6.97" data-time="158.04">[02:38.04]</span>With larger stomachs and slower digestion, you don't need as much energy. Joseph? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="14.35" data-time="165.01">[02:45.01]</span>Student: Does... do scientists actually know about sauropods from looking at... I mean, how much can we actually learn looking at some <span class="underline">ancient</span> bones compared to all we can learn from modern animals? <span class="time" data-times="4.05" data-time="179.36">[02:59.36]</span>And, comparisons between animals that lived millions of years apart?<span class="time" data-times="3.48" data-time="183.41">[03:03.41]</span> Well, it just seems... more like guessing. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.23" data-time="186.89">[03:06.89]</span>Professor: There's always some guesswork when studying <span class="underline">extinct</span> animals. <span class="time" data-times="5.93" data-time="191.12">[03:11.12]</span>But that's exactly what leads to discoveries, a <span class="underline">hypothesis</span>, a type of guess is made. <span class="time" data-times="3.98" data-time="197.05">[03:17.05]</span>We guess the <span class="underline">hypothesis</span> by looking for <span class="underline">evidence</span> to support it. <span class="time" data-times="4.62" data-time="201.03">[03:21.03]</span>Then some questions are answered, which may <span class="underline">lead</span> to new questions. <span class="time" data-times="3.69" data-time="205.65">[03:25.65]</span>For example, let's look at one of these comparisons. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.38" data-time="209.34">[03:29.34]</span>We know sauropods couldn't <span class="underline">chew</span> food. <span class="time" data-times="2.69" data-time="212.72">[03:32.72]</span>Their skulls show they had no chewing muscles. <span class="time" data-times="5.07" data-time="215.41">[03:35.41]</span>Lots of modern animals, like birds and reptiles, also can't <span class="underline">chew</span> food.<span class="time" data-times="1.85" data-time="220.48">[03:40.48]</span> They need to <span class="underline">swallow</span> it whole. <span class="time" data-times="4.33" data-time="222.33">[03:42.33]</span>But modern animals have an interesting aid for digesting food. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.01" data-time="226.66">[03:46.66]</span>They <span class="underline">swallow</span> stones, stones that are used to help <span class="underline">grind</span> up the food before it's actually digested in the stomach. <span class="time" data-times="3.18" data-time="234.67">[03:54.67]</span>These stones are called gastroliths. <span class="time" data-times="8.21" data-time="237.85">[03:57.85]</span>Gastroliths make food easier to <span class="underline">digest</span>, <span class="underline">essentially</span> smashing food up, just as we do when we <span class="underline">chew</span>.<span class="time" data-times="6.13" data-time="246.06">[04:06.06]</span>Over time, gastroliths inside the animal are ground down and become smooth and rounded. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.92" data-time="252.19">[04:12.19]</span>Now, <span class="underline">sauropod</span> fossils are commonly found with smooth stones. <span class="time" data-times="2.76" data-time="257.11">[04:17.11]</span>For years we thought these were gastroliths. <span class="time" data-times="4.67" data-time="259.87">[04:19.87]</span>They look just like gastroliths and were found in the area of the sauropods' stomachs. <span class="time" data-times="6.18" data-time="264.54">[04:24.54]</span>A recent study measured the gastroliths in modern animals, in ostriches. <span class="time" data-times="6.52" data-time="270.72">[04:30.72]</span>And the study showed that ostriches need to <span class="underline">ingest</span> about one percent of their total body weight in gastroliths.<span class="time" data-times="9.9" data-time="277.24">[04:37.24]</span>But we have been able to <span class="underline">determine</span> that the stones found with sauropods totaled much less proportionally, less than a tenth of one percent of their body weight. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.63" data-time="287.14">[04:47.14]</span>So now we are not quite sure what these sauropods' stones were used for. <span class="time" data-times="7.11" data-time="291.77">[04:51.77]</span>It could be they were accidently ingested as the sauropods foraged for food, that they served no real purpose. <span class="time" data-times="7.95" data-time="298.88">[04:58.88]</span>Other researchers <span class="underline">speculate</span> that sauropods ingested these stones as a <span class="underline">source</span> of some the minerals they needed, such as <span class="underline">calcium</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="306.83">[05:06.83]</span>So the <span class="underline">original</span> <span class="underline">hypothesis</span> that the stones found with sauropods were gastroliths, <span class="underline">even</span> though it hasn't been supported, has helped us to make new hypotheses, which may <span class="underline">eventually</span> <span class="underline">lead</span> to the answer. </p>
