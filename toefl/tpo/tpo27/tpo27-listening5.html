<span class="time" data-times="3.98" data-time="197.05">[03:17.05]</span>We guess the <span class="highlight">hypothesis</span> by looking for <span class="highlight">evidence</span> to support it.

data-times="3.69" data-time="205.65">[03:25.65]</span>For example, let's look at one of these comparisons. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.38" data-time="209.34">[03:29.34]</span>We know sauropods couldn't <span class="highlight">chew</span> food. <span class="time" data-times="2.69" data-time="212.72">[03:32.72]</span>Their skulls show they had no chewing muscles. <span class="time" data-times="5.07" data-time="215.41">[03:35.41]</span>Lots of modern animals, like birds and reptiles, also can't <span class="highlight">chew</span> food.<span class="time" data-times="1.85" data-time="220.48">[03:40.48]</span> They need to <span class="highlight">swallow</span> it whole. <span class="time" data-times="4.33" data-time="222.33">[03:42.33]</span>But modern animals have an interesting aid for digesting food. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="8.01" data-time="226.66">[03:46.66]</span>They <span class="highlight">swallow</span> stones, stones that are used to help <span class="highlight">grind</span> up the food before it's actually digested in the stomach. <span class="time" data-times="3.18" data-time="234.67">[03:54.67]</span>These stones are called gastroliths. <span class="time" data-times="8.21" data-time="237.85">[03:57.85]</span>Gastroliths make food easier to <span class="highlight">digest</span>, <span class="highlight">essentially</span> smashing food up, just as we do when we <span class="highlight">chew</span>.<span class="time" data-times="6.13" data-time="246.06">[04:06.06]</span>Over time, gastroliths inside the animal are ground down and become smooth and rounded. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.92" data-time="252.19">[04:12.19]</span>Now, <span class="highlight">sauropod</span> fossils are commonly found with smooth stones. <span class="time" data-times="2.76" data-time="257.11">[04:17.11]</span>For years we thought these were gastroliths. <span class="time" data-times="4.67" data-time="259.87">[04:19.87]</span>They look just like gastroliths and were found in the area of the sauropods' stomachs. <span class="time" data-times="6.18" data-time="264.54">[04:24.54]</span>A recent study measured the gastroliths in modern animals, in ostriches. <span class="time" data-times="6.52" data-time="270.72">[04:30.72]</span>And the study showed that ostriches need to <span class="highlight">ingest</span> about one percent of their total body weight in gastroliths.<span class="time" data-times="9.9" data-time="277.24">[04:37.24]</span>But we have been able to <span class="highlight">determine</span> that the stones found with sauropods totaled much less proportionally, less than a tenth of one percent of their body weight. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.63" data-time="287.14">[04:47.14]</span>So now we are not quite sure what these sauropods' stones were used for. <span class="time" data-times="7.11" data-time="291.77">[04:51.77]</span>It could be they were accidently ingested as the sauropods foraged for food, that they served no real purpose. <span class="time" data-times="7.95" data-time="298.88">[04:58.88]</span>Other researchers <span class="highlight">speculate</span> that sauropods ingested these stones as a <span class="highlight">source</span> of some the minerals they needed, such as <span class="highlight">calcium</span>. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="306.83">[05:06.83]</span>So the <span class="highlight">original</span><span class="highlight">hypothesis</span> that the stones found with sauropods were gastroliths, <span class="highlight">even</span> though it hasn't been supported, has helped us to make new hypotheses, which may <span class="highlight">eventually</span><span class="highlight">lead</span> to the answer. </p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div

New theories about the climate of the Mesozoic.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The professor said that we have to discuss Sauropod, and that the comparison of fossil records to modern animals lies in these two sentences.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What point does the professor make when she compares blues whales to large land animals?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Like large land animals, blue whales have many offspring.</p><p>B. Like large land animals, blue whales have proportionally small stomachs.</p><p>C. The land environment provides a wider variety of food sources than the ocean.</p><p>D. The ocean environment reduces some of the problems faced by large animals.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>Now the world's largest animal lives in the sea, the food in the sea is richer than on land, and there is for ocean-going whale, that's not a problem. Some of the difficulties in the description of large land animals can be solved in the sea.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor, what recent finding about the Mesozoic era challenges an earlier belief?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Sauropod populations in the Mesozoic era were smaller than previously believe.</p><p>B. Oxygen levels in the Mesozoic era were higher than previously believe.</p><p>C. Ocean levels in the Mesozoic era fluctuated more than previously believe.</p><p>D. Plant life in the Mesozoic era was less abundant than previously believe.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>However, we now know........the were much much plants for sauropods to eat than we thought.

Large animals use relatively more energy in digesting their food.</p><p>D. Large animals have greater difficulty staying warm.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="AB"><p>The reason mentioned by the professor in the previous article that it is hard to maintain populations is that it requires a lot of food, low fertility, and difficulty in dissipating body heat. Therefore, choosing AB and D to maintain is not correct.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor discuss gastroliths that have been found with sauropod fossils?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

To give an example of a discovery made possible by recent advance in technology.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>We we have been able to determine that the stones found with sauropods totaled much less proportionally, less than a tenth of one percent of their body weight. The professor gave an example of gastroliths to prove that guesswork can guide the study, find the answer, and discover the new The problem.
