          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.29" data-time="6.49">[00:06.49]</span>Student: Would it be okay to <span class="highlight">focus</span> on something related to <span class="highlight">agriculture</span>? </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.93" data-time="10.78">[00:10.78]</span>Professor: Sure, farming technology is fine, as long as it's pre-modern. <span class="time" data-times="12.59" data-time="15.71">[00:15.71]</span>But this isn't a long per, so are you going to need to pick a <span class="highlight">specific</span> area of pre-modern <span class="highlight">agriculture</span>, like <span class="highlight">irrigation</span> or food crops of <span class="highlight">ancient</span> Greece. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.3" data-time="28.3">[00:28.30]</span>Student: I am actually interested in hydroponics. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.97" data-time="30.6">[00:30.60]</span>Professor: Hydroponics. Growing plants in water <span class="highlight">instead</span> of soil. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.14" data-time="36.57">[00:36.57]</span>Student: Well, not in <span class="highlight">pure</span> water, in water that has the <span class="highlight">proper</span> mix of nutrients. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.99" data-time="40.71">[00:40.71]</span>Professor: OK. But is it a pre-modern technology?<span class="time" data-times="12.02" data-time="44.7">[00:44.70]</span> I mean, hydroponics isn't really my specialty but from the research I have read, we are talking the nineteenth <span class="highlight">century</span>, maybe the seventeenth <span class="highlight">century</span> if you really <span class="highlight">stretch</span> it. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="16.12" data-time="56.72">[00:56.72]</span>Student: Oh? But the Aztec <span class="highlight">civilization</span> back in the thirteenth <span class="highlight">century</span> in basically where Mexico city is today ... An article I read said the Aztecs were using hydroponics in something they called ... I have got the word right here, um, Chinampas. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.79" data-time="72.84">[01:12.84]</span>Professor: Chinampas, the so-called floating gardens. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="9.26" data-time="77.63">[01:17.63]</span>Student: Exactly. So yeah the chinampas, the article said very clearly these floating gardens are <span class="highlight">proof</span> that the Aztec invented hydroponic farming. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.97" data-time="86.89">[01:26.89]</span>Professor: Well, chinampas are <span class="highlight">artificial</span> islands built up in <span class="highlight">shallow</span> lakes. <span class="time" data-times="5.64" data-time="92.86">[01:32.86]</span>Islands made from <span class="highlight">packed</span> earth and weeds and uh, <span class="highlight">material</span> from the bottom of the lake.<span class="time" data-times="6.82" data-time="98.5">[01:38.50]</span>They may have appeared to be floating in the water, but in fact they <span class="highlight">reach</span> all the way to the bottom of the lake. <span class="time" data-times="8.42" data-time="105.32">[01:45.32]</span>So the <span class="highlight">primary</span> growing <span class="highlight">medium</span>, what the plants <span class="highlight">draw</span> nutrients from, is actually soil, not water. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.48" data-time="113.74">[01:53.74]</span>Student: So the article was wrong about that? <span class="time" data-times="3.69" data-time="116.22">[01:56.22]</span>Too bad, it seems like a great topic, but I guess... </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1" data-time="119.91">[01:59.91]</span>Professor: Wait a <span class="highlight">minute</span>. <span class="time" data-times="10" data-time="120.91">[02:00.91]</span>Just because chinampas were not technically hydroponic doesn't mean this couldn't be an <span class="highlight">appropriate</span> topic for your paper. <span class="time" data-times="4.54" data-time="130.91">[02:10.91]</span>Chinampas were still a great pre-modern <span class="highlight">technological</span> achievement. <span class="time" data-times="6.83" data-time="135.45">[02:15.45]</span>I mean, they enabled the Aztecs to grow plenty of food in an area without much <span class="highlight">available</span> farmland. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.89" data-time="142.28">[02:22.28]</span>Student: But I wondered why the author wrote that chinampas were hydroponic. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="9.56" data-time="146.17">[02:26.17]</span>Professor: Well it's <span class="highlight">pretty</span> <span class="highlight">common</span> for writers to <span class="highlight">generalize</span>, say use a <span class="highlight">term</span> like hydroponics to <span class="highlight">describe</span> other types of <span class="highlight">agriculture</span>.<span class="time" data-times="5.18" data-time="155.73">[02:35.73]</span>Personally, I would never say hydroponic except for plants growing in <span class="highlight">liquid</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.82" data-time="160.91">[02:40.91]</span>The crops on chinampas <span class="highlight">definitely</span> benefited from the water surrounding them. <span class="time" data-times="2.49" data-time="165.73">[02:45.73]</span>But... hydroponic... </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.63" data-time="168.22">[02:48.22]</span>Student: OK. So I will go with chinampas but leave out with the hydroponics part. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.84" data-time="172.85">[02:52.85]</span>Professor: Actually, there's an important lesson here. <span class="time" data-times="8.21" data-time="175.69">[02:55.69]</span>We should <span class="highlight">pay</span> <span class="highlight">attention</span> to what happened in <span class="highlight">history</span> but also how historical events are presented. <span class="time" data-times="6.42" data-time="183.9">[03:03.90]</span>Why, for example, would writers use a word like hydroponics so casually? </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.33" data-time="190.32">[03:10.32]</span>Student: I guess 'cause it's a <span class="highlight">popular</span> topic people want to read about? </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="9.12" data-time="193.65">[03:13.65]</span>Professor: Or to help modern-day readers to understand something historical, maybe these writers think a <span class="highlight">familiar</span> <span class="highlight">frame</span> of <span class="highlight">reference</span> is needed. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.52" data-time="202.77">[03:22.77]</span>Student: Well that article was in a <span class="highlight">popular</span> magazine, not a scholarly <span class="highlight">journal</span> for historians. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.64" data-time="208.29">[03:28.29]</span>Professor: OK. But historians sometimes do the same thing. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.08" data-time="211.93">[03:31.93]</span>Student: So I guess then that all historians might not <span class="highlight">describe</span> chinampas in quite the same way either. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.94" data-time="217.01">[03:37.01]</span>Professor: Good point. Why not look into that too? <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="219.95">[03:39.95]</span>And include it <span class="highlight">along</span> with your description and <span class="highlight">analysis</span>. </p>
