But is it a pre-modern technology?<span class="time" data-times="12.02" data-time="44.7">[00:44.70]</span> I mean, hydroponics isn't really my specialty but from the research I have read, we are talking the nineteenth <span class="highlight">century</span>, maybe the seventeenth <span class="highlight">century</span> if you really <span class="highlight">stretch</span> it. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="16.12" data-time="56.72">[00:56.72]</span>Student: Oh? But the Aztec <span class="highlight">civilization</span> back in the thirteenth <span class="highlight">century</span> in basically where Mexico city is today ... An article I read said the Aztecs were using hydroponics in something they called ... I have got the word right here, um, Chinampas. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.79" data-time="72.84">[01:12.84]</span>Professor: Chinampas, the so-called floating gardens. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="9.26" data-time="77.63">[01:17.63]</span>Student: Exactly. So yeah the chinampas, the article said very clearly these floating gardens are <span class="highlight">proof</span> that the Aztec invented hydroponic farming. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.97" data-time="86.89">[01:26.89]</span>Professor: Well, chinampas are <span class="highlight">artificial</span> islands built up in <span class="highlight">shallow</span> lakes. <span class="time" data-times="5.64" data-time="92.86">[01:32.86]</span>Islands made from <span class="highlight">packed</span> earth and weeds and uh, <span class="highlight">material</span> from the bottom of the lake.<span class="time" data-times="6.82" data-time="98.5">[01:38.50]</span>They may have appeared to be floating in the water, but in fact they <span class="highlight">reach</span> all the way to the bottom of the lake. <span class="time" data-times="8.42" data-time="105.32">[01:45.32]</span>So the <span class="highlight">primary</span> growing <span class="highlight">medium</span>, what the plants <span class="highlight">draw</span> nutrients from, is actually soil, not water. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.48" data-time="113.74">[01:53.74]</span>Student: So the article was wrong about that? <span class="time" data-times="3.69" data-time="116.22">[01:56.22]</span>Too bad, it seems like a great topic, but I guess... </p><p><span class="time" data-times="1" data-time="119.91">[01:59.91]</span>Professor: Wait a <span class="highlight">minute</span>. <span class="time" data-times="10" data-time="120.91">[02:00.91]</span>Just because chinampas were not technically hydroponic doesn't mean this couldn't be an <span class="highlight">appropriate</span> topic for your paper. <span class="time" data-times="4.54" data-time="130.91">[02:10.91]</span>Chinampas were still a great pre-modern <span class="highlight">technological</span> achievement. <span class="time" data-times="6.83" data-time="135.45">[02:15.45]</span>I mean, they enabled the Aztecs to grow plenty of food in an area without much <span class="highlight">available</span> farmland. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.89" data-time="142.28">[02:22.28]</span>Student: But I wondered why the author wrote that chinampas were hydroponic. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="9.56" data-time="146.17">[02:26.17]</span>Professor: Well it's <span class="highlight">pretty</span><span class="highlight">common</span> for writers to <span class="highlight">generalize</span>, say use a <span class="highlight">term</span> like hydroponics to <span class="highlight">describe</span> other types of <span class="highlight">agriculture</span>.<span class="time" data-times="5.18" data-time="155.73">[02:35.73]</span>Personally, I would never say hydroponic except for plants growing in <span class="highlight">liquid</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.82" data-time="160.91">[02:40.91]</span>The crops on chinampas <span class="highlight">definitely</span> benefited from the water surrounding them. <span class="time" data-times="2.49" data-time="165.73">[02:45.73]</span>But... hydroponic... </p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.63" data-time="168.22">[02:48.22]</span>Student: OK.

It was probably invented by the Aztecs.</p><p>B. It is a relatively modern development in agriculture.</p><p>C. It requires soil that is rich in nutrients.</p><p>D. It is most successful when extremely pure water is use.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>But is it a pre-modern technology? I mean, hydroponics isn't really my specialty but from the research I have read, we are talking the nineteenth century, maybe the seventeenth century if you really stretch it.

To emphasize that the topic selected for a paper needs to be more specific.</p><p>B. To encourage the student to do more research.</p><p>C. To point out how much labor was required to build chinampas.</p><p>D. To explain why crops grown on chinampas should not be considered hydroponi.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The student said that Aztec invented the hydroponics and the professor explained to prove the following: It appears to be hydroponics, but the plants draw nutrients from soil prove that the craft is not hydroponic.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor think about the article the students mentions?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.
