As you probably know, <span class="highlight">primary</span> colors are, <span class="highlight">theoretically</span> speaking, the <span class="highlight">basic</span> colors from which all other colors can be made. <span class="time" data-times="9.98" data-time="14.02">[00:14.02]</span>But as you'll find out when you start working on your painting projects, the three <span class="highlight">primary</span> colors – red, blue, yellow – don't always make the best secondary colors. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.33" data-time="24">[00:24.00]</span>Combining red and blue, you will probably never get a <span class="highlight">fantastic</span> violet. <span class="time" data-times="3.29" data-time="28.33">[00:28.33]</span>To get a nice violet, you'll have to add white.<span class="time" data-times="5.72" data-time="31.62">[00:31.62]</span> Combining yellow and blue, you will almost never get a satisfactory green. <span class="time" data-times="3.29" data-time="37.34">[00:37.34]</span>You are better off using a <span class="highlight">pure</span> green <span class="highlight">pigment</span>. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="10.6" data-time="40.63">[00:40.63]</span>The idea of <span class="highlight">primary</span> colors, and <span class="highlight">specifically</span> the idea of red, yellow and blue being THE <span class="highlight">primary</span> colors, didn't exist until about 200 years ago. <span class="time" data-times="6.09" data-time="51.23">[00:51.23]</span>Until then, the <span class="highlight">dominant</span><span class="highlight">theory</span> about color was one that had been proposed by Isaac Newton. <span class="time" data-times="4.88" data-time="57.32">[00:57.32]</span>Newton gave a <span class="highlight">scientific</span> and <span class="highlight">objective</span> explanation of colors. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.37" data-time="62.2">[01:02.20]</span>He used a prism to <span class="highlight">break</span> white light down into the various colors of the <span class="highlight">spectrum</span>.<span class="time" data-times="6.87" data-time="67.57">[01:07.57]</span>And he theorized, rightly so, that different colors are <span class="highlight">essentially</span> different wavelengths of light. <span class="time" data-times="2.79" data-time="74.44">[01:14.44]</span>But he made no <span class="highlight">mention</span> of <span class="highlight">primary</span> colors.<span class="time" data-times="7.53" data-time="77.23">[01:17.23]</span> That idea came from, or was at <span class="highlight">least</span> published by a man named Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.<span class="time" data-times="2.8" data-time="84.76">[01:24.76]</span>Goethe was a well-known author.<span class="time" data-times="3.08" data-time="87.56">[01:27.56]</span> He wrote many famous novels, plays, poems. <span class="time" data-times="3.19" data-time="90.64">[01:30.64]</span>So why did he start thinking about colors? </p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.53" data-time="93.83">[01:33.83]</span>Well Goethe was part of the <span class="highlight">Romantic</span> Movement in western <span class="highlight">literature</span>. <span class="time" data-times="13.81" data-time="98.36">[01:38.36]</span>And he was a <span class="highlight">Romantic</span>, <span class="highlight">through</span> and <span class="highlight">through</span>, meaning that he explained objects and phenomena in terms of the spiritual, <span class="highlight">emotional</span><span class="highlight">impact</span> they had, as <span class="highlight">opposed</span> to explaining them in terms of their <span class="highlight">scientific</span> nature. <span class="time" data-times="6.77" data-time="112.17">[01:52.17]</span>He rejected an <span class="highlight">objective</span> understanding of color, in <span class="highlight">favor</span> of a more subjective understanding. <span class="time" data-times="4.83" data-time="118.94">[01:58.94]</span>He believed that when we see color, it stimulates our emotions.<span class="time" data-times="5.63" data-time="123.77">[02:03.77]</span>And different colors <span class="highlight">appeal</span> to or <span class="highlight">inspire</span> different emotions in different people. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.99" data-time="129.4">[02:09.40]</span>Student: That sounds like <span class="highlight">psychology</span>. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.04" data-time="132.39">[02:12.39]</span>Professor: Well, color <span class="highlight">theory</span> is used in <span class="highlight">psychology</span> too. <span class="time" data-times="6.42" data-time="136.43">[02:16.43]</span>Some psychologists do use their <span class="highlight">field</span>'s <span class="highlight">version</span> of color <span class="highlight">theory</span> to <span class="highlight">diagnose</span> and treat patients. <span class="time" data-times="8.11" data-time="142.85">[02:22.85]</span>Um... anyway, Goethe conducted a number of experiments trying to <span class="highlight">figure</span> out which colors corresponded to which emotions. <span class="time" data-times="4.06" data-time="150.96">[02:30.96]</span>And in terms of that goal, he wasn't very successful. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="12.83" data-time="155.02">[02:35.02]</span>But his experiments actually did show a lot about the relationships between colors themselves, about how colors change when placed next to other colors, about how they <span class="highlight">interact</span> with one another. <span class="time" data-times="5.58" data-time="167.85">[02:47.85]</span>Scientists studying optics and chromatics today still <span class="highlight">marvel</span> at his findings. <span class="time" data-times="6.19" data-time="173.43">[02:53.43]</span>But Goethe wasn't really able to <span class="highlight">establish</span> a <span class="highlight">clear</span> connection between colors and emotions. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="8.22" data-time="179.62">[02:59.62]</span>Then in 1806, he received a letter from a <span class="highlight">relatively</span> unknown German artist, a painter named Philipp Otto Runge.<span class="time" data-times="9.14" data-time="187.84">[03:07.84]</span>In the letter, Runge outlined his own color <span class="highlight">theory</span>, <span class="highlight">specifically</span> the connections he made between colors and emotions.<span class="time" data-times="10.25" data-time="196.98">[03:16.98]</span>And his ideas about what colors <span class="highlight">symbolize</span>, about the emotions that different colors <span class="highlight">inspire</span> were based on the colors red, yellow and blue. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="20.47" data-time="207.23">[03:27.23]</span>Runge's choice of red, yellow and blue had nothing to do with what we know from modern-day chromatics, it had to do with Runge's <span class="highlight">complex</span> system of symbolism, his experience of nature, particularly with his experience of the <span class="highlight">quality</span> of light at various times of the day, morning, noon and night. <span class="time" data-times="3.99" data-time="227.7">[03:47.70]</span>So each color had a <span class="highlight">specific</span><span class="highlight">symbolic</span> value. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.63" data-time="231.69">[03:51.69]</span>Well, four years later, Goethe published a book entitled Color Lesson. <span class="time" data-times="6.85" data-time="237.32">[03:57.32]</span>In Color Lesson, Goethe COINCIDENTLY cites the same colors as <span class="highlight">primary</span> colors. <span class="time" data-times="14.64" data-time="244.17">[04:04.17]</span>At this point, Goethe was already a well-known author, so he was easily able to popularize this idea of <span class="highlight">primary</span> colors, and <span class="highlight">specifically</span> the idea of red, yellow and blue as THE <span class="highlight">primary</span> colors. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.05" data-time="258.81">[04:18.81]</span>Student: But he didn't <span class="highlight">mention</span> Runge? </p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.83" data-time="261.86">[04:21.86]</span>Professor: Well, he did put Runge's letter in the book, at the end. <span class="time" data-times="4.94" data-time="266.69">[04:26.69]</span>But he added a disclaimer implying that Runge's letter didn't influence his work.<span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="271.63">[04:31.63]</span>Apparently, what Goethe was saying was that they just HAPPENED TO come up with the same <span class="highlight">theory</span> at the same time. </p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the lecture mainly

It is more useful to modern-day artists than to artists in the past.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>You'd better use a pure green. The professor said that the color of the three primary colors is not satisfactory. Therefore, it is not useful for artists.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor mention Isaac Newton?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To show the similarities between early ideas in art and early ideas in science.</p><p>B. To explain why mixing primary colors does not produce satisfactory secondary colors.</p><p>C. To provide background information for the theory of primary colors.</p><p>D. To point out the first person to propose a theory of primary colors.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Professor then said that Newton did not establish a complete color theory, nor did he mention primary color, but said that he gave an objective scientific explanation, so Newton said.

(C)</p><p>But Goethe wasn't really able to establish a clear connection between colors and emotions. (A) The professor used in terms of that goal, he wasn't very successful to point out that Goeth was not able to find the association between color and emotion; but The test did show a lot about the relationships between color themselves. This corresponds to the C option.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor, why did Runge choose the colors red, yellow, and blues as the three primary colors?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. He felt they represented natural light at different times of the day.</p><p>B. He noticed that they were the favorite colors of Romantic painters.</p><p>C. He performed several scientific experiments that suggested those colors.</p><p>D. He read a book by Goethe and agreed with Goethe's choices of colors.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>It had to do with Runge's complex system of symbolism, his experience of nature, particular with his experience of the quality of light at various times of the day, morning, noon and night. So each color had a specific symbolic value. The choice of three colors is not related to what we now call colorimetry. Runge thinks these three colors can represent morning, noon and night.</p></div></div><div class="replay" id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor imply when he says this:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.
