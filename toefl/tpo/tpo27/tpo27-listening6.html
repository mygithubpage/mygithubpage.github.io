              <span class="time" data-times="4.51" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in a <span class="underline">studio</span> art class. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.51" data-time="4.51">[00:04.51]</span>Professor: OK. As you probably know, <span class="underline">primary</span> colors are, <span class="underline">theoretically</span> speaking, the <span class="underline">basic</span> colors from which all other colors can be made. <span class="time" data-times="9.98" data-time="14.02">[00:14.02]</span>But as you'll find out when you start working on your painting projects, the three <span class="underline">primary</span> colors – red, blue, yellow – don't always make the best secondary colors. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.33" data-time="24">[00:24.00]</span>Combining red and blue, you will probably never get a <span class="underline">fantastic</span> violet. <span class="time" data-times="3.29" data-time="28.33">[00:28.33]</span>To get a nice violet, you'll have to add white.<span class="time" data-times="5.72" data-time="31.62">[00:31.62]</span> Combining yellow and blue, you will almost never get a satisfactory green. <span class="time" data-times="3.29" data-time="37.34">[00:37.34]</span>You are better off using a <span class="underline">pure</span> green <span class="underline">pigment</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.6" data-time="40.63">[00:40.63]</span>The idea of <span class="underline">primary</span> colors, and <span class="underline">specifically</span> the idea of red, yellow and blue being THE <span class="underline">primary</span> colors, didn't exist until about 200 years ago. <span class="time" data-times="6.09" data-time="51.23">[00:51.23]</span>Until then, the <span class="underline">dominant</span> <span class="underline">theory</span> about color was one that had been proposed by Isaac Newton. <span class="time" data-times="4.88" data-time="57.32">[00:57.32]</span>Newton gave a <span class="underline">scientific</span> and <span class="underline">objective</span> explanation of colors. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.37" data-time="62.2">[01:02.20]</span>He used a prism to <span class="underline">break</span> white light down into the various colors of the <span class="underline">spectrum</span>.<span class="time" data-times="6.87" data-time="67.57">[01:07.57]</span>And he theorized, rightly so, that different colors are <span class="underline">essentially</span> different wavelengths of light. <span class="time" data-times="2.79" data-time="74.44">[01:14.44]</span>But he made no <span class="underline">mention</span> of <span class="underline">primary</span> colors.<span class="time" data-times="7.53" data-time="77.23">[01:17.23]</span> That idea came from, or was at <span class="underline">least</span> published by a man named Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.<span class="time" data-times="2.8" data-time="84.76">[01:24.76]</span>Goethe was a well-known author.<span class="time" data-times="3.08" data-time="87.56">[01:27.56]</span> He wrote many famous novels, plays, poems. <span class="time" data-times="3.19" data-time="90.64">[01:30.64]</span>So why did he start thinking about colors? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.53" data-time="93.83">[01:33.83]</span>Well Goethe was part of the <span class="underline">Romantic</span> Movement in western <span class="underline">literature</span>. <span class="time" data-times="13.81" data-time="98.36">[01:38.36]</span>And he was a <span class="underline">Romantic</span>, <span class="underline">through</span> and <span class="underline">through</span>, meaning that he explained objects and phenomena in terms of the spiritual, <span class="underline">emotional</span> <span class="underline">impact</span> they had, as <span class="underline">opposed</span> to explaining them in terms of their <span class="underline">scientific</span> nature. <span class="time" data-times="6.77" data-time="112.17">[01:52.17]</span>He rejected an <span class="underline">objective</span> understanding of color, in <span class="underline">favor</span> of a more subjective understanding. <span class="time" data-times="4.83" data-time="118.94">[01:58.94]</span>He believed that when we see color, it stimulates our emotions.<span class="time" data-times="5.63" data-time="123.77">[02:03.77]</span>And different colors <span class="underline">appeal</span> to or <span class="underline">inspire</span> different emotions in different people. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.99" data-time="129.4">[02:09.40]</span>Student: That sounds like <span class="underline">psychology</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.04" data-time="132.39">[02:12.39]</span>Professor: Well, color <span class="underline">theory</span> is used in <span class="underline">psychology</span> too. <span class="time" data-times="6.42" data-time="136.43">[02:16.43]</span>Some psychologists do use their <span class="underline">field</span>'s <span class="underline">version</span> of color <span class="underline">theory</span> to <span class="underline">diagnose</span> and treat patients. <span class="time" data-times="8.11" data-time="142.85">[02:22.85]</span>Um... anyway, Goethe conducted a number of experiments trying to <span class="underline">figure</span> out which colors corresponded to which emotions. <span class="time" data-times="4.06" data-time="150.96">[02:30.96]</span>And in terms of that goal, he wasn't very successful. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="12.83" data-time="155.02">[02:35.02]</span>But his experiments actually did show a lot about the relationships between colors themselves, about how colors change when placed next to other colors, about how they <span class="underline">interact</span> with one another. <span class="time" data-times="5.58" data-time="167.85">[02:47.85]</span>Scientists studying optics and chromatics today still <span class="underline">marvel</span> at his findings. <span class="time" data-times="6.19" data-time="173.43">[02:53.43]</span>But Goethe wasn't really able to <span class="underline">establish</span> a <span class="underline">clear</span> connection between colors and emotions. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.22" data-time="179.62">[02:59.62]</span>Then in 1806, he received a letter from a <span class="underline">relatively</span> unknown German artist, a painter named Philipp Otto Runge.<span class="time" data-times="9.14" data-time="187.84">[03:07.84]</span>In the letter, Runge outlined his own color <span class="underline">theory</span>, <span class="underline">specifically</span> the connections he made between colors and emotions.<span class="time" data-times="10.25" data-time="196.98">[03:16.98]</span>And his ideas about what colors <span class="underline">symbolize</span>, about the emotions that different colors <span class="underline">inspire</span> were based on the colors red, yellow and blue. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="20.47" data-time="207.23">[03:27.23]</span>Runge's choice of red, yellow and blue had nothing to do with what we know from modern-day chromatics, it had to do with Runge's <span class="underline">complex</span> system of symbolism, his experience of nature, particularly with his experience of the <span class="underline">quality</span> of light at various times of the day, morning, noon and night. <span class="time" data-times="3.99" data-time="227.7">[03:47.70]</span>So each color had a <span class="underline">specific</span> <span class="underline">symbolic</span> value. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.63" data-time="231.69">[03:51.69]</span>Well, four years later, Goethe published a book entitled Color Lesson. <span class="time" data-times="6.85" data-time="237.32">[03:57.32]</span>In Color Lesson, Goethe COINCIDENTLY cites the same colors as <span class="underline">primary</span> colors. <span class="time" data-times="14.64" data-time="244.17">[04:04.17]</span>At this point, Goethe was already a well-known author, so he was easily able to popularize this idea of <span class="underline">primary</span> colors, and <span class="underline">specifically</span> the idea of red, yellow and blue as THE <span class="underline">primary</span> colors. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.05" data-time="258.81">[04:18.81]</span>Student: But he didn't <span class="underline">mention</span> Runge? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.83" data-time="261.86">[04:21.86]</span>Professor: Well, he did put Runge's letter in the book, at the end. <span class="time" data-times="4.94" data-time="266.69">[04:26.69]</span>But he added a disclaimer implying that Runge's letter didn't influence his work.<span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="271.63">[04:31.63]</span>Apparently, what Goethe was saying was that they just HAPPENED TO come up with the same <span class="underline">theory</span> at the same time. </p>
