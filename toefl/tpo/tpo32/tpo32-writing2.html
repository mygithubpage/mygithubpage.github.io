        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>   With the development of society, people nowadays are living in a relatively comprehensive mechanism, yet some tiny but important aspects, which may be overlooked, need to be ameliorated by discussion. Some people may argue that youth seems to have no influence on current society, however, in my opinion, youth should still be taken into consideration when determining the future of the society in the long time run. </p>
          <p>   Firstly, for certain tasks and projects, only young people are qualified, since they usually have high demand for creativity and ambitions. And old people tend to be slow in reaction and stick to convention. So they definitely do not fit for these tasks. For instance, when hiring an IT engineer for a new app project, a company usually prefer those under 35 year old, since young engineers are more willing to dedicate themselves to their jobs, with more innovations. In such cases, it is clearly that young people are the strong driving force of the working force in our society.</p>
          <p>   Additionally, young people directly guide future direction of our society. As youth possess creativity coming up with ideas, which sometimes seem to be ridiculous, it's entirely possible that one of those "weird idea" become breakthrough in a specific area. For instance, Steve Jobs, who has been described as the "Father of the Digital Revolution", once said he would like to invent a smartphone containing only one key. It was such a brave and creative idea and cannot be realized at that time.However, after continuously research, iPhone, which guide a new period of communication, came out.</p>
          <p>   Admittedly, older people are more experienced than youth, and are more possible to come up with more feasible and reasonable ideas when confronting difficulties. But youth represents creativity, bravery and confidence, which are all indispensable during the process of the development of the society.</p>
          <p>   Overall, youth represent the future of the society, and have potential influence to the society from the aspect of future development.  </p>
