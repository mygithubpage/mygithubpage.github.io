The <span class="highlight">rate</span> at which a site is colonized by plants depends on both the <span class="highlight">rate</span> at which <span class="highlight">individual</span> organisms (seeds, spores, <span class="highlight">immature</span> or <span class="highlight">mature</span> individuals) arrive at the site and their success at becoming established and surviving. Success in <span class="highlight">colonization</span> depends to a great <span class="highlight">extent</span> on there being a site <span class="highlight">available</span> for <span class="highlight">colonization</span> ï¿½ a safe site where <span class="highlight">disturbance</span> by fire or by cutting down of trees has either removed <span class="highlight">competing</span><span class="highlight">species</span> or reduced levels of competition and other <span class="highlight">negative</span> interactions to a <span class="highlight">level</span> at which the invading <span class="highlight">species</span> can become established. For a <span class="highlight">given</span><span class="highlight">rate</span> of <span class="highlight">invasion</span>, <span class="highlight">colonization</span> of a <span class="highlight">moist</span>, <span class="highlight">fertile</span> site is likely to be much more rapid than that of a dry, infertile site because of poor <span class="highlight">survival</span> on the <span class="highlight">latter</span>. A <span class="highlight">fertile</span>, plowed <span class="highlight">field</span> is rapidly invaded by a large <span class="highlight">variety</span> of weeds, whereas a neighboring <span class="highlight">construction</span> site from which the soil has been compacted or removed to <span class="highlight">expose</span> a <span class="highlight">coarse</span>, infertile parent <span class="highlight">material</span> may <span class="highlight">remain</span><span class="highlight"><span class="question2">virtually</span></span> free of <span class="highlight">vegetation</span> for many months or <span class="highlight">even</span> years <span class="question4">despite</span> receiving the same input of seeds as the plowed <span class="highlight">field</span>.</p><p>Both the <span class="highlight">rate</span> of <span class="highlight">invasion</span> and the <span class="highlight">rate</span> of <span class="highlight">extinction</span><span class="highlight">vary</span> greatly among different plant <span class="highlight">species</span>. <span class="question5"><span class="highlight">Pioneer</span><span class="highlight">species</span> - those that <span class="highlight">occur</span> only in the earliest stages of <span class="highlight">colonization</span> - <span class="highlight">tend</span> to have high rates of <span class="highlight">invasion</span> because they produce very large numbers of <span class="highlight">reproductive</span> propagules (seeds, spores, and so on) and because they have an <span class="highlight">efficient</span> means of <span class="highlight">dispersal</span> (<span class="highlight">normally</span>, wind</span>).</p><p>If colonizers produce short-lived <span class="highlight">reproductive</span> propagules, they must produce very large numbers unless they have an <span class="highlight">efficient</span> means of <span class="highlight">dispersal</span> to <span class="highlight">suitable</span> new habitats. Many plants <span class="highlight">depend</span> on wind for <span class="highlight">dispersal</span> and produce <span class="highlight">abundant</span> quantities of small, <span class="highlight">relatively</span> short-lived seeds to <span class="highlight">compensate</span> for the fact that wind is not always a <span class="highlight">reliable</span> means If reaching the <span class="highlight">appropriate</span> type of <span class="highlight">habitat</span>. <span class="highlight">Alternative</span> strategies have evolved in some plants, such as those that produce fewer but larger seeds that are dispersed to <span class="highlight">suitable</span> sites by birds or small mammals or those that produce long-lived seeds. Many forest plants <span class="highlight">seem</span> to <span class="highlight">exhibit</span><span class="question7">the <span class="highlight">latter</span><span class="highlight">adaptation</span></span>, and <span class="highlight">viable</span> seeds of <span class="highlight">pioneer</span><span class="highlight">species</span> can be found in large numbers on some forest floors. For example, as many as 1,125 <span class="highlight">viable</span> seeds per <span class="highlight">square</span> meter were found in a 100-year-old Douglas fir/western hemlock forest in coastal British Columbia. Nearly all the seeds that had germinated from this seed bank were from <span class="highlight">pioneer</span><span class="highlight">species</span>. The rapid <span class="highlight">colonization</span> of such sites after <span class="highlight">disturbance</span> is undoubtedly in part a <span class="highlight">reflection</span> of the large seed <span class="highlight">band</span> on the forest floor.</p><p>An <span class="highlight">adaptation</span> that is well developed in colonizing <span class="highlight">species</span> is a high <span class="highlight">degree</span> of <span class="highlight">variation</span> in germination (the beginning of a seed's growth). Seeds of a <span class="highlight">given</span><span class="highlight">species</span><span class="highlight">exhibit</span> a wide <span class="highlight">range</span> of germination dates, increasing the probability that at <span class="highlight">least</span> some of the seeds will <span class="highlight">germinate</span> during a period of <span class="highlight">favorable</span><span class="highlight">environmental</span> conditions. This is particularly important for <span class="highlight">species</span> that <span class="highlight">colonize</span> an environment where there is no existing <span class="highlight">vegetation</span> to <span class="highlight">ameliorate</span><span class="highlight">climatic</span> extremes and in which there may be great <span class="highlight">climatic</span><span class="highlight">diversity</span>.</p><p><span class="highlight">Species</span><span class="highlight">succession</span> in plant communities, i.e., the <span class="highlight">temporal</span><span class="highlight">sequence</span> of <span class="highlight">appearance</span> and disappearance of <span class="highlight">species</span> is dependent on events occurring at different stages in the life <span class="highlight">history</span> of a <span class="highlight">species</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span><span class="highlight">Variation</span> in rates of <span class="highlight">invasion</span> and growth plays an important role in determining patterns of <span class="highlight">succession</span>, especially secondary <span class="highlight">succession</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>The <span class="highlight">species</span> that are first to <span class="highlight">colonize</span> a site are those that produce <span class="highlight"><span class="question11">abundant</span></span> seed that is distributed successfully to new sites. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>Such <span class="highlight">species</span> generally grow rapidly and quickly <span class="highlight">dominate</span> new sites, excluding other <span class="highlight">species</span> with <span class="highlight">lower</span><span class="highlight">invasion</span> and growth rates. The first <span class="highlight">community</span> that occupies a disturbed area <span class="highlight">therefore</span> may be composed of specie with the highest <span class="highlight">rate</span> of <span class="highlight">invasion</span>, whereas the <span class="highlight">community</span> of the <span class="highlight">subsequent</span><span class="highlight">stage</span> may <span class="highlight">consist</span> or plants with <span class="highlight">similar</span><span class="highlight">survival</span> rates but <span class="highlight">lower</span><span class="highlight">invasion</span> rates. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 1, how does disturbance of a site influence its colonization by a plant species?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Disturbance reduces or eliminates competition by other species.</p><p>B. Disturbance increases negative interactions with other organisms on the site.</p><p>C. Disturbance prevents a plant species from colonizing a new site.</p><p>D. Disturbance reduces the fertility of a site.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>Target the colonization depends to a great extent on there being a site available for colonization ï¿½ a safe site where disturbance is by fire or by cutting down of trees with either keyword "disturbance". It is said that the intervention through fire and felling either eliminates the competitor or reduces the intensity of the competition. This echoes the emotions in the A option. The negative negative interactions of the B option are contrary to the original reduced other negative interations, so they are wrong; C is negative; D is not mentioned in the original.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question2">virtually</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. almost totally</p><p>B. unusually</p><p>C. consistently</p><p>D. unnaturally</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" A"><p>Virtually: Actually; Almost, almost totally (corresponding to almost all) corresponding to the A option: A fertile, plowed field is rapidly invaded by a large variety of weeds, but a neighboring construction site from which the soil has been compacted or removed to The expose a coarse, infertile parent materialmaysubstantial free of vegetation for many months or even years <span class="question4">despite</span> receiving the same input of seedsas the plowed field. The main logic of this sentence is the turning point, the content before and after the formation of opposition, namely: is invaded by a large variety of weeds and remain <span class="question2">virtually</span> free of vegetation. Then, we can use this relationship to speculate. The B option is unusually (unusually), the C option is consistently (consistently), and the unnaturally (naturally) alternative of the D option is obviously inappropriate. Only the A option is most appropriate, and the content can form a very good transition.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the author mention a plowed field and a construction site in the passage?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To argue that sites that have been affected by human activity tend to be colonized slowly</p><p>B. To illustrate the kind of sites that may be invaded by weeds</p><p>C. To contrast sites in terms of their suitability for colonization</p><p>D. To explain that exposing or compacting the soil results in successful colonization</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Using the plowed field and a construction site to locate the last word of the whole paragraph, the target sentence supported by this detail is either in front of it 1.2 sentences or it is the main sentence of the whole paragraph. Obviously, the target sentence it highlights is the previous sentence, combining the two choices: For a given rate of invasion, colonization of a moist, fertile site is likely to be much more rapid than that of a dry, Infertile site because of poor survival on the latter. The content of this sentence is just that the invasion of fertile land is much faster than those of dry, infertile land. This echoes the C option.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question4">despite</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. without</p><p>B. almost never</p><p>C. even though</p><p>D. perhaps</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" C"><p>Despite though,; corresponds even though though/even. A fertile, plowed field is rapidly invaded by a large variety of weeds, when a neighboring construction site from which the soil has been compacted or removed to expose a coarse, infertile parent material may remain <span class="question2">virtually</span> free of vegetation for many months or even The main logic of this sentence is the conversion of whereas of seeds as the plowed field. Whereas the main turning point is the turning of the content before and after the transition. Then the argument must not be the contradiction of the opposite relationship. So you can try to substitute 4 options. Which one is the turning point relationship is established and semantically coherent. Only the "C" option is the most appropriate, meaning "<span class="question4">despite</span> the fact that as many seeds have been received, there may be no plants on dry land that is not fertile" and the status of the fertile land before the turning point is in stark opposition.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The seeds of pioneer species are usually carried by the wind to fertile sites, where they reproduce very efficiently.</p><p>B. Pioneer species are successful invaders because they produce lots of seeds that are dispersed effectively.</p><p>C. Pioneer species produce their largest numbers of propagules during the earliest stages of their colonization.</p><p>D. Pioneer species reproduce very quickly and efficiently because they produce very large number of seeds.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The logical structure of the original sentence, the most important logic is causal logic, and there is a parallel logic in the reason statement, which matches the core content and options of these two logics. The original sentence underscores two reasons for the rapid invasion of Pioneer species. One is the ability to produce a large number of reproducible seeds, and the other is to have an effective route of transmission. The original sentence is not related to the fertile sites, A is wrong; C does not mention the reproduction of seeds. Force; D did not mention the route of transmission. Only B satisfies the conditions of the original sentence.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What can be inferred from paragraph 3 about the reason that large seeds are dispersed by birds or small animals rather than by wind?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Large seeds are easier for birds and animals to see than are the small seeds dispersed by the wind.</p><p>B. Large seeds are too heavy for the wind to disperse.</p><p>C. Large seeds cannot be eaten by birds and animals.</p><p>D. Large seeds are short-lived and thus require a more efficient means of dispersal than small seeds do.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The use of large seeds can be used to locate the third sentence of the original text. However, the third sentence is not sufficient for speculation. The second sentence of the seed propagation mode needs to be discussed in conjunction with the two sentences. :Many plants depend on wind for dispersal and produce abundant quantities of small, relatively short-lived seeds to compensate for the fact that wind is not always a reliable means of reaching the appropriate type of habitat. Alternative strategies have evolved in some plants, such The as those that produces fewer but larger seeds that are dispersed to suitable sites by birds or small mammals or those that produce long-lived seeds. The main contents of these two sentences are: small seeds are usually spread by wind, large seeds are made of birds and animals Realize the spread. In saying that the wind is the medium of communication, mentioning its characteristics is not reliable. Later, it is said that the Big Seeds rely on other means to spread. The implication is that the big seeds are too heavy and the wind is difficult to spread. Then echo the contents of option B.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The phrase "<span class="highlight">the latter adaptation</span>" in the passage refers to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. producing fewer seeds</p><p>B. producing larger seeds</p><p>C. dispersal by birds and small mammals</p><p>D. producing long-lived seeds</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="the latter adaptation D"><p>The latter adaptation, the latter adaptability, because it is the definite article of the modification, it is represented in the previous article. In the previous sentence, there were two ways to discuss alternative strategies. One is that the seeds that produce less, but bigger, can be spread to the right places by birds or other small mammals; the second is The production paragraph begins with short-lived seeds, so the latter adaptability refers to long-lived seeds. Corresponds to the D option.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">viable</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. able to survive</p><p>B. individual</p><p>C. large</p><p>D. remaining</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>Viable: able to survive; able to develop on their own, corresponding to the A option's ability to survive to survive. Corresponding to the original: For example, as many as 1,125 viable seeds per square meter were found in a 100-year-old Douglas fir/western hemlock forest in coastal British Columbia. The word Viable is commonly understood by students as "feasible. "It is possible to speculate through this meaning. Even if there are other meanings, it will not be too different. And obvious B option individual (personal), C option of large (large), D option of remaining (remaining) obvious and "feasible" this layer means nothing. Only the A option is the most appropriate. The original text roughly stated that there are as many seeds as there are surviving seeds found in this forest.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The example of the 100-year-old Douglas fir/western hemlock forest in paragraph to illustrates which of the following ideas?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It is uncommon for older seed to germinate.</p><p>B. Pioneer species tend to prefer forest floors for colonization purposes.</p><p>C. Long-lived seeds of pioneer species can successfully germinate over long periods of time.</p><p>D. Coastal British Columbia is particularly suited for pioneer species to develop.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The first sentence of this example is a perspective sentence. The example is to illustrate the point of view. Many forest plants seem to exhibit the latter adaptation, and <span class="question8">viable</span> seeds of pioneer species can be found in large numbers on some forest floors. The main content is that long-lived seeds thrive on the forest floor. And C options echo.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, how do plants manage to germinate in areas with great climatic diversity and climatic extremes?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. By producing seeds only during favorable climatic conditions</p><p>B. By generating large numbers of seeds</p><p>C. By colonizing only those areas where other plants have survived</p><p>D. By producing seeds that have a wide range of germination dates</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>Climatic diversity is used to locate the last sentence of this paragraph, but this sentence only summarizes and does not describe how these plants are germinate, so we need to read the previous text, and the answer appears in the second sentence of the paragraph: The Seeds of a given species exhibit a wide range of germination dates, increasing the probability that at least some of the seeds will germinate during a period of selection environmental conditions. The main emphasis here is that these seeds have a wide range of germination periods, and the D option echo. The only option for the A option is too absolute, the original does not say so; the B option is not a reason for survival in extreme climates, and the answer is not asked; the C option is not mentioned in the original.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">abundant</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. new</p><p>B. improved</p><p>C. suitable</p><p>D. plentiful</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>Abundant: plentiful (rich, many) corresponding to D options.</p><p>The corresponding original: The species that are first to colonize a site are those that produce abundant seed that is distributed successfully to new sites. These seeds will be successfully distributed in new places. Again in context, the abundant must be related to the seed's ability to successfully migrate to another location, so only D is the most appropriate of these options.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 5, which of the following determines the sequence in which plant species will colonize a site?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The extent of growth of a species on a prior site before it begins to colonize a secondary site</p><p>B. The differences in invasion and growth rates across species</p><p>C. The degree of fertility of a site</p><p>D. The kind of disturbance that the site has undergone</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Use the sequence to locate the first sentence of the paragraph. The first sentence is too general and needs to continue to look down. The second sentence of this paragraph points out the elements that determine the sequence:</p><p>Variation in rates of invasion and growth plays an important role in determining patterns of succession, especially secondary succession. The species that are first to colonize a site are those that produce abundant seed that is distributed successfully to new sites. It is an important role of Variation in rates of invasion and growth, and it corresponds to Option B. There is no mention of ACD options.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>They require relatively little protection or nutrients..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The C insert sentence has the pronoun which they refer to in its previous article. And from the content of the insertion sentence, they refer to species. And in front of the C point, the first species is discussed. It is said that these species will produce a large number of seeds and they will be successfully distributed in new places. It is right behind. Insert the sentence to continue to supplement the description of the characteristics of these species, not less protection and nutrition.
