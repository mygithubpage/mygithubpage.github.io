            <b>Plant Colonization</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>
            <span class="underline">Colonization</span> is one way in which plants can change the <span class="underline">ecology</span> of a site. <span class="underline">Colonization</span> is a <span class="underline">process</span> with two components: <span class="underline">invasion</span> and <span class="underline">survival</span>. The <span class="underline">rate</span> at which a site is colonized by plants depends on both the <span class="underline">rate</span> at which <span class="underline">individual</span> organisms (seeds, spores, <span class="underline">immature</span> or <span class="underline">mature</span> individuals) arrive at the site and their success at becoming established and surviving. Success in <span class="underline">colonization</span> depends to a great <span class="underline">extent</span> on there being a site <span class="underline">available</span> for <span class="underline">colonization</span> – a safe site where <span class="underline">disturbance</span> by fire or by cutting down of trees has either removed <span class="underline">competing</span> <span class="underline">species</span> or reduced levels of competition and other <span class="underline">negative</span> interactions to a <span class="underline">level</span> at which the invading <span class="underline">species</span> can become established. For a <span class="underline">given</span> <span class="underline">rate</span> of <span class="underline">invasion</span>, <span class="underline">colonization</span> of a <span class="underline">moist</span>, <span class="underline">fertile</span> site is likely to be much more rapid than that of a dry, infertile site because of poor <span class="underline">survival</span> on the <span class="underline">latter</span>. A <span class="underline">fertile</span>, plowed <span class="underline">field</span> is rapidly invaded by a large <span class="underline">variety</span> of weeds, whereas a neighboring <span class="underline">construction</span> site from which the soil has been compacted or removed to <span class="underline">expose</span> a <span class="underline">coarse</span>, infertile parent <span class="underline">material</span> may <span class="underline">remain</span> <span class="underline">virtually</span> free of <span class="underline">vegetation</span> for many months or <span class="underline">even</span> years despite receiving the same input of seeds as the plowed <span class="underline">field</span>.</p>
          <p>Both the <span class="underline">rate</span> of <span class="underline">invasion</span> and the <span class="underline">rate</span> of <span class="underline">extinction</span> <span class="underline">vary</span> greatly among different plant <span class="underline">species</span>. <span class="underline">Pioneer</span> <span class="underline">species</span> - those that <span class="underline">occur</span> only in the earliest stages of <span class="underline">colonization</span> - <span class="underline">tend</span> to have high rates of <span class="underline">invasion</span> because they produce very large numbers of <span class="underline">reproductive</span> propagules (seeds, spores, and so on) and because they have an <span class="underline">efficient</span> means of <span class="underline">dispersal</span> (<span class="underline">normally</span>, wind).</p>
          <p>If colonizers produce short-lived <span class="underline">reproductive</span> propagules, they must produce very large numbers unless they have an <span class="underline">efficient</span> means of <span class="underline">dispersal</span> to <span class="underline">suitable</span> new habitats. Many plants <span class="underline">depend</span> on wind for <span class="underline">dispersal</span> and produce <span class="underline">abundant</span> quantities of small, <span class="underline">relatively</span> short-lived seeds to <span class="underline">compensate</span> for the fact that wind is not always a <span class="underline">reliable</span> means If reaching the <span class="underline">appropriate</span> type of <span class="underline">habitat</span>. <span class="underline">Alternative</span> strategies have evolved in some plants, such as those that produce fewer but larger seeds that are dispersed to <span class="underline">suitable</span> sites by birds or small mammals or those that produce long-lived seeds. Many forest plants <span class="underline">seem</span> to <span class="underline">exhibit</span> the <span class="underline">latter</span> <span class="underline">adaptation</span>, and <span class="underline">viable</span> seeds of <span class="underline">pioneer</span> <span class="underline">species</span> can be found in large numbers on some forest floors. For example, as many as 1,125 <span class="underline">viable</span> seeds per <span class="underline">square</span> meter were found in a 100-year-old Douglas fir/western hemlock forest in coastal British Columbia. Nearly all the seeds that had germinated from this seed bank were from <span class="underline">pioneer</span> <span class="underline">species</span>. The rapid <span class="underline">colonization</span> of such sites after <span class="underline">disturbance</span> is undoubtedly in part a <span class="underline">reflection</span> of the large seed <span class="underline">band</span> on the forest floor.</p>
          <p>An <span class="underline">adaptation</span> that is well developed in colonizing <span class="underline">species</span> is a high <span class="underline">degree</span> of <span class="underline">variation</span> in germination (the beginning of a seed's growth). Seeds of a <span class="underline">given</span> <span class="underline">species</span> <span class="underline">exhibit</span> a wide <span class="underline">range</span> of germination dates, increasing the probability that at <span class="underline">least</span> some of the seeds will <span class="underline">germinate</span> during a period of <span class="underline">favorable</span> <span class="underline">environmental</span> conditions. This is particularly important for <span class="underline">species</span> that <span class="underline">colonize</span> an environment where there is no existing <span class="underline">vegetation</span> to <span class="underline">ameliorate</span> <span class="underline">climatic</span> extremes and in which there may be great <span class="underline">climatic</span> <span class="underline">diversity</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="underline">Species</span>
            <span class="underline">succession</span> in plant communities, i.e., the <span class="underline">temporal</span> <span class="underline">sequence</span> of <span class="underline">appearance</span> and disappearance of <span class="underline">species</span> is dependent on events occurring at different stages in the life <span class="underline">history</span> of a <span class="underline">species</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> <span class="underline">Variation</span> in rates of <span class="underline">invasion</span> and growth plays an important role in determining patterns of <span class="underline">succession</span>, especially secondary <span class="underline">succession</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>The <span class="underline">species</span> that are first to <span class="underline">colonize</span> a site are those that produce <span class="underline">abundant</span> seed that is distributed successfully to new sites. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>Such <span class="underline">species</span> generally grow rapidly and quickly <span class="underline">dominate</span> new sites, excluding other <span class="underline">species</span> with <span class="underline">lower</span> <span class="underline">invasion</span> and growth rates. The first <span class="underline">community</span> that occupies a disturbed area <span class="underline">therefore</span> may be composed of specie with the highest <span class="underline">rate</span> of <span class="underline">invasion</span>, whereas the <span class="underline">community</span> of the <span class="underline">subsequent</span> <span class="underline">stage</span> may <span class="underline">consist</span> or plants with <span class="underline">similar</span> <span class="underline">survival</span> rates but <span class="underline">lower</span> <span class="underline">invasion</span> rates. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p>
