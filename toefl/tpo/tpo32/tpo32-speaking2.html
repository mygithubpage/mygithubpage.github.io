          <p>From my perspective, it's definitely a good idea since it's a good way to get kids motivated. I used to be paid for washing the dishes by my parents. They didn't pay me much though, I became really looking forward to doing the housework. Thus, these "little service tips" really pushed me to get involved in trivial tasks. Also, kids would be given the chances to manage their own savings. For me, I was pretty excited about the fact that I do own a certain amount of money and learned to save it for different things: whether I would use it to make small purchases or save the money in bank.</p>
