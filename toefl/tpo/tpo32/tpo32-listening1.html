            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.18" data-time="2">[00:02.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to a <span class="underline">conversation</span> between a student and a <span class="underline">bookstore</span> employee.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.34" data-time="8.18">[00:08.18]</span>Employee: Hi. Can I help you?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.07" data-time="10.52">[00:10.52]</span>Student: Yeah. I need to sell back a textbook. <span class="time" data-times="2.03" data-time="13.59">[00:13.59]</span>Are you the person I speak to about that?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.32" data-time="15.62">[00:15.62]</span>Employee: I am. But we can't buy textbooks back just yet, because the <span class="underline">bookstore</span>'s buyback period isn't until next Thursday.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.77" data-time="22.94">[00:22.94]</span>Student: I thought it started this week.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.42" data-time="24.71">[00:24.71]</span>Employee: It is only in the last week of the <span class="underline">semester</span> after classes are over.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.32" data-time="28.13">[00:28.13]</span>Student: Oh. Well, can you tell me if this book will be on the buyback <span class="underline">list</span>?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="0.89" data-time="31.45">[00:31.45]</span>Employee: I can look. <span class="time" data-times="1.88" data-time="32.34">[00:32.34]</span>But we are still putting the <span class="underline">list</span> together.<span class="time" data-times="7.76" data-time="34.22">[00:34.22]</span> Professors have to tell us what books they'll <span class="underline">definitely</span> need again next <span class="underline">semester</span>, and the <span class="underline">deadline</span> for them to let us know isn't for a <span class="underline">couple</span> of days. <span class="time" data-times="3.24" data-time="41.98">[00:41.98]</span>So the <span class="underline">list</span> I have here is not really complete. <span class="time" data-times="2.14" data-time="45.22">[00:45.22]</span>Um...what class was the book for?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.97" data-time="47.36">[00:47.36]</span>Student: Intro to economics, with Professor Murphy.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.43" data-time="51.33">[00:51.33]</span>Employee: Professor Murphy. OK. I <span class="underline">checked</span> earlier and I know she hasn't gotten back to us on that class yet. <span class="time" data-times="3.16" data-time="57.76">[00:57.76]</span>So we don't know if she'll use the same book next time. <span class="time" data-times="5.07" data-time="60.92">[01:00.92]</span>Usually if an updated edition of a textbook is <span class="underline">available</span>, professors will go for that one.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.49" data-time="65.99">[01:05.99]</span>Student: Um...so if this book doesn't end up on the buyback <span class="underline">list</span>, what can I do?<span class="time" data-times="3.51" data-time="70.48">[01:10.48]</span> I spent over a hundred dollars for it, and I want to get something back.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9" data-time="73.99">[01:13.99]</span>Employee: Well, if a professor didn't <span class="underline">assign</span> it for a class here, we could buy back for a whole seller who would <span class="underline">distribute</span> it for sale at another university <span class="underline">bookstore</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="0.63000000000001" data-time="82.99">[01:22.99]</span>Student: OK.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.48" data-time="83.62">[01:23.62]</span>Employee: Anyway...if Professor Murphy does put it on the <span class="underline">list</span>, it is important that you come in as early as possible next Thursday. <span class="time" data-times="2.79" data-time="90.1">[01:30.10]</span>There's only a limited number of books we would buy back.<span class="time" data-times="4.16" data-time="92.89">[01:32.89]</span> Once we get the number of books we need for next <span class="underline">semester</span>, we would stop buying them.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.93" data-time="97.05">[01:37.05]</span>Student: OK. So how much money will I get for the book?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.83" data-time="99.98">[01:39.98]</span>Employee: Well, if it's on the buyback <span class="underline">list</span>, we'll <span class="underline">pay</span> fifty percent of what the new price was.<span class="time" data-times="5.06" data-time="104.81">[01:44.81]</span> But that also depends on what condition the book is in, so it needs to be cleaned up as much as possible.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="0.82" data-time="109.87">[01:49.87]</span>Student: Cleaned up?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.77" data-time="110.69">[01:50.69]</span>Employee: Because used books show <span class="underline">wear</span> and tear, you know, water stains, <span class="underline">scruffy</span> covers, yellow highlighting...<span class="time" data-times="3.5" data-time="116.46">[01:56.46]</span>You really need to make sure there are no pencil marks on the book. <span class="time" data-times="3.42" data-time="119.96">[01:59.96]</span>The price you can get for a text depends on the <span class="underline">shape</span> it's in.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.07" data-time="123.38">[02:03.38]</span>Student: You mean I have to erase all the pencil marks?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.04" data-time="126.45">[02:06.45]</span>Employee: If you want the best price for it...</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.24" data-time="128.49">[02:08.49]</span>Student: And what if you decide the book is too beat-up and don't buy it back?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.49" data-time="131.73">[02:11.73]</span>Employee: That does happen. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="133.22">[02:13.22]</span>Hmm...well, one more thing you can try is to place an ad in the student newspaper to see if you can sell it directly to another student.</p>
