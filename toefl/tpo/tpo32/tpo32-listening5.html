a lecture in an earth science class. <span class="time" data-times="5.84" data-time="7.1">[00:07.10]</span>The professor is discussing an area of the United States called the <span class="highlight">Copper</span><span class="highlight">Basin</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.27" data-time="12.94">[00:12.94]</span>Professor: Now, you may not have heard of the <span class="highlight">Copper</span><span class="highlight">Basin</span>.<span class="time" data-times="4.48" data-time="17.21">[00:17.21]</span>It's in the Eastern United States, in the Tennessee River <span class="highlight">Valley</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.85" data-time="21.69">[00:21.69]</span>It got its name because settlers discovered <span class="highlight">copper</span> there in 1843. <span class="time" data-times="6.14" data-time="26.54">[00:26.54]</span>And soon afterwards, it supported one of the largest metal <span class="highlight">mining</span> operations in America. <span class="time" data-times="5.78" data-time="32.68">[00:32.68]</span>At one time, four <span class="highlight">mining</span> companies employed 2500 workers in the <span class="highlight">Copper</span><span class="highlight">Basin</span>.<span class="time" data-times="4.04" data-time="38.46">[00:38.46]</span>For that time period, it was a huge operation.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.58" data-time="42.5">[00:42.50]</span>Well, this <span class="highlight">mining</span> operation turned the <span class="highlight">Copper</span><span class="highlight">Basin</span> into a <span class="highlight">desert</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.24" data-time="48.08">[00:48.08]</span>In the 1840s, when <span class="highlight">mining</span> operations started, it was a <span class="highlight">dense</span> green forest. <span class="time" data-times="5.53" data-time="54.32">[00:54.32]</span>But in the 1940s, 100 years later, it was as <span class="highlight">barren</span> as the moon.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="9.67" data-time="59.85">[00:59.85]</span>Efforts to reclaim the land and <span class="highlight">restore</span> the <span class="highlight">basin</span> to the <span class="highlight">fertile</span><span class="highlight">valley</span> it once was...well, actually, those efforts are still <span class="highlight">ongoing</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3" data-time="69.52">[01:09.52]</span>It's been a long and <span class="highlight">tedious</span><span class="highlight">process</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.1" data-time="72.52">[01:12.52]</span>In fact, it was many years before any results were seen. <span class="time" data-times="4.15" data-time="76.62">[01:16.62]</span><span class="highlight">Copper</span><span class="highlight">mining</span> had gone on there for more than 90 years! <span class="time" data-times="2.56" data-time="80.77">[01:20.77]</span>The damage couldn't be reversed <span class="highlight">overnight</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="12.46" data-time="83.33">[01:23.33]</span>Although I should <span class="highlight">mention</span> that by 1996, the water in one of the rivers flowing <span class="highlight">through</span> the <span class="highlight">basin</span> was clean enough that it was the site of the Olympic white water kayaking competition. <span class="time" data-times="4.03" data-time="95.79">[01:35.79]</span>And that river is still used now for <span class="highlight">recreation</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.53" data-time="99.82">[01:39.82]</span>But...anyway...let's <span class="highlight">analyze</span> the problem.<span class="time" data-times="4.69" data-time="104.35">[01:44.35]</span> It wasn't the <span class="highlight">mining</span> itself that caused such <span class="highlight">massive</span><span class="highlight">destruction</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.4" data-time="109.04">[01:49.04]</span>It was what happened after the <span class="highlight">copper</span><span class="highlight">ore</span> was extracted from the mines. <span class="time" data-times="3.33" data-time="113.44">[01:53.44]</span>It was a <span class="highlight">process</span> called <span class="highlight">heap</span> roasting.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.5" data-time="116.77">[01:56.77]</span><span class="highlight">Copper</span><span class="highlight">ore</span> contains <span class="highlight">sulfur</span>.<span class="time" data-times="7.23" data-time="120.27">[02:00.27]</span> And <span class="highlight">heap</span> roasting was a way to burn away the <span class="highlight">sulfur</span> in the <span class="highlight">copper</span>, so they'd be left with something closer to <span class="highlight">pure</span><span class="highlight">copper</span>. <span class="time" data-times="10.56" data-time="127.5">[02:07.50]</span>Well, in the <span class="highlight">process</span>, large vats of <span class="highlight">raw</span><span class="highlight">copper</span><span class="highlight">ore</span> are burned slowly, for two or three months actually, to <span class="highlight">lower</span> the <span class="highlight">sulfur</span><span class="highlight">content</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.65" data-time="138.06">[02:18.06]</span>And this burning, well...let's look at the results.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.83" data-time="142.71">[02:22.71]</span>First, the mines were <span class="highlight">fairly</span><span class="highlight">remote</span>, so there was no way to bring <span class="highlight">coal</span> or other <span class="highlight">fuel</span> to keep the fires going. <span class="time" data-times="3.34" data-time="149.54">[02:29.54]</span>So they cut down <span class="highlight">local</span> trees for <span class="highlight">fuel</span>.<span class="time" data-times="4.48" data-time="152.88">[02:32.88]</span> And like I said, the fires burned for months. <span class="time" data-times="3.44" data-time="157.36">[02:37.36]</span>Uh...that's a lot of fires and a lot of trees. <span class="time" data-times="3.9" data-time="160.8">[02:40.80]</span>Deforestation was occurring at a rapid <span class="highlight">rate</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.03" data-time="164.7">[02:44.70]</span>And it was <span class="highlight">accelerated</span> by the smoke from the burning <span class="highlight">ore</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.08" data-time="167.73">[02:47.73]</span>Big clouds of sulfuric smoke, which was <span class="highlight">toxic</span> to the trees, formed over the areas. <span class="time" data-times="4.55" data-time="174.81">[02:54.81]</span>Trees that hadn't been cut for <span class="highlight">fuel</span> were killed by the fumes.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.48" data-time="179.36">[02:59.36]</span>The <span class="highlight">sulfur</span> also mixed with the <span class="highlight">air</span> and created <span class="highlight">sulfur</span><span class="highlight">dioxide</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.53" data-time="184.84">[03:04.84]</span>And the <span class="highlight">sulfur</span><span class="highlight">dioxide</span> settled in the clouds fell to the land in droplets of rain and sank into the soil. <span class="time" data-times="3.97" data-time="192.37">[03:12.37]</span>This is what we now call <span class="highlight">acid</span> rain. <span class="time" data-times="2.2" data-time="196.34">[03:16.34]</span>You've probably heard of it.<span class="time" data-times="2.93" data-time="198.54">[03:18.54]</span> But no one used the <span class="highlight">term</span> back then.<span class="time" data-times="5.15" data-time="201.47">[03:21.47]</span>Anyway...the <span class="highlight">acid</span> rain created highly <span class="highlight">acidic</span> soil.<span class="time" data-times="7.32" data-time="206.62">[03:26.62]</span> Well, soon the soil became so <span class="highlight">acidic</span> that nothing could grow, nothing at all. <span class="time" data-times="3.63" data-time="213.94">[03:33.94]</span>Vegetation and wild life disappeared.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5" data-time="217.57">[03:37.57]</span>And it wasn't just the land and the <span class="highlight">air</span>, it was the water too. <span class="time" data-times="2.68" data-time="222.57">[03:42.57]</span>What do you think happen to the rivers? <span class="time" data-times="5.84" data-time="225.25">[03:45.25]</span>Well, there are no trees to <span class="highlight">absorb</span> the rain, and there was a lot of rain! <span class="time" data-times="5.03" data-time="231.09">[03:51.09]</span>So the rain eroded the soil and swept it into the rivers. <span class="time" data-times="4.56" data-time="236.12">[03:56.12]</span>This is called silting, when soil particles are washed into the rivers.<span class="time" data-times="3.63" data-time="240.68">[04:00.68]</span> And the silting continued at an alarming <span class="highlight">rate</span>.<span class="time" data-times="11.19" data-time="244.31">[04:04.31]</span>But this was <span class="highlight">toxic</span> soil and <span class="highlight">toxic</span><span class="highlight">runoff</span>, the <span class="highlight">acid</span> and metals in the soil made the once <span class="highlight">clear</span> rivers flow bright orange.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="11.9" data-time="255.5">[04:15.50]</span>So it was really that one step in the <span class="highlight">process</span> of producing <span class="highlight">copper</span>...the problems just built up and up until there was a <span class="highlight">desert</span> where a beautiful forest used to be. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="267.4">[04:27.40]</span>OK. Now let's look at reforestation and land <span class="highlight">reclamation</span> efforts. </p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the lecture mainly about?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The environmental effects of heap roasting.</p><p>B. The reforestation efforts in the Copper Basin.</p><p>C. The process of mining and producing copper.</p><p>D. Damages caused during an attempt to clean up industrial waste.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>From the very beginning, the professor introduced the important topic of the lecture to the Copper Basin. Then he introduced some sources of the Copper Basin. Then use the transition word BUT to elicit the theme of this lecture.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the professor's opinion about the effort to reclaim the land in the Copper Basin?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The techniques and materials used for the cleanup were probably outdated.</p><p>B. Some attempts to clean up the Copper Basin have made the problems worse.</p><p>C. It is not surprising that cleaning up the area has been extremely difficult.</p><p>D. The cleanup has taken longer than necessary.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The professor began using well as a modal particle to explain his point of view. The copper mine has been in operation for more than 90 years and the damage caused cannot be reversed overnight.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor imply when he mentions an Olympic whitewater kayaking competition?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. That many people are unaware of the environmental problems in the Copper Basin.</p><p>B. That a successful reclamation of the Copper Basin may be possible.</p><p>C. That some activities in the Copper Basin must go on despite the pollution.</p><p>D. That the Olympic competition should have been held in a different location.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The professor mentioned that this Copper Basin is difficult to repair, and then he used the word "though" to describe the change of attitude. He mentioned that there is very clean water that can be used as a kayak rafting game. The intention is to express this place or save. of.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the lecture, why was heap roasting used in the producing of copper?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To make copper ore easier to transport.</p><p>B. To make copper ore safe for workers to handle.</p><p>C. To transform copper ore into fuel.</p><p>D. To remove impurities from copper ore.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>From the lecture, we can see that this process removes impurities from copper.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>What factors led to the disappearance of trees in the Copper Basin? [Choose two answers].</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Mines were dug under areas where trees were growing.</p><p>B. Loose soil led to trees being washed into the rivers.</p><p>C. Trees growing near the mines were cut and used as fuel.</p><p>D. Clouds of sulfur smoke killed trees in the area.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="CD"><p>Well elicited the main sentence, followed by points of argument. In the first point of the argument, the tree was cut down for fuel, and the smoke was toxic to the trees.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What resulted from the lack of trees near the copper-mining operation?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It became difficult to provide housing for all the workers.</p><p>B. Rivers became filled with toxic soil.</p><p>C. Coal and other fuel had to be transported into the area.</p><p>D. The heap-roasting process had to be completed far from the mines.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Original source: And it wasn't just the land and the air, it was the water too. What do you think happen to the rivers? Well, there are no trees to absorb the rain, and there was a lot of rain! So The rain eroded the soil and swept it into the rivers. And the silting continued at an alarming rate. But this was toxic soil and toxic runoff, the acid and metals in the soil made the once clear rivers flow bright orange. There are no trees to absorb the rain, and a lot of rainfall erodes the soil and brings the soil into the river. The toxic soil material that was eventually brought into the river, including the acids and metals in the soil, turned the originally clean river into orange. Therefore, the B option is correct, and the lack of trees around the copper operation site will eventually result in the river being filled with toxic soil.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
