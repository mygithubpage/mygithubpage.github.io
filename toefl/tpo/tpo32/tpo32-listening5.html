              <span class="time" data-times="7.1" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in an earth science class. <span class="time" data-times="5.84" data-time="7.1">[00:07.10]</span>The professor is discussing an area of the United States called the <span class="underline">Copper</span> <span class="underline">Basin</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.27" data-time="12.94">[00:12.94]</span>Professor: Now, you may not have heard of the <span class="underline">Copper</span> <span class="underline">Basin</span>.<span class="time" data-times="4.48" data-time="17.21">[00:17.21]</span>It's in the Eastern United States, in the Tennessee River <span class="underline">Valley</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.85" data-time="21.69">[00:21.69]</span>It got its name because settlers discovered <span class="underline">copper</span> there in 1843. <span class="time" data-times="6.14" data-time="26.54">[00:26.54]</span>And soon afterwards, it supported one of the largest metal <span class="underline">mining</span> operations in America. <span class="time" data-times="5.78" data-time="32.68">[00:32.68]</span>At one time, four <span class="underline">mining</span> companies employed 2500 workers in the <span class="underline">Copper</span> <span class="underline">Basin</span>.<span class="time" data-times="4.04" data-time="38.46">[00:38.46]</span>For that time period, it was a huge operation.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.58" data-time="42.5">[00:42.50]</span>Well, this <span class="underline">mining</span> operation turned the <span class="underline">Copper</span> <span class="underline">Basin</span> into a <span class="underline">desert</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.24" data-time="48.08">[00:48.08]</span>In the 1840s, when <span class="underline">mining</span> operations started, it was a <span class="underline"><span class="underline">dense</span></span> green forest. <span class="time" data-times="5.53" data-time="54.32">[00:54.32]</span>But in the 1940s, 100 years later, it was as <span class="underline">barren</span> as the moon.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.67" data-time="59.85">[00:59.85]</span>Efforts to reclaim the land and <span class="underline">restore</span> the <span class="underline">basin</span> to the <span class="underline">fertile</span> <span class="underline">valley</span> it once was...well, actually, those efforts are still <span class="underline">ongoing</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3" data-time="69.52">[01:09.52]</span>It's been a long and <span class="underline">tedious</span> <span class="underline">process</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.1" data-time="72.52">[01:12.52]</span>In fact, it was many years before any results were seen. <span class="time" data-times="4.15" data-time="76.62">[01:16.62]</span> <span class="underline">Copper</span> <span class="underline">mining</span> had gone on there for more than 90 years! <span class="time" data-times="2.56" data-time="80.77">[01:20.77]</span>The damage couldn't be reversed <span class="underline">overnight</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="12.46" data-time="83.33">[01:23.33]</span>Although I should <span class="underline">mention</span> that by 1996, the water in one of the rivers flowing <span class="underline">through</span> the <span class="underline">basin</span> was clean enough that it was the site of the Olympic white water kayaking competition. <span class="time" data-times="4.03" data-time="95.79">[01:35.79]</span>And that river is still used now for <span class="underline">recreation</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.53" data-time="99.82">[01:39.82]</span>But...anyway...let's <span class="underline">analyze</span> the problem.<span class="time" data-times="4.69" data-time="104.35">[01:44.35]</span> It wasn't the <span class="underline">mining</span> itself that caused such <span class="underline">massive</span> <span class="underline">destruction</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.4" data-time="109.04">[01:49.04]</span>It was what happened after the <span class="underline">copper</span> <span class="underline">ore</span> was extracted from the mines. <span class="time" data-times="3.33" data-time="113.44">[01:53.44]</span>It was a <span class="underline">process</span> called <span class="underline">heap</span> roasting.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.5" data-time="116.77">[01:56.77]</span>
              <span class="underline">Copper</span>
              <span class="underline">ore</span> contains <span class="underline">sulfur</span>.<span class="time" data-times="7.23" data-time="120.27">[02:00.27]</span> And <span class="underline">heap</span> roasting was a way to burn away the <span class="underline">sulfur</span> in the <span class="underline">copper</span>, so they'd be left with something closer to <span class="underline">pure</span> <span class="underline">copper</span>. <span class="time" data-times="10.56" data-time="127.5">[02:07.50]</span>Well, in the <span class="underline">process</span>, large vats of <span class="underline">raw</span> <span class="underline">copper</span> <span class="underline">ore</span> are burned slowly, for two or three months actually, to <span class="underline">lower</span> the <span class="underline">sulfur</span> <span class="underline">content</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.65" data-time="138.06">[02:18.06]</span>And this burning, well...let's look at the results.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.83" data-time="142.71">[02:22.71]</span>First, the mines were <span class="underline">fairly</span> <span class="underline">remote</span>, so there was no way to bring <span class="underline">coal</span> or other <span class="underline">fuel</span> to keep the fires going. <span class="time" data-times="3.34" data-time="149.54">[02:29.54]</span>So they cut down <span class="underline">local</span> trees for <span class="underline">fuel</span>.<span class="time" data-times="4.48" data-time="152.88">[02:32.88]</span> And like I said, the fires burned for months. <span class="time" data-times="3.44" data-time="157.36">[02:37.36]</span>Uh...that's a lot of fires and a lot of trees. <span class="time" data-times="3.9" data-time="160.8">[02:40.80]</span>Deforestation was occurring at a rapid <span class="underline">rate</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.03" data-time="164.7">[02:44.70]</span>And it was <span class="underline">accelerated</span> by the smoke from the burning <span class="underline">ore</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.08" data-time="167.73">[02:47.73]</span>Big clouds of sulfuric smoke, which was <span class="underline">toxic</span> to the trees, formed over the areas. <span class="time" data-times="4.55" data-time="174.81">[02:54.81]</span>Trees that hadn't been cut for <span class="underline">fuel</span> were killed by the fumes.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.48" data-time="179.36">[02:59.36]</span>The <span class="underline">sulfur</span> also mixed with the <span class="underline">air</span> and created <span class="underline">sulfur</span> <span class="underline">dioxide</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.53" data-time="184.84">[03:04.84]</span>And the <span class="underline">sulfur</span> <span class="underline">dioxide</span> settled in the clouds fell to the land in droplets of rain and sank into the soil. <span class="time" data-times="3.97" data-time="192.37">[03:12.37]</span>This is what we now call <span class="underline">acid</span> rain. <span class="time" data-times="2.2" data-time="196.34">[03:16.34]</span>You've probably heard of it.<span class="time" data-times="2.93" data-time="198.54">[03:18.54]</span> But no one used the <span class="underline">term</span> back then.<span class="time" data-times="5.15" data-time="201.47">[03:21.47]</span>Anyway...the <span class="underline">acid</span> rain created highly <span class="underline">acidic</span> soil.<span class="time" data-times="7.32" data-time="206.62">[03:26.62]</span> Well, soon the soil became so <span class="underline">acidic</span> that nothing could grow, nothing at all. <span class="time" data-times="3.63" data-time="213.94">[03:33.94]</span>Vegetation and wild life disappeared.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5" data-time="217.57">[03:37.57]</span>And it wasn't just the land and the <span class="underline">air</span>, it was the water too. <span class="time" data-times="2.68" data-time="222.57">[03:42.57]</span>What do you think happen to the rivers? <span class="time" data-times="5.84" data-time="225.25">[03:45.25]</span>Well, there are no trees to <span class="underline">absorb</span> the rain, and there was a lot of rain! <span class="time" data-times="5.03" data-time="231.09">[03:51.09]</span>So the rain eroded the soil and swept it into the rivers. <span class="time" data-times="4.56" data-time="236.12">[03:56.12]</span>This is called silting, when soil particles are washed into the rivers.<span class="time" data-times="3.63" data-time="240.68">[04:00.68]</span> And the silting continued at an alarming <span class="underline">rate</span>.<span class="time" data-times="11.19" data-time="244.31">[04:04.31]</span>But this was <span class="underline">toxic</span> soil and <span class="underline">toxic</span> <span class="underline">runoff</span>, the <span class="underline">acid</span> and metals in the soil made the once <span class="underline">clear</span> rivers flow bright orange.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="11.9" data-time="255.5">[04:15.50]</span>So it was really that one step in the <span class="underline">process</span> of producing <span class="underline">copper</span>...the problems just built up and up until there was a <span class="underline">desert</span> where a beautiful forest used to be. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="267.4">[04:27.40]</span>OK. Now let's look at reforestation and land <span class="underline">reclamation</span> efforts. </p>
