Ways species in an ecosystem affect each other's population size</p><p>B. How the carrying capacity of an ecosystem is determined</p><p>C. A new theory regarding cycles in predator and prey population sizes</p><p>D. How researchers monitor the population size of animal species in the wild</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>Students ask a question: the number of animals interacting with each other and other environmental factors also add this influence. The professor's answer is: In the ecosystem, the relationship between animals is very complicated. After the festival, it can be judged that the article mainly talks about the contents of the A option.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor mention nonnative species?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To show that some species cannot be transplanted easily to new environments.</p><p>B. To give an example of rapid population growth that is not followed by decline.</p><p>C. To emphasize that species with rapidly growing populations harm ecosystem.</p><p>D. To introduce a study on the changing population size of certain species.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>It can be seen from it doesn't usually happen that the professor thinks that such a phenomenon is not common. Such a nonnative species is still mad because there is not much competition.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What point does the professor make when she discusses the carrying capacity of an ecosystem?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The availability of food is more important for species than the availability of space.</p><p>B. The amount of environmental resistance in an ecosystem does not change over time.</p><p>C. Environmental resistance controls the population size of species in an ecosystem.</p><p>D. The population size of most species increases at a constant rate.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The professor used BUT to switch back to what the boys said. But for most species, most of the time, resources are finite. There's only so much available... which leads me to my point. Every ecosystem has what we call a carrying capacity. Explain your own view that the carrying capacity of the ecological environment will limit the maximum number of species. There are always factors that limit population growth. This is called environmental resistance. These limiting factors become: environmental resistance factors.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>How did the researchers test the links between acorns, white-footed mice, and gypsy moths in a forest?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They supplied an additional food source for gypsy moths.</p><p>B. They introduced gypsy moths to areas where there had been none.</p><p>C. They cleared oak trees from some areas where both animal species lived.</p><p>D. They manipulated the numbers of mice and acorns in some areas.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>From some parts of the forest... all the way to the end, they are all describing the number of rats and acorns that the researchers manipulated in this place. So corresponds to D.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor say can lead to a change in the gypsy moth population in a forest? [Choose two answers]</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. An increase in the number of tree species in a forest.</p><p>B. An increase in the number of acorns produced by oak trees.</p><p>C. A decrease in the population of white-footed mice.</p><p>D. A decrease in oak tree leaves caused by gypsy moth caterpillars.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="BC"><p>When there is less acorn, Gypsy Moth will also be greatly reduced. But when the white footed mouse is removed, the number of gypsy moths will expand. In other words, changes in the number of acorns and white footed rats will cause changes in the number of gypsy moths.</p></div></div><div class="replay" id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What can be inferred about the professor when she says this?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. She does not know the answer to the student's question.</p><p>B. She wants to correct a statement she made earlier.</p><p>C. She thinks the term the student used is incorrect.</p><p>D. She would like to redirect the discussion.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>After the girls proposed a concept, the professor said, wait, first of all I would like to review some important concepts. The implication is to re-conduct this discussion.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
