          <p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.24" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in a <span class="underline">biology</span> class.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="17.18" data-time="6.24">[00:06.24]</span>Student: Professor, since we are going to talk about changes in animal populations in the wild, I'd like to ask about something I read in an article online, about how the <span class="underline">population</span> size of some animal <span class="underline">species</span> can <span class="underline">affect</span> other animal <span class="underline">species</span>, and how other <span class="underline">environmental</span> factors come into play too.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.74" data-time="23.42">[00:23.42]</span>Professor: Right. Relationships between animal <span class="underline">species</span> in a <span class="underline">given</span> <span class="underline">ecosystem</span> can get <span class="underline">pretty</span> <span class="underline">complex</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.08" data-time="29.16">[00:29.16]</span>Because in <span class="underline">addition</span> to predator-prey relationships, there are other variables that <span class="underline">affect</span> <span class="underline">population</span> size.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.34" data-time="35.24">[00:35.24]</span>Student: The article mentioned that populations of predators and their <span class="underline">prey</span> might go up rapidly and then <span class="underline">decline</span> all of a sudden.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.3" data-time="41.58">[00:41.58]</span>Student: Oh. Yeah! I read about that in my <span class="underline">ecology</span> class. <span class="time" data-times="1.72" data-time="44.88">[00:44.88]</span>It happens in cycles. <span class="time" data-times="3.31" data-time="46.6">[00:46.60]</span>I think that's called a boom-and-bust <span class="underline">cycle</span>. Right?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.4" data-time="49.91">[00:49.91]</span>Professor: OK. Well, hold on a <span class="underline">second</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.03" data-time="52.31">[00:52.31]</span>First I want to go over some key concepts. <span class="time" data-times="5.55" data-time="55.34">[00:55.34]</span>Let's say there was a <span class="underline">species</span> that had <span class="underline">access</span> to plenty of food and <span class="underline">ideal</span> conditions. <span class="time" data-times="7.49" data-time="60.89">[01:00.89]</span>Under those circumstances, its <span class="underline">population</span> would increase exponentially, meaning it would increase at an ever-accelerating pace.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.92" data-time="68.38">[01:08.38]</span>Student: Wow! That sounds a little scary.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.38" data-time="71.3">[01:11.30]</span>Professor: Well, it doesn't usually happen.<span class="time" data-times="5" data-time="73.68">[01:13.68]</span> Like you said, a rapid <span class="underline">population</span> growth is often followed by a sudden <span class="underline">decline</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.03" data-time="78.68">[01:18.68]</span>But we do occasionally see exponential growth in nonnative <span class="underline">species</span> when they are transplanted into a new environment. <span class="time" data-times="5.08" data-time="85.71">[01:25.71]</span>Um...because they face little competition and have <span class="underline">favorable</span> growing conditions.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.55" data-time="90.79">[01:30.79]</span>But for most <span class="underline">species</span>, most of the time, resources are <span class="underline">finite</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.35" data-time="95.34">[01:35.34]</span>There's only so much <span class="underline">available</span>...which leads me to my point. <span class="time" data-times="3.94" data-time="98.69">[01:38.69]</span>Every <span class="underline">ecosystem</span> has what we call a carrying <span class="underline">capacity</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9.27" data-time="102.63">[01:42.63]</span>The carrying <span class="underline">capacity</span> is the <span class="underline">maximum</span> <span class="underline">population</span> size of a <span class="underline">species</span> that can be <span class="underline">sustained</span> by the resources of a <span class="underline">particular</span> <span class="underline">ecosystem</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.94" data-time="111.9">[01:51.90]</span>Resources are, of <span class="underline">course</span>, food, water, and just as important, <span class="underline">space</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.38" data-time="116.84">[01:56.84]</span>Although every <span class="underline">species</span> has a <span class="underline">maximum</span> <span class="underline">rate</span> at which the <span class="underline">population</span> of that <span class="underline">species</span> could increase, assuming <span class="underline">ideal</span> conditions for the <span class="underline">species</span> in its environment. <span class="time" data-times="4.77" data-time="126.22">[02:06.22]</span>There are always going to be <span class="underline">environmental</span> factors that limit <span class="underline">population</span> growth. <span class="time" data-times="3.21" data-time="130.99">[02:10.99]</span>This is called <span class="underline">environmental</span> <span class="underline">resistance</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.02" data-time="134.2">[02:14.20]</span> <span class="underline">Environmental</span> <span class="underline">resistance</span> is important because it stops populations from growing out of control. <span class="time" data-times="8.63" data-time="140.22">[02:20.22]</span>Factors such food <span class="underline">supply</span>, <span class="underline">predation</span> and <span class="underline">disease</span> <span class="underline">affect</span> <span class="underline">population</span> size, and can change from year to year or <span class="underline">season</span> to <span class="underline">season</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.75" data-time="148.85">[02:28.85]</span>Student: OK. I think I get it.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.25" data-time="150.6">[02:30.60]</span>Professor: Well, let's look at a case study.<span class="time" data-times="1.45" data-time="152.85">[02:32.85]</span> That should make things <span class="underline">clear</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9.67" data-time="154.3">[02:34.30]</span>Some years ago, some of my colleagues conducted an experiment in an <span class="underline">oak</span> forest involving three different species: white-footed <span class="underline">mice</span>, gypsy moths and <span class="underline">oak</span> trees.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.79" data-time="163.97">[02:43.97]</span>OK. Now let me explain what the situation is in this forest.<span class="time" data-times="6.12" data-time="168.76">[02:48.76]</span> <span class="underline">Oak</span> trees produce acorns, and acorns are a <span class="underline">primary</span> food <span class="underline">source</span> for white-footed <span class="underline">mice</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.82" data-time="174.88">[02:54.88]</span>Another food <span class="underline">source</span> for the white-footed <span class="underline">mice</span> is the gypsy <span class="underline">moth</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9.26" data-time="178.7">[02:58.70]</span>So the size of the gypsy <span class="underline">moth</span> <span class="underline">population</span> is controlled by the white-footed <span class="underline">mice</span>, which is a good thing because gypsy <span class="underline">moth</span> caterpillars are considered pests.<span class="time" data-times="3.65" data-time="187.96">[03:07.96]</span>They <span class="underline">strip</span> away the leaves from the <span class="underline">oak</span> trees every ten years or so.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.34" data-time="191.61">[03:11.61]</span>Student: So the <span class="underline">mice</span> eat both acorns from the <span class="underline">oak</span> trees and gypsy moths. <span class="time" data-times="3.35" data-time="196.95">[03:16.95]</span>And the gypsy <span class="underline">moth</span> caterpillars eat <span class="underline">oak</span> tree leaves.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.11" data-time="200.3">[03:20.30]</span>Professor: Right. Now, what makes this set of relationships particularly interesting is that <span class="underline">oak</span> trees only produce a large number of acorns every few years.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.43" data-time="210.41">[03:30.41]</span>Student: So during the years with fewer acorns, the white-footed <span class="underline">mice</span> have to <span class="underline">deal</span> with a smaller food <span class="underline">supply</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.28" data-time="215.84">[03:35.84]</span>Professor: Yes. But in the years with large amounts of acorns, the <span class="underline">mice</span> have more food, which leads to...?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.44" data-time="222.12">[03:42.12]</span>Student: The white-footed <span class="underline">mice</span> <span class="underline">population</span> growing.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.99" data-time="224.56">[03:44.56]</span>Professor: And the gypsy <span class="underline">moth</span> <span class="underline">population</span> decreasing.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.75" data-time="227.55">[03:47.55]</span>Student: How can we know that for sure? <span class="time" data-times="3.83" data-time="229.3">[03:49.30]</span>It seems like a big jump from more acorns to fewer gypsy moths.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.08" data-time="233.13">[03:53.13]</span>Professor: Well, we can know for sure because in this <span class="underline">oak</span> forest, the researchers decided to test the links between acorns and the two animal <span class="underline">species</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.18" data-time="242.21">[04:02.21]</span>In some parts of the forest, they had volunteers <span class="underline">drop</span> a large number of <span class="underline">extra</span> acorns on the forest floor.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.43" data-time="248.39">[04:08.39]</span>And in another <span class="underline">section</span> of the forest, they removed a number of white-footed <span class="underline">mice</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.52" data-time="252.82">[04:12.82]</span>In the forest areas where <span class="underline">extra</span> acorns had been dropped, the gypsy <span class="underline">moth</span> <span class="underline">population</span> soon went into a <span class="underline">significant</span> <span class="underline">decline</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="260.34">[04:20.34]</span>But in the <span class="underline">section</span> of the forest where the white-footed <span class="underline">mice</span> had been removed, the gypsy <span class="underline">moth</span> <span class="underline">population</span> exploded.</p>
