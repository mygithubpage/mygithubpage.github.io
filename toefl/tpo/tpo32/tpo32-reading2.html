The old ruling families were being displaced by an evolving <span class="highlight">centralized</span><span class="highlight">government</span>. These families were pensioned off (<span class="highlight">given</span> a <span class="highlight">sum</span> of money to live on) or <span class="highlight">simply</span> had their revenues taken away or <span class="highlight">restricted</span>; their sons were enticed away to schools for <span class="highlight">district</span> officers, later to be posted in some faraway province; and the old patron-client relations that had <span class="highlight">bound</span> together <span class="highlight">local</span> societies <span class="highlight">simply</span> disintegrated. <span class="highlight">Local</span> rulers could no longer protect their relatives and attendants in legal cases, and with the ending in 1905 of the practice of forcing peasant farmers to work part-time for <span class="highlight">local</span> rulers, the rulers no longer had a <span class="highlight">regular</span><span class="highlight">base</span> for relations with <span class="highlight">rural</span> populations. The old <span class="highlight">local</span> ruling families, then, were <span class="question1">severed</span> from their <span class="highlight">traditional</span> social <span class="highlight">context</span>.</p><p>The same situation viewed from the <span class="highlight">perspective</span> of the <span class="highlight">rural</span><span class="highlight">population</span> is <span class="highlight">even</span> more <span class="highlight">complex</span>. According to the <span class="highlight">government</span>'s first <span class="highlight">census</span> of the <span class="highlight">rural</span><span class="highlight">population</span>, taken in 1905, there were about thirty thousand villages in Siam. This was probably a large increase over the <span class="highlight">figure</span><span class="highlight">even</span> two or three decades earlier, during the late 1800s. It is difficult to imagine it now, but Siam's Central <span class="highlight">Plain</span> in the late 1800s was nowhere near as densely settled as it is today. There were still forests closely surrounding Bangkok into the last of the nineteenth <span class="highlight">century</span>, and <span class="highlight">even</span> at <span class="highlight">century</span>'s end there were wild elephants and tigers roaming the countryside only twenty or thirty miles away.</p><p>Much <span class="highlight">population</span> movement involved the opening up of new lands for rice <span class="highlight">cultivation</span>. Two things made this possible and encouraged it to happen. First, the opening of the <span class="highlight">kingdom</span> to the full force of international <span class="highlight">trade</span> by the Boring Treaty (1855) rapidly encouraged <span class="highlight">economic</span><span class="highlight">specialization</span> in the growing of rice, mainly to feed the <span class="question4">rice-deficient portions </span>of Asia (India and china in <span class="highlight">particular</span>). The <span class="highlight">average</span><span class="highlight">annual</span><span class="highlight">volume</span> of rice exported from Siam grew from under 60 million kilograms per year in the late 1850s to more than 660 million kilograms per year at the turn of the <span class="highlight">century</span>; and over the same period the <span class="highlight">average</span> price per kilogram doubled. During the same period, the area planted in rice increased from about 230,000 acres to more than350, 000 acres. This growth was achieved as the result of the <span class="highlight">collective</span> decisions of thousands of peasants families to <span class="highlight">expand</span> the <span class="highlight">amount</span> of land they <span class="highlight">cultivated</span>, <span class="highlight">clear</span> and plant new land, or <span class="highlight">adopt</span> more <span class="highlight">intensive</span> methods of <span class="highlight">agriculture</span>.</p><p><span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>They were able to do so because of our <span class="highlight">second</span><span class="highlight">consideration</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>They were <span class="highlight">relatively</span> freer than they had been half a <span class="highlight">century</span> earlier. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>Over the <span class="highlight">course</span> of the Fifth Reign (1868 – 1910), the ties that <span class="highlight">bound</span><span class="highlight">rural</span> people to the <span class="highlight">aristocracy</span> and <span class="highlight">local</span> ruling 
elites were greatly reduced. Peasants now paid a tax on individuals <span class="highlight">instead</span> of being required to <span class="highlight">render</span> labor service to the <span class="highlight">government</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>Under these conditions, it made good <span class="highlight">sense</span> to thousands of peasant families to in effect work
full-time at what they had been able to do only part-time <span class="highlight">previously</span> because of the requirement to work for the government: grow rice for the marketplace.</p><p><span class="highlight">Numerous</span> changes accompanied these developments. The <span class="highlight">rural</span><span class="highlight">population</span> both <span class="question9">dispersed </span>and grew, and was probably less <span class="highlight">homogeneous</span> and more <span class="highlight">mobile</span> than it had been a <span class="highlight">generation</span> earlier. The villages became more <span class="highlight">vulnerable</span> to <span class="highlight">arbitrary</span> treatment by <span class="highlight">government</span> bureaucrats as <span class="highlight">local</span> elites now had less control over them. By the early twentieth <span class="highlight">century</span>, as <span class="highlight">government</span> modernization in a <span class="highlight">sense</span> caught up with what had been happening in the countryside since the 1870s, the <span class="highlight">government</span> bureaucracy intruded more and more into village life. Provincial police began to <span class="highlight">appear</span>, <span class="highlight">along</span> with <span class="highlight">district</span> officers and <span class="highlight">cattle</span> registration and land deeds and registration for <span class="highlight"><span class="question10">compulsory</span><span class="highlight"></span>military</span> service. Village handicrafts <span class="highlight">diminished</span> or died out completely as people bought imported consumer goods, like cloth and tools, <span class="highlight">instead</span> of making them themselves. More <span class="highlight">economic</span><span class="highlight">variation</span> took <span class="highlight">shape</span> in <span class="highlight">rural</span> villages, as some grew <span class="highlight">prosperous</span> from farming while others did not. As well as can be measured, <span class="highlight">rural</span> standards of living improved in the Fifth Reign. But the <span class="highlight">statistical</span> averages mean little when measured against the <span class="highlight">harsh</span> realities of peasant life.</p></article></div><div id="question"><div id="question1"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">severed</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p><label class="my-label"><span>A. cut off</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><label class="my-label"><span>B. viewed</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><label class="my-label"><span>C. protected</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><label class="my-label"><span>D. rescued</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><p><span>Answer: </span><span class="my-answer">A</span></p></div><div id="question2"><p>According to paragraph 1, the situation for Siam's old ruling families changed in all of the following ways EXCEPT:</p><label class="my-label"><span>A.
