The old ruling families were being displaced by an evolving <span class="highlight">centralized</span><span class="highlight">government</span>. These families were pensioned off (<span class="highlight">given</span> a <span class="highlight">sum</span> of money to live on) or <span class="highlight">simply</span> had their revenues taken away or <span class="highlight">restricted</span>; their sons were enticed away to schools for <span class="highlight">district</span> officers, later to be posted in some faraway province; and the old patron-client relations that had <span class="highlight">bound</span> together <span class="highlight">local</span> societies <span class="highlight">simply</span> disintegrated. <span class="highlight">Local</span> rulers could no longer protect their relatives and attendants in legal cases, and with the ending in 1905 of the practice of forcing peasant farmers to work part-time for <span class="highlight">local</span> rulers, the rulers no longer had a <span class="highlight">regular</span><span class="highlight">base</span> for relations with <span class="highlight">rural</span> populations. The old <span class="highlight">local</span> ruling families, then, were <span class="highlight question1">severed</span> from their <span class="highlight">traditional</span> social <span class="highlight">context</span>.</p><p>The same situation viewed from the <span class="highlight">perspective</span> of the <span class="highlight">rural</span><span class="highlight">population</span> is <span class="highlight">even</span> more <span class="highlight">complex</span>. According to the <span class="highlight">government</span>'s first <span class="highlight">census</span> of the <span class="highlight">rural</span><span class="highlight">population</span>, taken in 1905, there were about thirty thousand villages in Siam. This was probably a large increase over the <span class="highlight">figure</span><span class="highlight">even</span> two or three decades earlier, during the late 1800s. It is difficult to imagine it now, but Siam's Central <span class="highlight">Plain</span> in the late 1800s was nowhere near as densely settled as it is today. There were still forests closely surrounding Bangkok into the last of the nineteenth <span class="highlight">century</span>, and <span class="highlight">even</span> at <span class="highlight">century</span>'s end there were wild elephants and tigers roaming the countryside only twenty or thirty miles away.</p><p>Much <span class="highlight">population</span> movement involved the opening up of new lands for rice <span class="highlight">cultivation</span>. Two things made this possible and encouraged it to happen. First, the opening of the <span class="highlight">kingdom</span> to the full force of international <span class="highlight">trade</span> by the Boring Treaty (1855) rapidly encouraged <span class="highlight">economic</span><span class="highlight">specialization</span> in the growing of rice, mainly to feed the <span class="question4">rice-deficient portions</span> of Asia (India and china in <span class="highlight">particular</span>). The <span class="highlight">average</span><span class="highlight">annual</span><span class="highlight">volume</span> of rice exported from Siam grew from under 60 million kilograms per year in the late 1850s to more than 660 million kilograms per year at the turn of the <span class="highlight">century</span>; and over the same period the <span class="highlight">average</span> price per kilogram doubled. During the same period, the area planted in rice increased from about 230,000 acres to more than350, 000 acres. This growth was achieved as the result of the <span class="highlight">collective</span> decisions of thousands of peasants families to <span class="highlight">expand</span> the <span class="highlight">amount</span> of land they <span class="highlight">cultivated</span>, <span class="highlight">clear</span> and plant new land, or <span class="highlight">adopt</span> more <span class="highlight">intensive</span> methods of <span class="highlight">agriculture</span>.</p><p><span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>They were able to do so because of our <span class="highlight">second</span><span class="highlight">consideration</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>They were <span class="highlight">relatively</span> freer than they had been half a <span class="highlight">century</span> earlier. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>Over the <span class="highlight">course</span> of the Fifth Reign (1868 ï¿½ 1910), the ties that <span class="highlight">bound</span><span class="highlight">rural</span> people to the <span class="highlight">aristocracy</span> and <span class="highlight">local</span> ruling 
elites were greatly reduced. Peasants now paid a tax on individuals <span class="highlight">instead</span> of being required to <span class="highlight">render</span> labor service to the <span class="highlight">government</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>Under these conditions, it made good <span class="highlight">sense</span> to thousands of peasant families to in effect work
full-time at what they had been able to do only part-time <span class="highlight">previously</span> because of the requirement to work for the government: grow rice for the marketplace.</p><p><span class="highlight">Numerous</span> changes accompanied these developments. The <span class="highlight">rural</span><span class="highlight">population</span> both <span class="question9">dispersed</span> and grew, and was probably less <span class="highlight">homogeneous</span> and more <span class="highlight">mobile</span> than it had been a <span class="highlight">generation</span> earlier. The villages became more <span class="highlight">vulnerable</span> to <span class="highlight">arbitrary</span> treatment by <span class="highlight">government</span> bureaucrats as <span class="highlight">local</span> elites now had less control over them. By the early twentieth <span class="highlight">century</span>, as <span class="highlight">government</span> modernization in a <span class="highlight">sense</span> caught up with what had been happening in the countryside since the 1870s, the <span class="highlight">government</span> bureaucracy intruded more and more into village life. Provincial police began to <span class="highlight">appear</span>, <span class="highlight">along</span> with <span class="highlight">district</span> officers and <span class="highlight">cattle</span> registration and land deeds and registration for <span class="highlight"><span class="question10">compulsory</span></span><span class="highlight">military</span> service. Village handicrafts <span class="highlight">diminished</span> or died out completely as people bought imported consumer goods, like cloth and tools, <span class="highlight">instead</span> of making them themselves. More <span class="highlight">economic</span><span class="highlight">variation</span> took <span class="highlight">shape</span> in <span class="highlight">rural</span> villages, as some grew <span class="highlight">prosperous</span> from farming while others did not. As well as can be measured, <span class="highlight">rural</span> standards of living improved in the Fifth Reign. But the <span class="highlight">statistical</span> averages mean little when measured against the <span class="highlight">harsh</span> realities of peasant life.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">severed</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. cut off</p><p>B. viewed</p><p>C. protected</p><p>D. rescued</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>Sever: Split and cut, corresponding to cut off of option A. Corresponding to the original: The old local ruling families, then, were severed from their traditional social context.</p><p>Judging from the foregoing, the original ruling families were seized power and the sons and daughters were banished. Various signs indicate that the status of these ruling families is not guaranteed, including the description of the corresponding sentence. It should also be a description of the decline of this ruling family. , then severed must be a relatively negative word. Among these four options, the C option protected and the D option rescued can be immediately eliminated, all of which are good results and cannot show decline, and the B option viewed does not support semantics. Only the A option is the most appropriate.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 1, the situation for Siam's old ruling families changed in all of the following ways EXCEPT:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Their incomes were reduced.</p><p>B. Their sons were posted as district officers in distant provinces.</p><p>C. They could sell lands that had traditionally belonged to them.</p><p>D. They had less control over the rural populations.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The A option uses income to target the third sentence of the paragraph: These families were pensioned off (given a sum of money to live on) or simply had their revenues taken away or restricted.</p><p>The B option uses their sons to correspond to the third sentence: ...the sons were enticed away to schools for district office later to be posted in some faraway province.</p><p>There is no mention in the original C option;</p><p>The D option uses rural population for the penultimate sentence:</p><p>Local rulers could no longer protect their relatives and attendants in legal cases, and with the ending in 1905 of the practice of forcing peasant farmers to work part-time for local rulers, the rulers no longer had a regular base for relations with rural populations. Corresponds to the D option.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 2, which of the following was true of Siam in 1905?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Its urban population began to migrate out of the cities and into the country.</p><p>B. Its Central Plain was almost as densely populated as it is today.</p><p>C. It was so rural that wild elephants and tigers sometimes roamed Bangkok.</p><p>D. It had many more villages than it did in the late 1800s.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>With the year 1905 to the second and third sentences of the paragraph: According to the government's first census of the rural population, taken in 1905, there were about thirty thousand villages in Siam. This was probably a large increase over the figure even two or three From the two sentences, it can be known that there were 30,000 villages in 1905, which was a great increase compared to the late 1800s. This echoes the D option. The AB option is not mentioned in the original text, and the C option does not describe the characteristics of 1905.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The phrase "<span class="highlight"><span class="question4">rice-deficient portions</span></span>" in the passage is closest in closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. the parts that consume rice</p><p>B. the parts that do not have enough rice</p><p>C. the parts where rice is grown</p><p>D. The parts that depend primarily on rice</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>Rice-deficient: The lack of rice, corresponding to do not have enough rice, corresponds to the original: First, the opening of the kingdom to the full force of international trade by the Bowring Treaty (1855) rapidly encouraged economic specialization in the growing of rice, mainly to Feed the <span class="question4">rice-deficient portions</span> of Asia (India and China in particular).</p><p>The correct answer can be selected by the phrase structure. Rice should all know. Deficient is the meaning of "lack". This word appears in tpo 5 in large numbers, meaning that part is the meaning of "partial". When connected, you get the correct answer. Of course, if you do not recognize some of these words, you can also scrutinize the contents of the corresponding original sentence. The first half said that international trade encourages the special production of rice, and the latter phrase says that the effect that can be achieved is to provide the <span class="question4">rice-deficient portions</span> of Asia. Obviously, ACD is not suitable for this context after substitution, only B is the most appropriate.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Paragraph 3 mentions all of the following as signs of economic growth in Siam EXCEPT</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. an increase in the price or rice</p><p>B. an increase in the amount of rice leaving Siam</p><p>C. an increase in the nutritional quality of the rice grown</p><p>D. an increase in the amount of land used for rice production</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The A option uses price of rice to target: the average price per kilogram doubled, and dboubled corresponds to the increase in the A option.</p><p>B option uses amount of rice corresponding paragraph 4th sentence:</p><p>The average annual volume of rice exported from Siam grew from under 60 million kilograms per year in the late 1850s to more than 660 million kilograms per year at the turn of the century. grew corresponds to the increase in the B option.</p><p>The C option is located with nutritional quality and is not mentioned in the original text.</p><p>The D option uses the amount of land to locate the last sentence of the segment: This growth was achieved as the result of the collective decisions of thousands of peasants families to expand the amount of land they cultivated, clear and plant new land, or adopt more intensive methods Of agriculture. expand corresponds to the increase in the D option.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 3, farming families increased the amount of rice they grew in part by</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. growing varieties of rice that produced greater yields</p><p>B. forming collective farms by joining together with other farm families</p><p>C. planting rice in areas that had previously remained unplanted</p><p>D. hiring laborers to help them tend their fields</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The title does not have a particularly good positioning word. The question is: What is the way to cultivate the rice production by the farming family? A quick tour of the entire section to the last sentence of the paragraph: This growth was achieved as the result of the collective decisions of thousands of peasants families to expand the amount of land they cultivated, clear and plant new land, or adopt more intensive methods of Agriculture. Three methods of expansion are mentioned here. The first is the expansion of cultivated land, the second is the removal of new land, and the third is the use of high-intensity agricultural practices. The second method corresponds to the C option. ABD did not mention it.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, what happened after the government ended the practice of requiring rural people to perform labor for it?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Rural people became more closely connected to the aristocracy.</p><p>B. Rural people spent more time growing rice for profit.</p><p>C. The government began to pay the laborers who grew rice for it.</p><p>D. The government introduced a special tax on rice.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Using government to locate the last sentence of the paragraph: ...it made good sense to thousands of peasant families to in effect work full-time, grow rice for the marketplace. Here it is pointed out that these farmers can grow rice for the market through full-time, and B options echo. A and C did not mention anything at all. The tax of the D option is not implemented by the government. Farmers pay personal tax.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the following best describes the relationship between paragraphs 3 and 4 in the passage?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Paragraph 4 provides further evidence of the economic growth of Siam discussed in paragraph 3.</p><p>B. Paragraph 4 continues the discussion begun in paragraph 3 of farming improvements that led to economic growth.</p><p>C. Paragraph 4 examines a particular effect of the Bowring Treaty mentioned in paragraph 3.</p><p>D. Paragraph 4 discusses the second of two factors that contributed to the expansion of rice farming mentioned in paragraph 3.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The first sentence of paragraph 3 is a general statement, referring to the fact that population mobility involves the development of new land for the cultivation of rice, and then said that two factors have contributed to this. Then the third paragraph is about one of them, starting with first. Obviously the structure is listed. The second paragraph of the fourth paragraph took first and mentioned the second factor. Corresponds to the fourth option.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question9">dispersed</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. spread out</p><p>B. gained power</p><p>C. adapted</p><p>D. specialized</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" A"><p>Disperse: spread out; disperse, corresponding to spread out spread, spread. It is possible to use the parallel relation of and and to speculate that disperse and greyin are collocated. All of these options, obviously only A is the most obvious, and that is probably less homogeneous and more mobile than it had been a generation earlier. It is appropriate, that is, "the rural population is both proliferating and growing." The B option's gained power (acquired rights), C option's adapted (adapted) and D options' specialized (specialized) substitutions are not appropriate.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question10">compulsory</span></span>" in passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. foreign</p><p>B. formal</p><p>C. required</p><p>D. preferred</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" C"><p>Compulsory: obligatory: Corresponding; required; <span class="question10">compulsory</span>. The provincial police began to appear, along with district officers and cattle registration and land deeds and registration for <span class="question10">compulsory</span> military service. The word should be no strangers. Compulsory education in 9-year <span class="question10">compulsory</span> education was translated as "<span class="question10">compulsory</span> educaiton". If you don't know something, you can also deduce from the original sentence. The original sentence is obviously a parallel logic. It lists all kinds of government restrictions and restrictions on the rural population. Compulsory military service is one of them. Among the four options, only the C option is most appropriate, ie "strong". Uniform military service ".</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 5, which of the following was true of Siam's rural people during the Fifth Reign?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They were forced to spend most of the profits from rice growing on registrations required by the government.</p><p>B. Their lives remained very difficult even though statistics suggest that their quality of life improved.</p><p>C. The non-farmers among them were helped by the government more than the farmers among them were.</p><p>D. They were more prosperous when they were ruled by local elites than when they were ruled by the more modern government of the Fifth Reign.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Use the Fifth Reigh to locate the first two sentences of the paragraph:</p><p>As well as can be measured, rural standards of living improved in the Fifth Reign. But the average averages mean little when measured against the harsh realities of peasant life.</p><p>Although the penultimate sentence says that statistical data shows that rural living standards have improved during the Fifth Reign, the last sentence goes on to say that statistics do not explain anything. Farmers are still living in dire straits. This corresponds to the B option. None of the ACD options are mentioned.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 5, the government bureaucracy intruded in village life by</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. requiring the people to register their cattle and land</p><p>B. requiring the people to buy certain kinds of imported goods</p><p>C. discouraging the people from making handicrafts and tools</p><p>D. encouraging more people to take up farming</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>Intrude was targeted to: By the early twentieth century, as government modernization in a sense caught up with what had been happening in the royalty since the 1870s, the government bureaucracy intruded more and more into village life. But this sentence did not discuss them. Intrude's method, looking back, is the answer to the question: Provincial police began to appear, along with district officers and cattle registration and land deeds and registration for <span class="question10">compulsory</span> military service. The words "along with district officers and cattle registration and land deeds ", echoing option A. The purchase of imported products mentioned in option B was not forced by the bureaucracy to buy them, so it was wrong; the CD option was not mentioned.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>And yet, how is it that the peasants were able to choose to expand their economic activity in response to the market opportunities?.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The insertion sentence is obviously a question. The following is definitely the answer to the question of How. The B option can be ruled out first, because the two sentences before and after the B option are obviously linked together and the related details are discussed. And D can also be excluded because it can be known through under these conditions that the two sentences before and after D are closely related, and in A and C, A is more appropriate because the whole paragraph is discussing how.</p></div></div><div id="question14" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>Prose SummaryDuring the late nineteenth century, changes in Siam's power structure had important economic consequences.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.Population movement occurred and rice cultivation intensified because Siam became more actively involved in international trade.</p><p>B.Changes in taxation and the ending of the requirement that people work part-time for the rulers allowed farmers to produce more rice for the marketplace.</p><p>C.Population increases occurred in part because Siam's farmers were able to produce more rice to feed the population.</p><p>D.Land became so valuable that villagers had to pay the government for the land that they worked on.</p><p>E.Although rural living standards may have improved somewhat, prosperity varied from village to village and government bureaucracy played a greater role in village life.</p><p>F.Government modernization in the early twentieth century resulted in the loss of some freedoms that the rural population had gained from the traditional ruling classes.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="ABE"><p>The A option corresponds to the core meaning of paragraph 3.</p><p>The B option corresponds to the core meaning of paragraph 4.</p><p>The original C option is not explicitly stated.</p><p>The D option is not explicitly stated in the original text.</p><p>The E option corresponds to the core meaning of paragraph 5.</p><p>The F option corresponds to paragraph 5 but the original concept of loss of freedoms is not mentioned in the original text.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
