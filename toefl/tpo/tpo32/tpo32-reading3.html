            <b>Distributions of Tropical Bee Colonies</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>In 1977 ecologists Stephen Hubbell and Leslie Johnson recorded a <span class="underline">dramatic</span> example of how social interactions can produce and <span class="underline">enforce</span> <span class="underline">regular</span> spacing in a <span class="underline">population</span>. They studied competition and <span class="underline">nest</span> spacing in populations of stingless bees in <span class="underline">tropical</span> dry forests in Costa Rica. Though these bees do no <span class="underline">sting</span>, <span class="light"><span class="underline">rival</span></span> colonies of some <span class="underline">species</span> fight fiercely over <span class="underline">potential</span> nesting sites.</p>
          <p>Stingless bees are <span class="underline">abundant</span> in <span class="underline">tropical</span> and subtropical environments, where they gather <span class="underline">nectar</span> and <span class="underline">pollen</span> from a wide <span class="underline">variety</span> of flowers. They generally <span class="underline">nest</span> in trees and live in colonies made up of hundreds to thousands of workers. Hubbell and Johnson observed that some <span class="underline">species</span> of stingless bees are highly <span class="underline">aggressive</span> to members of their <span class="underline">species</span> from other colonies, while other <span class="underline">species</span> are not. <span class="underline">Aggressive</span> <span class="underline">species</span> usually <span class="underline">forage</span> in groups and feed mainly on flowers that <span class="underline">occur</span> in high-density clumps. Nonaggressive <span class="underline">species</span> feed singly or in small groups and on more widely distributed flowers.</p>
          <p>Hubbell and Johnson studied several <span class="underline">species</span> of stingless bees to <span class="underline">determine</span> whether there is a relationship between <span class="underline">aggressiveness</span> and patterns of <span class="underline">colony</span> <span class="underline">distribution</span>. They predicted that the colonies of <span class="underline">aggressive</span> <span class="underline">species</span> would show <span class="underline">regular</span> distributions, while those of nonaggressive <span class="underline">species</span> would show <span class="underline">random</span> or closely grouped (clumped) <span class="underline">distribution</span>. They concentrated their studies on a thirteen-hectare <span class="underline">tract</span> of <span class="underline">tropical</span> dry forest that contained <span class="underline">numerous</span> nests of nine <span class="underline">species</span> of stingless bees.</p>
          <p>Though Hubbell and Johnson were interested in how bee <span class="underline">behavior</span> might <span class="underline">affect</span> <span class="underline">colony</span> distributions, they recognized that the <span class="underline">availability</span> of <span class="underline">potential</span> <span class="underline">nest</span> sites for colonies could also 
<span class="underline">affect</span> distributions. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> So as one of the first steps in their study, they mapped the distributions of trees <span class="underline">suitable</span> for nesting. 
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> They found that <span class="underline">potential</span> <span class="underline">nest</span> trees were distributed randomly <span class="underline">through</span> the study area. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span> They also found that the number of <span class="underline">potential</span> <span class="underline">nest</span> sites was much greater than the number of bee colonies. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span> What did these measurements show the researchers? The number of colonies in the study area was not limited by <span class="underline">availability</span> of <span class="underline">suitable</span> trees, and a clumped or <span class="underline">regular</span> <span class="underline">distribution</span> of colonies was not <span class="underline">due</span> to an <span class="underline">underlying</span> clumped or <span class="underline">regular</span> <span class="underline">distribution</span> of <span class="underline">potential</span> <span class="underline">nest</span> sites.</p>
          <p>Hubbell and Johnson mapped the nests of five of the nine <span class="underline">species</span> of stingless bees accurately, and the nests of four of these <span class="underline">species</span> were distributed regularly. All four <span class="underline">species</span> with <span class="underline">regular</span> <span class="underline">nest</span> distributions were highly <span class="underline">aggressive</span> to bees from other colonies of their own <span class="underline">species</span>. The fifth <span class="underline">species</span> was not <span class="underline">aggressive</span>, and its nests were randomly distributed over the study area.</p>
          <p>The researchers also studied the <span class="underline">process</span> by which the <span class="underline">aggressive</span> <span class="underline">species</span> <span class="underline">establish</span> new colonies. Their observations provide insights into the mechanisms that <span class="underline">establish</span> and <span class="underline">maintain</span> the <span class="underline">regular</span> <span class="underline">nest</span> <span class="underline">distribution</span> of these <span class="underline">species</span>. <span class="underline">Aggressive</span> <span class="underline">species</span> apparently mark prospective <span class="underline">nest</span> sites with pheromones, chemical substances secreted by some animals for communication with other members of their <span class="underline">species</span>. The <span class="underline">pheromone</span> secreted by these stingless bees attracts and aggregates members of their <span class="underline">colony</span> to the prospective <span class="underline">nest</span> site; however, it also attracts workers from other nests.</p>
          <p>If workers from two different colonies arrive at the prospective <span class="underline">nest</span> at the same time, they may fight for <span class="underline">possession</span>. Fights may be escalated into protracted battles. The researchers observed battles over a <span class="underline">nest</span> tree that lasted for two weeks. Each <span class="underline">dawn</span>, fifteen to thirty workers from two <span class="underline">competing</span> colonies arrived at the contested <span class="underline">nest</span> site. The workers from the two colonies faced off in two swarms and displayed and fought with each other. In the displays, pairs of bees faced each other, slowly flew <span class="underline">vertically</span> to a height of about three meters, and then grappled each other to the ground. When the two bees hit the ground, they separated, faced off, and performed another <span class="underline">aerial</span> <span class="underline">display</span>. Bees did not <span class="underline">appear</span> to be injured in these fights, which were apparently ritualized. The two swarms abandoned the battle at about 8 or 9 A.M. each morning, only to re-form and begin again the next day just after <span class="underline">dawn</span>. While this <span class="underline">contest</span> over an unoccupied <span class="underline">nest</span> site produced no <span class="underline">obvious</span> <span class="underline">mortality</span>, fights over occupied nests sometimes kill over 1,000 bees in a single battle.</p>
