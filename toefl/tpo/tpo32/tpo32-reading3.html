          <h4 class="w3-center">Distributions of Tropical Bee Colonies</h4>
          <p>In 1977 ecologists Stephen Hubbell and Leslie Johnson recorded a <span class="highlight">dramatic</span> example of how social interactions can produce and <span class="highlight">enforce</span> <span class="highlight">regular</span> spacing in a <span class="highlight">population</span>. They studied competition and <span class="highlight">nest</span> spacing in populations of stingless bees in <span class="highlight">tropical</span> dry forests in Costa Rica. Though these bees do no <span class="highlight">sting</span>, <span class="highlight question1">rival</span> colonies of some <span class="highlight">species</span> fight fiercely over <span class="highlight">potential</span> nesting sites.</p>
          <p>Stingless bees are <span class="highlight">abundant</span> in <span class="highlight">tropical</span> and subtropical environments, where they gather <span class="highlight">nectar</span> and <span class="highlight">pollen</span> from a wide <span class="highlight">variety</span> of flowers. They generally <span class="highlight">nest</span> in trees and live in colonies made up of hundreds to thousands of workers. Hubbell and Johnson observed that some <span class="highlight">species</span> of stingless bees are highly <span class="highlight">aggressive</span> to members of their <span class="highlight">species</span> from other colonies, while other <span class="highlight">species</span> are not. <span class="highlight">Aggressive</span> <span class="highlight">species</span> usually <span class="highlight">forage</span> in groups and feed mainly on flowers that <span class="highlight">occur</span> in high-density clumps. Nonaggressive <span class="highlight">species</span> feed singly or in small groups and on more widely distributed flowers.</p>
          <p>Hubbell and Johnson studied several <span class="highlight">species</span> of stingless bees to <span class="highlight">determine</span> whether there is a relationship between <span class="highlight">aggressiveness</span> and patterns of <span class="highlight">colony</span> <span class="highlight">distribution</span>. They predicted that the colonies of <span class="highlight">aggressive</span> <span class="highlight">species</span> would show <span class="highlight">regular</span> distributions, while those of nonaggressive <span class="highlight">species</span> would show <span class="highlight">random</span> or closely grouped (clumped) <span class="highlight">distribution</span>. They concentrated their studies on a thirteen-hectare <span class="highlight">tract</span> of <span class="highlight">tropical</span> dry forest that contained <span class="highlight">numerous</span> nests of nine <span class="highlight">species</span> of stingless bees.</p>
          <p>Though Hubbell and Johnson were interested in how bee <span class="highlight">behavior</span> might <span class="highlight">affect</span> <span class="highlight">colony</span> distributions, they recognized that the <span class="highlight">availability</span> of <span class="highlight">potential</span> <span class="highlight">nest</span> sites for colonies could also 
<span class="highlight">affect</span> distributions. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> So as one of the first steps in their study, they mapped the distributions of trees <span class="highlight">suitable</span> for nesting. 
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> They found that <span class="highlight">potential</span> <span class="highlight">nest</span> trees were distributed randomly <span class="highlight">through</span> the study area. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span> They also found that the number of <span class="highlight">potential</span> <span class="highlight">nest</span> sites was much greater than the number of bee colonies. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span> What did these measurements show the researchers? <span class="question5">The number of colonies in the study area was not limited by <span class="highlight">availability</span> of <span class="highlight">suitable</span> trees, and a clumped or <span class="highlight">regular</span> <span class="highlight">distribution</span> of colonies was not <span class="highlight">due</span> to an <span class="highlight">underlying</span> clumped or <span class="highlight">regular</span> <span class="highlight">distribution</span> of <span class="highlight">potential</span> <span class="highlight">nest</span> sites.</span></p>
          <p>Hubbell and Johnson mapped the nests of five of the nine <span class="highlight">species</span> of stingless bees accurately, and the nests of four of these <span class="highlight">species</span> were distributed regularly. All four <span class="highlight">species</span> with <span class="highlight">regular</span> <span class="highlight">nest</span> distributions were highly <span class="highlight">aggressive</span> to bees from other colonies of their own <span class="highlight">species</span>. <span class="question7">The fifth <span class="highlight">species</span> was not <span class="highlight">aggressive</span>, and its nests were randomly distributed over the study area.</span></p>
          <p>The researchers also studied the <span class="highlight">process</span> by which the <span class="highlight">aggressive</span> <span class="highlight">species</span> <span class="highlight">establish</span> new colonies. Their observations provide <span class="question8">insights into</span> the mechanisms that <span class="highlight">establish</span> and <span class="highlight">maintain</span> the <span class="highlight">regular</span> <span class="highlight">nest</span> <span class="highlight">distribution</span> of these <span class="highlight">species</span>. <span class="highlight">Aggressive</span> <span class="highlight">species</span> apparently mark prospective <span class="highlight">nest</span> sites with pheromones, chemical substances secreted by some animals for communication with other members of their <span class="highlight">species</span>. The <span class="highlight">pheromone</span> secreted by these stingless bees attracts and aggregates members of their <span class="highlight">colony</span> to the prospective <span class="highlight">nest</span> site; however, it also attracts workers from other nests.</p>
          <p>If workers from two different colonies arrive at the prospective <span class="highlight">nest</span> at the same time, they may fight for <span class="highlight">possession</span>. Fights may be <span class="question10">escalated</span> into protracted battles. The researchers observed battles over a <span class="highlight">nest</span> tree that lasted for two weeks. Each <span class="highlight">dawn</span>, fifteen to thirty workers from two <span class="highlight">competing</span> colonies arrived at the contested <span class="highlight">nest</span> site. The workers from the two colonies faced off in two swarms and displayed and fought with each other. In the displays, pairs of bees faced each other, slowly flew <span class="highlight">vertically</span> to a height of about three meters, and then grappled each other to the ground. When the two bees hit the ground, they separated, faced off, and performed another <span class="highlight">aerial</span> <span class="highlight">display</span>. Bees did not <span class="highlight">appear</span> to be injured in these fights, which were apparently ritualized. The two swarms abandoned the battle at about 8 or 9 A.M. each morning, only to re-form and begin again the next day just after <span class="highlight">dawn</span>. While this <span class="highlight">contest</span> over an unoccupied <span class="highlight">nest</span> site produced no <span class="highlight">obvious</span> <span class="highlight">mortality</span>, fights over occupied nests sometimes kill over 1,000 bees in a single battle.</p>

              <p>This question needs to be combined with the assumptions in the previous paragraph. In the third paragraph they assume: They predicted that the colonies of aggressive species would show regular distributions, while those of nonaggressive species would show random or closely grouped (clumped) distribution. This detail of the shadows and the section in which they are located all say that the bees are offensive in a pattern of 4 nest rules, and that the bees are not aggressive in a random pattern of nests; that is, the prediction of the preceding text is affirmative. So corresponds to the B option.</p>
