They studied competition and <span class="highlight">nest</span> spacing in populations of stingless bees in <span class="highlight">tropical</span> dry forests in Costa Rica. Though these bees do no <span class="highlight">sting</span>, <span class="highlight question1">rival</span> colonies of some <span class="highlight">species</span> fight fiercely over <span class="highlight">potential</span> nesting sites.</p><p>Stingless bees are <span class="highlight">abundant</span> in <span class="highlight">tropical</span> and subtropical environments, where they gather <span class="highlight">nectar</span> and <span class="highlight">pollen</span> from a wide <span class="highlight">variety</span> of flowers. They generally <span class="highlight">nest</span> in trees and live in colonies made up of hundreds to thousands of workers. Hubbell and Johnson observed that some <span class="highlight">species</span> of stingless bees are highly <span class="highlight">aggressive</span> to members of their <span class="highlight">species</span> from other colonies, while other <span class="highlight">species</span> are not. <span class="highlight">Aggressive</span><span class="highlight">species</span> usually <span class="highlight">forage</span> in groups and feed mainly on flowers that <span class="highlight">occur</span> in high-density clumps. Nonaggressive <span class="highlight">species</span> feed singly or in small groups and on more widely distributed flowers.</p><p>Hubbell and Johnson studied several <span class="highlight">species</span> of stingless bees to <span class="highlight">determine</span> whether there is a relationship between <span class="highlight">aggressiveness</span> and patterns of <span class="highlight">colony</span><span class="highlight">distribution</span>. They predicted that the colonies of <span class="highlight">aggressive</span><span class="highlight">species</span> would show <span class="highlight">regular</span> distributions, while those of nonaggressive <span class="highlight">species</span> would show <span class="highlight">random</span> or closely grouped (clumped) <span class="highlight">distribution</span>. They concentrated their studies on a thirteen-hectare <span class="highlight">tract</span> of <span class="highlight">tropical</span> dry forest that contained <span class="highlight">numerous</span> nests of nine <span class="highlight">species</span> of stingless bees.</p><p>Though Hubbell and Johnson were interested in how bee <span class="highlight">behavior</span> might <span class="highlight">affect</span><span class="highlight">colony</span> distributions, they recognized that the <span class="highlight">availability</span> of <span class="highlight">potential</span><span class="highlight">nest</span> sites for colonies could also 
<span class="highlight">affect</span> distributions. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> So as one of the first steps in their study, they mapped the distributions of trees <span class="highlight">suitable</span> for nesting. 
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> They found that <span class="highlight">potential</span><span class="highlight">nest</span> trees were distributed randomly <span class="highlight">through</span> the study area. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span> They also found that the number of <span class="highlight">potential</span><span class="highlight">nest</span> sites was much greater than the number of bee colonies. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span> What did these measurements show the researchers? <span class="question5">The number of colonies in the study area was not limited by <span class="highlight">availability</span> of <span class="highlight">suitable</span> trees, and a clumped or <span class="highlight">regular</span><span class="highlight">distribution</span> of colonies was not <span class="highlight">due</span> to an <span class="highlight">underlying</span> clumped or <span class="highlight">regular</span><span class="highlight">distribution</span> of <span class="highlight">potential</span><span class="highlight">nest</span> sites.</span></p><p>Hubbell and Johnson mapped the nests of five of the nine <span class="highlight">species</span> of stingless bees accurately, and the nests of four of these <span class="highlight">species</span> were distributed regularly. All four <span class="highlight">species</span> with <span class="highlight">regular</span><span class="highlight">nest</span> distributions were highly <span class="highlight">aggressive</span> to bees from other colonies of their own <span class="highlight">species</span>. <span class="question7">The fifth <span class="highlight">species</span> was not <span class="highlight">aggressive</span>, and its nests were randomly distributed over the study area.</span></p><p>The researchers also studied the <span class="highlight">process</span> by which the <span class="highlight">aggressive</span><span class="highlight">species</span><span class="highlight">establish</span> new colonies. Their observations provide <span class="question8">insights into</span> the mechanisms that <span class="highlight">establish</span> and <span class="highlight">maintain</span> the <span class="highlight">regular</span><span class="highlight">nest</span><span class="highlight">distribution</span> of these <span class="highlight">species</span>. <span class="highlight">Aggressive</span><span class="highlight">species</span> apparently mark prospective <span class="highlight">nest</span> sites with pheromones, chemical substances secreted by some animals for communication with other members of their <span class="highlight">species</span>. The <span class="highlight">pheromone</span> secreted by these stingless bees attracts and aggregates members of their <span class="highlight">colony</span> to the prospective <span class="highlight">nest</span> site; however, it also attracts workers from other nests.</p><p>If workers from two different colonies arrive at the prospective <span class="highlight">nest</span> at the same time, they may fight for <span class="highlight">possession</span>. Fights may be <span class="question10">escalated</span> into protracted battles. The researchers observed battles over a <span class="highlight">nest</span> tree that lasted for two weeks. Each <span class="highlight">dawn</span>, fifteen to thirty workers from two <span class="highlight">competing</span> colonies arrived at the contested <span class="highlight">nest</span> site. The workers from the two colonies faced off in two swarms and displayed and fought with each other. In the displays, pairs of bees faced each other, slowly flew <span class="highlight">vertically</span> to a height of about three meters, and then grappled each other to the ground. When the two bees hit the ground, they separated, faced off, and performed another <span class="highlight">aerial</span><span class="highlight">display</span>. Bees did not <span class="highlight">appear</span> to be injured in these fights, which were apparently ritualized. The two swarms abandoned the battle at about 8 or 9 A.M. each morning, only to re-form and begin again the next day just after <span class="highlight">dawn</span>. While this <span class="highlight">contest</span> over an unoccupied <span class="highlight">nest</span> site produced no <span class="highlight">obvious</span><span class="highlight">mortality</span>, fights over occupied nests sometimes kill over 1,000 bees in a single battle.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">rival</span>" in the passage is closest in leaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. established</p><p>B. competing</p><p>C. nearby</p><p>D. different</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Rival: competitive, corresponding to the competing option of the B option.</p><p>Corresponding to the original: Through these bees do no sting, rival colonies of some species fight fiercely over potential nesting sites.</p><p>Most of the classmates may have handwashing rival as a noun noun meaning "opponent, competitor." Then it is not difficult to guess the adjective part of speech from this part of speech. In addition, it can also be inferred from the context of this sentence, mainly that these species will compete for the site, then the rape is to describe the relationship between these species, it is clear that the only expression of this meaning is B Options. The established (determined, established) of the A option, the nearby (closed) of the C selected, and the different (different) of the D option are not suitable.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 2, some species of stingless bees are aggressive mainly toward</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Nonaggressive bees that forage on the same flowers</p><p>B. Aggressive bees of other species</p><p>C. Bees from their own colony</p><p>D. Bees of their own species from different colonies</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The third sentence of this paragraph was targeted by aggressive: Hubbell and Johnson observed that some species of stingless bees are highly aggressive to members of their species from other colonies, while other species are not. This sentence clearly states "aggressive to members of "Their species from other colonies" is said to be aggressive towards the bees of the same species, matching the D answer. The A option is inconsistent with the original text. The B option is contrary to the original text. The C option is not mentioned in the original text.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 3, Hubbell and Johnson hypothesized that</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. the distribution pattern of bee colonies determines the degree of aggressiveness the bees display</p><p>B. nests of nonaggressive bees have either a random or a clumped distribution, while nests of aggressive bees have a regular distribution</p><p>C. nests of nonaggressive bees are generally both closer together and more regularly distributed than those of aggressive bees</p><p>D. nests of aggressive bees tend to be more regular in shape than those of nonaggressive bees</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Without good positioning words, the whole paragraph discusses their hypotheses, and the answers appear in the second sentence of the paragraph: The predicted that the colonies of a foul species would show regular distributions, while those of nonaggressive species would show random or closely grouped. (clumped) distribution. As can be seen from this sentence, they predict that the aggressive population has a regular distribution whereas the non-aggressive population exhibits a random or clustered distribution. This is exactly the same as the B option. ACD is not mentioned in the original text.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, why did Hubbell and Johnson begin their study by mapping all the potential nest sites?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To determine whether the availability of potential nest sites played a role in the distribution of bee colonies</p><p>B. To know exactly where in the study area the colonies of all the different bee species were located</p><p>C. To be sure that suitable nesting sites were equally available in all parts of study area</p><p>D. To find out whether different species of bees preferred different types of trees as potential nest sites</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The mapping uses the mapping to locate the second sentence of the paragraph, but this sentence only describes the mapping as their first step, but from the beginning of the sentence, we can know that the reason should appear in the previous sentence:</p><p>Although Hubbell and Johnson were interested in how bee behavior might affect colony distributions, they recognized that the availability of potential nest sites for colonies could also affect distributions.</p><p>The first sentence of this paragraph says: They realize that potential lairs also affect distribution. This is why they plotted for all potential nest locations. Match the A option.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The limited number of colonies was not due to the distribution or availability of potential nesting sites.</p><p>B. There was no lack of suitable trees or potential nesting sites in the study area.</p><p>C. The number of nests was directly related to the number or the distribution of suitable trees.</p><p>D. Neither the number nor the distribution of colonies could be explained by the availability of suitable nest sites.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The main logic of this sentence is parallel logic, which expresses two meanings: 1. The number of actual nests is not limited by the number of potentials; 2 The distribution of groups or rules is also not affected by the distribution pattern of potential nests. A wrong option In the limited number of colonies, the original sentence is not mentioned; the B option is wrong because the original sentence meaning is completely irrelevant; the C option is wrong in the opposite meaning of the original sentence; the two negatives of the D option neither nor fully represent the relationship in the original sentence, correct .</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 5, Hubbell and Johnson determined</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. the order in which the colonies in the study area had been established</p><p>B. the level of aggressiveness of each of the nine species</p><p>C. the distribution pattern of the nests of five of the nine species</p><p>D. the number of colonies of each of the nine species</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Using the name of the person to locate the first sentence of the first sentence of the paragraph: Hubbell and Johnson mapped the nests of five of the nine species of stingless bees accurately, and the nests of four of these species were distributed regularly. Accurately describes the pattern of 5 nests in 9 nests. This corresponds directly to the C option. The other three options are not mentioned in the original text.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the author indicate that "<span class="highlight">The fifth species was not aggressive, and its nests were randomly distributed over the study area</span>"?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To identify research results that contradicted Hubbell and Johnson's original hypothesis</p><p>B. To indicate that research results confirmed that nest distribution was related to aggressiveness</p><p>C. To introduce the hypothesis that, within the same species, not all colonies are aggressive</p><p>D. To point out that both aggressive and nonaggressive species are equally successful at finding nest sites</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="The fifth species was not aggressive, and its nests were randomly distributed over the study area B"><p>This question needs to be combined with the assumptions in the previous paragraph. In the third paragraph they assume: They predicted that the colonies of aggressive species would show regular distributions, while those of nonaggressive species would show random or closely grouped (clumped) distribution. This detail of the shadows and the section in which they are located all say that the bees are offensive in a pattern of 4 nest rules, and that the bees are not aggressive in a random pattern of nests; that is, the prediction of the preceding text is affirmative. So corresponds to the B option.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The phrase "<span class="highlight"><span class="question8">insights into</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. tools to study</p><p>B. opportunities for</p><p>C. evidence of</p><p>D. an understanding of</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" D"><p>Insight: insight; comprehension, an understanding of the D option.</p><p>Corresponding to the original: The observations provide <span class="question8">insights into</span> the mechanisms that establish and maintain the regular nest distribution of these species. First of all, attention is paid to the structure of the insight, where in is the entry, and sight is the line of sight. Through its own structure, it can infer the meaning of the insight. Can also be inferred from the sentence before and after collocation, observation provides insights for the mechanism. Combining these two comprehensive judgments, the D option is most appropriate.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 6, what is one result of using pheromones to mark nest sites?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The use of pheromones tends to result in nest clumping.</p><p>B. Pheromones attract animals other than bees to prospective nest sites.</p><p>C. Pheromones tend to make bees aggressive.</p><p>D. Pheromones secreted by bees of one colony also attract bees of other colonies</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>Using pheromones to locate the last sentence of the paragraph: The pheromone secreted by these stingless bees attracts and aggregates members of their colony to the prospective nest site; However, it also attracts workers from other nests. Members can also attract worker bees from other nests. This corresponds to the D option. ABC is not mentioned in the original text.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question10">escalated</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. intensified</p><p>B. transformed</p><p>C. combined</p><p>D. lengthened</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" A"><p>Escalate: Gradually increase, gradually increase, corresponding to the A option intensify (enhance) enhancement; (make) intensify.</p><p>Corresponding to the original: Fights may be <span class="question10">escalated</span> into protracted battles.</p><p>First of all, escal has the meaning of a ladder. Then you can use this to judge the meaning of escsalated. Of course, it can also be inferred from the context of context. As I said above, if two groups of bees arrive at the same time, they will fight to fight. The fight will be <span class="question10">escalated</span> into battle. From this point of view, the tense has become severe. Of these four options, the only option that can reflect this transformation is the A option. The B option transform, change, C option combine, and D option lengthen are not appropriate.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Paragraph 7 supports which of the following ideas about fights over occupied nests?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They are more violent than battles over unoccupied nest sites.</p><p>B. They mostly occur between colonies of different species.</p><p>C. They are more frequent than battles over unoccupied sites.</p><p>D. They last longer than battles over unoccupied sites do.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>Occupied to locate, to the last sentence of the paragraph:While this contest over an unoccupied nest site produces no obvious mortality, fights over occupied nests sometimes kill over 1,000 bees in a single battle.</p><p>From this statement, it can be seen that there is no obvious casualty in the fight for an empty nest, but fighting for the nests will cause corpses. This matches the A option.
