            <span class="time" data-times="8.84" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to a <span class="highlight">conversation</span> between a student and an <span class="highlight">anthropology</span> professor.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.14" data-time="8.84">[00:08.84]</span>Professor: So how was the <span class="highlight">field</span> <span class="highlight">trip</span> to the Nature Center yesterday? <span class="time" data-times="2.25" data-time="13.98">[00:13.98]</span>You are in that <span class="highlight">biology</span> class, aren't you?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.94" data-time="16.23">[00:16.23]</span>Student: Yeah. I am. The <span class="highlight">trip</span> was amazing. <span class="time" data-times="5.11" data-time="18.17">[00:18.17]</span>We took a <span class="highlight">hike</span> <span class="highlight">through</span> the woods and our guide <span class="highlight">pointed</span> out all kinds of animal and plant <span class="highlight">species</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.29" data-time="23.28">[00:23.28]</span>She could <span class="highlight">identify</span> every bird, every tree...I have to tell you.<span class="time" data-times="2.13" data-time="26.57">[00:26.57]</span> I was very impressed with her knowledge.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.41" data-time="28.7">[00:28.70]</span>Professor: I am glad to hear you enjoyed the <span class="highlight">trip</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.38" data-time="31.11">[00:31.11]</span>Student: Well, I am interested in getting an <span class="highlight">advanced</span> <span class="highlight">degree</span> in forestry after I graduate from here. <span class="time" data-times="2.1" data-time="35.49">[00:35.49]</span>So I love all this <span class="highlight">stuff</span>.<span class="time" data-times="4.39" data-time="37.59">[00:37.59]</span> And actually, yesterday's <span class="highlight">trip</span> got me thinking about my research paper for your class.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.27" data-time="41.98">[00:41.98]</span>Professor: Wonderful! Tell me more.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.06" data-time="44.25">[00:44.25]</span>Student: So our guide was talking about how the human need for resources had shaped the environment. <span class="time" data-times="5.17" data-time="50.31">[00:50.31]</span>And I just assumed that the human <span class="highlight">impact</span> on the environment was always <span class="highlight">destructive</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.6" data-time="55.48">[00:55.48]</span>Professor: Ah...but that's not necessarily true.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.51" data-time="58.08">[00:58.08]</span>Student: Yeah. That's what she was telling us. <span class="time" data-times="12.02" data-time="59.59">[00:59.59]</span>She said there's <span class="highlight">archaeological</span> <span class="highlight">evidence</span> that some <span class="highlight">prehistoric</span> cultures relied heavily on dead wood for <span class="highlight">fuel</span>, or...um...just cut off some of the branches of trees <span class="highlight">instead</span> of killing the whole tree.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.58" data-time="71.61">[01:11.61]</span>Professor: It is so funny you mentioned that.<span class="time" data-times="11.55" data-time="74.19">[01:14.19]</span> I was just reading an article about an <span class="highlight">archaeological</span> site in <span class="highlight">Turkey</span> where scientists found <span class="highlight">evidence</span> that <span class="highlight">ancient</span> people had been harvesting the branches from pistachio and almond trees. <span class="time" data-times="7.52" data-time="85.74">[01:25.74]</span>Of <span class="highlight">course</span>, when you <span class="highlight">prune</span> these trees, cutting off just the branches like that, you are actually encouraging more growth! <span class="time" data-times="2.6" data-time="93.26">[01:33.26]</span>And you end up with a bigger crop of nuts. <span class="time" data-times="3.98" data-time="95.86">[01:35.86]</span>So this was a <span class="highlight">pretty</span> smart <span class="highlight">strategy</span> for collecting wood.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.79" data-time="99.84">[01:39.84]</span>Student: See, that's what I'd like to write about.<span class="time" data-times="5.28" data-time="101.63">[01:41.63]</span> I want to look at <span class="highlight">ancient</span> methods of wood harvesting that didn't result in the <span class="highlight">destruction</span> of the whole forest.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.93" data-time="106.91">[01:46.91]</span>Professor: Hmm...so you want to write your entire paper on wood harvesting?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.09" data-time="112.84">[01:52.84]</span>Student: Is...is that a problem?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.69" data-time="114.93">[01:54.93]</span>Professor: Well, it's certainly a timely topic.<span class="time" data-times="2.83" data-time="117.62">[01:57.62]</span> Researchers are investigating this now. <span class="time" data-times="5.29" data-time="120.45">[02:00.45]</span>Uh...it's just that...well...I am not sure how it fits with the <span class="highlight">assignment</span>.<span class="time" data-times="5.13" data-time="125.74">[02:05.74]</span>Remember you are supposed to be focusing on a <span class="highlight">particular</span> <span class="highlight">culture</span> or <span class="highlight">region</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.56" data-time="130.87">[02:10.87]</span>Student: Yeah. Um...actually I was planning on writing about the wood harvesting practices of the people who lived here. <span class="time" data-times="5.45" data-time="137.43">[02:17.43]</span>You know, the Native Americans who were living in this area and what that might tell us about how they lived.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.45" data-time="142.88">[02:22.88]</span>Professor: OK. Well, that's a possibility. <span class="time" data-times="6.8" data-time="146.33">[02:26.33]</span>I just want to make sure you can find enough information on that topic to write a well-developed paper. <span class="time" data-times="2.74" data-time="153.13">[02:33.13]</span>I'd like you to get started on your research right away. <span class="time" data-times="4.91" data-time="155.87">[02:35.87]</span>Maybe <span class="highlight">even</span> talk to that nature guide and show me what information you can find. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="160.78">[02:40.78]</span>Then we can talk about whether or not your topic will work.</p>
