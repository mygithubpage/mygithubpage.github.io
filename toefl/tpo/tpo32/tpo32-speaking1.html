It greatly facilitates my interpersonal skills by granting more chances to talk with others members. You know, I used to be a very shy and introverted person. However, group study that I was involved for different subjects enables me discuss various topics such as ways to solve a particular math problems. In addition, group study enhances my efficacy and offers me broader views. For instance, once I and other members of economics class prepared for a research paper. If I work alone, it is very likely that it will take me 10 more days to gather related materials and 2 weeks to finish it. Nevertheless, with collective efforts, the whole group spent no more than a week to accomplish the paper.</p></article></section></main></body></html>
