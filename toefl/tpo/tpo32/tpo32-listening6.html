          <p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.02" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in an architectural <span class="underline">history</span> class. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.18" data-time="7.02">[00:07.02]</span>Professor: So last week we started our unit on <span class="underline">residential</span> <span class="underline">architecture</span> in the United States. <span class="time" data-times="6.57" data-time="13.2">[00:13.20]</span>So today we'll be surveying a number of architects who made contributions to <span class="underline">residential</span> <span class="underline">architecture</span> in the 19th <span class="underline">century</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.62" data-time="19.77">[00:19.77]</span>Now, it's <span class="underline">worth</span> noting that people who designed homes at that time probably had to <span class="underline">deal</span> with a certain <span class="underline">amount</span> of discouragement. <span class="time" data-times="10.12" data-time="27.39">[00:27.39]</span>Since there were other architects who thought it was more respectable to design the kind of buildings...and maybe other structures...that were less...less <span class="underline">utilitarian</span> in their <span class="underline">function</span>.<span class="time" data-times="14.55" data-time="37.51">[00:37.51]</span>In fact, an article from an 1876 <span class="underline">issue</span> of a <span class="underline">journal</span> called The American <span class="underline">Architect</span> and Building News stated that, and this is a <span class="underline">quote</span>, they stated that "the planning of houses isn't <span class="underline">architecture</span> at all"! </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.05" data-time="52.06">[00:52.06]</span>So keep that <span class="underline">journal</span> article in <span class="underline">mind</span> as we look at the work of an <span class="underline">architect</span> named Harriet Morrison Irwin. <span class="time" data-times="6.03" data-time="59.11">[00:59.11]</span>Harriet Morrison Irwin was from the South, born in North Carolina in 1828.<span class="time" data-times="4.07" data-time="65.14">[01:05.14]</span>At the time, there weren't many architects from the southern United States. <span class="time" data-times="3.05" data-time="69.21">[01:09.21]</span>And as you might imagine, very few of them were women.<span class="time" data-times="4.15" data-time="72.26">[01:12.26]</span>So Irwin was really a <span class="underline">pretty</span> <span class="underline">exceptional</span> case. <span class="time" data-times="3.07" data-time="76.41">[01:16.41]</span>And she wasn't <span class="underline">even</span> formally trained as an <span class="underline">architect</span>.<span class="time" data-times="4.08" data-time="79.48">[01:19.48]</span>Her educational background was in <span class="underline">literature</span>. Yes, Vicky? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.03" data-time="83.56">[01:23.56]</span>Student: So she just had like...unnatural gift for <span class="underline">architecture</span>? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.19" data-time="88.59">[01:28.59]</span>Professor: Yes. She was actually a writer for several years. <span class="time" data-times="4.89" data-time="91.78">[01:31.78]</span>But she did have a penchant for math and <span class="underline">engineering</span>, so she read a lot about it on her own. <span class="time" data-times="5.53" data-time="96.67">[01:36.67]</span>Um...especially the architectural essays written by the British <span class="underline">critic</span> – John Ruskin. <span class="time" data-times="2.92" data-time="102.2">[01:42.20]</span>And John Ruskin believed what? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.28" data-time="105.12">[01:45.12]</span>Student: Um...that buildings should have a lot of <span class="underline">access</span> to the outdoors, to nature.<span class="time" data-times="5.33" data-time="110.4">[01:50.40]</span>Ruskin said that being close to nature was great for people's <span class="underline">mental</span> and <span class="underline">physical</span> health. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.15" data-time="115.73">[01:55.73]</span>Professor: Right! So that was an influence. <span class="time" data-times="7.74" data-time="118.88">[01:58.88]</span>Now, Harriet Irwin's <span class="underline">contribution</span> to <span class="underline">architecture</span> was <span class="underline">relatively</span> <span class="underline">minor</span> but still quite interesting and <span class="underline">unique</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.65" data-time="126.62">[02:06.62]</span>She designed a house with a hexagonal <span class="underline">shape</span>. Josh? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.19" data-time="131.27">[02:11.27]</span>Student: A house with six sides? <span class="time" data-times="2.93" data-time="133.46">[02:13.46]</span> <span class="underline">Instead</span> of the <span class="underline">standard</span>, you know, four-sided home? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.47" data-time="136.39">[02:16.39]</span>Professor: Yeah. The rooms inside the house were also hexagonal, six-sided.<span class="time" data-times="18.99" data-time="141.86">[02:21.86]</span>So one important thing was that the rooms were arranged around a chimney in the center of the house, which could provide heat for the whole house <span class="underline">through</span> flues, uh, small <span class="underline">air</span> passageways into each room, as <span class="underline">opposed</span> to having a fireplace in every room, which would <span class="underline">require</span> more cleaning and make the <span class="underline">air</span> inside the house dirtier. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.53" data-time="160.85">[02:40.85]</span>The house's <span class="underline">shape</span> also allowed for more windows. <span class="time" data-times="6.13" data-time="164.38">[02:44.38]</span>Each room had a large wall that could fit a <span class="underline">couple</span> of big winters, giving every room a nice view of the outdoors. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.05" data-time="170.51">[02:50.51]</span>Student: Plus there would be good <span class="underline">airflow</span> <span class="underline">through</span> the house. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.03" data-time="173.56">[02:53.56]</span>Professor: Yes. In warm weather when you can open all the windows. <span class="time" data-times="6.69" data-time="176.59">[02:56.59]</span>Good. The doors to the house as well...uh...the house didn't have a main <span class="underline">entrance</span> or any hallways.<span class="time" data-times="7.09" data-time="183.28">[03:03.28]</span>So there could be a <span class="underline">couple</span> of <span class="underline">entry</span> doors in different places, which like the windows, provided ready <span class="underline">access</span> to the outdoors. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.08" data-time="190.37">[03:10.37]</span>So, what other advantages might there be to hexagonal rooms? <span class="time" data-times="3.14" data-time="194.45">[03:14.45]</span>OK. Think about cleaning. <span class="time" data-times="2.77" data-time="197.59">[03:17.59]</span>What part of a room is usually the hardest to clean? <span class="time" data-times="1.47" data-time="200.36">[03:20.36]</span>Like...to <span class="underline">sweep</span> with a <span class="underline">broom</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.84" data-time="201.83">[03:21.83]</span>Student: Oh! The corners. Because in <span class="underline">square</span> or <span class="underline">rectangular</span> rooms, the corners are at 90 <span class="underline">degree</span> angles. <span class="time" data-times="2.79" data-time="208.67">[03:28.67]</span>It's hard to <span class="underline">reach</span> all the dust that gathers in the corners. <span class="time" data-times="8.49" data-time="211.46">[03:31.46]</span>But if Irwin's rooms were closer to a circle than a <span class="underline">square</span>, it would be easier to <span class="underline">reach</span> all the dust and dirt with a <span class="underline">broom</span>. Right? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.52" data-time="219.95">[03:39.95]</span>Professor: Exactly. Now, um...biographers who wrote about Irwin in the 19th <span class="underline">century</span>, I feel, <span class="underline">sort</span> of downplayed the <span class="underline">ingenuity</span> of her design. <span class="time" data-times="13.26" data-time="229.47">[03:49.47]</span>But I think if she had designed this house today, the same biographers would praise her for coming up with a floor plan that emphasized <span class="underline">function</span>, <span class="underline">efficient</span> <span class="underline">function</span> of a house, as well as a design that's <span class="underline">creative</span> and <span class="underline">unique</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.38" data-time="242.73">[04:02.73]</span>In any cases, three houses were built in Irwin's time that used her hexagonal design. <span class="time" data-times="9.82" data-time="248.11">[04:08.11]</span>And in 1869, when she was 41, Irwin became the first woman in the United States to receive a <span class="underline">patent</span> for an architectural design. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="257.93">[04:17.93]</span>And that speaks volumes if you ask me.  </p>
