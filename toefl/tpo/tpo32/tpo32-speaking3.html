I think the university should run a free bus service for students between campus and the airport during the breaks. This would help the students, since there is no public transportation between campus and the airport. In order to provide service to the airport, some of the buses that normally run between campus buildings when classes are in session could run between the school and the airport during the school breaks.
Sincerely,

What do you think about her idea?</p><p>(man) I think it'd be great. It'd make things much less expensive cause our campus is located outside the city. If you can't get a friend with a car to give you a ride, there is no other way to get to the airport. And your only choice is to take a taxi.</p><p>(woman) I know. I've had to take a taxi before and it's pretty expensive.</p><p>(man) Yeah, like thirty or forty dollars which is a lot especially for students.</p><p>(woman) Yeah, definitely</p><p>(man) And I think it would work what she's suggesting. I mean, there is less need for buses on campus during that time to take students between the buildings.</p><p>(woman) You mean because classes are over then?</p><p>(man) Yeah, exactly, there might some final exams still going on but regular classes won't be meeting. There are much fewer students left on campus and they don't need to get around campus that often.</p><p>(woman) Yeah, I guess they're just making occasional trips to take exams or go to the library or gym or whatever.</p><p>(man) Right, it shouldn't cause any problems for anyone who still needs to get around campus.</p></article></section><section id="question"><h4>Question</h4><p>The man expresses his opinion about the proposal described in the letter. Briefly summarize the proposal then state his opinion about the proposal and explain the reasons he gives for holding that opinion. </p></section><section id="sample-response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><article><p>Well, the proposal says that university should run a free bus service for students between the campus and the airport during the breaks for two main reasons. Accordingly, the man agrees with the proposal and its reasons. First, he thinks that it's going to save much money for the students because their campus is kinda far away from the airport, and if the students can't find a friend to get a ride, the only choice for them is to take a taxi which usually costs the students an arm and a leg. Secondly, he thinks that there's less need for buses on campus during school breaks because regular classes don't meet by then, so it wouldn't cause any problem to the students making occasional trips to get around campus. All in all, the man agrees with the proposal and its reasons stated. (140 words)</p></article></section></main></body></html>
