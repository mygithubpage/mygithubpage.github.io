            <span class="time" data-times="7.79" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in an <span class="highlight">archaeology</span> class.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="14.18" data-time="7.79">[00:07.79]</span>Professor: One of the important aspects of the <span class="highlight">field</span> of <span class="highlight">archaeology</span>...one of the things that excites me about the <span class="highlight">field</span>...is that seemingly <span class="highlight">insignificant</span> things can suddenly change the way we think about a <span class="highlight">culture</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.38" data-time="21.97">[00:21.97]</span>We are always making new discoveries that have the <span class="highlight">potential</span> to <span class="highlight">challenge</span> widely held beliefs.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.68" data-time="28.35">[00:28.35]</span>Take something like the banana, for example. <span class="time" data-times="7.54" data-time="31.03">[00:31.03]</span>It turns out that this ordinary fruit may be forcing scientists to rewrite <span class="highlight">major</span> parts of African <span class="highlight">history</span>! <span class="time" data-times="4.95" data-time="38.57">[00:38.57]</span>We know the bananas were introduced to Africa via Southeast Asia. <span class="time" data-times="5.99" data-time="43.52">[00:43.52]</span>And until recently, we thought we knew when they were introduced-about 2,000 years ago.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.97" data-time="49.51">[00:49.51]</span>But discoveries in Uganda, that's in Eastern Africa, are throwing that into question. <span class="time" data-times="8.42" data-time="56.48">[00:56.48]</span>Scientists studying soil samples there discovered <span class="highlight">evidence</span> of bananas in <span class="highlight">sediment</span> that was 5,000 years old!</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.24" data-time="64.9">[01:04.90]</span>Now, let me explain that it's not easy to find traces of <span class="highlight">ancient</span> bananas. <span class="time" data-times="5.64" data-time="70.14">[01:10.14]</span>The fruit is <span class="highlight">soft</span> and doesn't have any hard seeds that might <span class="highlight">survive</span> over the ages. <span class="time" data-times="5.38" data-time="75.78">[01:15.78]</span>So after 5,000 years, you might think there would be nothing left to study. <span class="time" data-times="8.41" data-time="81.16">[01:21.16]</span>Well, fortunately for archaeologists, all plants <span class="highlight">contain</span> what are called phytoliths in their stems and leaves.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.54" data-time="89.57">[01:29.57]</span>Phytoliths are <span class="highlight">microscopic</span> structures made of <span class="highlight">silica</span>, and they do not <span class="highlight">decay</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.33" data-time="96.11">[01:36.11]</span>When plants die and rot away, they leave these phytoliths behind. <span class="time" data-times="9.44" data-time="101.44">[01:41.44]</span>Because different plants produce differently shaped phytoliths, scientists can <span class="highlight">identify</span> the type of plant from <span class="highlight">ancient</span> remains.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="7.32" data-time="110.88">[01:50.88]</span>So, those scientists in Uganda, dug down to sediments that were 5,000 years old. <span class="time" data-times="2.1" data-time="118.2">[01:58.20]</span>And what do you think they found?<span class="time" data-times="2.23" data-time="120.3">[02:00.30]</span> Banana phytoliths! <span class="time" data-times="6.84" data-time="122.53">[02:02.53]</span> <span class="highlight">Obviously</span> this meant that we had to rethink our <span class="highlight">previous</span> notions about when bananas first arrived in Africa. <span class="time" data-times="4.34" data-time="129.37">[02:09.37]</span>But, well, this discovery had other implications for <span class="highlight">history</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="7.82" data-time="133.71">[02:13.71]</span>As soon as bananas <span class="highlight">appear</span> in the <span class="highlight">archaeological</span> <span class="highlight">record</span>, we know we have <span class="highlight">contact</span> between Africa and Southeast Asia. <span class="time" data-times="5.99" data-time="141.53">[02:21.53]</span>It would <span class="highlight">appear</span> now that this <span class="highlight">contact</span> occurred much earlier than <span class="highlight">previously</span> thought.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="10.26" data-time="147.52">[02:27.52]</span>Al...although...now here's where the uncertainty comes in...we don't really have any <span class="highlight">solid</span> <span class="highlight">evidence</span> of <span class="highlight">trade</span> between the peoples of these two regions that long ago. <span class="time" data-times="12.51" data-time="157.78">[02:37.78]</span>Presumably, if people were bringing bananas to Africa, they'd also be bringing other things too: <span class="highlight">pottery</span>, tools...all sorts of objects made for <span class="highlight">trade</span> or daily use. <span class="time" data-times="4.39" data-time="170.29">[02:50.29]</span>But any such <span class="highlight">evidence</span> is missing from the <span class="highlight">archaeological</span> <span class="highlight">record</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="9.83" data-time="174.68">[02:54.68]</span>The early <span class="highlight">appearance</span> of bananas also suggests that <span class="highlight">agriculture</span> began in this part of Africa earlier than scientists imagined. <span class="time" data-times="6.23" data-time="184.51">[03:04.51]</span>You see, bananas, at <span class="highlight">least</span> the <span class="highlight">edible</span> kind, can't grow without human intervention. <span class="time" data-times="1.89" data-time="190.74">[03:10.74]</span>They have to be <span class="highlight">cultivated</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.11" data-time="192.63">[03:12.63]</span>People need to plant them and <span class="highlight">care</span> for them. <span class="time" data-times="8.51" data-time="195.74">[03:15.74]</span>So if bananas were present in Uganda 5,000 years ago, we would have to <span class="highlight">assume</span>...that...that...that someone planted them.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.06" data-time="204.25">[03:24.25]</span>But, there are questions about this too.<span class="time" data-times="8.58" data-time="207.31">[03:27.31]</span> We know that bananas can be a <span class="highlight">staple</span> food that can support large populations, as they did in Uganda in the more recent past. <span class="time" data-times="9.82" data-time="215.89">[03:35.89]</span>If bananas were grown thousands of years ago, why don't we see <span class="highlight">evidence</span> of large populations thriving in the area earlier?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.65" data-time="225.71">[03:45.71]</span>So, we are left with this mystery. <span class="time" data-times="9.97" data-time="229.36">[03:49.36]</span>We have what appears to be strong biological <span class="highlight">evidence</span> that bananas were being <span class="highlight">cultivated</span> in Uganda as early as 5,000 years ago. <span class="time" data-times="5.73" data-time="239.33">[03:59.33]</span>But we are missing other kinds of <span class="highlight">evidence</span> that would conclusively prove that this is so.<span class="time" data-times="3.39" data-time="245.06">[04:05.06]</span>Clearly, more research needs to be done. <span class="time" data-times="3.54" data-time="248.45">[04:08.45]</span>Perhaps by some young scholars from this university? <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="251.99">[04:11.99]</span>At <span class="highlight">least</span> give it some thought.</p>
