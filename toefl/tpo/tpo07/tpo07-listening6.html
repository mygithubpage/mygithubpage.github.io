OK? </p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.44" data-time="93">[01:33.00]</span>Now the next type of movement we will talk about is called: deformation. <span class="time" data-times="5.01" data-time="97.44">[01:37.44]</span>You've already known that ice is <span class="highlight">brittle</span>, if you hit it with a <span class="highlight">hammer</span>, it will <span class="highlight">shatter</span> like glass. <span class="time" data-times="5.1" data-time="102.45">[01:42.45]</span>But ice is also <span class="highlight">plastic</span>, it can change <span class="highlight">shape</span> without breaking. <span class="time" data-times="9.65" data-time="107.55">[01:47.55]</span>If you leave, for example, a bar of ice supported only at one end, the end, the unsupported end will <span class="highlight">deform</span> under its own weight. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.45" data-time="117.2">[01:57.20]</span>It'll kind of <span class="highlight">flatten</span> out at one end, get distorted, deformed. <span class="time" data-times="4.08" data-time="121.65">[02:01.65]</span>Think of deformation as a very slow oozing. <span class="time" data-times="5.54" data-time="125.73">[02:05.73]</span>Depending on the stresses on the <span class="highlight">glacier</span>, the ice crystals <span class="highlight">within</span> it reorganize. <span class="time" data-times="7.47" data-time="131.27">[02:11.27]</span>And during this re-organization the ice crystals realign in a way that allows them to <span class="highlight">slide</span> pass each other. <span class="time" data-times="4.7" data-time="138.74">[02:18.74]</span>And so the <span class="highlight">glacier</span> oozes downhill without any ice actually <span class="highlight">melting</span>. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="11.81" data-time="143.44">[02:23.44]</span>Now, there are a <span class="highlight">couple</span> of factors that <span class="highlight">affect</span> the <span class="highlight">amount</span> of deformation that takes place or the speed of the <span class="highlight">glacier</span>'s movement for example. <span class="time" data-times="6.79" data-time="155.25">[02:35.25]</span>Deformation is more likely to <span class="highlight">occur</span> the thicker the ice is, because of the <span class="highlight">gravity</span> of the weight of the ice. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="8.51" data-time="162.04">[02:42.04]</span>And <span class="highlight">temperature</span> also plays a part here, in that cold ice does not move as easily as ice that is close to the <span class="highlight">melting</span> point. <span class="time" data-times="7.16" data-time="170.55">[02:50.55]</span>In fact, it is not too different from... the way oil is, thicker at <span class="highlight">lower</span> temperatures. <span class="time" data-times="6.84" data-time="177.71">[02:57.71]</span>So, if you have a <span class="highlight">glacier</span> in a <span class="highlight">slightly</span> warmer <span class="highlight">region</span>, it will flow faster than a <span class="highlight">glacier</span> in a cooler <span class="highlight">region</span>. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.84" data-time="184.55">[03:04.55]</span>Ok, um... Now, I'd like to touch <span class="highlight">briefly</span> on <span class="highlight">extension</span> and compression. <span class="time" data-times="11.15" data-time="190.39">[03:10.39]</span>Your textbook includes these as types, as a <span class="highlight">particular</span> type of <span class="highlight">glacier</span> movement, but you will see that there are ...as many textbooks that <span class="highlight">omit</span> it as a type of movement as include it. <span class="time" data-times="3.91" data-time="201.54">[03:21.54]</span>And I might not include it right now, if it weren't in your textbook. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.17" data-time="205.45">[03:25.45]</span>But, basically, the upper parts of glaciers have less <span class="highlight">pressure</span> on them. <span class="time" data-times="3.25" data-time="211.62">[03:31.62]</span>So, they don't <span class="highlight">deform</span> easily, they <span class="highlight">tend</span> to be more <span class="highlight">brittle</span>.<span class="time" data-times="4.19" data-time="214.87">[03:34.87]</span>And crevasses can form in this upper layers of the <span class="highlight">glacier</span>. <span class="time" data-times="10.09" data-time="219.06">[03:39.06]</span>When the <span class="highlight">glacier</span> comes into <span class="highlight">contact</span> with <span class="highlight">bedrock</span> walls or is <span class="highlight">otherwise</span> under some kind of <span class="highlight">stress</span>, but can't <span class="highlight">deform</span> quickly enough. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="18.75" data-time="229.15">[03:49.15]</span>So, the ice would <span class="highlight">expand</span> or <span class="highlight">constrict</span>, and that can cause big fissures big cracks to form in the surface layers of the ice, and that <span class="highlight">brittle</span> surface ice moving is sometimes considered a type of <span class="highlight">glacier</span> movement depending on which <span class="highlight">source</span> you are consulting. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.83" data-time="247.9">[04:07.90]</span>Now, as you probably know, glaciers generally move really slowly. <span class="time" data-times="9.3" data-time="252.73">[04:12.73]</span>But sometimes, they experience surges, and during these surges, in some places, they can move at speeds as high as 7000 meters per year. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="262.03">[04:22.03]</span>Now, speeds like that are <span class="highlight">pretty</span> unusual, hundreds of times faster than the <span class="highlight">regular</span> movement of glaciers, but you can actually see <span class="highlight">glacier</span> move during these surges, though it is <span class="highlight">rare</span>. </p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the lecture mainly about?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Explanations of how glaciers move.</p><p>B. Landscape changes caused by glacial movement.</p><p>C. Climate changes that influence glacial movement.</p><p>D. Causes of glacial formation.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The professor mentioned in the first paragraph how they flow, and the way they flow needs some explaining. And explained the problem in the following lecture. So the answer should be A.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>The professor discusses the process of basal slip.Put the steps in the correct order.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.Friction between the glacier and bedrock is reduced</p><p>B.A liquid layer forms at the base of the glacier</p><p>C.The glacier begins to slide</p><p>D.Pressure is increased on the ice</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="DBAC"><p>With regard to the basal slip process, the professor clearly analyzed it. The first is that the ice at the bottom of the iceberg is under a great pressure and the melting point is reduced, forming a liquid layer at the bottom of the iceberg. As a result, the friction between the iceberg and the rock bed decreases, and the iceberg begins to slide. This analysis can be correctly ordered for DBAC.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>What factors are involved in the amount of deformation a glacier undergoes?Click on 2 answers.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

The temperature of the glacial ice.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="AD"><p>Professor mentioned there are a couple of the factors that affect, the first point: Deformation is more likely to occur the thicker the ices; The second point: the temperature also plays part here. It can be seen that the ice thickness and temperature are two major factors affecting the deformation.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor say about the speed of glaciers?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

He is not convinced that it is a type of glacial movement.</p><p>D. He does not agree that it causes fissures in glaciers.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The professor mentioned that if students did not list compression and extension as an iceberg exercise in their textbooks, he would not mention it.
