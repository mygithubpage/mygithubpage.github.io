            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.5" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in a <span class="underline">Geology</span> class. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="12.98" data-time="4.5">[00:04.50]</span>Pro: Last time, we started to talk about glaciers and how these masses of ice form from crystallized snow, and some of you were amazed at how huge some of these glaciers are. <span class="time" data-times="12.56" data-time="17.48">[00:17.48]</span>Now, <span class="underline">even</span> though it may be difficult to understand how a huge <span class="underline">mass</span> of ice can move or flow, it's another word for it, it's really known that no secret that the glaciers flow because of <span class="underline">gravity</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.45" data-time="30.04">[00:30.04]</span>But how they flow, the way they flow, needs some explaining. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.65" data-time="33.49">[00:33.49]</span>Now, the first type of <span class="underline">glacier</span> flow is called: basal <span class="underline">slip</span>. <span class="time" data-times="13.01" data-time="38.14">[00:38.14]</span>Basal <span class="underline">slip</span> or sliding as it's often called, basically refers to the slipping or sliding of a <span class="underline">glacier</span> <span class="underline">across</span> <span class="underline">bedrock</span>, actually <span class="underline">across</span> a thin <span class="underline">layer</span> of water on top of the <span class="underline">bedrock</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.39" data-time="51.15">[00:51.15]</span>So, this <span class="underline">process</span> shouldn't be too hard to imagine. <span class="time" data-times="8.2" data-time="55.54">[00:55.54]</span>What happens is that the ice at the <span class="underline">base</span> of the <span class="underline">glacier</span> is under a great <span class="underline">deal</span> of <span class="underline">pressure</span> – the <span class="underline">pressure</span> coming from the weight of the overlying ice. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.25" data-time="63.74">[01:03.74]</span>And you probably know that under <span class="underline">pressure</span>, the <span class="underline">melting</span> <span class="underline">temperature</span> of water, of the ice I mean, is reduced. <span class="time" data-times="5.69" data-time="71.99">[01:11.99]</span>So, ice at the <span class="underline">base</span> of the <span class="underline">glacier</span> melts, <span class="underline">even</span> though it's below zero <span class="underline">degree</span> celsius. <span class="time" data-times="5.28" data-time="77.68">[01:17.68]</span>And this results in a thin <span class="underline">layer</span> of water between the <span class="underline">glacier</span> and the ground. <span class="time" data-times="5.13" data-time="82.96">[01:22.96]</span>This <span class="underline">layer</span> of water reduces <span class="underline">friction</span> is... is like a <span class="underline">lubricant</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.91" data-time="88.09">[01:28.09]</span>And it allows the <span class="underline">glacier</span> to <span class="underline">slide</span> or <span class="underline">slip</span> over the <span class="underline">bedrock</span>. OK? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.44" data-time="93">[01:33.00]</span>Now the next type of movement we will talk about is called: deformation. <span class="time" data-times="5.01" data-time="97.44">[01:37.44]</span>You've already known that ice is <span class="underline">brittle</span>, if you hit it with a <span class="underline">hammer</span>, it will <span class="underline">shatter</span> like glass. <span class="time" data-times="5.1" data-time="102.45">[01:42.45]</span>But ice is also <span class="underline">plastic</span>, it can change <span class="underline">shape</span> without breaking. <span class="time" data-times="9.65" data-time="107.55">[01:47.55]</span>If you leave, for example, a bar of ice supported only at one end, the end, the unsupported end will <span class="underline">deform</span> under its own weight. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.45" data-time="117.2">[01:57.20]</span>It'll kind of <span class="underline">flatten</span> out at one end, get distorted, deformed. <span class="time" data-times="4.08" data-time="121.65">[02:01.65]</span>Think of deformation as a very slow oozing. <span class="time" data-times="5.54" data-time="125.73">[02:05.73]</span>Depending on the stresses on the <span class="underline">glacier</span>, the ice crystals <span class="underline">within</span> it reorganize. <span class="time" data-times="7.47" data-time="131.27">[02:11.27]</span>And during this re-organization the ice crystals realign in a way that allows them to <span class="underline">slide</span> pass each other. <span class="time" data-times="4.7" data-time="138.74">[02:18.74]</span>And so the <span class="underline">glacier</span> oozes downhill without any ice actually <span class="underline">melting</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="11.81" data-time="143.44">[02:23.44]</span>Now, there are a <span class="underline">couple</span> of factors that <span class="underline">affect</span> the <span class="underline">amount</span> of deformation that takes place or the speed of the <span class="underline">glacier</span>'s movement for example. <span class="time" data-times="6.79" data-time="155.25">[02:35.25]</span>Deformation is more likely to <span class="underline">occur</span> the thicker the ice is, because of the <span class="underline">gravity</span> of the weight of the ice. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.51" data-time="162.04">[02:42.04]</span>And <span class="underline">temperature</span> also plays a part here, in that cold ice does not move as easily as ice that is close to the <span class="underline">melting</span> point. <span class="time" data-times="7.16" data-time="170.55">[02:50.55]</span>In fact, it is not too different from... the way oil is, thicker at <span class="underline">lower</span> temperatures. <span class="time" data-times="6.84" data-time="177.71">[02:57.71]</span>So, if you have a <span class="underline">glacier</span> in a <span class="underline">slightly</span> warmer <span class="underline">region</span>, it will flow faster than a <span class="underline">glacier</span> in a cooler <span class="underline">region</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.84" data-time="184.55">[03:04.55]</span>Ok, um... Now, I'd like to touch <span class="underline">briefly</span> on <span class="underline">extension</span> and compression. <span class="time" data-times="11.15" data-time="190.39">[03:10.39]</span>Your textbook includes these as types, as a <span class="underline">particular</span> type of <span class="underline">glacier</span> movement, but you will see that there are ...as many textbooks that <span class="underline">omit</span> it as a type of movement as include it. <span class="time" data-times="3.91" data-time="201.54">[03:21.54]</span>And I might not include it right now, if it weren't in your textbook. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.17" data-time="205.45">[03:25.45]</span>But, basically, the upper parts of glaciers have less <span class="underline">pressure</span> on them. <span class="time" data-times="3.25" data-time="211.62">[03:31.62]</span>So, they don't <span class="underline">deform</span> easily, they <span class="underline">tend</span> to be more <span class="underline">brittle</span>.<span class="time" data-times="4.19" data-time="214.87">[03:34.87]</span>And crevasses can form in this upper layers of the <span class="underline">glacier</span>. <span class="time" data-times="10.09" data-time="219.06">[03:39.06]</span>When the <span class="underline">glacier</span> comes into <span class="underline">contact</span> with <span class="underline">bedrock</span> walls or is <span class="underline">otherwise</span> under some kind of <span class="underline">stress</span>, but can't <span class="underline">deform</span> quickly enough. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="18.75" data-time="229.15">[03:49.15]</span>So, the ice would <span class="underline">expand</span> or <span class="underline">constrict</span>, and that can cause big fissures big cracks to form in the surface layers of the ice, and that <span class="underline">brittle</span> surface ice moving is sometimes considered a type of <span class="underline">glacier</span> movement depending on which <span class="underline">source</span> you are consulting. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.83" data-time="247.9">[04:07.90]</span>Now, as you probably know, glaciers generally move really slowly. <span class="time" data-times="9.3" data-time="252.73">[04:12.73]</span>But sometimes, they experience surges, and during these surges, in some places, they can move at speeds as high as 7000 meters per year. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="262.03">[04:22.03]</span>Now, speeds like that are <span class="underline">pretty</span> unusual, hundreds of times faster than the <span class="underline">regular</span> movement of glaciers, but you can actually see <span class="underline">glacier</span> move during these surges, though it is <span class="underline">rare</span>. </p>
