OK? </p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.44" data-time="93">[01:33.00]</span>Now the next type of movement we will talk about is called: deformation. <span class="time" data-times="5.01" data-time="97.44">[01:37.44]</span>You've already known that ice is <span class="highlight">brittle</span>, if you hit it with a <span class="highlight">hammer</span>, it will <span class="highlight">shatter</span> like glass. <span class="time" data-times="5.1" data-time="102.45">[01:42.45]</span>But ice is also <span class="highlight">plastic</span>, it can change <span class="highlight">shape</span> without breaking. <span class="time" data-times="9.65" data-time="107.55">[01:47.55]</span>If you leave, for example, a bar of ice supported only at one end, the end, the unsupported end will <span class="highlight">deform</span> under its own weight. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.45" data-time="117.2">[01:57.20]</span>It'll kind of <span class="highlight">flatten</span> out at one end, get distorted, deformed. <span class="time" data-times="4.08" data-time="121.65">[02:01.65]</span>Think of deformation as a very slow oozing. <span class="time" data-times="5.54" data-time="125.73">[02:05.73]</span>Depending on the stresses on the <span class="highlight">glacier</span>, the ice crystals <span class="highlight">within</span> it reorganize. <span class="time" data-times="7.47" data-time="131.27">[02:11.27]</span>And during this re-organization the ice crystals realign in a way that allows them to <span class="highlight">slide</span> pass each other. <span class="time" data-times="4.7" data-time="138.74">[02:18.74]</span>And so the <span class="highlight">glacier</span> oozes downhill without any ice actually <span class="highlight">melting</span>. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="11.81" data-time="143.44">[02:23.44]</span>Now, there are a <span class="highlight">couple</span> of factors that <span class="highlight">affect</span> the <span class="highlight">amount</span> of deformation that takes place or the speed of the <span class="highlight">glacier</span>'s movement for example. <span class="time" data-times="6.79" data-time="155.25">[02:35.25]</span>Deformation is more likely to <span class="highlight">occur</span> the thicker the ice is, because of the <span class="highlight">gravity</span> of the weight of the ice. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="8.51" data-time="162.04">[02:42.04]</span>And <span class="highlight">temperature</span> also plays a part here, in that cold ice does not move as easily as ice that is close to the <span class="highlight">melting</span> point. <span class="time" data-times="7.16" data-time="170.55">[02:50.55]</span>In fact, it is not too different from... the way oil is, thicker at <span class="highlight">lower</span> temperatures. <span class="time" data-times="6.84" data-time="177.71">[02:57.71]</span>So, if you have a <span class="highlight">glacier</span> in a <span class="highlight">slightly</span> warmer <span class="highlight">region</span>, it will flow faster than a <span class="highlight">glacier</span> in a cooler <span class="highlight">region</span>. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.84" data-time="184.55">[03:04.55]</span>Ok, um... Now, I'd like to touch <span class="highlight">briefly</span> on <span class="highlight">extension</span> and compression. <span class="time" data-times="11.15" data-time="190.39">[03:10.39]</span>Your textbook includes these as types, as a <span class="highlight">particular</span> type of <span class="highlight">glacier</span> movement, but you will see that there are ...as many textbooks that <span class="highlight">omit</span> it as a type of movement as include it. <span class="time" data-times="3.91" data-time="201.54">[03:21.54]</span>And I might not include it right now, if it weren't in your textbook. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.17" data-time="205.45">[03:25.45]</span>But, basically, the upper parts of glaciers have less <span class="highlight">pressure</span> on them. <span class="time" data-times="3.25" data-time="211.62">[03:31.62]</span>So, they don't <span class="highlight">deform</span> easily, they <span class="highlight">tend</span> to be more <span class="highlight">brittle</span>.<span class="time" data-times="4.19" data-time="214.87">[03:34.87]</span>And crevasses can form in this upper layers of the <span class="highlight">glacier</span>. <span class="time" data-times="10.09" data-time="219.06">[03:39.06]</span>When the <span class="highlight">glacier</span> comes into <span class="highlight">contact</span> with <span class="highlight">bedrock</span> walls or is <span class="highlight">otherwise</span> under some kind of <span class="highlight">stress</span>, but can't <span class="highlight">deform</span> quickly enough. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="18.75" data-time="229.15">[03:49.15]</span>So, the ice would <span class="highlight">expand</span> or <span class="highlight">constrict</span>, and that can cause big fissures big cracks to form in the surface layers of the ice, and that <span class="highlight">brittle</span> surface ice moving is sometimes considered a type of <span class="highlight">glacier</span> movement depending on which <span class="highlight">source</span> you are consulting. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.83" data-time="247.9">[04:07.90]</span>Now, as you probably know, glaciers generally move really slowly. <span class="time" data-times="9.3" data-time="252.73">[04:12.73]</span>But sometimes, they experience surges, and during these surges, in some places, they can move at speeds as high as 7000 meters per year. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="262.03">[04:22.03]</span>Now, speeds like that are <span class="highlight">pretty</span> unusual, hundreds of times faster than the <span class="highlight">regular</span> movement of glaciers, but you can actually see <span class="highlight">glacier</span> move during these surges, though it is <span class="highlight">rare</span>. </p></p></article></section><div id="question"><div id="question1"><p>What is the lecture mainly about?</p><label class="my-label"><span>A.
