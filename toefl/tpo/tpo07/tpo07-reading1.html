Hsu and William B.F. Ryan were collecting research <span class="highlight">data</span> while aboard the oceanographic research <span class="highlight">vessel</span> Glomar Challenger. An <span class="highlight question1">objective</span> of this <span class="highlight">particular</span><span class="highlight">cruise</span> was to <span class="highlight">investigate</span> the floor of the <span class="highlight">Mediterranean</span> and to <span class="highlight">resolve</span> questions about its geologic <span class="highlight">history</span>. One question was related to <span class="highlight">evidence</span> that the <span class="highlight">invertebrate</span><span class="highlight">fauna</span> (animals without spines) of the <span class="highlight">Mediterranean</span> had changed <span class="highlight">abruptly</span> about 6 million years ago. Most of the older organisms were nearly wiped out, although a few <span class="highlight">hardy</span><span class="highlight">species</span> survived. A few managed to <span class="highlight">migrate</span> into the Atlantic. <span class="highlight">Somewhat</span> later, the migrants returned, bringing new <span class="highlight">species</span> with them. Why did the near <span class="highlight">extinction</span> and migrations <span class="highlight">occur</span>?</p><p><span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>Another task for the Glomar Challenger's scientists was to try to <span class="highlight">determine</span> the <span class="highlight">origin</span> of the domelike masses buried deep <span class="highlight">beneath</span> the <span class="highlight">Mediterranean</span> seafloor. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>These structures had been detected years earlier by echo-sounding instruments, but they had never been penetrated in the <span class="highlight">course</span> of drilling. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>Were they salt domes such as are <span class="highlight">common</span><span class="highlight">along</span> the United States Gulf <span class="highlight">Coast</span>, and if so, why should there have been so much <span class="highlight">solid</span><span class="highlight">crystalline</span> salt <span class="highlight">beneath</span> the floor of the <span class="highlight">Mediterranean</span>? <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p><p>With question such as these clearly before them, the scientists aboard the Glomar Challenger processed to the <span class="highlight">Mediterranean</span> to search for the answers. On August 23, 1970, they recovered a <span class="highlight">sample</span>. The <span class="highlight">sample</span> consisted of pebbles of hardened <span class="highlight">sediment</span> that had once been <span class="highlight">soft</span>, deep-sea mud, as well as granules of gypsum and fragments of <span class="highlight">volcanic</span> rock. <span class="question3">Not a single <span class="highlight">pebble</span> was found that might have indicated that the pebbles came from the nearby <span class="highlight">continent</span>.</span> In the days following, samples of <span class="highlight">solid</span> gypsum were repeatedly brought on <span class="highlight">deck</span> as drilling operations penetrated the seafloor. Furthermore, the gypsum was found to <span class="highlight">possess</span> peculiarities of <span class="highlight">composition</span> and structure that suggested it had formed on <span class="highlight">desert</span> flats. <span class="highlight">Sediment</span> above and below the gypsum <span class="highlight">layer</span> contained tiny <span class="highlight">marine</span> fossils, indicating open-ocean conditions. As they drilled into the central and deepest part of the <span class="highlight">Mediterranean</span><span class="highlight">basin</span>, the scientists took <span class="highlight">solid</span>, shiny, <span class="highlight">crystalline</span> salt from the <span class="highlight">core</span><span class="highlight">barrel</span>. Interbedded with the salt were thin layers of what appeared to be windblown <span class="highlight">silt</span>.</p><p>The time had come to <span class="highlight">formulate</span> a <span class="highlight">hypothesis</span>. The investigators theorized that about 20 million years ago, the <span class="highlight">Mediterranean</span> was a <span class="highlight">broad</span> seaway linked to the Atlantic by two narrow straits. <span class="highlight">Crustal</span> movements closed the straits, and the landlocked <span class="highlight">Mediterranean</span> began to <span class="highlight">evaporate</span>. Increasing <span class="highlight">salinity</span> caused by the <span class="highlight">evaporation</span> resulted in the extermination of <span class="question8">scores</span> of <span class="highlight">invertebrate</span><span class="highlight">species</span>. Only a few organisms especially <span class="highlight">tolerant</span> of very salty conditions remained. As <span class="highlight">evaporation</span> continued, the <span class="highlight">remaining</span> brine (salt water) became so <span class="highlight question1">dense</span> that the <span class="highlight">calcium</span> sulfate of the hard <span class="highlight">layer</span> was precipitated. In the central deeper part of the <span class="highlight">basin</span>, the last of the brine evaporated to <span class="highlight">precipitate</span> more <span class="highlight">soluble</span><span class="highlight">sodium</span> chloride (salt). Later, under the weight of overlying sediments, this salt flowed plastically upward to form salt domes. Before this happened, however, the <span class="highlight">Mediterranean</span> was a <span class="highlight">vast</span><span class="highlight">desert</span> 3,000 meters deep. Then, about 5.5 million years ago came the deluge. <span class="question10">As a result of <span class="highlight">crustal</span> adjustments and faulting, the Strait of Gibraltar, where the <span class="highlight">Mediterranean</span> now connects to the Atlantic, opened, and water cascaded spectacularly back into the <span class="highlight">Mediterranean</span>.</span><span class="question11">Turbulent</span> waters tore into the hardened salt flats, broke them up, and ground them into the pebbles observed in the first <span class="highlight">sample</span> taken by the Challenger. As the <span class="highlight">basin</span> was refilled, normal <span class="highlight">marine</span> organisms returned. Soon <span class="highlight">layer</span> of <span class="highlight">oceanic</span><span class="highlight">ooze</span> began to <span class="highlight">accumulate</span> above the old hard <span class="highlight">layer</span>.The salt and gypsum, the faunal changes, and the unusual <span class="highlight">gravel</span> provided <span class="highlight">abundant</span><span class="highlight">evidence</span> that the <span class="highlight">Mediterranean</span> was once a <span class="highlight">desert</span>.gypsum: a <span class="highlight">mineral</span> made of <span class="highlight">calcium</span> sulfate and water</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">objective</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. achievement</p><p>B. requirement</p><p>C. purpose</p><p>D. feature</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Objective: goal, purpose. A is an achievement; B is a requirement; C is a goal; D is a feature. So the purpose of C is correct. Corresponding to the original: An objective of this particular cruise was to investigate the floor of the Mediterranean and to resolve questions about its geologic history. The original sentence says that this cruise is a survey of the Mediterranean Sea, and MS has more features than the fly. Yes, but the previous sentence says what two people are collecting on the ship. Obviously the survey was not completed at the time. The achievement was wrong. The original did not say that someone asked them to do so, and the requirement was not correct.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the following is NOT mentioned in paragraph 1 as a change that occurred in the fauna of the Mediterranean?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Most invertebrate species disappeared during a wave of extinctions.</p><p>B. A few hardy species wiped out many of the Mediterranean's invertebrates.</p><p>C. Some invertebrates migrated to Atlantic Ocean.</p><p>D. New species of fauna populated the Mediterranean when the old migrants returned.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>EXCEPT questions, exclusion. Inteverbrate in A does keyword positioning to the third sentence, but this sentence only says change, the next sentence corresponds to A's answer, so A's right, do not choose; pay attention to the original saying that most of the wiped out, part of the hardy's left, and B said that Hardy's got most of the bang out, wrong, so he chose B; C's Atlantic corresponds to the penultimate sentence, right, not selected; D's old migrants correspond to the last sentence, yes, no</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the author imply by saying "<span class="highlight">Not a single pebble was found that might have indicated that the pebbles came from the nearby continent</span>"?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The most obvious explanation for the origin of the pebbles was not supported by the evidence.</p><p>B. The geologists did not find as many pebbles as they expected..</p><p>C. The geologists were looking for a particular kind of pebble.</p><p>D. The different pebbles could not have come from only one source.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="Not a single pebble was found that might have indicated that the pebbles came from the nearby continent A"><p>A. First, read the sentence where the rhetorical point is located, saying that no pebble can be found in the nearby continent. Note that if you look ahead, you cannot find the answer. Even if you read the central sentence, it is useless. So simply look back. Latermoremore said that these pebbles were formed in the desert, that is to say that the apparent evidence was wrong, A right; none of the remaining options said.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the following can be inferred from paragraph 3 about the solid gypsum layer?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It did not contain any marine fossil.</p><p>B. It had formed in open-ocean conditions.</p><p>C. It had once been soft, deep-sea mud.</p><p>D. It contained sediment from nearby deserts.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A Gypsum layer keyword positioning to the penultimate sentence, said above and below the gypsum layer sediment contains marine fossils, between the gypsum layer should not be included, otherwise it can not be layered. Please note that the answer I gave before this question was B, but after discussions with other teachers, I still felt that A was more likely to be correct, and the penultimate sentence in the original text stated that gypsum was formed in desert flats, so B's Open-ocean is not right; although say desert, but near this information is impossible to push, so D is wrong; C completely did not say</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>Select the two answer choice from paragraph 3 that identify materials discovered in the deepest part of the Mediterranean basin. To receive credit you must select two answers.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Volcanic rock fragments.</p><p>B. Thin silt layers</p><p>C. Soft, deep-sea mud</p><p>D. Crystalline salt</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="BD"><p>BD took the Mediterranean Basin keyword to the last sentence, saying that scientists got the salt and windblown silt from the bottom of the basin, so B and D are correct.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the main purpose of paragraph 3?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To describe the physical evidence collected by Hsu and Ryan</p><p>B. To explain why some of the questions posed earlier in the passage could not be answered by the findings of the Glomar Challenger</p><p>C. To evaluate techniques used by Hsu and Ryan to explore the sea floor</p><p>D. To describe the most difficult problems faced by the Glomar Challenger expedition</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A asked the entire sentence to see the first sentence, said that in order to solve these problems, scientists drove to the Mediterranean, and then spent a lot of ink and said they take a variety of sample, so the answer is A. The original did not say that the problem could not be solved, B was wrong; the technical thing was just brought over, and there was no detailed description. C was wrong; D said that the problems encountered during the voyage were completely absent.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, which of the following was responsible for the evaporation of the Mediterranean's waters?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The movements of Earth's crust</p><p>B. The accumulation of sediment layers</p><p>C. Changes in the water level of the Atlantic Ocean</p><p>D. Changes in Earth's temperature</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A uses evaporation as the key word to locate the third sentence, but the third sentence has already started to say that the result caused by evaporation has nothing to do with the question, while the second sentence says that the crustal movement closes the strait, and then the seawater begins to evaporate, so the answer is A</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question8">scores</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. members</p><p>B. large numbers</p><p>C. populations</p><p>D. different types</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>Scores of: refers to a large number of (fixed phrase), not related to the original meaning of score, so B is correct. Corresponding to the original:Increasing salinity caused by the evaporation resulted in the extermination of <span class="question8">scores</span> of invertebrate species. The original sentence said that the increase of salinity led to the <span class="question8">scores</span> of invertebrate extinction. Members and populations did not say a large quantity, because the latter sentence said only Some salt-tolerance survived, so most of them should be extinguished. That is, A and C are wrong. The original did not emphasize the type, and D was wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, what caused most invertebrate species in the Mediterranean to become extinct?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The evaporation of chemicals necessary for their survival</p><p>B. Crustal movements that connected the Mediterranean to the saltier Atlantic</p><p>C. The migration of new species through the narrow straits</p><p>D. Their inability to tolerate the increasing salt content of the Mediterranean</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D. Positioning to the fourth sentence with the invertebrate species keyword is caused by increased salinity salinity, only D says this</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The strait of Gibraltar reopened when the Mediterranean and the Atlantic became connected and the cascades of water from one sea to the other caused crustal adjustments and faulting.</p><p>B. The Mediterranean was dramatically refilled by water from the Atlantic when crustal adjustments and faulting opened the Strait of Gibraltar, the place where the two seas are joined.</p><p>C. The cascades of water from the Atlantic to the Mediterranean were not as spectacular as the crustal adjustments and faulting that occurred when the Strait of Gibraltar was connected to those seas.</p><p>D. As a result of crustal adjustments and faulting and the creation of the Strait of Gibraltar, the Atlantic and Mediterranean were connected and became a single sea with spectacular cascades of water between them.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The structure of the original sentence of B is due to crustal adjustment and faulting, resulting in strait opening and currents. The main logic of this sentence is cause and effect, and secondary logic is the juxtaposition of causes. A cause and effect reversal, wrong, cascades of water should be the result; B correct; C as spectacular as compare the two, and this is not the original, so wrong; D to open the channel belonging to the result of the original moved to the cause Part, wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question11">Turbulent</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Fresh</p><p>B. Deep</p><p>C. Violent</p><p>D. Temperate</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" C"><p>C: turbulent: turbulent, furious, turbulent. A is fresh; B is deep; C is violent and violent; D is mild and moderate. So violence is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Thus, scientists had information about the shape of the domes but not about their chemical composition and origin..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C, the four transition points, thus indicates that there is a causal relationship between the sentence before the correct insertion point and the sentence to be inserted; the noun shape, noun dome, and the noun chemical composition and origin. The dome and chemical composition and origin coincide with the salt domes and the crystalline salt of the original text. It is concluded that C or D is the correct answer; C points before these domes have been measured by echo, so the shape should be known, and the causality indicated by thus is established. C is wrong with D.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>An expedition to the Mediterranean answered some long-standing questions about the ocean's history.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.The Glomar Challenger expedition investigated changes in invertebrate fauna and some unusual geologic features.</p><p>B.Researchers collected fossils to determine which new species migrated from the Atlantic with older species.</p><p>C.Scientists aboard the Glomar Challenger were the first to discover the existence of domelike masses underneath the seafloor.</p><p>D.Samples recovered from the expedition revealed important differences in chemical composition and fossil distribution among the sediment layers.</p><p>E.Evidence collected by the Glomar Challenger supports geologists' beliefs that the Mediterranean had evaporated and become a desert, before it refilled with water.</p><p>F.Mediterranean salt domes formed after crustal movements opened the straits between the Mediterranean and the Atlantic, and the Mediterranean refilled with water.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="ADE"><p>ADE</p><p>The Glomar Challenger option corresponds to the first sentence of the third sentence of the first paragraph and the first sentence of the second paragraph.</p><p>The original Researchers option did not say, do not choose</p><p>The Scientists option is the opposite of the first sentence of the second paragraph, which states that the purpose of the scientists was to determine the sources of the domelike masses, that is to say they had been discovered before, so they were not the first one.</p><p>The Samples option corresponds to the entire third paragraph, correct</p><p>The Evidence option corresponds to the entire fourth paragraph, saying that the Mediterranean had dried up and was filled up again.</p><p>The Mediterranean option is contrary to the sixth sentence of the fourth paragraph.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
