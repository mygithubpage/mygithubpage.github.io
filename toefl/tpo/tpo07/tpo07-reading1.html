            <b>The Geologic History of the Mediterranean</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>In 1970 geologists Kenneth J. Hsu and William B.F. Ryan were collecting research <span class="highlight">data</span> while aboard the oceanographic research <span class="highlight">vessel</span> Glomar Challenger. An <span class="question1"><span class="highlight">objective</span></span> of this <span class="highlight">particular</span> <span class="highlight">cruise</span> was to <span class="highlight">investigate</span> the floor of the <span class="highlight">Mediterranean</span> and to <span class="highlight">resolve</span> questions about its geologic <span class="highlight">history</span>. One question was related to <span class="highlight">evidence</span> that the <span class="highlight">invertebrate</span> <span class="highlight">fauna</span> (animals without spines) of the <span class="highlight">Mediterranean</span> had changed <span class="highlight">abruptly</span> about 6 million years ago. Most of the older organisms were nearly wiped out, although a few <span class="highlight">hardy</span> <span class="highlight">species</span> survived. A few managed to <span class="highlight">migrate</span> into the Atlantic. <span class="highlight">Somewhat</span> later, the migrants returned, bringing new <span class="highlight">species</span> with them. Why did the near <span class="highlight">extinction</span> and migrations <span class="highlight">occur</span>?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A">
            </span>Another task for the Glomar Challenger's scientists was to try to <span class="highlight">determine</span> the <span class="highlight">origin</span> of the domelike masses buried deep <span class="highlight">beneath</span> the <span class="highlight">Mediterranean</span> seafloor. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>These structures had been detected years earlier by echo-sounding instruments, but they had never been penetrated in the <span class="highlight">course</span> of drilling. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>Were they salt domes such as are <span class="highlight">common</span> <span class="highlight">along</span> the United States Gulf <span class="highlight">Coast</span>, and if so, why should there have been so much <span class="highlight">solid</span> <span class="highlight">crystalline</span> salt <span class="highlight">beneath</span> the floor of the <span class="highlight">Mediterranean</span>? <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p>
          <p>With question such as these clearly before them, the scientists aboard the Glomar Challenger processed to the <span class="highlight">Mediterranean</span> to search for the answers. On August 23, 1970, they recovered a <span class="highlight">sample</span>. The <span class="highlight">sample</span> consisted of pebbles of hardened <span class="highlight">sediment</span> that had once been <span class="highlight">soft</span>, deep-sea mud, as well as granules of gypsum and fragments of <span class="highlight">volcanic</span> rock. <span class="question3">Not a single <span class="highlight">pebble</span> was found that might have indicated that the pebbles came from the nearby <span class="highlight">continent</span>. </span>In the days following, samples of <span class="highlight">solid</span> gypsum were repeatedly brought on <span class="highlight">deck</span> as drilling operations penetrated the seafloor. Furthermore, the gypsum was found to <span class="highlight">possess</span> peculiarities of <span class="highlight">composition</span> and structure that suggested it had formed on <span class="highlight">desert</span> flats. <span class="highlight">Sediment</span> above and below the gypsum <span class="highlight">layer</span> contained tiny <span class="highlight">marine</span> fossils, indicating open-ocean conditions. As they drilled into the central and deepest part of the <span class="highlight">Mediterranean</span> <span class="highlight">basin</span>, the scientists took <span class="highlight">solid</span>, shiny, <span class="highlight">crystalline</span> salt from the <span class="highlight">core</span> <span class="highlight">barrel</span>. Interbedded with the salt were thin layers of what appeared to be windblown <span class="highlight">silt</span>.</p>
          <p>The time had come to <span class="highlight">formulate</span> a <span class="highlight">hypothesis</span>. The investigators theorized that about 20 million years ago, the <span class="highlight">Mediterranean</span> was a <span class="highlight">broad</span> seaway linked to the Atlantic by two narrow straits. <span class="highlight">Crustal</span> movements closed the straits, and the landlocked <span class="highlight">Mediterranean</span> began to <span class="highlight">evaporate</span>. Increasing <span class="highlight">salinity</span> caused by the <span class="highlight">evaporation</span> resulted in the extermination of <span class="question8">scores </span>of <span class="highlight">invertebrate</span> <span class="highlight">species</span>. Only a few organisms especially <span class="highlight">tolerant</span> of very salty conditions remained. As <span class="highlight">evaporation</span> continued, the <span class="highlight">remaining</span> brine (salt water) became so <span class="highlight"><span class="highlight">dense</span></span> that the <span class="highlight">calcium</span> sulfate of the hard <span class="highlight">layer</span> was precipitated. In the central deeper part of the <span class="highlight">basin</span>, the last of the brine evaporated to <span class="highlight">precipitate</span> more <span class="highlight">soluble</span> <span class="highlight">sodium</span> chloride (salt). Later, under the weight of overlying sediments, this salt flowed plastically upward to form salt domes. Before this happened, however, the <span class="highlight">Mediterranean</span> was a <span class="highlight">vast</span> <span class="highlight">desert</span> 3,000 meters deep. Then, about 5.5 million years ago came the deluge. <span class="question10">As a result of <span class="highlight">crustal</span> adjustments and faulting, the Strait of Gibraltar, where the <span class="highlight">Mediterranean</span> now connects to the Atlantic, opened, and water cascaded spectacularly back into the <span class="highlight">Mediterranean</span>. </span><span class="question11">Turbulent </span>waters tore into the hardened salt flats, broke them up, and ground them into the pebbles observed in the first <span class="highlight">sample</span> taken by the Challenger. As the <span class="highlight">basin</span> was refilled, normal <span class="highlight">marine</span> organisms returned. Soon <span class="highlight">layer</span> of <span class="highlight">oceanic</span> <span class="highlight">ooze</span> began to <span class="highlight">accumulate</span> above the old hard <span class="highlight">layer</span>.The salt and gypsum, the faunal changes, and the unusual <span class="highlight">gravel</span> provided <span class="highlight">abundant</span> <span class="highlight">evidence</span> that the <span class="highlight">Mediterranean</span> was once a <span class="highlight">desert</span>.gypsum: a <span class="highlight">mineral</span> made of <span class="highlight">calcium</span> sulfate and water</p>
