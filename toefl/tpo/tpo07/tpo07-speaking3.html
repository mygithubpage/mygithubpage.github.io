          <h4 class="w3-center">Sculpture Courses to be Discontinued</h4>University administrators announced yesterday that the sculpture program, a division of the art department, will be eliminated. "The main reason is a lack of student interest," reported one administrator. "Although the number of art students has increased, fewer and fewer art major s are taking sculpture classes." Furthermore, the department's only sculpture professor is retiring this year. "Given the art department's limited budget, the administrator explained, "It just doesn't make sense to hire a new full-time professor to teacher sculpture for only a handful of students."</article>

          <p>Now listen to two students discussing the article.</p>
          <p>(man) Every thing all right?</p>
          <p>(woman) Yeah, I'm just upset about that article I showed you this morning.(man) Why? What's the big deal?</p>
          <p>(woman) Well, as an art major, I think it's a big loss for the department. The university's got it all wrong.</p>
          <p>(man) What do you mean?</p>
          <p>(woman) Well, the low enrollment isn't because art majors don't want to take these classes, problem is who has time to take them when there are so many other requirements?</p>
          <p>(man) I don't understand.</p>
          <p>(woman) See, the classes they're eliminating are all optional. The required courses are mostly painting and drawing, and they take up all our time. What we really need are different requirements. Then art majors could take a better variety of classes, all the things we're interested in.</p>
          <p>(man) That makes sense. But the thing about the professor...</p>
          <p>(woman) Well, that's true. But still, they're being drastic. If money is the problem, they could hire a part-time professor. Or most of the professors in the department have secondary fields.</p>
          <p>(man) Really?</p>
          <p>(woman) Yeah! At least a few painting teachers are also great sculptors. I'm sure one of them could teach the class."</p>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>Well, the woman totally disagrees with the university's plan for several reasons. First of all, she believes that the students have got so many requirements that they wont have enough time to take the classes mentioned in the plan, not for the reason that art major students don't want to enroll in these classes. And she adds that the art major students need more options for their own personal interests. Secondly, she thinks that the plan is drastic because money is not the problem. The university could hire a part-time professor or try asking the current professors who teach painting to work in their secondary fields. For example she argues that a few painting teachers could as well be excellent sculptors. In a word, the woman disagrees with the plan for the reasons stated above. (134 words)</p>
