It may have developed independently, but many scholars believe that the <span class="highlight">spread</span> of <span class="highlight">agriculture</span> and iron <span class="highlight">throughout</span> Africa linked it to the <span class="highlight">major</span> centers of the Near East and <span class="highlight">Mediterranean</span> world. The drying up of what is now the Sahara <span class="highlight">desert</span> had pushed many peoples to the south into sub-Sahara Africa. These peoples settled at first in <span class="highlight">scattered</span> hunting-and-gathering bands, although in some places near lakes and rivers, people who fished, with a more <span class="highlight">secure</span> food <span class="highlight">supply</span>, lived in larger <span class="highlight">population</span> concentrations. <span class="highlight">Agriculture</span> seems to have reached these people from the Near East, since the first <span class="highlight">domesticated</span> crops were millets and sorghums whose origins are not African but west Asian. Once the idea of planting <span class="question1">diffused</span> Africans began to develop their own crops, such as certain varieties of rice, and they demonstrated a continued receptiveness to new imports. The proposed areas of the <span class="highlight">domestication</span> of African crops lie in a <span class="highlight">band</span> that extends from Ethiopia <span class="highlight">across</span> southern Sudan to West Africa. Subsequently, other crops, such as bananas, were introduced from Southeast Asia.</p><p><span class="highlight">Livestock</span> also came from outside Africa. <span class="highlight">Cattle</span> were introduced from Asia, as probably were <span class="highlight">domestic</span> sheep and goats. Horses were apparently introduced by the Hyksos invaders of Egypt (1780-1560 B.C.) and then <span class="highlight">spread</span><span class="highlight">across</span> the Sudan to West Africa. Rock paintings in the Sahara <span class="highlight">indicate</span> that horses and chariots were used to traverse the <span class="highlight">desert</span> and that by 300-200 B.C., there were <span class="highlight">trade</span> routes <span class="highlight">across</span> the Sahara. Horses were adopted by peoples of the West African savannah, and later their powerful <span class="highlight">cavalry</span> forces allowed them to <span class="highlight">carve</span> out large empires. Finally, the <span class="highlight">camel</span> was introduced around the first <span class="highlight">century</span> A.D. This was an important <span class="highlight">innovation</span>, because the <span class="highlight">camel</span>'s abilities to <span class="highlight">thrive</span> in <span class="highlight">harsh</span><span class="highlight">desert</span> conditions and to carry large loads cheaply made it an <span class="highlight">effective</span> and <span class="highlight">efficient</span> means of <span class="highlight">transportation</span>. The <span class="highlight">camel</span> transformed the <span class="highlight">desert</span> from a <span class="highlight">barrier</span> into a still difficult, but more <span class="highlight">accessible</span>, <span class="highlight">route</span> of <span class="highlight">trade</span> and communication.</p><p>Iron came from West Asia, although its routes of <span class="highlight">diffusion</span> were <span class="highlight">somewhat</span> different than those of <span class="highlight">agriculture</span>. Most of Africa presents a <span class="highlight">curious</span> case in which societies moved directly from a technology of stone to iron without passing <span class="highlight">through</span> the <span class="highlight">intermediate</span><span class="highlight">stage</span> of <span class="highlight">copper</span> or <span class="highlight">bronze</span><span class="highlight">metallurgy</span>, although some early copper-working sites have been found in West Africa. Knowledge of iron making penetrated into the forest and savannahs of West Africa at <span class="highlight">roughly</span> the same time that iron making was reaching Europe. <span class="highlight">Evidence</span> of iron making has been found in Nigeria, Ghana, and Mali.</p><p>This <span class="highlight">technological</span><span class="highlight">shift</span> cause <span class="highlight"><span class="question7">profound</span></span>changes in the <span class="highlight">complexity</span> of African societies. Iron represented power. In West Africa the blacksmith who made tools and weapons had an important place in society, often with <span class="highlight">special</span><span class="highlight">religious</span> powers and functions. Iron hoes, which made the land more <span class="highlight">productive</span>, and iron weapons, which made the warrior more powerful, had <span class="highlight">symbolic</span> meaning in a number of West Africa societies. Those who knew the secrets of making iron gained <span class="highlight"><span class="question8">ritual</span></span>and sometimes <span class="highlight">political</span> power.</p><p><span class="question10">Unlike in the Americas, where <span class="highlight">metallurgy</span> was a very late and limited <span class="highlight">development</span>, Africans had iron from a <span class="highlight">relatively</span> early <span class="highlight">date</span>, developing <span class="highlight">ingenious</span> furnaces to produce the high heat needed for production and to control the <span class="highlight">amount</span> of <span class="highlight">air</span> that reached the <span class="highlight">carbon</span> and iron <span class="highlight">ore</span> necessary for making iron. </span>Much of Africa moved right into the Iron Age, taking the <span class="highlight">basic</span> technology and adapting it to <span class="highlight">local</span> conditions and resources.</p><p>The <span class="highlight">diffusion</span> of <span class="highlight">agriculture</span> and later of iron was accompanied by a great movement of people who may have carried these innovations. These people probably originated in eastern Nigeria.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>Their <span class="highlight">migration</span> may have been set in <span class="highlight">motion</span> by an increase in <span class="highlight">population</span> caused by a movement of peoples <span class="question11">fleeing </span>the <span class="highlight">desiccation</span>, or drying up, of the Sahara.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>They spoke a language, proto-Bantu ("Bantu" means "the people"), which is the parent tongue of a language of a large number of Bantu languages still spoken <span class="highlight">throughout</span> sub-Sahara Africa.
Why and how these people <span class="highlight">spread</span> out into central and southern Africa remains a mystery, but archaeologists believe that their iron weapons allowed them to <span class="highlight">conquer</span> their hunting-gathering opponents,
who still used stone implements. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>Still, the <span class="highlight">process</span> is uncertain, and peaceful <span class="highlight">migration</span>-or <span class="highlight">simply</span> rapid <span class="highlight">demographic</span> growth-may have also caused the <span class="question12">Bantu <span class="highlight">explosion</span>. </span><span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p></article></div><div id="question"><div id="question1"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">diffused</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p><label class="my-label"><span>A. emerged</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><label class="my-label"><span>B. was understood</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><label class="my-label"><span>C. spread</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><label class="my-label"><span>D. developed</span><input name="radio" type="radio"></input><span class="my-radio"></span></label><p><span>Answer: </span><span class="my-answer">C</span></p></div><div id="question2"><p>According to paragraph 1, why do researchers doubt that agriculture developed independently in Africa?</p><label class="my-label"><span>A.
