It may have developed independently, but many scholars believe that the <span class="highlight">spread</span> of <span class="highlight">agriculture</span> and iron <span class="highlight">throughout</span> Africa linked it to the <span class="highlight">major</span> centers of the Near East and <span class="highlight">Mediterranean</span> world. The drying up of what is now the Sahara <span class="highlight">desert</span> had pushed many peoples to the south into sub-Sahara Africa. These peoples settled at first in <span class="highlight">scattered</span> hunting-and-gathering bands, although in some places near lakes and rivers, people who fished, with a more <span class="highlight">secure</span> food <span class="highlight">supply</span>, lived in larger <span class="highlight">population</span> concentrations. <span class="highlight">Agriculture</span> seems to have reached these people from the Near East, since the first <span class="highlight">domesticated</span> crops were millets and sorghums whose origins are not African but west Asian. Once the idea of planting <span class="highlight question1">diffused</span> Africans began to develop their own crops, such as certain varieties of rice, and they demonstrated a continued receptiveness to new imports. The proposed areas of the <span class="highlight">domestication</span> of African crops lie in a <span class="highlight">band</span> that extends from Ethiopia <span class="highlight">across</span> southern Sudan to West Africa. Subsequently, other crops, such as bananas, were introduced from Southeast Asia.</p><p><span class="highlight">Livestock</span> also came from outside Africa. <span class="highlight">Cattle</span> were introduced from Asia, as probably were <span class="highlight">domestic</span> sheep and goats. Horses were apparently introduced by the Hyksos invaders of Egypt (1780-1560 B.C.) and then <span class="highlight">spread</span><span class="highlight">across</span> the Sudan to West Africa. Rock paintings in the Sahara <span class="highlight">indicate</span> that horses and chariots were used to traverse the <span class="highlight">desert</span> and that by 300-200 B.C., there were <span class="highlight">trade</span> routes <span class="highlight">across</span> the Sahara. Horses were adopted by peoples of the West African savannah, and later their powerful <span class="highlight">cavalry</span> forces allowed them to <span class="highlight">carve</span> out large empires. Finally, the <span class="highlight">camel</span> was introduced around the first <span class="highlight">century</span> A.D. This was an important <span class="highlight">innovation</span>, because the <span class="highlight">camel</span>'s abilities to <span class="highlight">thrive</span> in <span class="highlight">harsh</span><span class="highlight">desert</span> conditions and to carry large loads cheaply made it an <span class="highlight">effective</span> and <span class="highlight">efficient</span> means of <span class="highlight">transportation</span>. The <span class="highlight">camel</span> transformed the <span class="highlight">desert</span> from a <span class="highlight">barrier</span> into a still difficult, but more <span class="highlight">accessible</span>, <span class="highlight">route</span> of <span class="highlight">trade</span> and communication.</p><p>Iron came from West Asia, although its routes of <span class="highlight">diffusion</span> were <span class="highlight">somewhat</span> different than those of <span class="highlight">agriculture</span>. Most of Africa presents a <span class="highlight">curious</span> case in which societies moved directly from a technology of stone to iron without passing <span class="highlight">through</span> the <span class="highlight">intermediate</span><span class="highlight">stage</span> of <span class="highlight">copper</span> or <span class="highlight">bronze</span><span class="highlight">metallurgy</span>, although some early copper-working sites have been found in West Africa. Knowledge of iron making penetrated into the forest and savannahs of West Africa at <span class="highlight">roughly</span> the same time that iron making was reaching Europe. <span class="highlight">Evidence</span> of iron making has been found in Nigeria, Ghana, and Mali.</p><p>This <span class="highlight">technological</span><span class="highlight">shift</span> cause <span class="highlight"><span class="question7">profound</span></span> changes in the <span class="highlight">complexity</span> of African societies. Iron represented power. In West Africa the blacksmith who made tools and weapons had an important place in society, often with <span class="highlight">special</span><span class="highlight">religious</span> powers and functions. Iron hoes, which made the land more <span class="highlight">productive</span>, and iron weapons, which made the warrior more powerful, had <span class="highlight">symbolic</span> meaning in a number of West Africa societies. Those who knew the secrets of making iron gained <span class="highlight"><span class="question8">ritual</span></span> and sometimes <span class="highlight">political</span> power.</p><p><span class="question10">Unlike in the Americas, where <span class="highlight">metallurgy</span> was a very late and limited <span class="highlight">development</span>, Africans had iron from a <span class="highlight">relatively</span> early <span class="highlight">date</span>, developing <span class="highlight">ingenious</span> furnaces to produce the high heat needed for production and to control the <span class="highlight">amount</span> of <span class="highlight">air</span> that reached the <span class="highlight">carbon</span> and iron <span class="highlight">ore</span> necessary for making iron.</span> Much of Africa moved right into the Iron Age, taking the <span class="highlight">basic</span> technology and adapting it to <span class="highlight">local</span> conditions and resources.</p><p>The <span class="highlight">diffusion</span> of <span class="highlight">agriculture</span> and later of iron was accompanied by a great movement of people who may have carried these innovations. These people probably originated in eastern Nigeria.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>Their <span class="highlight">migration</span> may have been set in <span class="highlight">motion</span> by an increase in <span class="highlight">population</span> caused by a movement of peoples <span class="question11">fleeing</span> the <span class="highlight">desiccation</span>, or drying up, of the Sahara.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>They spoke a language, proto-Bantu ("Bantu" means "the people"), which is the parent tongue of a language of a large number of Bantu languages still spoken <span class="highlight">throughout</span> sub-Sahara Africa.
Why and how these people <span class="highlight">spread</span> out into central and southern Africa remains a mystery, but archaeologists believe that their iron weapons allowed them to <span class="highlight">conquer</span> their hunting-gathering opponents,
who still used stone implements. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>Still, the <span class="highlight">process</span> is uncertain, and peaceful <span class="highlight">migration</span>-or <span class="highlight">simply</span> rapid <span class="highlight">demographic</span> growth-may have also caused the <span class="question12">Bantu <span class="highlight">explosion</span>.</span><span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">diffused</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. emerged</p><p>B. was understood</p><p>C. spread</p><p>D. developed</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Diffuse: Diffusion. A is present; B is understood; C is spread, spread; D is development. According to the word meaning, the correct is the C option. The previous sentence said that agriculture came from the Near East, and that those crops were not in Africa. , and then said that once the idea of planting came to Africa, Africans began to develop their own crops. It is not Africa's stuff that reaches Africa, so it is spread or spread. It is not a mere appearance. Emerge is wrong. Only understanding of idea is certainly not okay. It is necessary to do it. Understood is not right; the idea of the original has no further meaning, and develop is wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 1, why do researchers doubt that agriculture developed independently in Africa?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. African lakes and rivers already provided enough food for people to survive without agriculture.</p><p>B. The earliest examples of cultivated plants discovered in Africa are native to Asia.</p><p>C. Africa's native plants are very difficult to domesticate.</p><p>D. African communities were not large enough to support agriculture.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B. Use developed independently and agriculture keywords to target the second sentence. But this sentence only says that African agriculture is related to the Near East and the Mediterranean. If you know that Near East is a part of Asia and part of Africa, the answer comes out. , B is correct; if you do not know what to look back, there is another sentence referring to agriculture, that is, the fifth sentence says that agriculture came from Asia, because those crops are not native to Africa, so the answer is B</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>In paragraph 1, what does the author imply about changes in the African environment during this time period?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The climate was becoming milder, allowing for a greater variety of crops to be grown.</p><p>B. Although periods of drying forced people south, they returned once their food supply was secure.</p><p>C. Population growth along rivers and lakes was dramatically decreasing the availability of fish.</p><p>D. A region that had once supported many people was becoming a desert where few could survive.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D. Use the keywords of changes of African environment to locate the third sentence of the original text. Note that the keyword in the title is not originally written, but the dry up of what is now in the Sahara desert is an environmental change. Saying that the drought drove these people to the sub-Saharan region meant that this change made the place where they were originally unable to live, so D was correct; A said that the climate became mild, contrary to the original; B said that they returned to the original place. , contrary to the original settlement in Southern Africa; C has no relevant information</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 2, camels were important because they</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. were the first domesticated animal to be introduced to Africa</p><p>B. allowed the people of the West African savannahs to carve out large empires</p><p>C. helped African peoples defend themselves against Egyptian invaders</p><p>D. made it cheaper and easier to cross the Sahara</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>C. Position the word to the second last sentence with the keyword camel, say camel in the first century, then say this is very important, followed by an important reason, so D is correct</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 2, which of the following were subjects of rock paintings in the Sahara?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Horses and chariots</p><p>B. Sheep and goats</p><p>C. Hyksos invaders from Egypt</p><p>D. Camels and cattle</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>With the keyword rock painting pointing to the fourth sentence: Rock paintings in the Sahara indicate that horses and chariots were used to traverse the desert and that by 300-200 BC, there were trade routes across the Sahara. It was used to cross the desert, so the obvious answer is A.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What function does paragraph 3 serve in the organization of the passage as a whole?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It contrasts the development of iron technology in West Asia and West Africa.</p><p>B. It discusses a non-agricultural contribution to Africa from Asia.</p><p>C. It introduces evidence that a knowledge of copper working reached Africa and Europe at the same time.</p><p>D. It compares the rates at which iron technology developed in different parts of Africa.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B asked the role of the entire paragraph in the article, see the first sentence. Iron is also said to have come from West Asia, but it is different from the line of agricultural diffusion, so the answer is B, Asia's impact on agriculture other than agriculture in Africa; the original did not compare the iron technology in West Africa and West Asia, with an emphasis on describing Africa, so A Wrong; C and D are only small details in the paragraph, not enough to present the entire segment.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question7">profound</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. fascinating</p><p>B. far-reaching</p><p>C. necessary</p><p>D. temporary</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>Profound: <span class="question7">profound</span> and far-reaching. A is attractive; B is far-reaching and broad; C is necessary; D is temporary. So B's far-reaching is the correct answer. Corresponding to the original: This technological shift cause <span class="question7">profound</span> changes in the complexity of African societies. Iron represented power. The third paragraph is entirely about how iron came to Africa. At the beginning of the fourth paragraph, it said what changes the technology brought to Africa. The title of this article is related to iron. It is certain that iron is very important, and it can be seen from the following that these changes are very important and the impact is far-reaching, so the temporary must be wrong, the fanciful change of fanscinating and necessary changes. I can't see it from later on, so it's not right.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question8">ritual</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. military</p><p>B. physical</p><p>C. ceremonial</p><p>D. permanent</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" C"><p>Ritual: Ritual, conventional. A is military; B is physical, physical; C is <span class="question8">ritual</span>; D is permanent. So C's ceremonial is correct. Corresponding to the original:Those who knew the secrets of making iron gained <span class="question8">ritual</span> and sometimes political power. The original sentence said that those who know how to make iron craft will get what rights, and sometimes even get the political rights, permanent and physical, natural None of them can be tied with politics, so B's physical and D's are permanent. MS's military and politics can be juxtaposed. However, symbolic meaning is called before, so C is more appropriate.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, all of the following were social effects of the new metal technology in Africa EXCEPT:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Access to metal tools and weapons created greater social equality.</p><p>B. Metal weapons increased the power of warriors.</p><p>C. Iron tools helped increase the food supply.</p><p>D. Technical knowledge gave religious power to its holders.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A EXCEPT question, exclusion method, A did not say, so election; B warriors in the penultimate sentence, correct, not selected; C in the food supply although the original is not, but the penultimate sentence of the original land more productive, explain this Option, not selected; D's religious power in the last sentence, correct, not selected</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. While American iron makers developed the latest furnaces, African iron makers continued using earlier techniques.</p><p>B. Africans produced iron much earlier than Americans, inventing technologically sophisticated heating systems.</p><p>C. Iron making developed earlier in Africa than in the Americas because of the ready availability of carbon and iron ore.</p><p>D. Both Africa and the Americas developed the capacity for making iron early, but African metallurgy developed at a slower rate.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The structure of the B sentence is different from that of the Americas. Africans made iron earlier, and since the beginning of development, they were all adverbial and did not look. A was wrong because the original did not say that the Americans were using the Latest technology. They just said that they were relatively late in making iron; the structure of B was exactly the same as the original, and the first part of C was right, but the reason behind was completely %E6%96%87 Original %E6%96%87 Original %E6%96%87 Original %E6%96%87 Original %E6%96%87 Original %E6%96%87 Original %E6%96%87 Original % E6%96%87 Original%E6%96%87 Original%E6%96%87 Original%E6%96%87 Original%E6%96%87 Original%E6%96%87 Original%E6%96%87 Original%E6 %96%87</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question11">fleeing</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. afraid of</p><p>B. displaced by</p><p>C. running away from</p><p>D. responding to</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" C"><p>Flee: Escape. A is afraid; B is replaced; C is <span class="question11">fleeing</span>; D is reaction. So C is correct. Corresponding to the original: The migration of may have been set in motion by an increase in population caused by a movement of peoples <span class="question11">fleeing</span> the desiccation, or drying up, of the Sahara. The original sentence said that the migration was caused by an increase in population, and then these people were How does the drought in the Sahara desert migrate, escape is the correct meaning; because it is already done, so it is not afraid, afraid of wrong; people can not be replaced by drought, so displace by is not correct; respond to answer is completely insensitive.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Paragraph 6 mentions all of the following as possible causes of the "<span class="highlight">Bantu explosion</span>" EXCEPT</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. superior weapons</p><p>B. better hunting skills</p><p>C. peaceful migration</p><p>D. increased population</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="Bantu explosion B"><p>A in the penultimate sentence: Why and how..., but archaeologists believe that their iron weapons allowed them to conquer their hunting-gathering opponents, who still used stone implements. A correct, not elected; B wrong, chosen because the original Just saying that the weapons can help them overcome their opponents in hunting, did not say that their hunting skills were good; C and D were in the last sentence, correct, not selected: Still, the process is uncertain, and peaceful migration-or simply rapid demographic growth-may be Have also caused the Bantu explosion.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>These people had a significant linguistic impact on the continent as well..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B, two transition points, these peoples and linguistic impact. These peoples instructions must have peoples in front, this point A/B/C are consistent; linguistic instructions must speak language, B/C possible; and after point B content is to explain the sentence to be inserted, so should insert B instead C.</p></div></div><div id="question14" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>Agriculture and iron working probably spread to Africa from neighboring regions.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.Once Africans developed their own crops, they no longer borrowed from other regions.</p><p>B.The harshness of the African climate meant that agriculture could not develop until after the introduction of iron tools.</p><p>C.The use of livestock improved transportation and trade and allowed for new forms of political control.</p><p>D.As the Sahara expanded, the camel gained in importance, eventually coming to have religious significance.</p><p>E.The spread of iron working had far-reaching effects on social, economic, and political organization in Africa.</p><p>F.Today's Bantu-speaking peoples are descended from a technologically advanced people who spread throughout Africa.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="CEF"><p>The original CEF Once option did not say, do not choose</p><p></p><p>The harshness option did not say the original, do not choose</p><p></p><p>The control option corresponds to the second paragraph of the original text, correct</p><p></p><p>The As option did not say that it is not a camel that is of religious significance.</p><p></p><p>The spread option corresponds to the first sentence of the fourth paragraph of the original text, correct</p><p></p><p>The Today option corresponds to the sixth paragraph of the original text.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
