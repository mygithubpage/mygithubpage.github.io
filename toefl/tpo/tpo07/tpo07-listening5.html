              <span class="time" data-times="4.8" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in an <span class="underline">Anthropology</span> class. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.09" data-time="4.8">[00:04.80]</span>Pro: So we've been discussing 16th <span class="underline">century</span> Native American life, and today we are <span class="underline">gonna</span> <span class="underline">focus</span> on the Iroquois and Huron peoples. <span class="time" data-times="5.95" data-time="14.89">[00:14.89]</span>They lived in the northeastern great lakes <span class="underline">region</span> of North America. <span class="time" data-times="10.19" data-time="20.84">[00:20.84]</span>Now, back then, their lives depended on the natural resources of the forests, especially the <span class="underline">birch</span> tree. <span class="time" data-times="7.16" data-time="31.03">[00:31.03]</span>The <span class="underline">birch</span> tree can grow in many different types of soils and is <span class="underline">prevalent</span> in that area. <span class="time" data-times="3.87" data-time="38.19">[00:38.19]</span>Now can anyone here <span class="underline">describe</span> a <span class="underline">birch</span> tree? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.14" data-time="42.06">[00:42.06]</span>Stu: Um, they are tall and white, the <span class="underline">bark</span>, I mean. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="0.57" data-time="48.2">[00:48.20]</span>Pro: Yes. <span class="time" data-times="9.43" data-time="48.77">[00:48.77]</span>The <span class="underline">birch</span> tree has white <span class="underline">bark</span>, and this <span class="underline">tough</span> protective outer <span class="underline">layer</span> of the tree, this white <span class="underline">bark</span>, is waterproof. <span class="time" data-times="10.82" data-time="58.2">[00:58.20]</span>And this waterproof <span class="underline">quality</span> of the <span class="underline">bark</span>, it made it useful for making things like cooking containers, a <span class="underline">variety</span> of utensils. <span class="time" data-times="13.79" data-time="69.02">[01:09.02]</span>And if you peel <span class="underline">birch</span> <span class="underline">bark</span> in the winter, we call it "the winter <span class="underline">bark</span>", another <span class="underline">layer</span>, a tougher <span class="underline">inner</span> <span class="underline">layer</span> of the tree adheres to the <span class="underline">bark</span>, producing a stronger <span class="underline">material</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.33" data-time="82.81">[01:22.81]</span>So the winter <span class="underline">bark</span> was used for larger utensils and containers. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.14" data-time="87.14">[01:27.14]</span>Stu: I know people make utensils out of wood, but utensils out of tree <span class="underline">bark</span>? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.84" data-time="93.28">[01:33.28]</span>Pro: Well, <span class="underline">birch</span> <span class="underline">bark</span> is <span class="underline">pliable</span> and very easy to bend. <span class="time" data-times="10.08" data-time="98.12">[01:38.12]</span>The Native Americans would cut the <span class="underline">bark</span> and <span class="underline">fold</span> it into any <span class="underline">shape</span> they needed, then <span class="underline">secure</span> it with cords until it dried. <span class="time" data-times="2.45" data-time="108.2">[01:48.20]</span>They could <span class="underline">fold</span> the <span class="underline">bark</span> into many shapes. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.69" data-time="110.65">[01:50.65]</span>Stu: So if they cooked in bowls made of <span class="underline">birch</span> <span class="underline">bark</span>, wouldn't that make the food <span class="underline">taste</span> funny? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.56" data-time="117.34">[01:57.34]</span>Pro: Oh, that's one of the great things about <span class="underline">birch</span> <span class="underline">bark</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.7" data-time="120.9">[02:00.90]</span>The <span class="underline">taste</span> of the <span class="underline">birch</span> tree doesn't get transferred to the food. <span class="time" data-times="3.4" data-time="124.6">[02:04.60]</span>So it was <span class="underline">perfect</span> for cooking containers. <span class="time" data-times="6.11" data-time="128">[02:08.00]</span>But the most important use of the <span class="underline">bark</span>, by far, was the <span class="underline">canoe</span>. <span class="time" data-times="13.38" data-time="134.11">[02:14.11]</span>Since the northeast <span class="underline">region</span> of North American is interconnected by many streams and waterways, water <span class="underline">transportation</span> by vessels like a <span class="underline">canoe</span> was most <span class="underline">essential</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.74" data-time="147.49">[02:27.49]</span>The paths <span class="underline">through</span> the woods were often overgrown, so water travel was much faster. <span class="time" data-times="3.11" data-time="153.23">[02:33.23]</span>And here's what the Native Americans did. <span class="time" data-times="6.9" data-time="156.34">[02:36.34]</span>They would peel large sheets of <span class="underline">bark</span> from the tree to form lightweight yet <span class="underline">sturdy</span> canoes. <span class="time" data-times="8.67" data-time="163.24">[02:43.24]</span>The <span class="underline">bark</span> was stretched over frames made from tree branches, stitched together and sealed with <span class="underline">resin</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.87" data-time="171.91">[02:51.91]</span>You know that <span class="underline">sticky</span> <span class="underline">liquid</span> that comes out of the tree? <span class="time" data-times="3.29" data-time="175.78">[02:55.78]</span>And when it dries, it's watertight. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.48" data-time="179.07">[02:59.07]</span>One great thing about these <span class="underline">birch</span> <span class="underline">bark</span> canoes was, uh, they could carry a large <span class="underline">amount</span> of <span class="underline">cargo</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9.32" data-time="185.55">[03:05.55]</span>For example, a <span class="underline">canoe</span> weighing about 50 pounds could carry up to nine people and 250 pounds of <span class="underline">cargo</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.56" data-time="194.87">[03:14.87]</span>Stu: Wow! But how far could they travel that way? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.46" data-time="198.43">[03:18.43]</span>Pro: Well like I said, the northeastern <span class="underline">region</span> is interconnected by rivers and streams and the ocean at the <span class="underline">coast</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.73" data-time="206.89">[03:26.89]</span>The canoes allow them to travel over a <span class="underline">vast</span> area that today would take a few hours to fly over. <span class="time" data-times="10.08" data-time="214.62">[03:34.62]</span>You see, the Native Americans made canoes of all types, for travel on small streams or on large open ocean waters. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.74" data-time="224.7">[03:44.70]</span>For small streams, they made narrow, maneuverable boats, while, while larger canoes were needed for the ocean. <span class="time" data-times="11.75" data-time="232.44">[03:52.44]</span>They could travel <span class="underline">throughout</span> the area only occasionally having to portage, to carry the <span class="underline">canoe</span> over a land short distance to another nearby <span class="underline">stream</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.13" data-time="244.19">[04:04.19]</span>And since the canoes were so light, this wasn't a difficult task. <span class="time" data-times="4.44" data-time="248.32">[04:08.32]</span>Now how do you think this affected their lives? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="12.49" data-time="252.76">[04:12.76]</span>Stu: Well if they could travel so easily over such a large area, they could <span class="underline">trade</span> with people from other areas which I guess would <span class="underline">lead</span> them to form alliances? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.51" data-time="265.25">[04:25.25]</span>Pro: Exactly. <span class="time" data-times="8.52" data-time="266.76">[04:26.76]</span>Having an <span class="underline">efficient</span> means of <span class="underline">transportation</span>, well, that helps the Iroquois to form a federation linked by natural waterways. <span class="time" data-times="7.73" data-time="275.28">[04:35.28]</span>And this federation expanded from what is now Southern Canada all the way south to the Dalever River. <span class="time" data-times="7.73" data-time="283.01">[04:43.01]</span>And this <span class="underline">efficiency</span> of the <span class="underline">birch</span> <span class="underline">bark</span> <span class="underline">canoe</span> also made an <span class="underline">impression</span> on newcomers to the area. <span class="time" data-times="14.74" data-time="290.74">[04:50.74]</span>French traders in the 17th <span class="underline">century</span> modeled their...well they adopted the design of the Iroquois <span class="underline">birch</span> <span class="underline">bark</span> canoes, and they found they could travel great distances more than 1500 kilometers a month. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.11" data-time="305.48">[05:05.48]</span>Now <span class="underline">besides</span> the <span class="underline">bark</span>, Native Americans also used the wood of the <span class="underline">birch</span> tree. <span class="time" data-times="8.15" data-time="311.59">[05:11.59]</span>The young trees were used as supports for lodgings, with the waterproof <span class="underline">bark</span> used as roofing. <span class="time" data-times="4.02" data-time="319.74">[05:19.74]</span>Branches were folded into snowshoes. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="323.76">[05:23.76]</span>And the Native American people were all <span class="underline">adept</span> at running very fast over the snow in these <span class="underline">birch</span> <span class="underline">branch</span> snowshoes, which if you ever tried walking in snowshoes you know it wasn't easy. </p>
