          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.74" data-time="147.49">[02:27.49]</span>The paths <span class="highlight">through</span> the woods were often overgrown, so water travel was much faster. <span class="time" data-times="3.11" data-time="153.23">[02:33.23]</span>And here's what the Native Americans did. <span class="time" data-times="6.9" data-time="156.34">[02:36.34]</span>They would peel large sheets of <span class="highlight">bark</span> from the tree to form lightweight yet <span class="highlight">sturdy</span> canoes. <span class="time" data-times="8.67" data-time="163.24">[02:43.24]</span>The <span class="highlight">bark</span> was stretched over frames made from tree branches, stitched together and sealed with <span class="highlight">resin</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.87" data-time="171.91">[02:51.91]</span>You know that <span class="highlight">sticky</span> <span class="highlight">liquid</span> that comes out of the tree? <span class="time" data-times="3.29" data-time="175.78">[02:55.78]</span>And when it dries, it's watertight. </p>

            <span class="time" data-times="6.48" data-time="179.07">[02:59.07]</span>One great thing about these <span class="highlight">birch</span> <span class="highlight">bark</span> canoes was, uh, they could carry a large <span class="highlight">amount</span> of <span class="highlight">cargo</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9.32" data-time="185.55">[03:05.55]</span>For example, a <span class="highlight">canoe</span> weighing about 50 pounds could carry up to nine people and 250 pounds of <span class="highlight">cargo</span>. </p>

            <span class="time" data-times="3.56" data-time="194.87">[03:14.87]</span>Stu: Wow! But how far could they travel that way? </p>

            <span class="time" data-times="8.46" data-time="198.43">[03:18.43]</span>Pro: Well like I said, the northeastern <span class="highlight">region</span> is interconnected by rivers and streams and the ocean at the <span class="highlight">coast</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.73" data-time="206.89">[03:26.89]</span>The canoes allow them to travel over a <span class="highlight">vast</span> area that today would take a few hours to fly over. <span class="time" data-times="10.08" data-time="214.62">[03:34.62]</span>You see, the Native Americans made canoes of all types, for travel on small streams or on large open ocean waters. </p>

            <span class="time" data-times="7.74" data-time="224.7">[03:44.70]</span>For small streams, they made narrow, maneuverable boats, while, while larger canoes were needed for the ocean. <span class="time" data-times="11.75" data-time="232.44">[03:52.44]</span>They could travel <span class="highlight">throughout</span> the area only occasionally having to portage, to carry the <span class="highlight">canoe</span> over a land short distance to another nearby <span class="highlight">stream</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.13" data-time="244.19">[04:04.19]</span>And since the canoes were so light, this wasn't a difficult task. <span class="time" data-times="4.44" data-time="248.32">[04:08.32]</span>Now how do you think this affected their lives? </p>

            <span class="time" data-times="1.51" data-time="265.25">[04:25.25]</span>Pro: Exactly. <span class="time" data-times="8.52" data-time="266.76">[04:26.76]</span>Having an <span class="highlight">efficient</span> means of <span class="highlight">transportation</span>, well, that helps the Iroquois to form a federation linked by natural waterways. <span class="time" data-times="7.73" data-time="275.28">[04:35.28]</span>And this federation expanded from what is now Southern Canada all the way south to the Dalever River. <span class="time" data-times="7.73" data-time="283.01">[04:43.01]</span>And this <span class="highlight">efficiency</span> of the <span class="highlight">birch</span> <span class="highlight">bark</span> <span class="highlight">canoe</span> also made an <span class="highlight">impression</span> on newcomers to the area. <span class="time" data-times="14.74" data-time="290.74">[04:50.74]</span>French traders in the 17th <span class="highlight">century</span> modeled their...well they adopted the design of the Iroquois <span class="highlight">birch</span> <span class="highlight">bark</span> canoes, and they found they could travel great distances more than 1500 kilometers a month. </p>

              <p>The article mentioned that birch bark has two features: waterproof and pliable and very easy to bend. Because of the release of water, birch bark can be used to make a variety of containers. Because of its easy folding, the birch bark can be shaped into a variety of shapes. These features make it very useful for Native Americans. Therefore, A and A should be selected. C.</p>

              <p>For the A option, the professor mentioned that the the northeastern region of North American is interconnected by many streams and waterways, water transportation by vessels like a canoe was most essential. Because the residence is mainly connected by waterways, the boat is of course very important, A The options are correct; the text does not mention winter snow, but that the jungle where the land passes through is too lush and the water is faster, so B is wrong; the professor did not mention that Native American would trade the boat, so C was wrong; Native Americans who mentioned different ethnic groups could communicate through the waterway, thereby strengthening the links between ethnic groups.
