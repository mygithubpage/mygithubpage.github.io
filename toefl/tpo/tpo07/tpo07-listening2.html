of a lecture in a class on theater <span class="highlight">history</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.06" data-time="4.6">[00:04.60]</span>The professor is discussing the theater of 19th-century France. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.79" data-time="10.66">[00:10.66]</span>Professor: The 19th <span class="highlight">century</span> was the time that saw what we called <span class="highlight">Realism</span> developed in the European theater. <span class="time" data-times="19.38" data-time="17.45">[00:17.45]</span>Um... to understand this though, we first need to look at an earlier form of drama known as the well-made play, which basically was a <span class="highlight">pattern</span> for constructing plays, plays that... uh.. beginning with some early 19th <span class="highlight">century</span> comedies in France proved very successful commercially. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.21" data-time="36.83">[00:36.83]</span>The <span class="highlight">dramatic</span> devices used here weren't actually anything new. <span class="time" data-times="2.14" data-time="41.04">[00:41.04]</span>They had been around for centuries. <span class="time" data-times="8.1" data-time="43.18">[00:43.18]</span>But the formula for a well-made play required that the certain of these elements be included in a <span class="highlight">particular</span> order. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.11" data-time="51.28">[00:51.28]</span>And most importantly, that everything in the play be logically connected. <span class="time" data-times="12.15" data-time="57.39">[00:57.39]</span>In fact, some of these playwrights would start by writing the end of a play and work backward toward the beginning, just to make sure each event led logically from what had gone before. <span class="time" data-times="5.98" data-time="69.54">[01:09.54]</span>Ok, so what are the necessary elements of a well-made play? </p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.7" data-time="75.52">[01:15.52]</span>Well, the first is <span class="highlight">logical</span><span class="highlight">exposition</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.73" data-time="80.22">[01:20.22]</span><span class="highlight">Exposition</span> is whatever background information you have to <span class="highlight">reveal</span> to the <span class="highlight">audience</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.67" data-time="87.95">[01:27.95]</span>So, they'll understand what's going on. <span class="time" data-times="6.63" data-time="90.62">[01:30.62]</span>Before this time, <span class="highlight">exposition</span> might have come from actors <span class="highlight">simply</span> giving speeches. <span class="time" data-times="12.39" data-time="97.25">[01:37.25]</span>Ur, someone might walk out on a <span class="highlight">stage</span> and say: "In <span class="highlight">fair</span> Verona where we <span class="highlight">lay</span> our <span class="highlight">scene</span>!" and then tell all about the feuding families of Romeo and Juliet. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.78" data-time="109.64">[01:49.64]</span>But for the well-made play, <span class="highlight">even</span> the <span class="highlight">exposition</span> had to be <span class="highlight">logical</span>, believable. <span class="time" data-times="6.45" data-time="117.42">[01:57.42]</span>So, for example, you might have two servants gossiping as they are cleaning the house. <span class="time" data-times="4.7" data-time="123.87">[02:03.87]</span>And one says, Oh, what a <span class="highlight">shame</span> the master's son is still not married. <span class="time" data-times="7.27" data-time="128.57">[02:08.57]</span>And the other might <span class="highlight">mention</span> a <span class="highlight">rumor</span> about a <span class="highlight">mysterious</span> gentleman who's just moved into town with his beautiful daughter. <span class="time" data-times="5.01" data-time="135.84">[02:15.84]</span>These comments are part of the play's <span class="highlight">logical</span><span class="highlight">exposition</span>. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.32" data-time="140.85">[02:20.85]</span>The next key <span class="highlight">element</span> of a well-made play is referred to as the inciting <span class="highlight">incident</span>. <span class="time" data-times="13.04" data-time="148.17">[02:28.17]</span>After we have the background information, we need a key moment that gets things moving, that really makes the <span class="highlight">audience</span> interested in what happens to the characters we just heard about. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.2" data-time="161.21">[02:41.21]</span>So, for example, after the two servants <span class="highlight">reveal</span> all this background information, we meet the young man. <span class="time" data-times="7" data-time="168.41">[02:48.41]</span>Just as he first lays eyes on the beautiful young woman, and immediately falls in love. <span class="time" data-times="4.08" data-time="175.41">[02:55.41]</span>This is the inciting <span class="highlight">incident</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.86" data-time="179.49">[02:59.49]</span>It sets off the <span class="highlight">plot</span> of the play. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.65" data-time="183.35">[03:03.35]</span>Now, the <span class="highlight">plot</span> of a well-made play is usually driven by secrets. <span class="time" data-times="4.91" data-time="189">[03:09.00]</span>Things that the <span class="highlight">audience</span> knows, but the characters often don't know.<span class="time" data-times="12.2" data-time="193.91">[03:13.91]</span>So, for example, the <span class="highlight">audience</span> learns <span class="highlight">through</span> a letter or <span class="highlight">through</span> someone else's <span class="highlight">conversation</span> who this <span class="highlight">mysterious</span> gentleman is and why he left the town many years before. <span class="time" data-times="3.08" data-time="206.11">[03:26.11]</span>But the young man doesn't know about this. <span class="time" data-times="5.8" data-time="209.19">[03:29.19]</span>And the woman doesn't understand the <span class="highlight">ancient</span> connection between her family and his. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="9.82" data-time="214.99">[03:34.99]</span>And before the secrets are revealed to the main characters, the <span class="highlight">plot</span> of the play proceeds as a <span class="highlight">series</span> of <span class="highlight">sort</span> of up and down moments. <span class="time" data-times="8.2" data-time="224.81">[03:44.81]</span>For example, the woman first appears not to <span class="highlight">even</span> notice the young man, and it seems to him like the end of the world.<span class="time" data-times="4.39" data-time="233.01">[03:53.01]</span>But then, he learns that she actually wants to meet him, too. <span class="time" data-times="1.99" data-time="237.4">[03:57.40]</span>So, life is wonderful. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.16" data-time="239.39">[03:59.39]</span>Then, if he tries to talk with her, maybe her father gets <span class="highlight">furious</span>, for no <span class="highlight">apparent</span><span class="highlight">reason</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.25" data-time="245.55">[04:05.55]</span>So, they can't see each other. <span class="time" data-times="17.34" data-time="247.8">[04:07.80]</span>But, just as the young man has almost lost all hope, he finds out, well you get the idea, the reversals of <span class="highlight">fortune</span> continue, increasing the <span class="highlight">audience</span>'s <span class="highlight">tension</span> and excitement, making them <span class="highlight">wonder</span> if everything is going to come out okay or not. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.33" data-time="265.14">[04:25.14]</span>Next comes an <span class="highlight">element</span> known as the: obligatory <span class="highlight">scene</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.12" data-time="270.47">[04:30.47]</span>It's a <span class="highlight">scene</span>, a moment in which all the secrets are revealed. <span class="time" data-times="7.05" data-time="276.59">[04:36.59]</span>And generally, things turn out well for the hero and others we <span class="highlight">care</span> about, a happy ending of some <span class="highlight">sort</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9.77" data-time="283.64">[04:43.64]</span>This became so <span class="highlight">popular</span> that a <span class="highlight">playwright</span> almost had to include it in every play, which is why it's called: the obligatory <span class="highlight">scene</span>. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="13.74" data-time="293.41">[04:53.41]</span>And that's followed by the final <span class="highlight">dramatic</span><span class="highlight">element</span> - the denouement or the <span class="highlight">resolution</span>, when all the <span class="highlight">loose</span> ends have to be tied up in a <span class="highlight">logical</span> way. <span class="time" data-times="6.33" data-time="307.15">[05:07.15]</span>Remember, the obligatory <span class="highlight">scene</span> gives the <span class="highlight">audience</span><span class="highlight">emotional</span> pleasure. <span class="time" data-times="5.58" data-time="313.48">[05:13.48]</span>But the denouement offers the <span class="highlight">audience</span> a <span class="highlight">logical</span> conclusion. <span class="time" data-times="5.85" data-time="319.06">[05:19.06]</span>That's the <span class="highlight">subtle</span><span class="highlight">distinction</span> we need to try very hard to keep in <span class="highlight">mind</span>. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="12.85" data-time="324.91">[05:24.91]</span>So, as I said, the well-made play, this form of playwriting, became the basis for <span class="highlight">realism</span> in drama, and for a lot of very <span class="highlight">popular</span> 19th-century plays. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="337.76">[05:37.76]</span>And also, a <span class="highlight">pattern</span> we find in the plots of many later plays and <span class="highlight">even</span> movies that we see today. </p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the
