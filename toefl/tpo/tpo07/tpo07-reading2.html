          <h4 class="w3-center">Ancient Rome and Greece</h4>
          <p>There is a <span class="highlight">quality</span> of cohesiveness about the Roman world that applied neither to Greece nor perhaps to any other <span class="highlight">civilization</span>, <span class="highlight">ancient</span> or modern. <span class="question1">Like the stone of Roman wall, which were held together both by the regularity of the design and by that peculiarly powerful Roman <span class="highlight">cement</span>, so the various parts of the Roman <span class="highlight">realm</span> were bonded into a <span class="highlight">massive</span>, monolithic entity by <span class="highlight">physical</span>, organizational, and psychological controls</span> The <span class="highlight">physical</span> bonds included the network of <span class="highlight">military</span> garrisons, which were stationed in every province, and the network of stone-built roads that linked the provinces with Rome. The organizational bonds were based on the <span class="highlight">common</span> principles of law and <span class="highlight">administration</span> and on the universal army of officials who enforced <span class="highlight">common</span> standards of <span class="highlight">conduct</span>. The psychological controls were built on fear and punishment-on the <span class="highlight">absolute</span> certainty that anyone or anything that threatened the <span class="highlight">authority</span> of Rome would be <span class="highlight">utterly</span> destroyed.</p>
          <p>The <span class="highlight">source</span> of Roman <span class="question3">obsession with</span> <span class="highlight">unity</span> and <span class="highlight">cohesion</span> may well have lain in the <span class="highlight">pattern</span> of Rome's early <span class="highlight">development</span>. Whereas Greece had grown from scores of <span class="highlight">scattered</span> cities, Rome grew from one single <span class="highlight">organism</span>. While the Greek world had expanded <span class="highlight">along</span> the <span class="highlight">Mediterranean</span> seas lanes, the Roman world was assembled by <span class="highlight">territorial</span> <span class="highlight">conquest</span>. Of <span class="highlight">course</span>, the <span class="highlight">contrast</span> is not quite so stark: in <span class="question5">Alexander the Great</span> the Greeks had found the greatest <span class="highlight">territorial</span> conqueror of all time; and the Romans, once they moved outside Italy, did not fail to learn the lessons of sea power. Yet the <span class="highlight">essential</span> <span class="highlight">difference</span> is undeniable. The key to the Greek world <span class="highlight">lay</span> in its high-powered ships; the key to Roman power <span class="highlight">lay</span> in its marching legions. The Greeks were wedded to the sea; the Romans, to the land. The Greek was a sailor at heart; the Roman, a landsman.</p>
          <p>Certainly, in trying to explain the Roman <span class="highlight">phenomenon</span>, one would have to place great emphasis on this almost <span class="highlight">instinct</span> for the <span class="highlight">territorial</span> <span class="highlight">imperative</span>. Roman priorities <span class="highlight">lay</span> in the <span class="highlight">organization</span>, <span class="highlight">exploitation</span>, and <span class="highlight">defense</span> of their <span class="highlight">territory</span>. In all probability it was the <span class="highlight">fertile</span> <span class="highlight">plain</span> of Latium, where the Latins who founded Rome originated, that created the habits and skills of landed <span class="highlight">settlement</span>, landed <span class="highlight">property</span>, landed <span class="highlight">economy</span>, landed <span class="highlight">administration</span>, and a land-based society. From this arose the Roman <span class="highlight">genius</span> for <span class="highlight">military</span> <span class="highlight">organization</span> and orderly <span class="highlight">government</span>. In turn, a deep attachment to the land, and to the <span class="highlight">stability</span> which <span class="highlight">rural</span> life engenders, <span class="question6">fostered</span> the Roman virtues: gravitas, a <span class="highlight">sense</span> of responsibility, pietas, a <span class="highlight">sense</span> of <span class="highlight">devotion</span> to family and country, and iustitia, a <span class="highlight">sense</span> of the natural order.</p>
          <p>Modern attitudes to Roman <span class="highlight">civilization</span> <span class="highlight">range</span> from the infinitely impressed to the thoroughly disgusted. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>As always, there are the power worshippers,
 especially among historians, who are predisposed to <span class="highlight">admire</span> whatever is strong, who feel more attracted to the might of Rome than to the subtlety of Greece.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>At the same time, there is a <span class="highlight">solid</span> body of opinion that dislikes Rome. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>For many, Rome is at best the <span class="highlight">imitator</span> and the continuator of Greece on a larger <span class="highlight">scale</span>. 
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>Greek <span class="highlight">civilization</span> had <span class="highlight">quality</span>; Rome, <span class="highlight">mere</span> <span class="highlight">quantity</span>. Greece was <span class="highlight">original</span>; Rome, derivative. Greece had style; Rome had money. Greece was the inventor; Rome, 
 the research and <span class="highlight">development</span> <span class="highlight">division</span>. Such indeed was the opinion of some of the more <span class="highlight">intellectual</span> Romans. "Had the Greeks held <span class="highlight">novelty</span> in such <span class="highlight">disdain</span> as we," asked Horace in his epistle, 
 "what work of <span class="highlight">ancient</span> <span class="highlight">date</span> would now exist?"</p>
          <p>Rome's <span class="highlight">debt</span> to Greece was <span class="highlight">enormous</span>. The Romans adopted Greek <span class="highlight">religion</span> and <span class="highlight">moral</span> <span class="highlight">philosophy</span>. In <span class="highlight">literature</span>, Greek writers were <span class="highlight">consciously</span> used as models by their <span class="highlight">Latin</span> successors. It was <span class="highlight">absolutely</span> accepted that an <span class="highlight">educated</span> Roman should be fluent in Greek. In speculative <span class="highlight">philosophy</span> and the sciences, the Romans made <span class="highlight">virtually</span> no <span class="highlight">advance</span> on early achievements.</p>
          <p>Yet it would be wrong to suggest that Rome was somehow a junior partner in Greco-Roman <span class="highlight">civilization</span>. The Roman <span class="highlight">genius</span> was projected into new <span class="question11">spheres</span>-especially into those of law, <span class="highlight">military</span> <span class="highlight">organization</span>, <span class="highlight">administration</span>, and <span class="highlight">engineering</span>. Moreover, the tensions that arose <span class="highlight">within</span> the Roman <span class="highlight">state</span> produced <span class="highlight">literary</span> and <span class="highlight">artistic</span> sensibilities of the highest order. It was no <span class="highlight">accident</span> that many <span class="highlight">leading</span> Roman soldiers and statesmen were writers of high <span class="highlight">caliber</span>.</p>

              <p>C This sentence looks very complicated, in fact, is an analogical sentence that adds a lot of modified components, using so to connect analogy (A is XXX-like, B is XXX-like). Remove the stone of Roman wall, which was held by design and cement, so the real estate was bonded into an entiy by controls. After the abbreviation, it was a very good choice. The correct answer is C. The inspire in A is purely fabricated; the concessions in B are also not in the original sentence, wrong; the first half of D is very correct, but the clause says that powerful laws narrow down the original control, wrong.</p>

In the fourth paragraph, mainly by comparing Greek and Roman cultures, Greek culture pays attention to quality, Roman culture pays attention to quantity; Greece is the creator, and Rome is the successor. And through the viewpoint of Roman intellectuals, they further compared two civilizations to describe Roman civilization. So option D is correct.</p>
