The organizational bonds were based on the <span class="highlight">common</span> principles of law and <span class="highlight">administration</span> and on the universal army of officials who enforced <span class="highlight">common</span> standards of <span class="highlight">conduct</span>. The psychological controls were built on fear and punishment-on the <span class="highlight">absolute</span> certainty that anyone or anything that threatened the <span class="highlight">authority</span> of Rome would be <span class="highlight">utterly</span> destroyed.</p><p>The <span class="highlight">source</span> of Roman <span class="question3">obsession with</span><span class="highlight">unity</span> and <span class="highlight">cohesion</span> may well have lain in the <span class="highlight">pattern</span> of Rome's early <span class="highlight">development</span>. Whereas Greece had grown from scores of <span class="highlight">scattered</span> cities, Rome grew from one single <span class="highlight">organism</span>. While the Greek world had expanded <span class="highlight">along</span> the <span class="highlight">Mediterranean</span> seas lanes, the Roman world was assembled by <span class="highlight">territorial</span><span class="highlight">conquest</span>. Of <span class="highlight">course</span>, the <span class="highlight">contrast</span> is not quite so stark: in <span class="question5">Alexander the Great</span> the Greeks had found the greatest <span class="highlight">territorial</span> conqueror of all time; and the Romans, once they moved outside Italy, did not fail to learn the lessons of sea power. Yet the <span class="highlight">essential</span><span class="highlight">difference</span> is undeniable. The key to the Greek world <span class="highlight">lay</span> in its high-powered ships; the key to Roman power <span class="highlight">lay</span> in its marching legions. The Greeks were wedded to the sea; the Romans, to the land. The Greek was a sailor at heart; the Roman, a landsman.</p><p>Certainly, in trying to explain the Roman <span class="highlight">phenomenon</span>, one would have to place great emphasis on this almost <span class="highlight">instinct</span> for the <span class="highlight">territorial</span><span class="highlight">imperative</span>. Roman priorities <span class="highlight">lay</span> in the <span class="highlight">organization</span>, <span class="highlight">exploitation</span>, and <span class="highlight">defense</span> of their <span class="highlight">territory</span>. In all probability it was the <span class="highlight">fertile</span><span class="highlight">plain</span> of Latium, where the Latins who founded Rome originated, that created the habits and skills of landed <span class="highlight">settlement</span>, landed <span class="highlight">property</span>, landed <span class="highlight">economy</span>, landed <span class="highlight">administration</span>, and a land-based society. From this arose the Roman <span class="highlight">genius</span> for <span class="highlight">military</span><span class="highlight">organization</span> and orderly <span class="highlight">government</span>. In turn, a deep attachment to the land, and to the <span class="highlight">stability</span> which <span class="highlight">rural</span> life engenders, <span class="question6">fostered</span> the Roman virtues: gravitas, a <span class="highlight">sense</span> of responsibility, pietas, a <span class="highlight">sense</span> of <span class="highlight">devotion</span> to family and country, and iustitia, a <span class="highlight">sense</span> of the natural order.</p><p>Modern attitudes to Roman <span class="highlight">civilization</span><span class="highlight">range</span> from the infinitely impressed to the thoroughly disgusted. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>As always, there are the power worshippers,
 especially among historians, who are predisposed to <span class="highlight">admire</span> whatever is strong, who feel more attracted to the might of Rome than to the subtlety of Greece.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>At the same time, there is a <span class="highlight">solid</span> body of opinion that dislikes Rome. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>For many, Rome is at best the <span class="highlight">imitator</span> and the continuator of Greece on a larger <span class="highlight">scale</span>. 
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>Greek <span class="highlight">civilization</span> had <span class="highlight">quality</span>; Rome, <span class="highlight">mere</span><span class="highlight">quantity</span>. Greece was <span class="highlight">original</span>; Rome, derivative. Greece had style; Rome had money. Greece was the inventor; Rome, 
 the research and <span class="highlight">development</span><span class="highlight">division</span>. Such indeed was the opinion of some of the more <span class="highlight">intellectual</span> Romans. "Had the Greeks held <span class="highlight">novelty</span> in such <span class="highlight">disdain</span> as we," asked Horace in his epistle, 
 "what work of <span class="highlight">ancient</span><span class="highlight">date</span> would now exist?"</p><p>Rome's <span class="highlight">debt</span> to Greece was <span class="highlight">enormous</span>. The Romans adopted Greek <span class="highlight">religion</span> and <span class="highlight">moral</span><span class="highlight">philosophy</span>. In <span class="highlight">literature</span>, Greek writers were <span class="highlight">consciously</span> used as models by their <span class="highlight">Latin</span> successors. It was <span class="highlight">absolutely</span> accepted that an <span class="highlight">educated</span> Roman should be fluent in Greek. In speculative <span class="highlight">philosophy</span> and the sciences, the Romans made <span class="highlight">virtually</span> no <span class="highlight">advance</span> on early achievements.</p><p>Yet it would be wrong to suggest that Rome was somehow a junior partner in Greco-Roman <span class="highlight">civilization</span>. The Roman <span class="highlight">genius</span> was projected into new <span class="question11">spheres</span>-especially into those of law, <span class="highlight">military</span><span class="highlight">organization</span>, <span class="highlight">administration</span>, and <span class="highlight">engineering</span>. Moreover, the tensions that arose <span class="highlight">within</span> the Roman <span class="highlight">state</span> produced <span class="highlight">literary</span> and <span class="highlight">artistic</span> sensibilities of the highest order. It was no <span class="highlight">accident</span> that many <span class="highlight">leading</span> Roman soldiers and statesmen were writers of high <span class="highlight">caliber</span>.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The regularity and power of stone walls inspired Romans attempting to unify the parts of their realm.</p><p>B. Although the Romans used different types of designs when building their walls, they used regular controls to maintain their realm.</p><p>C. Several types of control united the Roman realm, just as design and cement held Roman walls together.</p><p>D. Romans built walls to unite the various parts of their realm into a single entity, which was controlled by powerful laws.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C This sentence looks very complicated, in fact, is an analogical sentence that adds a lot of modified components, using so to connect analogy (A is XXX-like, B is XXX-like). Remove the stone of Roman wall, which was held by design and cement, so the real estate was bonded into an entiy by controls. After the abbreviation, it was a very good choice. The correct answer is C. The inspire in A is purely fabricated; the concessions in B are also not in the original sentence, wrong; the first half of D is very correct, but the clause says that powerful laws narrow down the original control, wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 1, all of the following are controls that held together the Roman world EXCEPT</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. administrative and legal systems</p><p>B. the presence of the military</p><p>C. a common language</p><p>D. transportation networks</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C. Note that there is a typographical error in this sentence. The original sentence does not have so, otherwise the grammar is wrong. The structure of the original sentence is like a stone, blablabla, Rome is connected by a lot of things. The inspire in A is purely fabricated; the concessions in B are not in the original sentence, wrong; C is correct; the first half of D is very correct, but the clause says that powerful laws reduce the original control, wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The phrase "<span class="highlight"><span class="question3">obsession with</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. thinking about</p><p>B. fixation on</p><p>C. interest in</p><p>D. attitude toward</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>B, <span class="question3">obsession with</span>: fascinated by..., so fixing on fascination... correct. A is thinking; C is interested in... D is attitude towards.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 2, which of the following was NOT characteristic of Rome's early development?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Expansion by sea invasion</p><p>B. Territorial expansion</p><p>C. Expansion from one original settlement</p><p>D. Expansion through invading armies</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A EXCEPT questions, exclusion. The A option contradicts the third sentence of the original text. The original sentence says that the land A says to be the ocean, so it is wrong to choose; at the same time, it also shows that B is correct and not selected; one of the original settlements in C is positioned to the second sentence, and is correct; D's invading armies position to the third sentence of the countdown. Note that legion is armies, so D is not selected.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the author mention "<span class="highlight"><span class="question5">Alexander the Great</span></span>" in the passage?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To acknowledge that Greek civilization also expanded by land conquest</p><p>B. To compare Greek leaders to Roman leaders</p><p>C. To give an example of Greek leader whom Romans studied</p><p>D. To indicate the superior organization of the Greek military</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" A"><p>In the original text, A said that during the time of <span class="question5">Alexander the Great</span>, Greece also established a very strong army. It has always been said that Greece is an oceanic army. The first half of this sentence says that the contrast is not absolutely clear, and it is followed by an example. The content of the example before the colon is also very important, and it is emphasized that the opposition between the two is not so complete, that is to say there are also land forces in Greece, so the answer is A.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question6">fostered</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. accepted</p><p>B. combined</p><p>C. introduced</p><p>D. encouraged</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" D"><p>Foster: nurture, promote. A is accepted; B is combined; C is introduced; D is encouraged and promoted. So D's encourage is correct. Corresponding to the original: In turn, a deep attachment to the land, and to the stability which rural life engenders, <span class="question6">fostered</span> the Roman virtues: gravitas, a sense of responsibility, peitas, a sense of devotion to family and country, and iustitia, a sense The original sentence states that the dependence on land and stability is related to the Romans' personality, sense of responsibility, contribution to the country and the family, and natural order. The former should be positive to the latter, and accept/combine/introduce is not biased, so the encourage is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Paragraph 3 suggests which of the following about the people of Latium?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Their economy was based on trade relations with other settlements.</p><p>B. They held different values than the people of Rome.</p><p>C. Agriculture played a significant role in the society.</p><p>D. They possessed unusual knowledge of animal instincts.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C. Use Lantium as the key word to locate the third sentence, saying that people in this place have a series of land-related personalities. Since it is related to land, C is correct; A says it is counter-intuitive, saying that the economy is dominated by land, and trade is not. Relying on the land; B saying it is reversed, the person in that place is the person who founded the Roman Empire; D did not say</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Paragraph 4 indicates that some historians admire Roman civilization because of</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. the diversity of cultures within Roman society</p><p>B. its strength</p><p>C. its innovative nature</p><p>D. the large body of literature that it developed</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>With historians keyword positioning to the second sentence: As always, there are the power worshippers, especially among historians, who are predisposed to admire whatever is strong, who feel more attracted to the might of Rome than to the subtlety of Greece. There are always those who admire power, and explain that they worship the strong, so the reason why these people worship Rome is also this, the answer is B.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>In paragraph 4, the author develops a description of Roman civilization by</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. comparing the opinions of Roman intellectuals to Greek intellectuals</p><p>B. identifying which characteristics of Roman civilization were copied from Greece</p><p>C. explaining how the differences between Roman and Greece developed as time passed</p><p>D. contrasting characteristics of Roman civilization with characteristics of Greek civilization</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The fourth paragraph of paragraph D only mentions the views of Roman intellectuals and does not mention the views of Greek intellectuals. Therefore, the A option is wrong. Option B and Option C are not mentioned in the fourth paragraph. In the fourth paragraph, mainly by comparing Greek and Roman cultures, Greek culture pays attention to quality, Roman culture pays attention to quantity; Greece is the creator, and Rome is the successor. And through the viewpoint of Roman intellectuals, they further compared two civilizations to describe Roman civilization. So option D is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, intellectual Romans such as Horace held which of the following opinions about their civilization?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Ancient works of Greece held little value in the Roman world.</p><p>B. The Greek civilization had been surpassed by the Romans.</p><p>C. Roman civilization produced little that was original or memorable.</p><p>D. Romans valued certain types of innovations that had been ignored by ancient Greeks.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C. Take the name of the person as the key word and position it to the last sentence. This sentence starts with such a, so the above is Horace's point of view. He kept saying that Greece is the original creator. Rome just followed the school, so the answer is C. There is nothing in Rome. Valuable things, A/B is allegedly reversed; D different types did not say</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question11">spheres</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. abilities</p><p>B. areas</p><p>C. combinations</p><p>D. models</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>B sphere sphere, so B's area is correct. The dash behind the original sentence gives an explanation of this word. Law, military organization, administration, and engineering are disciplines or fields; A capability C and D model are not correct.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the following statements about leading Roman soldiers and statesmen is supported by paragraphs 5 and 6?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They could read and write the Greek language.</p><p>B. They frequently wrote poetry and plays.</p><p>C. They focused their writing on military matters.</p><p>D. They wrote according to the philosophical laws of the Greeks.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A, with the words "Roman soldiers and statesman" as the key word to the last sentence of the sixth paragraph, saying that these people are very talented writers, and then they seem to have no answer, but the question is based on the fifth and sixth paragraphs. Did not look, the last sentence of the last paragraph said that well-educated Romans are proficient in Greek, so those talented writers mentioned above are certainly proficient, A correct; if not found, use exclusion, the other three did not say</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>They esteem symbols of Roman power, such as the massive Colosseum..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B Two transition points, pronouns they and noun power, according to power only A and B are possible, and they must have those who worship power before, put B if there are historians, put A if not, A exclude, correct answer B .</p></div></div><div id="question14" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>The Roman world drew its strength from several important sources.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.Numerous controls imposed by Roman rulers held its territory together.</p><p>B.The Roman military was organized differently from older military organizations.</p><p>C.Romans valued sea power as did the Latins, the original inhabitants of Rome.</p><p>D.Roman values were rooted in a strong attachment to the land and the stability of rural life.</p><p>E.Rome combined aspects of ancient Greek civilization with its own contributions in new areas.</p><p>F.Educated Romans modeled their own literature and philosophy on the ancient Greeks.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="ADE"><p>A.D.E</p><p>The numerous options correspond to the first two sentences of the first paragraph.</p><p>The Roman military option did not say originally, do not choose</p><p>The Romans valued sea power option is the opposite of the first sentence of the second and third paragraphs of the original text.</p><p>The Roman values option corresponds to the first sentence of the third paragraph of the original text.</p><p>The Rome combined option corresponds to the second sentence of the sixth paragraph of the original text.</p><p>The original educated Romans option did not say, do not choose</p><p>Perfect solution</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
