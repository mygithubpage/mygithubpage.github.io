          <p>Narrator: Listen to a conversation between a student and a librarian.</p>
          <p>:Stu: Hi, I am new here. I, um, couldn't come to the student orientation and I'm wondering if you can give me a few quick pointers about the library? I'd really appreciate it.</p>
          <p>:Librarian: Sure. I'd be glad to. What's your major area of study?</p>
          <p>:Stu: Latin American Literature.</p>
          <p>:Librarian: OK. Well, over here's the section where we have language, literature and the arts. And if you go downstairs you will find the history section. Generally, the students who concentrate in Latin American literature find themselves researching in the history section a lot.</p>
          <p>:Stu: Um-hmm, you are right. I am a transfer student and I've already done a year at another university, so I know how the research can go. I spent a lot of time in the history section. So how long can I borrow books for?</p>
          <p>:Librarian: Our loan period is a month. Oh, I should also mention that we have an inter-library loan service. If you need to get hold a book that's not in our library, there is a truck that runs between our library and a few other public and university libraries in this area. It comes around three times a week.</p>
          <p>:Stu: Hey, that's great! At my last school, it could take a really long time to get the materials I needed. So when I had a project, I had to make a plan way in advance. This sounds much faster. Another thing I was wondering is: is there a place where I can bring my computer and hook it up?</p>
          <p>:Librarian: Sure. There is a whole area here on the main floor where you can bring a laptop and plug it in for power, but on top of that we also have a connection for the internet at every seat.</p>
          <p>:Stu: Nice, so I can do all the research I need to do right here in the library. I'll have all the resources, all the books and the information I need right here in one place.</p>
          <p>:Librarian: Yeah. That's the idea. I am sure you'll need photocopiers too. There are down the hall to your left. We have a system where you have to use a copy card, so you'll need to buy a card from the front desk. You insert it into the machine and you are ready to make copies.</p>
          <p>:Stu: How much do you guys get charge?</p>
          <p>:Librarian: Seven cents a copy.</p>
          <p>:Stu: Oh, that's not too bad. Thanks. Um, where is the collection of rare books?</p>
          <p>:Librarian: Rare books are up on the second floor. They are in a separate room where the temperature is controlled, to preserve the old paper in them. You need to get special permission to access them, and then you have to wear gloves to handle them 'cause the oils in our hands, you know, can destroy the paper. And gloves prevent that so we have a basket of gloves in the room.</p>
          <p>:Stu: Ok. Thanks. I suppose that's all I need to know. You've been very helpful. Thanks.</p>
          <p>:Librarian: Anytime. Bye</p>
          <p>:Stu: Bye. </p>
