How are things going?</p><p>(woman) Well, I'm relieved this is the end of semester. But that's actually part of my problem.</p><p>(man) What do you mean?</p><p>(woman) Can you believe this? My computer broke yesterday. So it's at the shop being repaired. It won't be ready until the end of next week which is when all my papers are due.</p><p>(man) Why not use the computer lab? They've got lots of machines there.</p><p>(woman) I know. But it gets so noisy there that I can't keep my mind on my work. I mean, when I'm at a computer, I'm not just typing. I'm thinking! So I need quiet to concentrate.</p><p>(man) Maybe you can try going in the morning or evening. It might be less noisy then.</p><p>(woman) Maybe. But this time of year, everybody's working on papers. It could be crowded even then.</p><p>(man) Hmm. What about calling back the computer repair shop to see if they can have your computer ready at the beginning of next week instead? That would still give you enough time to finish your papers by the end of the week.</p><p>(woman) Oh! I haven't thought of that! The only problem is the shop is closed today and tomorrow for the long holiday weekend. So it'll be a few days before I can talk to them. "</p></article><section id="question"><h4>Question</h4><p>The speakers discuss two possible solutions to the woman's problem. Briefly summarize the problem, then state which solution your recommend and explain why. </p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>The woman's problem is that her papers will be due by the end of next week but her computer won't be fixed by then. Accordingly, the man offer two solutions: she could try using the computer lab or she could call the computer repair shop to check if they could get the computer fixed at the beginning of next week/ahead of time. Well, I guess go using the computer lab is a better idea for some reasons. To begin with, the computer lab is an exact place for students especially those who don't even own a computer to write their papers. Therefore all she needs to do is to plan her personal study schedule and try to avoid the rush hour of the lab. I am sure if she tries hard to make good use of the study time, the atmosphere there in the lab would become a better motivation instead of obstacles for her paper writing. Secondly, calling back to the shop would be comparatively a bad idea. After all, begging others to reschedule their business plan is more difficult than refine our own study plan. So I would recommend the first solution for the reasons stated above. (201 words)</p></article></div></main></body></html>
