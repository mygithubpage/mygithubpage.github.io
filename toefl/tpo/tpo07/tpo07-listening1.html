To hand in a late assignment.</p><p>B. To find out about jobs in the department.</p><p>C. To discuss Dean Adam's current research.</p><p>D. To volunteer to help organize an event.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>At the beginning of the dialogue, the students had not put forward their reason for coming to the professor. The professor first put forward the topic of late assignment of student work and discussed each other in twos and threes. This may mislead many people to choose the A option. However, the positioning of this topic in the text of the dialogue should be after the topic of the assignment is over: Right. Now, ah, I just have overheard some graduate students' talking, something about a party for De Adams? Students are looking for teachers to do party volunteers. So the answer should be D.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>How did the man learn about Dean Adams' retirement?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. He read about it in an e-mail message.</p><p>B. It was posted on a bulletin board.</p><p>C. He heard other students discussing it</p><p>D. Dean Adams announced it in her class.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The student said: I just have overheard some graduate students' talking, something about a party for De Adams? The answer is C.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor refuse the man's offer to help with a party?Click on 2 answers.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Two people are already working on it.</p><p>B. She prefers that he spend his time on another project.</p><p>C. The party does not require much preparation.</p><p>D. Dean Adams is not permanently leaving the department.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="AC"><p>After the student expressed his desire to be a party volunteer, the professor's speech was that's very thoughtful of you. In the process of listening, this sentence should be used as a reminder for the professor to refuse the student. Next Professor mentioned that it will be pretty low key, nothing flashy. There is no gimmick to say this party, it will be very low-key; also said that actually a couple of the administrative assistants are working on that. You could ask them but I think they've got covered. That is, there are already two students who are responsible for these things. I don't think you need your help anymore. Note that a couple of is the meaning of two students.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor talk about speciation?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To describe the main focus of the work she needs help with.</p><p>B. To tell the man about a new research area in ethnology.</p><p>C. To explain what Dean Adams chose to work on in Indonesia.</p><p>D. To demonstrate how varied Dean Adams' research has been.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>Before the proposal was made, the professor mentioned De Adams did a lot of field research in Indonesia and asked if the students knew about it. After the students expressed that they did not know, the professor emphasized once again that she is really versatile, and proposed a speciation as an example to illustrate that De Adams's research scope is really wide. So the answer is D</p></div></div><div class="replay" id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor say this?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To express doubt about the man's qualifications for the project.</p><p>B. To ask the man if he would be willing to work on the project.</p><p>C. To ask the man to recommend someone for the project.</p><p>D. To apologize for not being able to offer the project to the man.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Because the professor thinks that students may not be interested in this type of work, he said I hesitate to mention it. But I don't suppose it's something you would. This sentence euphemistically asks students whether they are willing to accept this job.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
