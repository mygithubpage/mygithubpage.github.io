            <span class="time" data-times="6.36" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in a <span class="highlight">Biology</span> class.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.44" data-time="6.36">[00:06.36]</span>Pro: So, that is how elephants use infrasound. <span class="time" data-times="8.67" data-time="9.8">[00:09.80]</span>Now, let's talk about the other end of the <span class="highlight">acoustical</span> <span class="highlight">spectrum</span>, <span class="highlight">sound</span> that is too high for humans to hear - ultrasound. <span class="time" data-times="9.35" data-time="18.47">[00:18.47]</span>Ultrasound is used by many animals that <span class="highlight">detect</span> and some of them send out very high <span class="highlight">frequency</span> sounds. <span class="time" data-times="2.65" data-time="27.82">[00:27.82]</span>So, what's a good example? <span class="time" data-times="1.41" data-time="30.47">[00:30.47]</span>Yes? Carol.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="9.81" data-time="31.88">[00:31.88]</span>Carol: Well, bats, since they are all <span class="highlight">blind</span>, bats have to use <span class="highlight">sound</span> for, you know, to keep from flying into things.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.55" data-time="41.69">[00:41.69]</span>Pro: That's echolocation. <span class="time" data-times="9.86" data-time="45.24">[00:45.24]</span>Echolocation is <span class="highlight">pretty</span> self-explanatory; using echoes reflected <span class="highlight">sound</span> waves to <span class="highlight">locate</span> things. <span class="time" data-times="4.43" data-time="55.1">[00:55.10]</span>As Carol said, bats use it for <span class="highlight">navigation</span> and <span class="highlight">orientation</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.07" data-time="59.53">[00:59.53]</span>And what else? Mike.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="8.73" data-time="63.6">[01:03.60]</span>Mike: Well, finding food is always important, and I guess not becoming food for other animals.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.86" data-time="72.33">[01:12.33]</span>Pro: Right, on both counts. <span class="time" data-times="7" data-time="74.19">[01:14.19]</span>Avoiding other predators, and locating <span class="highlight">prey</span>, typically insects that fly around at night. <span class="time" data-times="6.74" data-time="81.19">[01:21.19]</span>Now before I go on, let me just <span class="highlight">respond</span> to something Carol was saying- this idea that bats are <span class="highlight">blind</span>. <span class="time" data-times="13.63" data-time="87.93">[01:27.93]</span>Actually, there are some <span class="highlight">species</span> of bats, the ones that don't use echolocation that do <span class="highlight">rely</span> on their <span class="highlight">vision</span> for <span class="highlight">navigation</span>, but it is true that for many bats, their <span class="highlight">vision</span> is too weak to <span class="highlight">count</span> on.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.12" data-time="101.56">[01:41.56]</span>Ok, so quick <span class="highlight">summary</span> of how echolocation works. <span class="time" data-times="6.17" data-time="106.68">[01:46.68]</span>The bat emits these ultrasonic pulses, very high <span class="highlight">pitch</span> <span class="highlight">sound</span> waves that we can't hear. <span class="time" data-times="5.01" data-time="112.85">[01:52.85]</span>And then, they <span class="highlight">analyze</span> the echoes, how the waves <span class="highlight">bounce</span> back. <span class="time" data-times="4.13" data-time="117.86">[01:57.86]</span>Here, let me finish this <span class="highlight">diagram</span> I started before class. <span class="time" data-times="10.48" data-time="121.99">[02:01.99]</span>So the bat sends out these pulses, very focused bursts of <span class="highlight">sound</span>, and echoes <span class="highlight">bounce</span> back. <span class="time" data-times="6.19" data-time="132.47">[02:12.47]</span>You know, I don't think I need to <span class="highlight">draw</span> on the echoes. <span class="time" data-times="4.3" data-time="138.66">[02:18.66]</span>Your reading <span class="highlight">assignment</span> for the next class, it has a <span class="highlight">diagram</span> that shows this very clearly.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="12.81" data-time="142.96">[02:22.96]</span>So, anyway, as I were saying, by analyzing these echoes, the bat can <span class="highlight">determine</span>, say, if there is wall in a cave that it needs to <span class="highlight">avoid</span>, and how far away it is. <span class="time" data-times="5.72" data-time="155.77">[02:35.77]</span>Another thing it uses ultrasound to <span class="highlight">detect</span> is the size and <span class="highlight">shape</span> of objects. <span class="time" data-times="9.66" data-time="161.49">[02:41.49]</span>For example, one <span class="highlight">echo</span> they quickly <span class="highlight">identify</span> is the one they <span class="highlight">associate</span> with a <span class="highlight">moth</span>, which is <span class="highlight">common</span> <span class="highlight">prey</span> for a bat, particularly a <span class="highlight">moth</span> beating its wings.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.86" data-time="171.15">[02:51.15]</span>However, <span class="highlight">moth</span> happened to have a <span class="highlight">major</span> <span class="highlight">advantage</span> over most other insects. <span class="time" data-times="7.84" data-time="176.01">[02:56.01]</span>They can <span class="highlight">detect</span> ultrasound; this means that when a bat approaches, the <span class="highlight">moth</span> can <span class="highlight">detect</span> the bat's presence. <span class="time" data-times="5.59" data-time="183.85">[03:03.85]</span>So, it has time to <span class="highlight">escape</span> to safety, or else they can just <span class="highlight">remain</span> <span class="highlight">motionless</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9.46" data-time="189.44">[03:09.44]</span>Since, when they stop beating their wings, they'd be much harder for the bat to <span class="highlight">distinguish</span> from, oh... a leaf or some other object.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="7.26" data-time="198.9">[03:18.90]</span>Now, we have tended to <span class="highlight">underestimate</span> just how <span class="highlight">sophisticated</span> the abilities of animals that use ultrasound are. <span class="time" data-times="10.92" data-time="206.16">[03:26.16]</span>In fact, we kind of assumed that they were filtering a lot out, the way a <span class="highlight">sophisticated</span> <span class="highlight">radar</span> system can <span class="highlight">ignore</span> echoes from <span class="highlight">stationary</span> objects on the ground. <span class="time" data-times="7.68" data-time="217.08">[03:37.08]</span> <span class="highlight">Radar</span> does this to remove ground clutter, information about hills or buildings that it doesn't need.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="7.05" data-time="224.76">[03:44.76]</span>But bats, we thought they were filtering out this kind of information, because they <span class="highlight">simply</span> couldn't <span class="highlight">analyze</span> it. <span class="time" data-times="2.59" data-time="231.81">[03:51.81]</span>But, it looks as if we were wrong. <span class="time" data-times="6.06" data-time="234.4">[03:54.40]</span>Recently there was this experiment with trees and a <span class="highlight">specific</span> <span class="highlight">species</span> of bats. <span class="time" data-times="3.44" data-time="240.46">[04:00.46]</span>A bat called: the lesser spear-nosed bat.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.71" data-time="243.9">[04:03.90]</span>Now, a tree should be a huge <span class="highlight">acoustical</span> <span class="highlight">challenge</span> for a bat, right? <span class="time" data-times="4.67" data-time="249.61">[04:09.61]</span>I mean it's got all kinds of surfaces with different shapes and angles. <span class="time" data-times="8.98" data-time="254.28">[04:14.28]</span>So, well, the echoes from a tree are going to a <span class="highlight">mass</span> of <span class="highlight">chaotic</span> <span class="highlight">acoustic</span> reflections, right, not like the <span class="highlight">echo</span> from a <span class="highlight">moth</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="7.37" data-time="263.26">[04:23.26]</span>So, we thought for a long time that bats stop their evaluation at <span class="highlight">simply</span> that is a tree. <span class="time" data-times="16.61" data-time="270.63">[04:30.63]</span>Yet, it turns out that bats or at <span class="highlight">least</span> this <span class="highlight">particular</span> <span class="highlight">species</span>, cannot only tell that is a tree, but can also <span class="highlight">distinguish</span> between, say, a <span class="highlight">pine</span> tree, and a <span class="highlight">deciduous</span> tree, like a maple or <span class="highlight">oak</span> tree, just by their leaves. <span class="time" data-times="3.61" data-time="287.24">[04:47.24]</span>And when I say, leaves, I mean <span class="highlight">pine</span> needles too. <span class="time" data-times="3.65" data-time="290.85">[04:50.85]</span>Any ideas on how it would know that?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="7.55" data-time="294.5">[04:54.50]</span>Stu: Well, like with the <span class="highlight">moth</span>, could it be their <span class="highlight">shape</span>?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="7" data-time="302.05">[05:02.05]</span>Pro: You are on the right <span class="highlight">track</span> - It is actually the <span class="highlight">echo</span> of all the leaves as whole that matters. <span class="time" data-times="6.14" data-time="309.05">[05:09.05]</span>Now, think, a <span class="highlight">pine</span> tree with all those little densely <span class="highlight">packed</span> needles. <span class="time" data-times="5.93" data-time="315.19">[05:15.19]</span>Those produce a large number of <span class="highlight">faint</span> reflections in what's... what's called a ... a smooth <span class="highlight">echo</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="12.91" data-time="321.12">[05:21.12]</span>The wave form is very <span class="highlight">even</span>, but an <span class="highlight">oak</span> which has fewer but bigger leaves with stronger reflections, produces a jagged wave form, or what we called: a <span class="highlight">rough</span> <span class="highlight">echo</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="334.03">[05:34.03]</span>And these bats can <span class="highlight">distinguish</span> between the two, and not just with trees, but with any <span class="highlight">echo</span> that comes in a smooth or <span class="highlight">rough</span> <span class="highlight">shape</span>.</p>
