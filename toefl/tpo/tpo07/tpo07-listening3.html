Carol.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="9.81" data-time="31.88">[00:31.88]</span>Carol: Well, bats, since they are all <span class="highlight">blind</span>, bats have to use <span class="highlight">sound</span> for, you know, to keep from flying into things.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.55" data-time="41.69">[00:41.69]</span>Pro: That's echolocation. <span class="time" data-times="9.86" data-time="45.24">[00:45.24]</span>Echolocation is <span class="highlight">pretty</span> self-explanatory; using echoes reflected <span class="highlight">sound</span> waves to <span class="highlight">locate</span> things. <span class="time" data-times="4.43" data-time="55.1">[00:55.10]</span>As Carol said, bats use it for <span class="highlight">navigation</span> and <span class="highlight">orientation</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.07" data-time="59.53">[00:59.53]</span>And what else? Mike.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="8.73" data-time="63.6">[01:03.60]</span>Mike: Well, finding food is always important, and I guess not becoming food for other animals.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="1.86" data-time="72.33">[01:12.33]</span>Pro: Right, on both counts. <span class="time" data-times="7" data-time="74.19">[01:14.19]</span>Avoiding other predators, and locating <span class="highlight">prey</span>, typically insects that fly around at night. <span class="time" data-times="6.74" data-time="81.19">[01:21.19]</span>Now before I go on, let me just <span class="highlight">respond</span> to something Carol was saying- this idea that bats are <span class="highlight">blind</span>. <span class="time" data-times="13.63" data-time="87.93">[01:27.93]</span>Actually, there are some <span class="highlight">species</span> of bats, the ones that don't use echolocation that do <span class="highlight">rely</span> on their <span class="highlight">vision</span> for <span class="highlight">navigation</span>, but it is true that for many bats, their <span class="highlight">vision</span> is too weak to <span class="highlight">count</span> on.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.12" data-time="101.56">[01:41.56]</span>Ok, so quick <span class="highlight">summary</span> of how echolocation works. <span class="time" data-times="6.17" data-time="106.68">[01:46.68]</span>The bat emits these ultrasonic pulses, very high <span class="highlight">pitch</span><span class="highlight">sound</span> waves that we can't hear. <span class="time" data-times="5.01" data-time="112.85">[01:52.85]</span>And then, they <span class="highlight">analyze</span> the echoes, how the waves <span class="highlight">bounce</span> back. <span class="time" data-times="4.13" data-time="117.86">[01:57.86]</span>Here, let me finish this <span class="highlight">diagram</span> I started before class. <span class="time" data-times="10.48" data-time="121.99">[02:01.99]</span>So the bat sends out these pulses, very focused bursts of <span class="highlight">sound</span>, and echoes <span class="highlight">bounce</span> back. <span class="time" data-times="6.19" data-time="132.47">[02:12.47]</span>You know, I don't think I need to <span class="highlight">draw</span> on the echoes. <span class="time" data-times="4.3" data-time="138.66">[02:18.66]</span>Your reading <span class="highlight">assignment</span> for the next class, it has a <span class="highlight">diagram</span> that shows this very clearly.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="12.81" data-time="142.96">[02:22.96]</span>So, anyway, as I were saying, by analyzing these echoes, the bat can <span class="highlight">determine</span>, say, if there is wall in a cave that it needs to <span class="highlight">avoid</span>, and how far away it is. <span class="time" data-times="5.72" data-time="155.77">[02:35.77]</span>Another thing it uses ultrasound to <span class="highlight">detect</span> is the size and <span class="highlight">shape</span> of objects. <span class="time" data-times="9.66" data-time="161.49">[02:41.49]</span>For example, one <span class="highlight">echo</span> they quickly <span class="highlight">identify</span> is the one they <span class="highlight">associate</span> with a <span class="highlight">moth</span>, which is <span class="highlight">common</span><span class="highlight">prey</span> for a bat, particularly a <span class="highlight">moth</span> beating its wings.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.86" data-time="171.15">[02:51.15]</span>However, <span class="highlight">moth</span> happened to have a <span class="highlight">major</span><span class="highlight">advantage</span> over most other insects. <span class="time" data-times="7.84" data-time="176.01">[02:56.01]</span>They can <span class="highlight">detect</span> ultrasound; this means that when a bat approaches, the <span class="highlight">moth</span> can <span class="highlight">detect</span> the bat's presence. <span class="time" data-times="5.59" data-time="183.85">[03:03.85]</span>So, it has time to <span class="highlight">escape</span> to safety, or else they can just <span class="highlight">remain</span><span class="highlight">motionless</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9.46" data-time="189.44">[03:09.44]</span>Since, when they stop beating their wings, they'd be much harder for the bat to <span class="highlight">distinguish</span> from, oh... a leaf or some other object.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.26" data-time="198.9">[03:18.90]</span>Now, we have tended to <span class="highlight">underestimate</span> just how <span class="highlight">sophisticated</span> the abilities of animals that use ultrasound are. <span class="time" data-times="10.92" data-time="206.16">[03:26.16]</span>In fact, we kind of assumed that they were filtering a lot out, the way a <span class="highlight">sophisticated</span><span class="highlight">radar</span> system can <span class="highlight">ignore</span> echoes from <span class="highlight">stationary</span> objects on the ground. <span class="time" data-times="7.68" data-time="217.08">[03:37.08]</span><span class="highlight">Radar</span> does this to remove ground clutter, information about hills or buildings that it doesn't need.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.05" data-time="224.76">[03:44.76]</span>But bats, we thought they were filtering out this kind of information, because they <span class="highlight">simply</span> couldn't <span class="highlight">analyze</span> it. <span class="time" data-times="2.59" data-time="231.81">[03:51.81]</span>But, it looks as if we were wrong. <span class="time" data-times="6.06" data-time="234.4">[03:54.40]</span>Recently there was this experiment with trees and a <span class="highlight">specific</span><span class="highlight">species</span> of bats. <span class="time" data-times="3.44" data-time="240.46">[04:00.46]</span>A bat called: the lesser spear-nosed bat.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.71" data-time="243.9">[04:03.90]</span>Now, a tree should be a huge <span class="highlight">acoustical</span><span class="highlight">challenge</span> for a bat, right? <span class="time" data-times="4.67" data-time="249.61">[04:09.61]</span>I mean it's got all kinds of surfaces with different shapes and angles. <span class="time" data-times="8.98" data-time="254.28">[04:14.28]</span>So, well, the echoes from a tree are going to a <span class="highlight">mass</span> of <span class="highlight">chaotic</span><span class="highlight">acoustic</span> reflections, right, not like the <span class="highlight">echo</span> from a <span class="highlight">moth</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.37" data-time="263.26">[04:23.26]</span>So, we thought for a long time that bats stop their evaluation at <span class="highlight">simply</span> that is a tree. <span class="time" data-times="16.61" data-time="270.63">[04:30.63]</span>Yet, it turns out that bats or at <span class="highlight">least</span> this <span class="highlight">particular</span><span class="highlight">species</span>, cannot only tell that is a tree, but can also <span class="highlight">distinguish</span> between, say, a <span class="highlight">pine</span> tree, and a <span class="highlight">deciduous</span> tree, like a maple or <span class="highlight">oak</span> tree, just by their leaves. <span class="time" data-times="3.61" data-time="287.24">[04:47.24]</span>And when I say, leaves, I mean <span class="highlight">pine</span> needles too. <span class="time" data-times="3.65" data-time="290.85">[04:50.85]</span>Any ideas on how it would know that?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.55" data-time="294.5">[04:54.50]</span>Stu: Well, like with the <span class="highlight">moth</span>, could it be their <span class="highlight">shape</span>?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="7" data-time="302.05">[05:02.05]</span>Pro: You are on the right <span class="highlight">track</span> - It is actually the <span class="highlight">echo</span> of all the leaves as whole that matters. <span class="time" data-times="6.14" data-time="309.05">[05:09.05]</span>Now, think, a <span class="highlight">pine</span> tree with all those little densely <span class="highlight">packed</span> needles. <span class="time" data-times="5.93" data-time="315.19">[05:15.19]</span>Those produce a large number of <span class="highlight">faint</span> reflections in what's... what's called a ... a smooth <span class="highlight">echo</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="12.91" data-time="321.12">[05:21.12]</span>The wave form is very <span class="highlight">even</span>, but an <span class="highlight">oak</span> which has fewer but bigger leaves with stronger reflections, produces a jagged wave form, or what we called: a <span class="highlight">rough</span><span class="highlight">echo</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="334.03">[05:34.03]</span>And these bats can <span class="highlight">distinguish</span> between the two, and not just with trees, but with any <span class="highlight">echo</span> that comes in a smooth or <span class="highlight">rough</span><span class="highlight">shape</span>.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the lecture mainly about?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. How animals emit ultrasonic pulses.</p><p>B. How bats use acoustical signals.</p><p>C. A comparison of echolocation and radar.</p><p>D. Variations among bats in the use of ultrasound.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Subject themes. Lecture's main content is about how bats use ultrasound to locate, hedge, and prey. The answer should be B. Lecture did not discuss the mechanism by which animals sent out ultrasound waves, so the A option was wrong. The lecture mentioned the comparison of radar and echolocation, but it was not the main thread of the lecture, so the C option was wrong. Some lectures mentioned that some bats can rely on vision. Most bats can only rely on ultrasound, but this part is not the main line of the lecture, so the D option is wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor decide NOT to add more information to the diagram on the board?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. She wants students to complete the diagram themselves as an assignment.</p><p>B. She needs to look up some information in order to complete the diagram accurately.</p><p>C. The additional information is not relevant to the topic that she wants to discuss next.</p><p>D. Students already have the additional information in their textbook.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The professor mentioned that You know, I don't think I need to draw any echoes, your reading assignment for the next class; it has a diagram that shows this very clearly. The relevant chart has already appeared in the students' teaching materials, so the answer is D.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor,what are two ways in which a moth might react when it detects the presence of a bat?Click on 2 answers.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The moth might stop beating its wings.</p><p>B. The moth might emit high-frequency sounds.</p><p>C. The moth might leave the area.</p><p>D. The moth might change its color to match its surroundings.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="AC"><p>The professor mentioned the moth can detect the bat's presence. So, it has time to escape to safety, or else they can once just motionless. This sentence tells the two possible reflections of Moth's discovery of the presence of bats. To escape, the second is to stay still. Therefore, A and C should be selected.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What surprising information did a recent experiment reveal about lesser spear-nosed bats?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They filter out echoes from some types of trees.</p><p>B. They can analyze echoes from stationary objects with complex surfaces.</p><p>C. They cannot analyze "jagged" echoes.</p><p>D. They cannot analyze echoes from certain types of small moving objects..</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The answer to this question is we thought for a long time that the bat stops their evaluation as simply that is a tree. We originally thought that bats could only know that there were trees in front of them and could not analyze further information. However, recent studies have shown that bats can use different shapes of the leaves to form different types of trees. So the B option is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor ,why does a pine tree produce a "smooth" echo?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.
