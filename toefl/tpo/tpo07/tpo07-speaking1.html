I lived there for five years so I am familiar with it. Firstly, Chongqing has a unique scenery. It's a mountainous city. Because of this special terrain, the buildings and Pedestrian Malls are built in a different way from other cities. For example, the fourth floor of one building may be the ground level of another one. Secondly, Chongqing has many kinds of delicious food. Hot pot is like world-famous. Everyone in China knows it originate from Chongqing. Besides, there are some other famous food such as Kung Pao Chicken and double-cooked pork slices. Anyway, if one goes to Chongqing, one will feel that every meal is a feast.</p></article></div></main></body></html>
