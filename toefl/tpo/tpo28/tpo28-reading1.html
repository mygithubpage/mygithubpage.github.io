There is more than 50 times as much freshwater stored <span class="highlight">underground</span> than in all the freshwater rivers and lakes at the surface. Nearly 50 percent of all <span class="highlight">groundwater</span> is stored in the upper 1,000 meters of Earth. At greater depths <span class="highlight">within</span> Earth, the <span class="highlight">pressure</span> of the overlying rock causes pores and cracks to close, reducing the <span class="highlight">space</span> that <span class="highlight">pore</span> water can <span class="highlight">occupy</span>, and almost complete closure occurs at a depth of about 10 kilometers. The greatest water <span class="highlight">storage</span>, <span class="highlight">therefore</span>, lies near the surface.</p><p>Aquifers, <span class="highlight">Porosity</span> and Permeability.<span class="highlight">Groundwater</span> is stored in a <span class="highlight">variety</span> of rock types. A <span class="highlight">groundwater</span><span class="highlight">reservoir</span> from which water can be <span class="question3">extracted</span> is called an <span class="highlight">aquifer</span>. We can effectively think of an <span class="highlight">aquifer</span> as a <span class="highlight">deposit</span> of water. Extraction of water depends on two properties of the aquifer: <span class="highlight">porosity</span> and permeability. Between <span class="highlight">sediment</span> grains are spaces that can be filled with water. This <span class="highlight">pore</span><span class="highlight">space</span> is known as <span class="highlight">porosity</span> and is expressed as a percentage of the total rock <span class="highlight">volume</span>. <span class="highlight">Porosity</span> is important for water-storage <span class="highlight">capacity</span>, but for water to flow <span class="highlight">through</span> rocks, the <span class="highlight">pore</span> spaces must be connected. The <span class="highlight">ability</span> of water, or other fluids, to flow <span class="highlight">through</span> the interconnected <span class="highlight">pore</span> spaces in rocks is <span class="question4">termed</span> permeability. In the intergranular spaces of rocks, however, <span class="highlight">fluid</span> must flow around and between grains in a tortuous <span class="highlight">path</span>; this winding <span class="highlight">path</span> causes a <span class="highlight">resistance</span> to flow. The <span class="highlight">rate</span> at which the flowing water overcomes this <span class="highlight">resistance</span> is related to the permeability of rock.</p><p><span class="highlight">Sediment</span> sorting and compaction influence permeability and <span class="highlight">porosity</span>. The more poorly sorted or the more tightly <span class="question7">compacted</span> a <span class="highlight">sediment</span> is ,the <span class="highlight">lower</span> its <span class="highlight">porosity</span> and permeability. Sedimentary rocks----the most <span class="highlight">common</span> rock type near the surface----are also the most <span class="highlight">common</span> reservoirs for water because they <span class="highlight">contain</span> the most <span class="highlight">space</span> that can be filled with water. Sandstones generally make good aquifers, while finer-grained mudstones are typically <span class="highlight">impermeable</span>. <span class="highlight">Impermeable</span> rocks are referred to as aquicludes. <span class="highlight">Igneous</span> and <span class="highlight">metamorphic</span> rocks are more <span class="highlight">compact</span>, commonly <span class="highlight">crystalline</span>, and <span class="highlight">rarely</span><span class="highlight">contain</span> spaces between grains. However, <span class="highlight">even</span><span class="highlight">igneous</span> and <span class="highlight">metamorphic</span> rocks may act as <span class="highlight">groundwater</span> reservoirs if <span class="highlight">extensive</span> fracturing occurs in such rocks and if the <span class="highlight">fracture</span> system is interconnected.</p><p>The water table is the <span class="highlight">underground</span><span class="highlight">boundary</span> below which all the cracks and pores are filled with water. In some cases, the water table reaches Earth's surface, where it is expressed as rivers, lakes and marshes. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> Typically, though, the water table may be tens or hundreds of meters below the surface. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> The water table is not <span class="highlight">flat</span> but usually follows the contours of the <span class="highlight">topography</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span> Above the water table is the vadose <span class="highlight">zone</span>, <span class="highlight">through</span> which rainwater percolates. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span> Water in the vadose <span class="highlight">zone</span> drains down to the water table, leaving behind a thin <span class="highlight"><span class="question9">coating</span></span> of water on <span class="highlight">mineral</span> grains. The vadose <span class="highlight">zone</span> supplies plant roots near the surface with water.</p><p>Because the surface of the water table is not <span class="highlight">flat</span> but <span class="highlight">instead</span> rises and falls with <span class="highlight">topography</span>, <span class="highlight">groundwater</span> is affected by <span class="highlight">gravity</span> in the same <span class="highlight">fashion</span> as surface water. <span class="highlight">Groundwater</span> flows downhill to topographic lows. <span class="question11">If the water table intersect the land surface, <span class="highlight">groundwater</span> will flow out onto the surface at springs, whether to be collected there or to <span class="highlight">subsequently</span> flow farther <span class="highlight">along</span> a <span class="highlight">drainage</span>.</span><span class="highlight">Groundwater</span> commonly collects in <span class="highlight">stream</span> drainages but may <span class="highlight">remain</span><span class="highlight">entirely</span><span class="highlight">beneath</span> the surface of dry stream-beds in <span class="highlight">arid</span> regions. In particularly wet years, short stretches of an <span class="highlight">otherwise</span> dry stream-bed may have flowing water because the water table rises to intersect the land surface.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>In paragraph 1, why does the author mention "the pressure of the overlying rock"?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To show how water can be forced deep under Earth's surface</p><p>B. To show why groundwater is more plentiful than surface freshwater</p><p>C. To correct a commonly made error about the location of groundwater</p><p>D. To explain why most groundwater lies near Earth's surface</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D After the description of the highlighted part, the last sentence of this paragraph appears, therefore, here is also the result of the pressure of the overlying rock, that is, the article mentions its purpose. The result is: The greatest water storage Therefore, from this sentence it can be read that most of the water reserves are on the surface. So its purpose is to explain why water is on the surface. So choose D.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 1, groundwater differs from the water in rivers and lakes in terms of its</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. portability</p><p>B. usefulness</p><p>C. abundance</p><p>D. cost</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C. Using rivers and lakes to locate the second sentence of the original, that is, comparing the groundwater to rivers and lakes: There is more than 50 times as much freshwater stored underground than in all the freshwater rivers and lakes at the surface. The original sentence says more than 50 times, 50 times the amount of the gap. Prove that there is a large amount of groundwater. Here A is drinkability, the original does not say that the river can not; B is useful, the same reason; D is the cost, the cost, this even more not mentioned. So the answer is C, rich.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question3">extracted</span></span>"in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. used</p><p>B. poured</p><p>C. removed</p><p>D. kept out</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" C"><p>C extract: Take and remove. Corresponding to the C option remove (move, remove). It can be inferred from the back of the original sentence that the water storage layer can be regarded as a deposit of water, so the front should say that it can be taken out. In addition, the affix ex- of this word has its own meaning. Then A is used, B is spilled, C is moving, and D is isolated. So choose C.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question4">termed</span></span>"in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. considered</p><p>B. called</p><p>C. limited to</p><p>D. caused by</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>B term: verb. Corresponds to the B option call. The term noun is the meaning of "terminology", which is very commonly used. And here we use the passive form of its verbs, then it should be ... is <span class="question4">termed</span>, that is, is named. Then A thinks that B is called, C is restricted, and D is because. So should choose B. Can also be combined with the context of the paragraph to infer, the entire paragraph is to introduce two concepts, one is porosity, in the previous article under a definition, using is known as. The corresponding original sentence here is obviously also defined, is<span class="question4">termed</span> should be similar to is known as. The correct answer to this is B.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 2, what does porosity determine?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The rate at which the aquifer's water overcomes resistance to flow</p><p>B. The amount of water that the aquifer can hold</p><p>C. The likelihood that fractures and joints will occur in the aquifer</p><p>D. The depth underground at which the aquifer lies</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B uses porosity to locate the fourth sentence of the segment, and this also indicates that the previous sentence is also relevant: Between sediment grains are spaces that can be filled with water. This pore space is known as porosity and is expressed a percentage of The total rock volume. Porosity is important for water-storage capacity... It can be clearly read from these two sentences: porosity refers to the gap that can store water. Expressed by the percentage of rock volume, it is important for the water storage capacity. Then echo the contents of option B. A is determined by the permeability of rack, which corresponds to the last sentence of this paragraph; C is not directly related to porosity; D is not mentioned in the original text.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 2, what is the relationship between permeability and porosity?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The more pores a rock has, the higher its porosity but the lower its permeability.</p><p>B. Rocks with many internal spaces that are not connected with each other will have high porosity but low permeability.</p><p>C. If water flows through a rock easily, it has high permeability but low porosity.</p><p>D. Rocks that have high permeability have high porosity and vice versa.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B porosity porosity; permeability permeability. The paper mentions that porosity means the amount of water that can be stored in rocks; and when these holes are linked together, water can flow in rocks, which is permeability. So choose B: There are lots of space in the rock but these spaces are not connected together, then this rock is porous but poor in permeability.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question7">compacted</span></span>"in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. hard</p><p>B. compressed</p><p>C. heavy</p><p>D. deeply buried</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>Compact is compact and compact. By the following and the content of the parallelism can be introduced its word meaning, because and behind said rare contain space, it means that the space in the middle is small. So choose B for compression. A is hard, C is heavy, and D is deep.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 3, when can igneous rock serve as an aquifer?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. When it has many connected fractures</p><p>B. When it lies next to metamorphic rock</p><p>C. When it lies relatively near the surface</p><p>D. When it is crystalline</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>Corresponding to the last sentence of this article, the phrase "even igneous rocks may act as groundwater..." is the answer given in the latter part of the sentence. Then it says that there must be fractures and should be interconnected. So choose A.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question9">coating</span></span>"in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. stream</p><p>B. barrier</p><p>C. amount</p><p>D. layer</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" D"><p>D <span class="question9">coating</span>: <span class="question9">coating</span>, <span class="question9">coating</span>. Then A is the stream, B is the obstacle, C is the quantity, and D is the layer. So D meets. Original text</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Paragraph 4 implies which of the following about the roots of plants?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They prevent water from reaching the vadose zone.</p><p>B. They mark the boundary between the vadose zone and the water table</p><p>C. They do not typically get their water from the water table.</p><p>D. They help keep the water table from dropping farther.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C. Locate the last sentence of this paragraph according to the plant roots: The vadose zone supplies plant roots near the surface with water. Say the vadose zone provides water to the root near the surface. This means that for the roots of these plants, the vadose zone can also be a source of water, and the water table is not their only water source option. This corresponds to the C option. A, B, D are not mentioned.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage paragraph 5? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Groundwater only flows out of the ground if the water table intersects the land surface.</p><p>B. If the land surface and the water table intersect, groundwater can flow underground.</p><p>C. Groundwater may be drained if springs occur where the water table intersects the land surface.</p><p>D. Where the water table meets the land surface, groundwater flows out through surface springs.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D To see the main logic, either of the supplementary content behind is secondary, you can ignore it first. The meaning of the trunk is very simple: when the groundwater level meets the land surface, the groundwater will flow into the spring water on the surface. The A option is in error with only, this restrictive condition is not reflected in the original sentence, so A and the original sentence are different; B option flow underground and the original sentence of the surface conflict; C option may be drained in the original sentence there is no such description, So wrong. D contains all the main parts of the original text, correct.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Paragraph 5 implies which of the following about the level of the water</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It may rise or fall from year to year, depending on annual rainfall.</p><p>B. It does not vary in arid regions.</p><p>C. It rarely intersects the land surface of most regions.</p><p>D. It is unrelated to the rate at which groundwater flows.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A. Use the level of the water table to find the first description and locate the first two sentences of the paragraph. Groundwater usually collects in stream drainages but can remain completely beneath the surface of dry stream-beds in arid regions. In specifically wet years, short stretches of an otherwise dry stream-bed may have have flowing water because the water table rises to intersect the land surface According to the description of the wet years in the last two sentences of this paragraph, it can be concluded that the groundwater level varies according to the amount of rainfall. In more rainy years, the groundwater level may rise and meet the surface. So A is correct. B is not correct, the original text clearly writes that in the arid regions there is a lot of rainfall when the dry creek will have water; C is not right, the whole paragraph has a large space in writing and land surface of intersects; D did not mention the original text.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>This is a consequence of the slow rate of movement of the groundwater, which often prevents the water table from attaining a flat (horizontal) level..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C. The sentence to be inserted says that this is a consequence. Then this must refer to what. According to the first half of the sentence, it can be known that the content of the reference should be a result of the slowness of groundwater. It is also known from the latter part that peace should be uneven. So the position of C is consistent because the previous sentence says that the groundwater level is not a plane.</p></div></div><div id="question14" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>
Most of the world's potable water is stored as groundwater in the pores and fractures of underground rock, much of it at depths of less than 1,000 meters.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.Sedimentary rock may make poor aquifers because of tightly compacted sediment, which reduces porosity and permeability.</p><p>B.Groundwater reservoirs are characterized by the porosity and permeability of the rock in which they lie, and these factors vary according to the type of rock.</p><p>C.Porosity is a measure of the empty space within rock, while permeability measures the degree to which water can flow freely through rock.</p><p>D.The vadose zone is typically dry because water does not stay in it, but instead percolates down to aquifers below or drains out through springs and streams.</p><p>E.In arid regions, the water tables remain at a constant level far below the surface, preventing stream-beds from filling up even during wet years.</p><p>F.Although the water table usually follows the contours of the land surface, its level may vary from year to year and may intersect the surface in places.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="BCF"><p>The BCF A error corresponds to the third sentence of the third paragraph of the article on the description of the geological rock. According to the original text, the geological rock is a good aquifers. B is correct, corresponding to the first four sentences of the second paragraph. C is correct, corresponding to the second paragraph of the original text. D mistake, vadose zone will leave thin <span class="question9">coating</span> so it will still be wet. Corresponding to the original paragraph. E error, the water table is not maintained at a constant level. According to the penultimate sentence, the groundwater level sometimes crosses the surface.
