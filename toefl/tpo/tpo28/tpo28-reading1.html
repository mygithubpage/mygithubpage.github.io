          <h4 class="w3-center">Groundwater</h4>
          <p>Most of the world's potable water----freshwater <span class="highlight">suitable</span> for drinking----is accounted for by <span class="highlight">groundwater</span>, which is stored in the pores and fractures in rocks. There is more than 50 times as much freshwater stored <span class="highlight">underground</span> than in all the freshwater rivers and lakes at the surface. Nearly 50 percent of all <span class="highlight">groundwater</span> is stored in the upper 1,000 meters of Earth. At greater depths <span class="highlight">within</span> Earth, the <span class="highlight">pressure</span> of the overlying rock causes pores and cracks to close, reducing the <span class="highlight">space</span> that <span class="highlight">pore</span> water can <span class="highlight">occupy</span>, and almost complete closure occurs at a depth of about 10 kilometers. The greatest water <span class="highlight">storage</span>, <span class="highlight">therefore</span>, lies near the surface.</p>
          <p>Aquifers, <span class="highlight">Porosity</span> and Permeability.<span class="highlight">Groundwater</span> is stored in a <span class="highlight">variety</span> of rock types. A <span class="highlight">groundwater</span> <span class="highlight">reservoir</span> from which water can be <span class="question3">extracted</span> is called an <span class="highlight">aquifer</span>. We can effectively think of an <span class="highlight">aquifer</span> as a <span class="highlight">deposit</span> of water. Extraction of water depends on two properties of the aquifer: <span class="highlight">porosity</span> and permeability. Between <span class="highlight">sediment</span> grains are spaces that can be filled with water. This <span class="highlight">pore</span> <span class="highlight">space</span> is known as <span class="highlight">porosity</span> and is expressed as a percentage of the total rock <span class="highlight">volume</span>. <span class="highlight">Porosity</span> is important for water-storage <span class="highlight">capacity</span>, but for water to flow <span class="highlight">through</span> rocks, the <span class="highlight">pore</span> spaces must be connected. The <span class="highlight">ability</span> of water, or other fluids, to flow <span class="highlight">through</span> the interconnected <span class="highlight">pore</span> spaces in rocks is <span class="question4">termed</span> permeability. In the intergranular spaces of rocks, however, <span class="highlight">fluid</span> must flow around and between grains in a tortuous <span class="highlight">path</span>; this winding <span class="highlight">path</span> causes a <span class="highlight">resistance</span> to flow. The <span class="highlight">rate</span> at which the flowing water overcomes this <span class="highlight">resistance</span> is related to the permeability of rock.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="highlight">Sediment</span> sorting and compaction influence permeability and <span class="highlight">porosity</span>. The more poorly sorted or the more tightly <span class="question7">compacted</span> a <span class="highlight">sediment</span> is ,the <span class="highlight">lower</span> its <span class="highlight">porosity</span> and permeability. Sedimentary rocks----the most <span class="highlight">common</span> rock type near the surface----are also the most <span class="highlight">common</span> reservoirs for water because they <span class="highlight">contain</span> the most <span class="highlight">space</span> that can be filled with water. Sandstones generally make good aquifers, while finer-grained mudstones are typically <span class="highlight">impermeable</span>. <span class="highlight">Impermeable</span> rocks are referred to as aquicludes. <span class="highlight">Igneous</span> and <span class="highlight">metamorphic</span> rocks are more <span class="highlight">compact</span>, commonly <span class="highlight">crystalline</span>, and <span class="highlight">rarely</span> <span class="highlight">contain</span> spaces between grains. However, <span class="highlight">even</span> <span class="highlight">igneous</span> and <span class="highlight">metamorphic</span> rocks may act as <span class="highlight">groundwater</span> reservoirs if <span class="highlight">extensive</span> fracturing occurs in such rocks and if the <span class="highlight">fracture</span> system is interconnected.</p>
          <p>The water table is the <span class="highlight">underground</span> <span class="highlight">boundary</span> below which all the cracks and pores are filled with water. In some cases, the water table reaches Earth's surface, where it is expressed as rivers, lakes and marshes. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> Typically, though, the water table may be tens or hundreds of meters below the surface. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> The water table is not <span class="highlight">flat</span> but usually follows the contours of the <span class="highlight">topography</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span> Above the water table is the vadose <span class="highlight">zone</span>, <span class="highlight">through</span> which rainwater percolates. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span> Water in the vadose <span class="highlight">zone</span> drains down to the water table, leaving behind a thin <span class="highlight"><span class="question9">coating</span></span> of water on <span class="highlight">mineral</span> grains. The vadose <span class="highlight">zone</span> supplies plant roots near the surface with water.</p>
          <p>Because the surface of the water table is not <span class="highlight">flat</span> but <span class="highlight">instead</span> rises and falls with <span class="highlight">topography</span>, <span class="highlight">groundwater</span> is affected by <span class="highlight">gravity</span> in the same <span class="highlight">fashion</span> as surface water. <span class="highlight">Groundwater</span> flows downhill to topographic lows. <span class="question11">If the water table intersect the land surface, <span class="highlight">groundwater</span> will flow out onto the surface at springs, whether to be collected there or to <span class="highlight">subsequently</span> flow farther <span class="highlight">along</span> a <span class="highlight">drainage</span>.</span> <span class="highlight">Groundwater</span> commonly collects in <span class="highlight">stream</span> drainages but may <span class="highlight">remain</span> <span class="highlight">entirely</span> <span class="highlight">beneath</span> the surface of dry stream-beds in <span class="highlight">arid</span> regions. In particularly wet years, short stretches of an <span class="highlight">otherwise</span> dry stream-bed may have flowing water because the water table rises to intersect the land surface.</p>

              <p>C. Using rivers and lakes to locate the second sentence of the original, that is, comparing the groundwater to rivers and lakes: There is more than 50 times as much freshwater stored underground than in all the freshwater rivers and lakes at the surface. The original sentence says more than 50 times, 50 times the amount of the gap. Prove that there is a large amount of groundwater. Here A is drinkability, the original does not say that the river can not; B is useful, the same reason; D is the cost, the cost, this even more not mentioned. So the answer is C, rich.</p>

In addition, the affix ex- of this word has its own meaning. Then A is used, B is spilled, C is moving, and D is isolated. So choose C.</p>

The paper mentions that porosity means the amount of water that can be stored in rocks; and when these holes are linked together, water can flow in rocks, which is permeability.

Groundwater usually collects in stream drainages but can remain completely beneath the surface of dry stream-beds in arid regions. In specifically wet years, short stretches of an otherwise dry stream-bed may have have flowing water because the water table rises to intersect the land surface According to the description of the wet years in the last two sentences of this paragraph, it can be concluded that the groundwater level varies according to the amount of rainfall. In more rainy years, the groundwater level may rise and meet the surface. So A is correct. B is not correct, the original text clearly writes that in the arid regions there is a lot of rainfall when the dry creek will have water; C is not right, the whole paragraph has a large space in writing and land surface of intersects; D did not mention the original text.</p>
