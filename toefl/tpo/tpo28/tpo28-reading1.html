            <b>Groundwater</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>Most of the world's potable water----freshwater <span class="underline">suitable</span> for drinking----is accounted for by <span class="underline">groundwater</span>, which is stored in the pores and fractures in rocks. There is more than 50 times as much freshwater stored <span class="underline">underground</span> than in all the freshwater rivers and lakes at the surface. Nearly 50 percent of all <span class="underline">groundwater</span> is stored in the upper 1,000 meters of Earth. At greater depths <span class="underline">within</span> Earth, the <span class="underline">pressure</span> of the overlying rock causes pores and cracks to close, reducing the <span class="underline">space</span> that <span class="underline">pore</span> water can <span class="underline">occupy</span>, and almost complete closure occurs at a depth of about 10 kilometers. The greatest water <span class="underline">storage</span>, <span class="underline">therefore</span>, lies near the surface.</p>
          <p>Aquifers, <span class="underline">Porosity</span> and Permeability.<span class="underline">Groundwater</span> is stored in a <span class="underline">variety</span> of rock types. A <span class="underline">groundwater</span> <span class="underline">reservoir</span> from which water can be extracted is called an <span class="underline">aquifer</span>. We can effectively think of an <span class="underline">aquifer</span> as a <span class="underline">deposit</span> of water. Extraction of water depends on two properties of the aquifer: <span class="underline">porosity</span> and permeability. Between <span class="underline">sediment</span> grains are spaces that can be filled with water. This <span class="underline">pore</span> <span class="underline">space</span> is known as <span class="underline">porosity</span> and is expressed as a percentage of the total rock <span class="underline">volume</span>. <span class="underline">Porosity</span> is important for water-storage <span class="underline">capacity</span>, but for water to flow <span class="underline">through</span> rocks, the <span class="underline">pore</span> spaces must be connected. The <span class="underline">ability</span> of water, or other fluids, to flow <span class="underline">through</span> the interconnected <span class="underline">pore</span> spaces in rocks is termed permeability. In the intergranular spaces of rocks, however, <span class="underline">fluid</span> must flow around and between grains in a tortuous <span class="underline">path</span>; this winding <span class="underline">path</span> causes a <span class="underline">resistance</span> to flow. The <span class="underline">rate</span> at which the flowing water overcomes this <span class="underline">resistance</span> is related to the permeability of rock.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="underline">Sediment</span> sorting and compaction influence permeability and <span class="underline">porosity</span>. The more poorly sorted or the more tightly compacted a <span class="underline">sediment</span> is ,the <span class="underline">lower</span> its <span class="underline">porosity</span> and permeability. Sedimentary rocks----the most <span class="underline">common</span> rock type near the surface----are also the most <span class="underline">common</span> reservoirs for water because they <span class="underline">contain</span> the most <span class="underline">space</span> that can be filled with water. Sandstones generally make good aquifers, while finer-grained mudstones are typically <span class="underline">impermeable</span>. <span class="underline">Impermeable</span> rocks are referred to as aquicludes. <span class="underline">Igneous</span> and <span class="underline">metamorphic</span> rocks are more <span class="underline">compact</span>, commonly <span class="underline">crystalline</span>, and <span class="underline">rarely</span> <span class="underline">contain</span> spaces between grains. However, <span class="underline">even</span> <span class="underline">igneous</span> and <span class="underline">metamorphic</span> rocks may act as <span class="underline">groundwater</span> reservoirs if <span class="underline">extensive</span> fracturing occurs in such rocks and if the <span class="underline">fracture</span> system is interconnected.</p>
          <p>The water table is the <span class="underline">underground</span> <span class="underline">boundary</span> below which all the cracks and pores are filled with water. In some cases, the water table reaches Earth's surface, where it is expressed as rivers, lakes and marshes. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> Typically, though, the water table may be tens or hundreds of meters below the surface. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> The water table is not <span class="underline">flat</span> but usually follows the contours of the <span class="underline">topography</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span> Above the water table is the vadose <span class="underline">zone</span>, <span class="underline">through</span> which rainwater percolates. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span> Water in the vadose <span class="underline">zone</span> drains down to the water table, leaving behind a thin <span class="underline">coating</span> of water on <span class="underline">mineral</span> grains. The vadose <span class="underline">zone</span> supplies plant roots near the surface with water.</p>
          <p>Because the surface of the water table is not <span class="underline">flat</span> but <span class="underline">instead</span> rises and falls with <span class="underline">topography</span>, <span class="underline">groundwater</span> is affected by <span class="underline">gravity</span> in the same <span class="underline">fashion</span> as surface water. <span class="underline">Groundwater</span> flows downhill to topographic lows. If the water table intersect the land surface, <span class="underline">groundwater</span> will flow out onto the surface at springs, whether to be collected there or to <span class="underline">subsequently</span> flow farther <span class="underline">along</span> a <span class="underline">drainage</span>. <span class="underline">Groundwater</span> commonly collects in <span class="underline">stream</span> drainages but may <span class="underline">remain</span> <span class="underline">entirely</span> <span class="underline">beneath</span> the surface of dry stream-beds in <span class="underline">arid</span> regions. In particularly wet years, short stretches of an <span class="underline">otherwise</span> dry stream-bed may have flowing water because the water table rises to intersect the land surface.</p>
