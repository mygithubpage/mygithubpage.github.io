Throat markings trigger aggressive behavior in other magpies.</p><p>B. Throat markings are extremely rare in magpies.</p><p>C. Magpies cannot see their own throats without looking in a mirror.</p><p>D. Magpies cannot easily remove a mark from their throats.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Positioning original, Professor: As I said, ,magpies are corvids, and because corvids have these other cognitive skills, researchers want to see if they were also capable of mirror‐self recognition, so they give them a mirror mark test, placing a yellow Sticker on the bird's black throats. At first, the magpies only engage in the same social behaviors that other animals do- looking behind the mirror, etc. But eventually some of the birds, while looking in the mirror, kept scratching at the mark until They got rid of it. As you can tell from the speech, they did this experiment to test whether magpies had the ability to look in the mirror. A yellow sticker was placed on the magpie black throat feathers. In the beginning, all the magpies, like other animals, started the same kind of social behavior - looking behind the mirror, and so on. In the end, there are some birds, when they look in the mirror, they keep catching the mark until they get rid of it. When there is no mirror, they did not catch this mark. So the correct answer is C. When there is no mirror, the magpie cannot see his own throat.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor,some corvids are known to hide their food.
