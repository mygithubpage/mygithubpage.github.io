              <span class="time" data-times="4.54" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in an animal <span class="underline">behavior</span> class. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="13.55" data-time="4.54">[00:04.54]</span>Professor: As you know, researchers have long been interested in discovering exactly how <span class="underline">intelligent</span> animals are.<span class="time" data-times="7.53" data-time="18.09">[00:18.09]</span>Today we are going to talk about a <span class="underline">particular</span> <span class="underline">cognitive</span> <span class="underline">ability</span> some animals <span class="underline">seem</span> to have-the <span class="underline">ability</span> to <span class="underline">recognize</span> themselves in a <span class="underline">mirror</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.43" data-time="25.62">[00:25.62]</span>Student: Oh. I've heard about that. <span class="time" data-times="1.49" data-time="27.05">[00:27.05]</span>Chimpanzees have it. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.78" data-time="28.54">[00:28.54]</span>Professor: Right. Chimpanzees and other primates, chimps, gorillas, orangutans, and of <span class="underline">course</span>, humans. <span class="time" data-times="4.69" data-time="34.32">[00:34.32]</span>But it's also been found in elephants and bottlenose dolphins, a bit of a surprise. <span class="time" data-times="1.49" data-time="39.01">[00:39.01]</span>It's very <span class="underline">rare</span>. <span class="time" data-times="1.4" data-time="40.5">[00:40.50]</span>Most animals don't have it. <span class="time" data-times="3.73" data-time="41.9">[00:41.90]</span>And it's called <span class="underline">mirror</span> self-recognition, or MSR. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="14.62" data-time="45.63">[00:45.63]</span>Student: Well, how does it work? I mean, how do researchers know if elephants or chimps <span class="underline">recognize</span> themselves? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.44" data-time="60.25">[01:00.25]</span>Professor: Researchers give them a <span class="underline">mirror</span> mark test. <span class="time" data-times="16.63" data-time="63.69">[01:03.69]</span>In the <span class="underline">mirror</span> mark test, researchers put a mark on the animal where the animal is unable to see it or smell it or feel it, like on the side of their head, without looking in the <span class="underline">mirror</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.57" data-time="80.32">[01:20.32]</span>Now, typically, when animals first see themselves in the <span class="underline">mirror</span>, they think they are seeing another animal. <span class="time" data-times="2.79" data-time="85.89">[01:25.89]</span>Often they will look for this animal behind the <span class="underline">mirror</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.64" data-time="88.68">[01:28.68]</span>They may <span class="underline">even</span> <span class="underline">exhibit</span> <span class="underline">aggressive</span> <span class="underline">behavior</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.27" data-time="91.32">[01:31.32]</span>But some animals, after this period of <span class="underline">exploration</span>, <span class="underline">exhibit</span> behaviors that show they know they are looking at themselves. <span class="time" data-times="4.5" data-time="98.59">[01:38.59]</span>For <span class="underline">instance</span>, elephants will touch the mark on their heads with their trunks. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="14.14" data-time="103.09">[01:43.09]</span>Now, it's been assumed that primates and some other mammals stood alone at the top of the <span class="underline">hierarchy</span> of <span class="underline">cognitive</span> <span class="underline">evolution</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.47" data-time="117.23">[01:57.23]</span>But recently, birds have been found to <span class="underline">possess</span> some of the same <span class="underline">cognitive</span> abilities!<span class="time" data-times="5.48" data-time="122.7">[02:02.70]</span>In <span class="underline">particular</span>, researchers have discovered these abilities in corvids, birds of the corvidae family. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="12.35" data-time="128.18">[02:08.18]</span>Corvids include ravens, jays, crows and magpies among others. <span class="time" data-times="3.43" data-time="140.53">[02:20.53]</span>And what kinds of <span class="underline">cognitive</span> abilities are we talking about? <span class="time" data-times="8.63" data-time="143.96">[02:23.96]</span>Well, corvids and some mammals have the <span class="underline">ability</span> to plan for the future, to store food for <span class="underline">instance</span>, in places where they can find it later. <span class="time" data-times="11.2" data-time="152.59">[02:32.59]</span>It's been suggested in fact that jays, corvids known for stealing each other's food, may <span class="underline">hide</span> their food precisely because they are projecting their own <span class="underline">tendency</span> to steal onto other jays. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.93" data-time="163.79">[02:43.79]</span>So let's talk about a study recently conducted with magpies. <span class="time" data-times="9.81" data-time="167.72">[02:47.72]</span>As I said, magpies are corvids.<span class="time" data-times="7.87" data-time="177.53">[02:57.53]</span> And because corvids have these other <span class="underline">cognitive</span> skills, researchers <span class="underline">wanted</span> to see if they were also <span class="underline">capable</span> of <span class="underline">mirror</span> self-recognition. <span class="time" data-times="5.82" data-time="185.4">[03:05.40]</span>So they gave them the <span class="underline">mirror</span> mark test, placing yellow sticker on the birds' black throat feathers. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.99" data-time="191.22">[03:11.22]</span>At first, the magpies all <span class="underline">engage</span> in the same social behaviors that other animals do-looking behind the <span class="underline">mirror</span>, etc.<span class="time" data-times="6.48" data-time="199.21">[03:19.21]</span>But <span class="underline">eventually</span>, some of the birds, while looking in the <span class="underline">mirror</span>, kept scratching at the mark until they got rid of it. <span class="time" data-times="3.58" data-time="205.69">[03:25.69]</span>And they didn't <span class="underline">scratch</span> at it when there was no <span class="underline">mirror</span> around.<span class="time" data-times="2.15" data-time="209.27">[03:29.27]</span> So they passed the test. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="11.6" data-time="211.42">[03:31.42]</span>Student: Wow! Do any other birds have this <span class="underline">ability</span>? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.98" data-time="223.02">[03:43.02]</span>Professor: Well, not that we know of. <span class="time" data-times="11.15" data-time="225">[03:45.00]</span>There was a study using pigeons, where researchers attempted to reduce MSR to a matter of conditioning, that is, they claimed that the <span class="underline">ability</span> to <span class="underline">recognize</span> oneself in a <span class="underline">mirror</span> could be learned. <span class="time" data-times="5.04" data-time="236.15">[03:56.15]</span>So these researchers basically trained some pigeons to pass the <span class="underline">mirror</span> mark test. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.99" data-time="241.19">[04:01.19]</span>But two things are <span class="underline">noteworthy</span> here. <span class="time" data-times="3.03" data-time="243.18">[04:03.18]</span>One, no one's ever replicated the study. <span class="time" data-times="2.85" data-time="246.21">[04:06.21]</span>But more importantly, it misses the point. <span class="time" data-times="3.08" data-time="249.06">[04:09.06]</span>The <span class="underline">issue</span> isn't whether some <span class="underline">behavior</span> can be learned. <span class="time" data-times="3.59" data-time="252.14">[04:12.14]</span>It's whether a <span class="underline">species</span> has developed this <span class="underline">ability</span> spontaneously. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.43" data-time="255.73">[04:15.73]</span>Student: So what does the test tell us about corvids or chimpanzees? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.05" data-time="259.16">[04:19.16]</span>Professor: Good question. <span class="time" data-times="7.39" data-time="260.21">[04:20.21]</span>For one thing, it is important because it sets animals with a <span class="underline">sense</span> of self apart from those without a <span class="underline">sense</span> of self. <span class="time" data-times="6.48" data-time="267.6">[04:27.60]</span>But more importantly, many researchers believe that MSR is <span class="underline">indicative</span> of other <span class="underline">advanced</span> <span class="underline">cognitive</span> abilities. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.66" data-time="274.08">[04:34.08]</span>Self-awareness, <span class="underline">even</span> in its earliest stages, might <span class="underline">entail</span> an <span class="underline">awareness</span> of others, the <span class="underline">ability</span> to see their <span class="underline">perspective</span>, to look at the world from another's point of view. <span class="time" data-times="4.54" data-time="283.74">[04:43.74]</span>This is <span class="underline">crucial</span>, because it implies a high <span class="underline">level</span> of <span class="underline">cognitive</span> <span class="underline">development</span>.<span class="time" data-times="3.43" data-time="288.28">[04:48.28]</span> It's perhaps the first <span class="underline">stage</span> toward the <span class="underline">development</span> of empathy. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.63" data-time="291.71">[04:51.71]</span>Student: But birds' brains are so small compared to primates. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.09" data-time="295.34">[04:55.34]</span>Professor: True. Though corvids do have unusually large brains for birds. <span class="time" data-times="2.24" data-time="299.43">[04:59.43]</span>But size isn't the whole story. <span class="time" data-times="7.17" data-time="301.67">[05:01.67]</span>It's thought that primates are so <span class="underline">intelligent</span> because of a certain part of their brains, which birds <span class="underline">simply</span> don't have. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.22" data-time="308.84">[05:08.84]</span>But there is an area in birds' brains that researchers believe governs <span class="underline">similar</span> <span class="underline">cognitive</span> functions.<span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="315.06">[05:15.06]</span>So primates and birds' brains have evolved <span class="underline">along</span> different tracks, but ended up with <span class="underline">similar</span> abilities. </p>
