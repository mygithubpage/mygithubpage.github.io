        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>I think group project would be beneficial for students. There are two reasons to support that. The first one is that students can learn to cooperate with each other through group project. For example, when I was in senior high, the first time ever, I was asked to work with 7 other people in an English project to do a play based on the famous short story "Necklace". At first, it didn't go that well. We all held our own opinions about how to do it and refused to listen to others' ideas. It went on like that for an hour and we all realized it wouldn't work if we couldn't work well with each other. We changed our attitude and cooperated to finish the project. It was a huge success at the end. The second main reason is that students can learn from each other in group work. Every time I am stuck with something, I always have my group members to turn to for help. Also, I always get motivated by the diligence of other students in my group. It pushes me not to give up and to try harder.</p>
