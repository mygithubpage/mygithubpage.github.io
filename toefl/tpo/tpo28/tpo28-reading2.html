As recently as 6,000 B.C. the southern <span class="highlight">frontier</span> of the <span class="highlight">desert</span> was far to the north of where it is now, while <span class="highlight">semiarid</span> grassland and <span class="highlight">shallow</span> freshwater lakes covered much of what are now <span class="highlight">arid</span> plains. This was a <span class="highlight">landscape</span> where <span class="highlight">antelope</span> of all kinds abounded----along with Bos primigenius, a kind of oxen that has become <span class="highlight">extinct</span>. The areas that are now <span class="highlight">desert</span> were, like all <span class="highlight">arid</span> regions, very <span class="highlight">susceptible</span> to cycles of higher and <span class="highlight">lower</span> levels of <span class="highlight">rainfall</span>, resulting in <span class="highlight">major</span>, sudden changes in distributions of plants and animals. The people who hunted the <span class="highlight">sparse</span><span class="highlight">desert</span> animals responded to <span class="highlight">drought</span> by managing the wild resources they hunted and gathered, especially wild oxen, which had to have <span class="highlight">regular</span> water supplies to <span class="highlight">survive</span>.</p><p><span class="highlight">Even</span> before the <span class="highlight">drought</span>, the Sahara was never well watered. Both humans and animals were <span class="highlight">constantly</span> on the move, in search of food and <span class="highlight">reliable</span> water supplies. Under these circumstances, archaeologist Andrew Smith believes, the small herds of Bos primigenius in the <span class="highlight">desert</span> became smaller, more closely knit <span class="highlight">breeding</span> units as the <span class="highlight">drought</span> took hold. The beasts were more disciplined, so that it was easier for hunters to <span class="highlight">predict</span> their habits, and <span class="highlight">capture</span> animals at will. At the same time, both <span class="highlight">cattle</span> and humans were more confined in their movements, staying much closer to <span class="highlight">permanent</span> water supplies for long periods of time. As a result, <span class="highlight">cattle</span> and humans came into close <span class="highlight">association</span>.</p><p>Smith believes that the hunters were well <span class="highlight">aware</span> of the more disciplined ways in which their <span class="highlight">prey</span> behaved. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span><span class="highlight">Instead</span> of following the <span class="highlight">cattle</span> on their <span class="highlight">annual</span> migrations, 
the hunters began to prevent the <span class="highlight">herd</span> from moving from one <span class="highlight">spot</span> to another. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>At first, they controlled the movement of the <span class="highlight">herd</span> while ensuring continuance of their meat <span class="highlight">diet</span>. 
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>But soon they also gained <span class="highlight">genetic</span> control of the animals, which led to rapid <span class="highlight">physical</span> changes in the <span class="highlight">herd</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>South African farmers who <span class="highlight">maintain</span> herds of wild eland (large African antelopes with short,
twisted horns) <span class="highlight">report</span> that the <span class="highlight">offspring</span> soon <span class="highlight">diminish</span> in size, unless wild bulls are introduced <span class="highlight">constantly</span> from outside. The same effects of inbreeding may have occurred in controlled <span class="highlight">cattle</span>
populations, with some <span class="highlight">additional</span>, and perhaps unrecognized, advantages. The newly <span class="highlight">domesticated</span> animals behaved better, were easier to control, and may have enjoyed a higher birth <span class="highlight">rate</span>, which in
turn yielded greater milk supplies. We know from <span class="question6">rock paintings deep in the Sahara</span> that the herders were soon selecting <span class="highlight">breeding</span> animals to produce <span class="highlight">offspring</span> with different <span class="highlight">horn</span> shapes and <span class="highlight">hide</span> 
colors.</p><p>It is still unclear whether <span class="highlight">domesticated</span><span class="highlight">cattle</span> were tamed independently in northern Africa or introduced to the <span class="highlight">continent</span> from southwest Asia. <span class="question8">Whatever the <span class="highlight">source</span> of the <span class="highlight">original</span> tamed herds might have been, it seems <span class="highlight">entirely</span> likely that much the same <span class="highlight">process</span> of juxtaposition (living side by side) and control occurred in both southwest Asia and northern Africa, and <span class="highlight">even</span> in Europe, among peoples who had an <span class="highlight">intimate</span> knowledge of the <span class="highlight">behavior</span> of wild <span class="highlight">cattle</span>.</span> The experiments with <span class="highlight">domestication</span> probably occurred in many places, as people living in ever-drier environments <span class="highlight">cast</span> around for more <span class="highlight">predictable</span> food supplies.</p><p>The <span class="highlight">cattle</span> herders had only a few possessions: unsophisticated pots and polished adzes. They also hunted with bow and <span class="highlight">arrow</span>. The Saharan people left a <span class="highlight">remarkable</span><span class="highlight">record</span> of their lives painted on the walls of caves deep in the <span class="highlight">desert</span>. Their <span class="highlight">artistic</span><span class="question10">endeavors</span> have been preserved in paintings of wild animals, <span class="highlight">cattle</span>, goats, humans, and scenes of daily life that <span class="highlight">extend</span> back perhaps to 5,000 B.C.. The <span class="highlight">widespread</span><span class="highlight">distribution</span> of <span class="highlight">pastoral</span> sites of this period suggests that the Saharans ranged their herds over widely separated summer and winter <span class="highlight">grazing</span> grounds.</p><p>About 3,500 B.C., <span class="highlight">climatic</span> conditions again <span class="question11">deteriorated</span>. The Sahara slowly became drier and lakes vanished. On the other hand, <span class="highlight">rainfall</span> increased in the <span class="highlight">interior</span> of western Africa, and the northern limit of the tsetse fly, an <span class="highlight">insect</span><span class="highlight">fatal</span> to <span class="highlight">cattle</span>, moved south. So the herders shifted south, following the <span class="highlight">major</span> river systems into savanna regions. By this time, the Saharan people were probably using <span class="highlight">domestic</span> crops, experimenting with such summer <span class="highlight">rainfall</span> crops as sorghum and millet as they move out of areas where they could grow wheat, barley, and other <span class="highlight">Mediterranean</span> crops.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 1, what was true of the Sahara region around 6,000 B.C.?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Much less of it was desert than is now the case.</p><p>B. Most areas that are now grassland were covered by shallow lakes.</p><p>C. It had just undergone a major climatic change.</p><p>D. Wild oxen and antelopes lived in separate parts of the region.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A wrote in the original text: "About 6,000 BC, on the southern boundary of the desert, the place far from the north is now arid plain. At that time, it was a place where the various antelopes and primitive cattle were rich in landscape painting." Said that time was not a desert. So, A. At the time, the desert was less than it is right now. B now has no grassland. C did not say that this change occurred in 6000 BC. D through "along with" can know that the two animals live together.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question2">albeit</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. usually</p><p>B. almost</p><p>C. though</p><p>D. rather</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" C"><p>C <span class="question2">albeit</span>: Although, even. Corresponds to the C option though. Corresponding to the original Sahara is a highly diverse, <span class="question2">albeit</span> dry, region that has undergone major climatic changes since 10,000 BC through the original word <span class="question2">albeit</span> before and after the two words can be introduced turning meaning, in front of the diversity, followed by dry, there are comparisons between the two kinds of praise , so choose C.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 1, which of the following is true of all arid regions?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They include at least some freshwater lakes.</p><p>B. They have similar distributions of plants and animals.</p><p>C. They are greatly affected by changes in the amount of rain they receive.</p><p>D. They have frequent droughts that make it difficult to manage the wild resources.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C According to all arid region positioning (red marked) option A is wrong, the original did not say. B. Although the original mentions the distribution of plants, it does not say that all the dry areas are similar. C is correct. The original text is very susceptible to higher and lower levels of rainfall. D is wrong. The last sentence says people start managing resources.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Paragraph 2 supports which of the following ideas about wild oxen in the Sahara region after the drought took hold?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They traveled in smaller herds.</p><p>B. They were harder for hunters to capture.</p><p>C. They tended to be significantly smaller in size.</p><p>D. They moved along less predictable routes.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A using oxen positioning, found that did not appear, but corresponding to the original text of beasts and battle, corresponding to the article three sentences, the fourth sentence: The beasts were more disciplined, so that it was easier for hunters to predict their habits, and capture animals at will At the same time, both cattle and humans were more confined in their movements, staying much closer to permanent water supplies for long periods of time. According to the original text: Livestock are more domesticated, habits are better predicted, easier to grasp, and animals And humans are more restricted in their movements, which means they are smaller and correspond to the A option. So B, D is wrong, C is not mentioned in the original text, only that the group is smaller.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 2, what was it that brought cattle and humans into close association?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The development of smaller breeding units within hers.</p><p>B. Cattle and humans staying close to permanent water supplies for long period of time.</p><p>C. The development of greater discipline among cattle.</p><p>D. Cattle and humans constangly on the move searching for food and reliable water supplies.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B According to the close association, to the last sentence, but this sentence says as a result, then the reason is that in the previous sentence: At the same time, both cattle and humans were more confined in their movements, staying much closer to permanent water supplies for long periods In the previous sentence, the battle human was closer to the water source, so it perfectly matched B. The ACD option is not the cause of this result.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the author mention the "<span class="highlight"><span class="question6">rock paintings deep in the Sahara</span></span>"?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To help explain why the hunters wanted to control the herds.</p><p>B. To provide support for the idea that the herders soon gained genetic control of the cattle</p><p>C. To show that the herders had artistic as well as practical abilities</p><p>D. To argue that the herders soon began to value their cattle for more than food.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>B has been talking about herders gain genetic control and its effects before this example. Then give this example. The following content also explains how the herdsman controlled the genes. Therefore, you should choose B.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 3, all of the following statements were true of newly domesticated animals EXCEPT</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They were controlled more easily by the farmers.</p><p>B. They produced a larger number of offspring.</p><p>C. They produce more milk.</p><p>D. They were larger in size.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D According to the domesticated animals, locate the last two sentences of this paragraph: The newly domesticated animals behaved better, were easier to control, and may have enjoyed a higher birth rate, which in turn yielded greater milk supplies. We know from <span class="question6">rock paintings deep in the Sahara</span> that the herders were soon made of controlled animals to produce offspring with different horn shapes and hide colors. The controlled more easily of the A option corresponds to the easier to control of the original text, not selected; a larger number of offspring of the B option and the original a Higher birth rate corresponds to, not selected; more milk of the C option corresponds to greater milksupply of the original text, not selected; the larger in size of the D option is the opposite of the offspring soon diminish in size of the fourth sentence of the countdown, so the error is D. .</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage paragraph 4? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Regardless of where the first tamed herds came from, people tried to control them by living in juxtaposition with them.</p><p>B. Regardless of where the first tamed herds came from, they resulted from the same process of juxtaposition and control by people who understood the behavior of wild cattle.</p><p>C. People who had an intimate knowledge of the behavior of wild cattle moved closer together to cooperate in taming the herd, regardless of where they found them.</p><p>D. The process of taming herds was certainly the same in southwest Asia, northern Africa, and Europe because people knew a lot about the behavior of wild cattle, regardless of where they lived.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The main logic of the B original sentence is the concession adverbial clause. The main content is that regardless of where the domesticated animal originated, the final method obtained in different regions is the same method: juxtaposition and control. According to the above information, the options are excluded: A: No problem in the first part of the sentence, the last part of the sentence does not match the original text; B: correct, including all the trunk parts; C: completely and the original text is not the same thing; D: and the original The logical relationship is contradictory and the original has no causal relationship.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 5, each of the following was true about the early Saharan people EXCEPT</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They had few possessions apart from cattle.</p><p>B. After about 5,000 , they lived primarily in caves that were located deep in the desert.</p><p>C. Between the summer and winter seasons, they moved their herds over long distances.</p><p>D. They painted animals and scenes of daily life on the walls of caves.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B, A opposed to the first sentence: The cattle herders had only a few possessions: unsophisticated pots and polished adzes. They had only dwellings and axes excluded cattle. C: The widespread distribution of pastoral The Sites of this period suggest that the Saharans ranged their herd over widely separated summer and winter grazing grounds. D: The third sentence: Their artistic <span class="question10">endeavors</span> have been preserved in paintings of wild animals, cattle, The goats, humans, And Scenes Of daily life that extend back perhaps to 5000 BC B also correspond to the third sentence. Although the original text says that they painted in the deep caves of the desert, they did not say they lived there. So wrong, choose B.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question10">endeavors</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. methods</p><p>B. styles</p><p>C. scenes</p><p>D. efforts</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" D"><p>D endeavor: Work hard, do your best. A is a method; B style; C scene; D effort. So D is the most appropriate. Corresponding to Original artistic Endeavors have been preserved in paintings of wild animals, cattle, goats, humans, and scenes of daily life that extend back perhaps to 5000 B.C. Before describing their life scene, property, hunting. Then say they draw. The question here is what was recorded. It should be their previous effort. The other words cannot be explained after they are brought in.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question11">deteriorated</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. became unstable</p><p>B. caused hardship</p><p>C. changed completely</p><p>D. got worse</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" D"><p>D deterioration: deterioration, deterioration. A is unstable, B is hard, C is completely changed, D is bad, and bad, so D is the correct option. Corresponding to the original About 3500 B.C., climatic conditions again <span class="question11">deteriorated</span>. The Sahara's description by the phrase following the word can be seen as negative development: drier, the lake disappeared. And deterioration is to echo such changes. ABC does not reflect the following context well. Only D is the most suitable.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 6, what allowed the herders to shift south into the savanna regions after about 3,500 B.C.?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They could easily grow Mediterranean crops in those regions.</p><p>B. They could more easily domesticated sorghum and millet in those regions.</p><p>C. The tsetse fly was no longer a problem in those regions.</p><p>D. The river systems in those regions provided reliable sources of water in the summer.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C Based on shift south and savanna region positioning information, this sentence begins with So, which proves that the previous sentence is the reason: On the other hand, rainfall increased in the interior of western Africa, and the northern limit of the tsetse fly, an insect In the previous sentence, the precipitation in the west increased, and the northern limit of the tsetse fly moved south, so the herd also moved south, corresponding to the C option. D may be an obfuscation option, but according to the original meaning of the word, river is just the cow's migration path "following", but it is not the reason.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>This knowledge enabled the hunters to adopt a different approach to hunting..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A sentence that needs to be inserted says "This knowledge makes the hunter change the method of hunting." Then the front should say what the hunter got, and later it should be said how this method has changed. The A option perfectly fits this logic and content. And the next few words have a clear development process, from at first to But soon.</p></div></div><div id="question14" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>, much of the Sahara region was semiarid grassland where humans hunted wild oxen and antelope.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.There was enough freshwater for Saharan peoples to move freely throughout the region without having to manage the resources they hunted and gathered.</p><p>B.When the drying climate forced cattle and humans close to each other in areas with water supplies, humans gained control over the cattle and eventually domesticated them.</p><p>C.Once Saharans controlled the breeding of their cattle, the characteristics of the cattle changed rapidly, increasing their reproductive rates and milk production.</p><p>D.Herders soon began selecting breeding animals to produce offspring with different horn shapes and hide colors, although the advantages of controlled inbreeding were not apparent to them at first.</p><p>E.Although the Saharan peoples were remarkably sophisticated artists, they had only a few simple possessions, like adzes and the bows and arrows they used for hunting.</p><p>F.As the drought worsened around 3500 B.C. and conditions for herders became more favorable to the south, the Saharan people moved into savanna regions, where they grew different crops.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="BCF"><p>The correct answer: B, C, F. A. The original text says that because of the drought, the peasants began to manage the resources. Corresponds to the last sentence of the first paragraph of the original text. B correct. Corresponds to the last few sentences of the second paragraph. It is said that people and animals have established contact. And after the continuous description of the process of domestication. C is correct. Corresponds to paragraph 3 of the original text. The first part of D was correct, but the latter part was incorrect. After they selected the breeding stock, they clearly knew the benefits. E Although this article has all been mentioned, there is no such logic change as although. So don't choose. F correct. Corresponds to the last paragraph of the article. Correct. Corresponds to the last paragraph of the article.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
