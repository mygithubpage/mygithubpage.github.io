            <b>Early Saharan Pastoralists</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>The Sahara is a highly <span class="underline">diverse</span>, <span class="underline">albeit</span> dry, <span class="underline">region</span> that has undergone <span class="underline">major</span> <span class="underline">climatic</span> changes since 10,000 B.C. As recently as 6,000 B.C. the southern <span class="underline">frontier</span> of the <span class="underline">desert</span> was far to the north of where it is now, while <span class="underline">semiarid</span> grassland and <span class="underline">shallow</span> freshwater lakes covered much of what are now <span class="underline">arid</span> plains. This was a <span class="underline">landscape</span> where <span class="underline">antelope</span> of all kinds abounded----along with Bos primigenius, a kind of oxen that has become <span class="underline">extinct</span>. The areas that are now <span class="underline">desert</span> were, like all <span class="underline">arid</span> regions, very <span class="underline">susceptible</span> to cycles of higher and <span class="underline">lower</span> levels of <span class="underline">rainfall</span>, resulting in <span class="underline">major</span>, sudden changes in distributions of plants and animals. The people who hunted the <span class="underline">sparse</span> <span class="underline">desert</span> animals responded to <span class="underline">drought</span> by managing the wild resources they hunted and gathered, especially wild oxen, which had to have <span class="underline">regular</span> water supplies to <span class="underline">survive</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="underline">Even</span> before the <span class="underline">drought</span>, the Sahara was never well watered. Both humans and animals were <span class="underline">constantly</span> on the move, in search of food and <span class="underline">reliable</span> water supplies. Under these circumstances, archaeologist Andrew Smith believes, the small herds of Bos primigenius in the <span class="underline">desert</span> became smaller, more closely knit <span class="underline">breeding</span> units as the <span class="underline">drought</span> took hold. The beasts were more disciplined, so that it was easier for hunters to <span class="underline">predict</span> their habits, and <span class="underline">capture</span> animals at will. At the same time, both <span class="underline">cattle</span> and humans were more confined in their movements, staying much closer to <span class="underline">permanent</span> water supplies for long periods of time. As a result, <span class="underline">cattle</span> and humans came into close <span class="underline">association</span>.</p>
          <p>Smith believes that the hunters were well <span class="underline">aware</span> of the more disciplined ways in which their <span class="underline">prey</span> behaved. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> <span class="underline">Instead</span> of following the <span class="underline">cattle</span> on their <span class="underline">annual</span> migrations, 
the hunters began to prevent the <span class="underline">herd</span> from moving from one <span class="underline">spot</span> to another. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>At first, they controlled the movement of the <span class="underline">herd</span> while ensuring continuance of their meat <span class="underline">diet</span>. 
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>But soon they also gained <span class="underline">genetic</span> control of the animals, which led to rapid <span class="underline">physical</span> changes in the <span class="underline">herd</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>South African farmers who <span class="underline">maintain</span> herds of wild eland (large African antelopes with short,
twisted horns) <span class="underline">report</span> that the <span class="underline">offspring</span> soon <span class="underline">diminish</span> in size, unless wild bulls are introduced <span class="underline">constantly</span> from outside. The same effects of inbreeding may have occurred in controlled <span class="underline">cattle</span>
populations, with some <span class="underline">additional</span>, and perhaps unrecognized, advantages. The newly <span class="underline">domesticated</span> animals behaved better, were easier to control, and may have enjoyed a higher birth <span class="underline">rate</span>, which in
turn yielded greater milk supplies. We know from rock paintings deep in the Sahara that the herders were soon selecting <span class="underline">breeding</span> animals to produce <span class="underline">offspring</span> with different <span class="underline">horn</span> shapes and <span class="underline">hide</span> 
colors.</p>
          <p>It is still unclear whether <span class="underline">domesticated</span> <span class="underline">cattle</span> were tamed independently in northern Africa or introduced to the <span class="underline">continent</span> from southwest Asia. Whatever the <span class="underline">source</span> of the <span class="underline">original</span> tamed herds might have been, it seems <span class="underline">entirely</span> likely that much the same <span class="underline">process</span> of juxtaposition (living side by side) and control occurred in both southwest Asia and northern Africa, and <span class="underline">even</span> in Europe, among peoples who had an <span class="underline">intimate</span> knowledge of the <span class="underline">behavior</span> of wild <span class="underline">cattle</span>. The experiments with <span class="underline">domestication</span> probably occurred in many places, as people living in ever-drier environments <span class="underline">cast</span> around for more <span class="underline">predictable</span> food supplies.</p>
          <p>The <span class="underline">cattle</span> herders had only a few possessions: unsophisticated pots and polished adzes. They also hunted with bow and <span class="underline">arrow</span>. The Saharan people left a <span class="underline">remarkable</span> <span class="underline">record</span> of their lives painted on the walls of caves deep in the <span class="underline">desert</span>. Their <span class="underline">artistic</span> endeavors have been preserved in paintings of wild animals, <span class="underline">cattle</span>, goats, humans, and scenes of daily life that <span class="underline">extend</span> back perhaps to 5,000 B.C.. The <span class="underline">widespread</span> <span class="underline">distribution</span> of <span class="underline">pastoral</span> sites of this period suggests that the Saharans ranged their herds over widely separated summer and winter <span class="underline">grazing</span> grounds.</p>
          <p>About 3,500 B.C., <span class="underline">climatic</span> conditions again deteriorated. The Sahara slowly became drier and lakes vanished. On the other hand, <span class="underline">rainfall</span> increased in the <span class="underline">interior</span> of western Africa, and the northern limit of the tsetse fly, an <span class="underline">insect</span> <span class="underline">fatal</span> to <span class="underline">cattle</span>, moved south. So the herders shifted south, following the <span class="underline">major</span> river systems into savanna regions. By this time, the Saharan people were probably using <span class="underline">domestic</span> crops, experimenting with such summer <span class="underline">rainfall</span> crops as sorghum and millet as they move out of areas where they could grow wheat, barley, and other <span class="underline">Mediterranean</span> crops.</p>
