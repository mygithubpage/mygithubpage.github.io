Evidence of an ancient civilization in central Asia.</p><p>B. Archaeological techniques used to uncover ancient settlements.</p><p>C. The controversy concerning an archaeological find in central Asia.</p><p>D. Methods used to preserve archaeological sites in arid area.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>As soon as the professor said that the archeologist dream found the ancient civilization, many people thought that this was impossible, but he did find out what he said next. This ancient civilization was discovered and how the evidence proved that he was an ancient civilization.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What points does the professor make about mound sites?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They are easier to excavate than other types of archaeological sites.</p><p>B. They often provide information about several generations of people.</p><p>C. They often contain evidence of trade.</p><p>D. Most have been found in what are now desert areas.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Awareness of exposure of wealth of information about the everyday life of a wealth of information about the everyday life of a people of a settlement over occupations occupations. Occurrence of A simplicity is ruled out. C trade is located at a later point, independent of site Clearly excluded, D desert was mentioned in the introduction section of the beginning, but in this example of the professor's explanation, he chose B to run back and listen again. He had heard that for a long time this place had had a house temple but it was gone. Since then, people have built a lot of new things, so only layers and size of the city are about the information at the time.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor compare Gonur-depe to ancient Egypt?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To point out that Gonur-depe existed earlier than other ancient civilizations.</p><p>B. To emphasize that the findings at Gonur-depe are evidence of an ancient civilization.</p><p>C. To demonstrate that the findings at these locations have little in common.</p><p>D. To suggest that the discovery of Gonur-depe will lead to more research in Egypt.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>When the professor said GD, he said something amazing, stating that teaching this culture is a very positive attitude. After saying that traces of jewelry, etc. were found, it was shown that the professor had to verify from the very beginning that GD is proof of civilization. The thing that AGD has in Egypt and China is definitely lateer is not earlier. C little in common is wrong, it is negative feeling. D more research did not mention, and this article emphasizes the evidence</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor imply about the people of Gonur-depe?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They avoided contact with people from other areas.</p><p>B. They inhibited Gonur-depe before resettling in Egypt.</p><p>C. They are skilled in jewelry making.</p><p>D. They modeled their city after cities in China.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Only after the site at Gonur-depe was excavated were archaeologists able to identify it as coming from Gonur-depe. The key words were on artifacts. Later the professor said that other jewels that passed identification also belonged to GD, so they were very skillful for jewelry making. .</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>Settlements existed at the Gonur-depe site for only a few hundred years. What does the professor say might explain this fact?Click on two answers.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. War with neighboring settlements.</p><p>B. Destruction caused by an earthquake.</p><p>C. Changes in the course of the Murgab River.</p><p>D. Frequent flooding of the Murgab River.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="AC"><p>So one theory is that the river's course shifted toward the South, and they simply followed it and built new towns to the South.</p><p>Another theory is that they were involved in wars with neighboring settlements. But we might never know the truth. This is actually a good point to listen to. Below is a record about them. There are two theory about their transfer. The first one is Because the river changed, they followed their migration. The second was a neighboring settlement. It was not heard but it was based on the obvious neighbor. Flooding and earthquake did not mention it.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the professor's opinion of the future of the Gonur-depe site?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. She believes it would be a mistake to alter its original form.</p><p>B. She doubts the ruins will deteriorate further.</p><p>C. She thinks other sites are more deserving of researchers' attention.</p><p>D. She is not convinced it will be restored.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>It will take a lot of funding to restore it and I am not sure it'll be made available, which would be a pity. Even a partially altered site can provide valuable information, which would be lost otherwise. Isotherwise, the professor's general idea is that giving him money does not necessarily have any useful place, but it does not give us or determine what we will lose, so we can see the uncertainty of the professor.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
