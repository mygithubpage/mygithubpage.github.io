              <span class="time" data-times="6.03" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in an <span class="underline">archaeology</span> class. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="14.49" data-time="6.03">[00:06.03]</span>Professor: It's every archaeologist's dream to find a lost <span class="underline">civilization</span>, to make some huge discovery, to find artifacts no one else has laid a hand on in <span class="underline">millennia</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.47" data-time="20.52">[00:20.52]</span>You might think that this never happens any more, <span class="underline">given</span> all the research in <span class="underline">archaeology</span> that's been done. <span class="time" data-times="11.95" data-time="25.99">[00:25.99]</span>But in the late twentieth <span class="underline">century</span>, archaeologists discovered the remains of a <span class="underline">sophisticated</span> people whose <span class="underline">settlement</span> might have been the hub of a <span class="underline">civilization</span> few people <span class="underline">even</span> thought existed. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.23" data-time="37.94">[00:37.94]</span>They found this site at the <span class="underline">edge</span> of a <span class="underline">desert</span> in Turkmenistan, in central Asia, where a <span class="underline">series</span> of mounds rise up from the plains.<span class="time" data-times="13.14" data-time="46.17">[00:46.17]</span>Now, you might remember because we've talked about this, archaeologists know that mounds such as these are the kinds of geological features that <span class="underline">indicate</span> the presence of <span class="underline">ancient</span> settlements. Jim? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.16" data-time="59.31">[00:59.31]</span>Student: Um...mounds can be different things, right?<span class="time" data-times="1.71" data-time="69.47">[01:09.47]</span> Some are <span class="underline">burial</span> places... </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.11" data-time="71.18">[01:11.18]</span>Professor: Exactly. And some are the remains of cities. <span class="time" data-times="4.6" data-time="74.29">[01:14.29]</span>The inhabitants would build houses and temples you know, what have you.<span class="time" data-times="5.55" data-time="78.89">[01:18.89]</span>And over time, those buildings would fall down or be torn down and then be built over. <span class="time" data-times="9.03" data-time="84.44">[01:24.44]</span>Over time, generations of building and rebuilding in the same area would result in a large hill the size of a city.<span class="time" data-times="11.75" data-time="93.47">[01:33.47]</span>Careful <span class="underline">excavation</span> and <span class="underline">documentation</span> of layers in a <span class="underline">mound</span> can <span class="underline">reveal</span> a wealth of information about the everyday life of a people in a <span class="underline">settlement</span> over many periods of occupation. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.44" data-time="105.22">[01:45.22]</span>Now, this <span class="underline">particular</span> site is called Gonur-depe. <span class="time" data-times="21.22" data-time="108.66">[01:48.66]</span>What was found at Gonur-depe was amazing: the ruins of a huge palace <span class="underline">complex</span>, the foundations of shops and houses, the remains of thick walls and towers that fortified the city. <span class="time" data-times="5.03" data-time="129.88">[02:09.88]</span>There was <span class="underline">even</span> an <span class="underline">elaborate</span> <span class="underline">canal</span> system and a lot of very <span class="underline">intricate</span> <span class="underline">jewelry</span>. <span class="time" data-times="11.17" data-time="134.91">[02:14.91]</span>All these findings <span class="underline">seem</span> to <span class="underline">indicate</span> that they are the remains of an <span class="underline">ancient</span> <span class="underline">civilization</span> that was every bit as <span class="underline">advanced</span> as other more famous civilizations of the time. <span class="time" data-times="2.92" data-time="146.08">[02:26.08]</span>Like those in Egypt, or, or China. <span class="time" data-times="14.67" data-time="149">[02:29.00]</span>And the site dates back to 3,000 B.C.E. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.13" data-time="163.67">[02:43.67]</span>Student: Did they <span class="underline">trade</span> with those other civilizations? <span class="time" data-times="3.66" data-time="166.8">[02:46.80]</span>Because if they did, wouldn't there've been some <span class="underline">evidence</span> of that?<span class="time" data-times="3.46" data-time="170.46">[02:50.46]</span> You know, an <span class="underline">artifact</span> found in the ruins of other civilizations? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.38" data-time="173.92">[02:53.92]</span>Professor: That's a good question.<span class="time" data-times="8.37" data-time="175.3">[02:55.30]</span> I mentioned <span class="underline">Jewelry</span>, well, <span class="underline">Jewelry</span> have been found in <span class="underline">Mesopotamia</span> and at <span class="underline">archaeological</span> sites in modern-day Pakistan. <span class="time" data-times="3.08" data-time="183.67">[03:03.67]</span>But archaeologists didn't know where it came from.<span class="time" data-times="9.59" data-time="186.75">[03:06.75]</span> Only after the site at Gonur-depe was excavated were archaeologists able to <span class="underline">identify</span> it as coming from Gonur-depe. Uh, Sheryl? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="11.59" data-time="196.34">[03:16.34]</span>Student: I <span class="underline">wonder</span> why nobody have found this site before. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.39" data-time="207.93">[03:27.93]</span>Professor: Well, before the discovery of this site, it was commonly believed that central Asia had always been occupied by mostly <span class="underline">nomadic</span> people. <span class="time" data-times="2.46" data-time="216.32">[03:36.32]</span>So there would be no <span class="underline">record</span> of <span class="underline">major</span> settlements. <span class="time" data-times="5.78" data-time="218.78">[03:38.78]</span>A <span class="underline">couple</span> of small finds have been made in the area, but really, no one had looked very hard. <span class="time" data-times="8.02" data-time="224.56">[03:44.56]</span>Now, one mystery regarding this site is that <span class="underline">archaeological</span> records show it was inhabited for only a few centuries. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.23" data-time="232.58">[03:52.58]</span>Student: What happened to the people who lived there? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.59" data-time="234.81">[03:54.81]</span>Professor: Well, the site was close to the Murgab River, which they would have depended on for their water. <span class="time" data-times="7.37" data-time="240.4">[04:00.40]</span>And the Murgab River, which runs toward the west, is the kind of river that shifts its <span class="underline">course</span> over time. <span class="time" data-times="8.76" data-time="247.77">[04:07.77]</span>So one <span class="underline">theory</span> is that the river's <span class="underline">course</span> shifted toward the South, and they <span class="underline">simply</span> followed it and built new towns to the South. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.7" data-time="256.53">[04:16.53]</span>Another <span class="underline">theory</span> is that they were involved in wars with neighboring settlements.<span class="time" data-times="1.97" data-time="261.23">[04:21.23]</span> But we might never know the truth. <span class="time" data-times="8.48" data-time="263.2">[04:23.20]</span>One thing we do know is that in the decades since Gonur-depe was discovered, the site has deteriorated <span class="underline">significantly</span>.<span class="time" data-times="3.54" data-time="271.68">[04:31.68]</span>I mean, it's been disturbed for the first time in <span class="underline">millennia</span>.<span class="time" data-times="5.57" data-time="275.22">[04:35.22]</span> And being <span class="underline">exposed</span> to the Sun and wind has taken its toll on the <span class="underline">ancient</span> city. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.47" data-time="280.79">[04:40.79]</span>So now the question is, do we <span class="underline">partially</span> <span class="underline">restore</span> and rebuild the site before the entire thing disintegrates? <span class="time" data-times="7.02" data-time="287.26">[04:47.26]</span>It will take a lot of <span class="underline">funding</span> to <span class="underline">restore</span> it and I am not sure it'll be made <span class="underline">available</span>, which would be a pity. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="294.28">[04:54.28]</span> <span class="underline">Even</span> a <span class="underline">partly</span> altered site can provide <span class="underline">valuable</span> information, which would be lost <span class="underline">otherwise</span>. </p>
