              <p>Plants absorb most of the red light that hits them, but plants only absorb some of the far-red light that hits them. They reflect the rest. Remember this, because it's going to be relevant in an experiment I want to discuss. The incoming red light is absorbed almost entirely, but it only absorbs part of the infrared light and reflects it, so it absorbs more red light than infrared light.</p>

              <p>A ratio of less red and to more far-red light would cause a reaction from the plant. It would stop growing taller, because that plant would sense that it wasn't going to get sufficient sunlight to provide the energy to grow large. The proportion of light is less than that of infrared, and when the proportion of infrared light is higher than that of red, the plant will stop growing. This is the ratio that will slow down its growth.</p>
