The differences in how humans and plants sense light.</p><p>B. An explanation of an experiment on color and wavelength.</p><p>C. How plants sense and respond to different wavelengths of light.</p><p>D. The process by which photoreceptors distinguish wavelengths of light.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The professor talks today about how light affects plants. Plants also have the ability to distinguish different wavelengths of light, that is, how plants respond and sense light stimulation.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor,what is one way that a plant reacts to changes in the number of hours of sunlight?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The plant absorbs different wavelengths of light.</p><p>B. The plant begins to flower or stops flowering.</p><p>C. The number of photoreceptors in the plant increases.</p><p>D. The plant's rate of photosynthesis increases.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Some plant species won't flower if they sense too much light and some plants will only flower if something sense a specific amount of light. Some plants do not bloom because they perceive too much light, some plants only feel a certain amount of light It only blossoms, which means that flowering or not is a way for plants to cope with the light.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor think that it is inappropriate for certain wavelengths of light to be named "far-red"?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Far-red wavelengths appear identical to red wavelengths to the human eye.</p><p>B. Far-red wavelengths have the same effects on plants as red wavelengths do.</p><p>C. Far-red wavelengths travel shorter distances than red wavelengths do.</p><p>D. Far-red wavelengths are not perceived as red by the human eye.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>Specifically there's a space called far-red. Although why they call it far-red ... I mean, it is not red at all. It lies in the infrared range of the spectrum. We can't see it, but plants can sense it As a different wavelength.</p><p>The human eye cannot see far-red, so the professor thinks that calling it far-red is actually problematic.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What points does the professor make when she discusses the red light and far-red light that reaches plants?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. All of the far-red light that reaches plants is used for photosynthesis.</p><p>B. Plants flower more rapidly in response to far-red light than to red light.</p><p>C. Plants absorb more of the red light that reaches them than of the far-red light.</p><p>D. Red-light is absorbed more slowly by plants than far-red light is.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Plants absorb most of the red light that hits them, but plants only absorb some of the far-red light that hits them. They reflect the rest. Remember this, because it's going to be relevant in an experiment I want to discuss. The incoming red light is absorbed almost entirely, but it only absorbs part of the infrared light and reflects it, so it absorbs more red light than infrared light.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor,how does a plant typically react when it senses a high ratio of far-red light to red light?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It slows down its growth.</p><p>B. It begins photosynthesis.</p><p>C. It produces more photoreceptors.</p><p>D. It starts to release it seeds.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A ratio of less red and to more far-red light would cause a reaction from the plant. It would stop growing taller, because that plant would sense that it wasn't going to get sufficient sunlight to provide the energy to grow large. The proportion of light is less than that of infrared, and when the proportion of infrared light is higher than that of red, the plant will stop growing. This is the ratio that will slow down its growth.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>In the Pampas experiment,what was the function of LEDs?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To simulate photosynthesis.</p><p>B. To simulate red light.</p><p>C. To add to the intensity of the sunlight.</p><p>D. To provide additional far-red light.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>In the speech, these light emitting diodes can stimulate red light directly.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
