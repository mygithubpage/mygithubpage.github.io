              <span class="time" data-times="5.28" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in a <span class="underline">botany</span> class.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="13.53" data-time="5.28">[00:05.28]</span>Professor: OK. Last time we talked about <span class="underline">photosynthesis</span>, the <span class="underline">process</span> by which plants use light to <span class="underline">convert</span> <span class="underline">carbon</span> <span class="underline">dioxide</span> and water into food. <span class="time" data-times="4.04" data-time="18.81">[00:18.81]</span>Today I want to talk about another way light affects plants. <span class="time" data-times="9.7" data-time="22.85">[00:22.85]</span>I am sure you all know from physics class about how light moves in <span class="underline">microscopic</span> ways and that we can only see light when the wavelength of that light is in a <span class="underline">specific</span> <span class="underline">range</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.73" data-time="32.55">[00:32.55]</span>Plus, depending on the wavelengths, we see different colors.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.13" data-time="36.28">[00:36.28]</span>Well, plants are also <span class="underline">capable</span> of distinguishing between different wavelengths of light.<span class="time" data-times="1.94" data-time="41.41">[00:41.41]</span> Now, I don't want to confuse you. <span class="time" data-times="1.8" data-time="43.35">[00:43.35]</span>It is not like plants have eyes. <span class="time" data-times="6.15" data-time="45.15">[00:45.15]</span>Plants don't see in the <span class="underline">sense</span> that humans or animals do, but they do have photoreceptors.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="12.88" data-time="51.3">[00:51.30]</span>Photoreceptors are cells that <span class="underline">respond</span> to light by sending out a chemical <span class="underline">signal</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.17" data-time="64.18">[01:04.18]</span>And the <span class="underline">organism</span>, the plant, reacts to this <span class="underline">signal</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.42" data-time="67.35">[01:07.35]</span>In fact, the signals that plants get from their photoreceptors sometimes cause <span class="underline">significant</span> reactions.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.38" data-time="73.77">[01:13.77]</span>And many plants are <span class="underline">seasonal</span>.<span class="time" data-times="5.85" data-time="83.15">[01:23.15]</span> And one way they know when winter is ending and <span class="underline">spring</span> is beginning is by sensing the change in light. <span class="time" data-times="4.9" data-time="89">[01:29.00]</span>The time when an adult plant flowers is based on the <span class="underline">amount</span> of light the plant senses. <span class="time" data-times="7.63" data-time="93.9">[01:33.90]</span>Certain plant <span class="underline">species</span> won't flower if they <span class="underline">sense</span> too much light and some plants will only flower if they <span class="underline">sense</span> a <span class="underline">specific</span> <span class="underline">amount</span> of light.<span class="time" data-times="2.78" data-time="101.53">[01:41.53]</span>Of <span class="underline">course</span>, these aren't <span class="underline">conscious</span> reactions.<span class="time" data-times="3.64" data-time="104.31">[01:44.31]</span>These plants just automatically <span class="underline">respond</span> to light in certain ways.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.67" data-time="107.95">[01:47.95]</span>Plants are also able to <span class="underline">distinguish</span> between <span class="underline">specific</span> wavelengths of light that the human eye cannot <span class="underline">even</span> see! <span class="time" data-times="3.65" data-time="114.62">[01:54.62]</span> <span class="underline">Specifically</span> there's a wavelength called far-red.<span class="time" data-times="5.41" data-time="118.27">[01:58.27]</span>Although why they call it far-red ... I mean, it is not red at all. <span class="time" data-times="2.94" data-time="123.68">[02:03.68]</span>It lies in the <span class="underline">infrared</span> <span class="underline">range</span> of the <span class="underline">spectrum</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.49" data-time="126.62">[02:06.62]</span>We can't see it, but plants can <span class="underline">sense</span> it as a different wavelength.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.07" data-time="131.11">[02:11.11]</span>OK. Now I need to <span class="underline">mention</span> another thing about <span class="underline">photosynthesis</span>.<span class="time" data-times="4.58" data-time="135.18">[02:15.18]</span>I didn't explain how different wavelengths of light <span class="underline">affect</span> <span class="underline">photosynthesis</span>.<span class="time" data-times="7.65" data-time="139.76">[02:19.76]</span>When a plant absorbs light for performing <span class="underline">photosynthesis</span>, it only absorbs some wavelengths of light and reflects others. <span class="time" data-times="7.58" data-time="147.41">[02:27.41]</span>Plants <span class="underline">absorb</span> most of the red light that hits them, but plants only <span class="underline">absorb</span> some of the far-red light that hits them.<span class="time" data-times="1.67" data-time="154.99">[02:34.99]</span> They <span class="underline">reflect</span> the rest. <span class="time" data-times="4.16" data-time="156.66">[02:36.66]</span>Remember this, because it's going to be <span class="underline">relevant</span> in an experiment I want to discuss.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="12.97" data-time="160.82">[02:40.82]</span>This <span class="underline">fascinating</span> experiment showed that plants not only <span class="underline">detect</span> and react to <span class="underline">specific</span> wavelengths of light, plants can also <span class="underline">detect</span> and react to changes in the <span class="underline">ratio</span> of one wavelength to another.<span class="time" data-times="3.86" data-time="173.79">[02:53.79]</span>This experiment was called the Pampas experiment.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="17.84" data-time="177.65">[02:57.65]</span>The idea behind the Pampas experiment had to do with the <span class="underline">response</span> of plants to changes in the <span class="underline">ratio</span> of red light to far-red light that the plants <span class="underline">sense</span> with their photoreceptors.<span class="time" data-times="12.37" data-time="195.49">[03:15.49]</span>Some biologists <span class="underline">hypothesize</span> that a plant will stop growing if it's in the <span class="underline">shade</span> of another plant, a <span class="underline">reaction</span> that's triggered when it senses an unusual <span class="underline">ratio</span> of red light to far-red light.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.42" data-time="207.86">[03:27.86]</span>OK. Imagine there are two plants. <span class="time" data-times="2.15" data-time="210.28">[03:30.28]</span>One below the other.<span class="time" data-times="7" data-time="212.43">[03:32.43]</span>The plant on top would <span class="underline">absorb</span> most of the red light for <span class="underline">photosynthesis</span>, but <span class="underline">reflect</span> most of the far-red light. <span class="time" data-times="4.99" data-time="219.43">[03:39.43]</span>That would <span class="underline">lead</span> to the plant in its <span class="underline">shade</span> sensing an unusual <span class="underline">ratio</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.81" data-time="224.42">[03:44.42]</span>There will be less red light and more far-red light than normal.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.99" data-time="228.23">[03:48.23]</span>What that <span class="underline">ratio</span> signifies is important. <span class="time" data-times="5.78" data-time="231.22">[03:51.22]</span>A <span class="underline">ratio</span> of less red and to more far-red light would cause a <span class="underline">reaction</span> from the plant. <span class="time" data-times="8.07" data-time="237">[03:57.00]</span>It would stop growing taller, because that plant could <span class="underline">sense</span> that it wasn't going to get enough sunlight to provide the energy to grow large.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.41" data-time="245.07">[04:05.07]</span>To test their <span class="underline">hypothesis</span>, researchers took some electrical lights, um... actually, they were light-emitting diodes, or LEDs. <span class="time" data-times="11.61" data-time="253.48">[04:13.48]</span>These light-emitting diodes could <span class="underline">simulate</span> red light. <span class="time" data-times="3.63" data-time="265.09">[04:25.09]</span>So they put these LEDs around some plants that were in the <span class="underline">shade</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.88" data-time="268.72">[04:28.72]</span>The LEDs produce light that the plants sensed as red.</p>

              <span class="time" data-times="5.79" data-time="272.6">[04:32.60]</span>But, unlike sunlight, the light from these LEDs did not support <span class="underline">photosynthesis</span>. <span class="time" data-times="13.5" data-time="278.39">[04:38.39]</span>So the plants sensed the <span class="underline">proper</span> <span class="underline">ratio</span> of red light to far-red light and reacted by continuing to grow taller, while in reality these plants were not getting enough energy from <span class="underline">photosynthesis</span> to support all of that growth. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="291.89">[04:51.89]</span>And because they weren't getting enough energy to support their growth, most of the shaded plants died after a short time. </p>
