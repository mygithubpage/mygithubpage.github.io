          <h4 class="w3-center">Buck Rubs and Buck Scrapes</h4>
          <p>A <span class="highlight question1">conspicuous</span> sign indicating the presence of white-tailed deer in a woodlot is a <span class="highlight">buck</span> <span class="highlight">rub</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>A <span class="highlight">male</span> deer makes a <span class="highlight">buck</span> <span class="highlight">rub</span> by striping the <span class="highlight">bark</span> (outer <span class="highlight">layer</span>) of a small tree with its antlers.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>When completed, the <span class="highlight">buck</span> <span class="highlight">rub</span> is an <span class="highlight">obvious</span> <span class="highlight">visual</span> <span class="highlight">signal</span> to us and presumable to other deer in the area. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>A <span class="highlight">rub</span> is usually located at the shoulder height of a deer
(one meter or less above the ground) on a smooth-barked, small-diameter (16-25 millimeters) tree. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>The smooth <span class="highlight">bark</span> of small red maples makes this <span class="highlight">species</span> <span class="highlight">ideal</span> for <span class="highlight">buck</span> rubs in the forests of 
the mid-eastern United States.</p>
          <p>Adult <span class="highlight">male</span> deer usually produce rubs in late summer or early autumn when the outer velvet <span class="highlight">layer</span> is being <span class="highlight">shed</span> from their antlers. Rubs are created about one to two months before the <span class="highlight">breeding</span> <span class="highlight">season</span> (the rut). Hence for a long time biologists believed that <span class="highlight">male</span> deer used <span class="highlight">buck</span> rubs not only to clean and <span class="highlight">polish</span> antlers but also to provide practice for the ensuing male-to-male <span class="highlight">combat</span> during the rut. However, biologists also <span class="highlight">noted</span> deer sniff and lick an unfamiliar <span class="highlight">rub</span>, which suggests that this <span class="highlight">visual</span> mark on a small tree plays an important communication purpose in the social life of deer.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="highlight">Buck</span> rubs also have a <span class="highlight">scent</span> produced by glands in the foreheads of deer that is transferred to the tree when the <span class="highlight">rub</span> is made. These odors make <span class="highlight">buck</span> rubs an important means of <span class="highlight">olfactory</span> communication between deer. The importance of <span class="highlight">olfactory</span> communication (using odors to <span class="highlight">communicate</span>) in the way of life of deer was documented by a study of <span class="highlight">captive</span> adult <span class="highlight">male</span> deer a few decades ago, which <span class="highlight">noted</span> that males rubbed their foreheads on branches and twigs, especially as autumn approached. A <span class="highlight">decade</span> later another study reported that adult <span class="highlight">male</span> white-tailed deer <span class="question4">exhibited</span> forehead rubbing just before and during the rut. It was found that when a white-tailed <span class="highlight">buck</span> makes a <span class="highlight">rub</span>, it moves both antlers and forehead glands <span class="highlight">along</span> the small tree in a <span class="highlight">vertical</span> direction. This forehead rubbing <span class="highlight">behavior</span> coincides with a high <span class="highlight">level</span> of glandular <span class="highlight">activity</span> in the modified <span class="highlight">scent</span> glands found on the foreheads of <span class="highlight">male</span> deer; the glandular <span class="highlight">activity</span> causes the forehead pelage (hairy covering) of adult males to be distinctly darker than in females or younger males.</p>
          <p>Forehead rubbing by <span class="highlight">male</span> deer on <span class="highlight">buck</span> rubs <span class="highlight">presumably</span> sends a great <span class="highlight">deal</span> of information to other members of the same <span class="highlight">species</span>. First, the chemicals deposited on the <span class="highlight">rub</span> provide information on the <span class="highlight">individual</span> <span class="highlight">identity</span> of an animal; no two mammals produce the same <span class="highlight">scent</span>. For <span class="highlight">instance</span>, as we all know, <span class="question5">dogs <span class="highlight">recognize</span> each other via smell.</span> <span class="highlight">Second</span>, because only <span class="highlight">male</span> deer <span class="highlight">rub</span>, the <span class="highlight">buck</span> <span class="highlight">rub</span> and its <span class="highlight">associated</span> chemicals <span class="highlight">indicate</span> the sex of the deer producing the <span class="highlight">rub</span>. Third, older, more <span class="highlight">dominant</span> bucks produce more <span class="highlight">buck</span> rubs and probably <span class="highlight">deposit</span> more glandular secretions on a <span class="highlight">given</span> <span class="highlight">rub</span>. Thus the presence of many well-marked rubs is <span class="highlight">indicative</span> of older, higher-status males being in the general <span class="highlight">vicinity</span> rather than <span class="highlight">simply</span> being a <span class="highlight"><span class="question6">crude</span></span> <span class="highlight">measure</span> of <span class="highlight">relative</span> deer <span class="highlight">abundance</span> in a <span class="highlight">given</span> area. The information conveyed by the <span class="highlight">olfactory</span> signals on a <span class="highlight">buck</span> <span class="highlight">rub</span> make it the social <span class="highlight">equivalent</span> of some <span class="highlight">auditory</span> signals in other deer <span class="highlight">species</span>, such as trumpeting by bull elk.</p>
          <p>Because both sexes of white-tailed <span class="highlight">respond</span> to <span class="highlight">buck</span> rubs by smelling and licking them, rubs may serve a very important <span class="highlight">additional</span> <span class="highlight">function</span>. Fresher <span class="highlight">buck</span> rubs (less than two days old), in <span class="highlight">particular</span>, are visited more frequently by adult females than older rubs. In view of this <span class="highlight">behavior</span> it has been suggested that chemicals present in fresh <span class="highlight">buck</span> rubs may help <span class="highlight">physiologically</span> <span class="highlight"><span class="question9">induce</span></span> and <span class="highlight">synchronize</span> <span class="highlight">fertility</span> in females that visit these rubs. This would be an <span class="highlight">obvious</span> <span class="highlight">advantage</span> to wide-ranging deer, especially to a socially <span class="highlight">dominant</span> <span class="highlight">buck</span> when courting several adult females during the autumn rut. Another <span class="highlight">visual</span> <span class="highlight">signal</span> produced by while-tailed deer is <span class="question11">termed</span> a <span class="highlight">buck</span> <span class="highlight">scrape</span>. Scrapes <span class="highlight">consist</span> of a clearing (about 0.5 meter in <span class="highlight">diameter</span>) and <span class="highlight">shallow</span> <span class="highlight">depression</span> made by pushing aside the leaves covering the ground; after making the <span class="highlight">scrape</span>, the deer typically urinates in the <span class="highlight">depression</span>. Thus, like a <span class="highlight">buck</span> <span class="highlight">rub</span>, a <span class="highlight">scrape</span> is both a <span class="highlight">visual</span> and an <span class="highlight">olfactory</span> <span class="highlight">signal</span>. <span class="highlight">Buck</span> scrapes are generally created after leaf-fall in autumn, which is just before or during the rut. Scrapes are usually placed in open or <span class="highlight">conspicuous</span> places, such as <span class="highlight">along</span> a deer <span class="highlight">trail</span>. Most are made by older males, although females and younger males (2.5 years old or less) occasionally make scrapes.</p>

It follows that conspicuous is synonymous with obvious. Therefore, the A option was notable noticeable. BCD is common; strange; special.</p>

              <p>There is no particularly good positioning for D. The whole paragraph is discussing forehead rubbing. Need to read through the positioning, the answer appears in the first two sentences of this paragraph: Buck rubs also have a scent produced by glands in the foreheads of deer that is transferred to the tree when the rub is made. These odors make buck rubs an important. The first sentence says that it will leave an odor, and the latter sentence says that the role of odor is communication. So D meets. A option to promote the growth of the antlers did not mention the original; B options did not mention the original; C options did not mention, the original just said that during the estrus with the forehead friction.</p>

The meaning of this sentence can be inferred from the previous text. A decade later another study reported that adult male white-tailed deer <span class="question4">exhibited</span> forehead rubbing just before and during the rut. Because the previous paragraph also mentioned that the male deer rubs the bark with horns during the estrus period. So this should mean "appear." After ABD entered this sentence, it found that the sentence was completely unreasonable.</p>

              <p>C This sentence is derived from for instance. So if you want to find the purpose of this example, go to the front to find the argument. The general point of this paragraph is the first sentence, mainly "send information to other members"; first is followed by the first point of argument. So the answer should be related to these two sentences. The answer and point of view echo: First, the chemicals deposited on the rub provide information on the individual identity of an animal; no two mammals produce the same scent. The argument points out that rub provides the animal's individual identity (individual identity of an animal ). So choose C, smell can help identify.</p>

            <div class="explanation">
              <p>A based on the trumpeting of bull elk to the last sentence of this paragraph: The information conveyed by the olfactory signals on a buck rub make it the social equivalent of some auditory signals in other deer species, such as trumpeting by bull elk. Here trumpeting by bull elk This is an example. If you want to know what to describe, look for it. In the previous sentence, the information transmitted by the scent of the bucks played the same role in socializing as the hearing signals of other deer races. But what is this role? Keep looking. It can be seen that well-marked rub is indicative of older, higher-status male. After the information is complete, it is easy to get A's answer.</p>

This sentence corresponds to the A option, so A is not selected. 2) Second, because only male deer rub, the buck rub and its associated materials indicate the sex of the deer producing the rub. This sentence corresponds to the B option, so B is not selected. 3) Third, older, more dominant bucks produce more buck rubs and probably deposit more glandular secretions on a given rub. Thus, the status makes being in the general vicinity rather than simply being a <span class="question6">crude</span> measure of relative deer abundance in a given area.

              <p>A does not have a particularly good positioning, and it needs to compare the distinction between it and scrape in the context of the previous description of rubs. The answer appears in the last sentence of this paragraph and is compared to the fourth sentence of paragraph 4: Most are made by older males, although females and younger males (2.5 years old or less) occasionally make scrapes. (Paragraph 4) Second, because only male deer rub, the buck rub and its associated materials indicate the sex of the deer producing the rub. A is correct because according to Para 4 above, it is known that rub is caused only by male, and scrapes are both male and female. ;B does not match the original, corresponding to the middle of this paragraph, when it comes to both visual and olfactory signal;C this is not clearly distinguish, scrapes and buck rubs are done in the fall, before or during the rut; D did not mention .</p>
