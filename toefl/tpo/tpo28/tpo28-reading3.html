 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>When completed, the <span class="highlight">buck</span><span class="highlight">rub</span> is an <span class="highlight">obvious</span><span class="highlight">visual</span><span class="highlight">signal</span> to us and presumable to other deer in the area. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>A <span class="highlight">rub</span> is usually located at the shoulder height of a deer
(one meter or less above the ground) on a smooth-barked, small-diameter (16-25 millimeters) tree. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>The smooth <span class="highlight">bark</span> of small red maples makes this <span class="highlight">species</span><span class="highlight">ideal</span> for <span class="highlight">buck</span> rubs in the forests of 
the mid-eastern United States.</p><p>Adult <span class="highlight">male</span> deer usually produce rubs in late summer or early autumn when the outer velvet <span class="highlight">layer</span> is being <span class="highlight">shed</span> from their antlers. Rubs are created about one to two months before the <span class="highlight">breeding</span><span class="highlight">season</span> (the rut). Hence for a long time biologists believed that <span class="highlight">male</span> deer used <span class="highlight">buck</span> rubs not only to clean and <span class="highlight">polish</span> antlers but also to provide practice for the ensuing male-to-male <span class="highlight">combat</span> during the rut. However, biologists also <span class="highlight">noted</span> deer sniff and lick an unfamiliar <span class="highlight">rub</span>, which suggests that this <span class="highlight">visual</span> mark on a small tree plays an important communication purpose in the social life of deer.</p><p><span class="highlight">Buck</span> rubs also have a <span class="highlight">scent</span> produced by glands in the foreheads of deer that is transferred to the tree when the <span class="highlight">rub</span> is made. These odors make <span class="highlight">buck</span> rubs an important means of <span class="highlight">olfactory</span> communication between deer. The importance of <span class="highlight">olfactory</span> communication (using odors to <span class="highlight">communicate</span>) in the way of life of deer was documented by a study of <span class="highlight">captive</span> adult <span class="highlight">male</span> deer a few decades ago, which <span class="highlight">noted</span> that males rubbed their foreheads on branches and twigs, especially as autumn approached. A <span class="highlight">decade</span> later another study reported that adult <span class="highlight">male</span> white-tailed deer <span class="question4">exhibited</span> forehead rubbing just before and during the rut. It was found that when a white-tailed <span class="highlight">buck</span> makes a <span class="highlight">rub</span>, it moves both antlers and forehead glands <span class="highlight">along</span> the small tree in a <span class="highlight">vertical</span> direction. This forehead rubbing <span class="highlight">behavior</span> coincides with a high <span class="highlight">level</span> of glandular <span class="highlight">activity</span> in the modified <span class="highlight">scent</span> glands found on the foreheads of <span class="highlight">male</span> deer; the glandular <span class="highlight">activity</span> causes the forehead pelage (hairy covering) of adult males to be distinctly darker than in females or younger males.</p><p>Forehead rubbing by <span class="highlight">male</span> deer on <span class="highlight">buck</span> rubs <span class="highlight">presumably</span> sends a great <span class="highlight">deal</span> of information to other members of the same <span class="highlight">species</span>. First, the chemicals deposited on the <span class="highlight">rub</span> provide information on the <span class="highlight">individual</span><span class="highlight">identity</span> of an animal; no two mammals produce the same <span class="highlight">scent</span>. For <span class="highlight">instance</span>, as we all know, <span class="question5">dogs <span class="highlight">recognize</span> each other via smell.</span><span class="highlight">Second</span>, because only <span class="highlight">male</span> deer <span class="highlight">rub</span>, the <span class="highlight">buck</span><span class="highlight">rub</span> and its <span class="highlight">associated</span> chemicals <span class="highlight">indicate</span> the sex of the deer producing the <span class="highlight">rub</span>. Third, older, more <span class="highlight">dominant</span> bucks produce more <span class="highlight">buck</span> rubs and probably <span class="highlight">deposit</span> more glandular secretions on a <span class="highlight">given</span><span class="highlight">rub</span>. Thus the presence of many well-marked rubs is <span class="highlight">indicative</span> of older, higher-status males being in the general <span class="highlight">vicinity</span> rather than <span class="highlight">simply</span> being a <span class="highlight"><span class="question6">crude</span></span><span class="highlight">measure</span> of <span class="highlight">relative</span> deer <span class="highlight">abundance</span> in a <span class="highlight">given</span> area. The information conveyed by the <span class="highlight">olfactory</span> signals on a <span class="highlight">buck</span><span class="highlight">rub</span> make it the social <span class="highlight">equivalent</span> of some <span class="highlight">auditory</span> signals in other deer <span class="highlight">species</span>, such as trumpeting by bull elk.</p><p>Because both sexes of white-tailed <span class="highlight">respond</span> to <span class="highlight">buck</span> rubs by smelling and licking them, rubs may serve a very important <span class="highlight">additional</span><span class="highlight">function</span>. Fresher <span class="highlight">buck</span> rubs (less than two days old), in <span class="highlight">particular</span>, are visited more frequently by adult females than older rubs. In view of this <span class="highlight">behavior</span> it has been suggested that chemicals present in fresh <span class="highlight">buck</span> rubs may help <span class="highlight">physiologically</span><span class="highlight"><span class="question9">induce</span></span> and <span class="highlight">synchronize</span><span class="highlight">fertility</span> in females that visit these rubs. This would be an <span class="highlight">obvious</span><span class="highlight">advantage</span> to wide-ranging deer, especially to a socially <span class="highlight">dominant</span><span class="highlight">buck</span> when courting several adult females during the autumn rut. Another <span class="highlight">visual</span><span class="highlight">signal</span> produced by while-tailed deer is <span class="question11">termed</span> a <span class="highlight">buck</span><span class="highlight">scrape</span>. Scrapes <span class="highlight">consist</span> of a clearing (about 0.5 meter in <span class="highlight">diameter</span>) and <span class="highlight">shallow</span><span class="highlight">depression</span> made by pushing aside the leaves covering the ground; after making the <span class="highlight">scrape</span>, the deer typically urinates in the <span class="highlight">depression</span>. Thus, like a <span class="highlight">buck</span><span class="highlight">rub</span>, a <span class="highlight">scrape</span> is both a <span class="highlight">visual</span> and an <span class="highlight">olfactory</span><span class="highlight">signal</span>. <span class="highlight">Buck</span> scrapes are generally created after leaf-fall in autumn, which is just before or during the rut. Scrapes are usually placed in open or <span class="highlight">conspicuous</span> places, such as <span class="highlight">along</span> a deer <span class="highlight">trail</span>. Most are made by older males, although females and younger males (2.5 years old or less) occasionally make scrapes.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">conspicuous</span>"in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. noticeable</p><p>B. common</p><p>C. strange</p><p>D. particular</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A conspicuous: Obvious, obvious. The noticeable correspondence with the A option. This is a continuation sign indicating the presence of white-tailed deer in woodlot is a buck rub. Here a XX sign can indicate the existence of a white-tailed deer. Later, the third sentence has an agreed sentence, saying "the buck rub is an obvious visual signal to us..." It follows that conspicuous is synonymous with obvious. Therefore, the A option was notable noticeable. BCD is common; strange; special.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 1, why are small red maple trees ideal for buck rubs?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They have smooth bark.</p><p>B. They are found in the mid-eastern United States.</p><p>C. They grow very slowly.</p><p>D. They tend to grow in open spaces.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A based on the small red maple tree to the last sentence of the paragraph: The smooth bark of small red maples makes this species ideal for buck rubs in the forests of the mid-eastern United States. The subject of this sentence is actually "The smooth bark "So knowing that they have a smooth bark is an important condition for becoming an ideal target.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The studies of forehead rubbing by deer described in paragraph 3 showed that</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. forehead rubbing encourages the growth of antlers</p><p>B. male deer and white-tailed deer behave differently during the rut.</p><p>C. the rut can occur at different times of the year</p><p>D. deer convey important information through scent</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>There is no particularly good positioning for D. The whole paragraph is discussing forehead rubbing. Need to read through the positioning, the answer appears in the first two sentences of this paragraph: Buck rubs also have a scent produced by glands in the foreheads of deer that is transferred to the tree when the rub is made. These odors make buck rubs an important. The first sentence says that it will leave an odor, and the latter sentence says that the role of odor is communication. So D meets. A option to promote the growth of the antlers did not mention the original; B options did not mention the original; C options did not mention, the original just said that during the estrus with the forehead friction.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question4">exhibited</span></span>"in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. relied on</p><p>B. increased</p><p>C. displayed</p><p>D. preferred</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" C"><p>C <span class="question4">exhibited</span>: Show, appear. A is to rely on; B is to increase; C is to show; D is to prefer. So C meets. The meaning of this sentence can be inferred from the previous text. A decade later another study reported that adult male white-tailed deer <span class="question4">exhibited</span> forehead rubbing just before and during the rut. Because the previous paragraph also mentioned that the male deer rubs the bark with horns during the estrus period. So this should mean "appear." After ABD entered this sentence, it found that the sentence was completely unreasonable.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the author mention that "<span class="highlight">dogs recognize each other via smell</span>"?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To point out the similarities between dogs and deer</p><p>B. To argue that animals communicate through scent rather than through vision</p><p>C. To support the claim that the scent of a buck rub serves to identify its maker to other deer</p><p>D. To suggest that buck rubs can be detected by other species</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="dogs recognize each other via smell C"><p>C This sentence is derived from for instance. So if you want to find the purpose of this example, go to the front to find the argument. The general point of this paragraph is the first sentence, mainly "send information to other members"; first is followed by the first point of argument. So the answer should be related to these two sentences. The answer and point of view echo: First, the chemicals deposited on the rub provide information on the individual identity of an animal; no two mammals produce the same scent. The argument points out that rub provides the animal's individual identity (individual identity of an animal ). So choose C, smell can help identify.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question6">crude</span></span>"in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. rough</p><p>B. useful</p><p>C. necessary</p><p>D. obvious</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" A"><p>A <span class="question6">crude</span>: rough. A rough; B useful; C necessary; D obvious. So should choose A. Original text</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What can be inferred from paragraph 4 about the trumpeting of bull elk?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Trumpeting by higher-status bull elk signals their presence to other members of their species.</p><p>B. Bull elk need to combine trumpeting with olfactory signals to convey information about their identity.</p><p>C. Trumpeting alerts white-tailed deer to the presence of bull elk in their vicinity.</p><p>D. Trumpeting provides a better measure of deer presence in a given area than buck rubs do.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A based on the trumpeting of bull elk to the last sentence of this paragraph: The information conveyed by the olfactory signals on a buck rub make it the social equivalent of some auditory signals in other deer species, such as trumpeting by bull elk. Here trumpeting by bull elk This is an example. If you want to know what to describe, look for it. In the previous sentence, the information transmitted by the scent of the bucks played the same role in socializing as the hearing signals of other deer races. But what is this role? Keep looking. It can be seen that well-marked rub is indicative of older, higher-status male. After the information is complete, it is easy to get A's answer.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, the buck rubs occurring in a given area reveal all of the following information about deer EXCEPT</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. the individual identity of the deer</p><p>B. the gender of the deer</p><p>C. the likely social status of the deer</p><p>D. the number of deer in the vicinity</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D This problem is very good positioning, the original first, second and third will be listed in three out of the information out, respectively, these three sentences for reading analysis that is to choose the answer. 1) First, the chemical deposited on the rub provide information on the individual identity of an animal; no two mammals produce the same scent. This sentence corresponds to the A option, so A is not selected. 2) Second, because only male deer rub, the buck rub and its associated materials indicate the sex of the deer producing the rub. This sentence corresponds to the B option, so B is not selected. 3) Third, older, more dominant bucks produce more buck rubs and probably deposit more glandular secretions on a given rub. Thus, the status makes being in the general vicinity rather than simply being a <span class="question6">crude</span> measure of relative deer abundance in a given area. These two sentences correspond to the C option. The D option conflicts with this sentence, so choose D.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question9">induce</span></span>"in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. increase</p><p>B. extend</p><p>C. delay</p><p>D. stimulate</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" D"><p>D Induce: Boot, trigger. A increases; B extends; C delays; D promotes/stimulates. Corresponding to the original In view of this behavior it has been suggested that chemicals present in fresh buck rubs may help physiologically <span class="question9">induce</span> and synchronize fertility in females that visit these rubs. Before and after the word meaning should be similar, behind is to make / make synchronization. If the front is used to increase, extend, delay is not appropriate. So choose D. Promote.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 5, which of the following is true about chemicals in buck rubs?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They have to be at least two days old for females to be able to detect them.</p><p>B. They are more effective in older buck rubs than in fresher ones.</p><p>C. They may affect fertility in female deer.</p><p>D. They can be more easily detected by young males than adult females.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C according to the chemical positioning to the penultimate sentence: In view of this behavior it has been suggested that chemicals present in fresh buck rubs may help physiologically <span class="question9">induce</span> and synchronize fertility in females that visit these rubs. This sentence later says to physically guide and make fertility Synchronize....... So C meets. The second sentence of the original text of A is mentioned, but the original text says that less than 2 day is the opposite of the option; B is inconsistent with the original; the original text says that fresh buck rubs is more popular; the rubbing detected in D is all about Females.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question11">termed</span></span>"in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. associated with</p><p>B. visible as</p><p>C. known as</p><p>D. provided by</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" C"><p>C <span class="question11">termed</span>: called. Corresponds to the known as (referred to as, considered to be) of the C option. A: related to... B: visible D: provided by. Corresponding to the original Another visual signal produced by white-tailed deer is <span class="question11">termed</span> a buck scrape. This word is given in front of a description, followed by a term, noun. It can be inferred from this that this sentence is a definition. Therefore, it should be the meaning of being called and defined. So choose C.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the passage, in what way do buck scrapes differ from buck rubs?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Buck scrapes are made by both male and female deer.</p><p>B. Buck scrapes are purely visual signals.</p><p>C. Buck scrapes are made closer to the breeding season than buck rubs.</p><p>D. Buck scrapes can be smelled only by deer.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A does not have a particularly good positioning, and it needs to compare the distinction between it and scrape in the context of the previous description of rubs. The answer appears in the last sentence of this paragraph and is compared to the fourth sentence of paragraph 4: Most are made by older males, although females and younger males (2.5 years old or less) occasionally make scrapes. (Paragraph 4) Second, because only male deer rub, the buck rub and its associated materials indicate the sex of the deer producing the rub. A is correct because according to Para 4 above, it is known that rub is caused only by male, and scrapes are both male and female. ;B does not match the original, corresponding to the middle of this paragraph, when it comes to both visual and olfactory signal;C this is not clearly distinguish, scrapes and buck rubs are done in the fall, before or during the rut; D did not mention .</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>This process can take a few hours to several days..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The B keyword this process, before this sentence will describe the process, so that this refers to the relationship is close. Of these four options, B and C are the most likely. But it was most appropriate to put B. Before B, he described how the Bucks left a buck rub on the tree. And the sentence before C is obviously the end of the story, and how to say after the completion.</p></div></div><div id="question14" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>Buck rubs and buck scrapes are two types of markings made by white-tailed deer.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.The observation that deer sniff and lick buck rubs first led scientists to connect buck rubs with combat between adult males during the breeding season.</p><p>B.Buck rubs and buck scrapes are visual signals and smells that deer use to communicate a variety of information to other deer.</p><p>C.The number of buck rubs and buck scrapes in a given area changes as the density of the population of male deer in the area changes.</p><p>D.As they rub the bark from trees, male deer leave behind chemicals produced by the glands in their foreheads, creating a scent that other deer can detect.</p><p>E.The height of a buck rub, the type of tree used, and the direction in which the deer applies the rub can give different kinds of information to other deer.</p><p>F.Buck rubs are created close to the breeding season of deer and may affect the timing of fertility in the female deer that visit the rubs.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="BDF"><p>A corresponds to the views of the two scientists in the second paragraph of the original text. But the two do not have such a logical relationship. Therefore do not choose.</p><p>B is correct and corresponds to the fourth paragraph of the original text. Say rubs can help identify.</p><p>C error, the original does not relate to the relationship between the number of buck rubs and population density.</p><p>D is correct and corresponds to the third paragraph of the original text.</p><p>E mistake, the article did not mention the relevant content.</p><p>F is correct, corresponding to the fifth paragraph of the original text, which appears to help physiologically <span class="question9">induce</span> and synchronize fertility in females.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
