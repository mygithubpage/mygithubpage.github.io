            <b>Buck Rubs and Buck Scrapes</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>A <span class="light"><span class="underline">conspicuous</span></span> sign indicating the presence of white-tailed deer in a woodlot is a <span class="underline">buck</span> <span class="underline">rub</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>A <span class="underline">male</span> deer makes a <span class="underline">buck</span> <span class="underline">rub</span> by striping the <span class="underline">bark</span> (outer <span class="underline">layer</span>) of a small tree with its antlers.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>When completed, the <span class="underline">buck</span> <span class="underline">rub</span> is an <span class="underline">obvious</span> <span class="underline">visual</span> <span class="underline">signal</span> to us and presumable to other deer in the area. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>A <span class="underline">rub</span> is usually located at the shoulder height of a deer
(one meter or less above the ground) on a smooth-barked, small-diameter (16-25 millimeters) tree. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>The smooth <span class="underline">bark</span> of small red maples makes this <span class="underline">species</span> <span class="underline">ideal</span> for <span class="underline">buck</span> rubs in the forests of 
the mid-eastern United States.</p>
          <p>Adult <span class="underline">male</span> deer usually produce rubs in late summer or early autumn when the outer velvet <span class="underline">layer</span> is being <span class="underline">shed</span> from their antlers. Rubs are created about one to two months before the <span class="underline">breeding</span> <span class="underline">season</span> (the rut). Hence for a long time biologists believed that <span class="underline">male</span> deer used <span class="underline">buck</span> rubs not only to clean and <span class="underline">polish</span> antlers but also to provide practice for the ensuing male-to-male <span class="underline">combat</span> during the rut. However, biologists also <span class="underline">noted</span> deer sniff and lick an unfamiliar <span class="underline">rub</span>, which suggests that this <span class="underline">visual</span> mark on a small tree plays an important communication purpose in the social life of deer.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="underline">Buck</span> rubs also have a <span class="underline">scent</span> produced by glands in the foreheads of deer that is transferred to the tree when the <span class="underline">rub</span> is made. These odors make <span class="underline">buck</span> rubs an important means of <span class="underline">olfactory</span> communication between deer. The importance of <span class="underline">olfactory</span> communication (using odors to <span class="underline">communicate</span>) in the way of life of deer was documented by a study of <span class="underline">captive</span> adult <span class="underline">male</span> deer a few decades ago, which <span class="underline">noted</span> that males rubbed their foreheads on branches and twigs, especially as autumn approached. A <span class="underline">decade</span> later another study reported that adult <span class="underline">male</span> white-tailed deer exhibited forehead rubbing just before and during the rut. It was found that when a white-tailed <span class="underline">buck</span> makes a <span class="underline">rub</span>, it moves both antlers and forehead glands <span class="underline">along</span> the small tree in a <span class="underline">vertical</span> direction. This forehead rubbing <span class="underline">behavior</span> coincides with a high <span class="underline">level</span> of glandular <span class="underline">activity</span> in the modified <span class="underline">scent</span> glands found on the foreheads of <span class="underline">male</span> deer; the glandular <span class="underline">activity</span> causes the forehead pelage (hairy covering) of adult males to be distinctly darker than in females or younger males.</p>
          <p>Forehead rubbing by <span class="underline">male</span> deer on <span class="underline">buck</span> rubs <span class="underline">presumably</span> sends a great <span class="underline">deal</span> of information to other members of the same <span class="underline">species</span>. First, the chemicals deposited on the <span class="underline">rub</span> provide information on the <span class="underline">individual</span> <span class="underline">identity</span> of an animal; no two mammals produce the same <span class="underline">scent</span>. For <span class="underline">instance</span>, as we all know, dogs <span class="underline">recognize</span> each other via smell. <span class="underline">Second</span>, because only <span class="underline">male</span> deer <span class="underline">rub</span>, the <span class="underline">buck</span> <span class="underline">rub</span> and its <span class="underline">associated</span> chemicals <span class="underline">indicate</span> the sex of the deer producing the <span class="underline">rub</span>. Third, older, more <span class="underline">dominant</span> bucks produce more <span class="underline">buck</span> rubs and probably <span class="underline">deposit</span> more glandular secretions on a <span class="underline">given</span> <span class="underline">rub</span>. Thus the presence of many well-marked rubs is <span class="underline">indicative</span> of older, higher-status males being in the general <span class="underline">vicinity</span> rather than <span class="underline">simply</span> being a <span class="underline">crude</span> <span class="underline">measure</span> of <span class="underline">relative</span> deer <span class="underline">abundance</span> in a <span class="underline">given</span> area. The information conveyed by the <span class="underline">olfactory</span> signals on a <span class="underline">buck</span> <span class="underline">rub</span> make it the social <span class="underline">equivalent</span> of some <span class="underline">auditory</span> signals in other deer <span class="underline">species</span>, such as trumpeting by bull elk.</p>
          <p>Because both sexes of white-tailed <span class="underline">respond</span> to <span class="underline">buck</span> rubs by smelling and licking them, rubs may serve a very important <span class="underline">additional</span> <span class="underline">function</span>. Fresher <span class="underline">buck</span> rubs (less than two days old), in <span class="underline">particular</span>, are visited more frequently by adult females than older rubs. In view of this <span class="underline">behavior</span> it has been suggested that chemicals present in fresh <span class="underline">buck</span> rubs may help <span class="underline">physiologically</span> <span class="underline">induce</span> and <span class="underline">synchronize</span> <span class="underline">fertility</span> in females that visit these rubs. This would be an <span class="underline">obvious</span> <span class="underline">advantage</span> to wide-ranging deer, especially to a socially <span class="underline">dominant</span> <span class="underline">buck</span> when courting several adult females during the autumn rut. Another <span class="underline">visual</span> <span class="underline">signal</span> produced by while-tailed deer is termed a <span class="underline">buck</span> <span class="underline">scrape</span>. Scrapes <span class="underline">consist</span> of a clearing (about 0.5 meter in <span class="underline">diameter</span>) and <span class="underline">shallow</span> <span class="underline">depression</span> made by pushing aside the leaves covering the ground; after making the <span class="underline">scrape</span>, the deer typically urinates in the <span class="underline">depression</span>. Thus, like a <span class="underline">buck</span> <span class="underline">rub</span>, a <span class="underline">scrape</span> is both a <span class="underline">visual</span> and an <span class="underline">olfactory</span> <span class="underline">signal</span>. <span class="underline">Buck</span> scrapes are generally created after leaf-fall in autumn, which is just before or during the rut. Scrapes are usually placed in open or <span class="underline">conspicuous</span> places, such as <span class="underline">along</span> a deer <span class="underline">trail</span>. Most are made by older males, although females and younger males (2.5 years old or less) occasionally make scrapes.</p>
