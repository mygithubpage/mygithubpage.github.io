Often, student musicians want to practice their instruments later at night, and right now there's no good place for them to do that. Also, lots of students want to use the practice rooms, so it's often difficult to reserve one. If the building were open more hours, though, it would be easier to accommodate the large number of students who want to reserve rooms.</p></article><div><audio src="tpo28-speaking3.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></div><article id="listening-passage" class="passage"><h3>Listening Text</h3><p>Now listen to two students discussing the letter.</p><p>(woman): Jim, did you see this letter in the paper today?</p><p>(man): Yeah, I did.</p><p>(woman): That would be great for us music students. Because I mean, what happens is, students keep practicing in the dorm room because they don't have anywhere else they can go.</p><p>(man): Yeah, I've done that myself a bunch of times playing my violin.</p><p>(woman): Me too, and I always feel kind of bad about it, because even if you try to keep the volume down, it's still pretty noisy, and other students are nearby in their rooms trying to sleep or study.</p><p>(man): That's true.</p><p>(woman): And we really could use more time slots, especially just before the big concerts: the winter concert and the spring concert, because everybody from all sections of the orchestra needs to practice then.</p><p>(man): I know, I tried to make a reservation to practice before the winter concert, but I couldn't, because other people from the orchestra had already booked every single time slot.</p><p>(woman) Exactly, so this would really help.</p></article><section id="question"><h4>Question</h4><p>The woman expresses her opinion of the proposal. Briefly summarize the proposal, then state her opinion about the proposal, and explain the reasons she gives for holding that opinion. </p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>Well, the proposal says the university should keep the campus music building open until mid-night for two reasons. Accordingly, the woman agrees with the proposal for two main reasons. Firstly, as a music student, she feels bad since she usually plays musical instruments in her dorm, which is too noisy and brothers everyone nearby, especially those who want to study or try to get some sleep, simply because the music building closes early and she has nowhere else to go practicing. Secondly, she thinks music students could really use more time slot to practice musical instruments especially just before the big concert because everyone from all sections of the orchestra needs to practice by then. In a word, the woman agrees with the decision for the reason stated above. (123 words)</p></article></div></main></body></html>
