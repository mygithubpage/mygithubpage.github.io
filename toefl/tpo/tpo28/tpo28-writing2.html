Parents today are more involved in their children's education than were parents in the past.Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. </p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>The involvement of parents in their children's education has been acknowledged to include not only the exact knowledge and values they would tell their children but also the attention they would pay to their children's educational process as well as the role they would play during the decision-making process. From my perspective, modern parents are more related to their children's educational aspects than parents are in the past.</p><p>It could not be denied that parents in the modern society would bear much more responsibilities and burdens as well than those in the past such as the financial pressure to support the family, due to the increasing desire of individuals and the economic reality in the present society. That means modern parents would spend plenty of time on earning money and have less time to be with their children or to actually teach them. However, the real situation regarding the children education is that parents in the present are more likely to emphasize the education of their children in various respects such as arranging the detailed study plan for their children.</p><p>Moreover, the emphasis children would receive on their education from the parents has been increased significantly in the contemporary society, because of the fact that individuals now have generally believed in the essential influence of the education on people especially the younger generation. That significance could be realized by the modern parents during their working and social experiences, and it to a great extent could be comprehended due to the reality that the well-educated person has been demanded in relatively every area of the current society. Therefore, in order to help their children to become successful and qualified, parents in the present have been inclined to check or help with their school projects, to have them acquire multiple skills, and to expect them to receive the best education at a higher level, which would not be the focus of the parents in the past who even did not care about the educational situation of their children and merely held the expectation that the children could help to support the family in terms of the finance as soon as possible.</p><p>Furthermore, it has been proposed that current parents have been more active during the process of making decisions related to their children's educational choices than the past. That could suggest that to some extent they would like to exert an influence on the children and their educational affairs rather than be willing to let their children to have the independent decision-making process as they did in the past, which might be due to the possibility that the present parents might place more emphasis on their children's education and not want them to make any mistakes. However, this situation could probably be interpreted that the modern parents could be considered to be the better educated people themselves and could assist their children to choose wisely and appropriately by offering the relevant information and reasonable advice in the course of educational matters such as how to plan their time arrangements, what major they would study in, and whether they should have a gap year before entering the university.</p><p>In conclusion, although modern parents might have less time with their children than those in the past during their educational period, they definitely could be regarded as more active in the participation in their children's educational activities in terms of the attention they might pay and the positive effort they might provide to help their children to make educational decisions due to the fact that they perceive the importance.</p></article></div></main></body></html>
