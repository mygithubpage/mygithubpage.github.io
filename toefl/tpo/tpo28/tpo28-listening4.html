            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.75" data-time="5.58">[00:05.58]</span>Student: Hi. Sorry. I'm late. Professor Blane. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.33" data-time="11.33">[00:11.33]</span>Professor: No problem. Jim. <span class="time" data-times="3.72" data-time="12.66">[00:12.66]</span>So you've got some questions about your <span class="highlight">senior</span> <span class="highlight">thesis</span> requirement? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.44" data-time="16.38">[00:16.38]</span>Student: Yeah. I've got a <span class="highlight">couple</span> of problems actually.<span class="time" data-times="5.77" data-time="18.82">[00:18.82]</span> So, the first thing is, you <span class="highlight">normally</span> write it during the first half of the <span class="highlight">academic</span> year. Right? <span class="time" data-times="2.09" data-time="24.59">[00:24.59]</span>In your final year of studies. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="0.85" data-time="26.68">[00:26.68]</span>Professor: Right. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.59" data-time="27.53">[00:27.53]</span>Student: But I have my student teaching scheduled for that time.<span class="time" data-times="2.93" data-time="30.12">[00:30.12]</span> I want to teach high school English after graduation. <span class="time" data-times="2.64" data-time="33.05">[00:33.05]</span>So I really need to give that my full <span class="highlight">attention</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.18" data-time="35.69">[00:35.69]</span>And I just worry that I won't be able to if I am writing my <span class="highlight">senior</span> <span class="highlight">thesis</span> at the same time.<span class="time" data-times="3.49" data-time="39.87">[00:39.87]</span>I mean, it's supposed to be 35 to 40 pages. <span class="time" data-times="1.88" data-time="43.36">[00:43.36]</span>That's a serious <span class="highlight">commitment</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="0.74" data-time="45.24">[00:45.24]</span>Professor: You are right.<span class="time" data-times="1.71" data-time="45.98">[00:45.98]</span> But it really isn't a problem. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="0.78" data-time="47.69">[00:47.69]</span>Student: Really? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.12" data-time="48.47">[00:48.47]</span>Professor: No. A lot of English majors get teacher certification, so we have students like you do their <span class="highlight">senior</span> <span class="highlight">thesis</span> after their student teaching. <span class="time" data-times="5.45" data-time="56.59">[00:56.59]</span>It works out well, because many students want to use a unit they taught as the basis of their paper.<span class="time" data-times="4.08" data-time="62.04">[01:02.04]</span> So you'll just <span class="highlight">enroll</span> in a <span class="highlight">thesis</span> <span class="highlight">seminar</span> for the <span class="highlight">second</span> <span class="highlight">semester</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.06" data-time="66.12">[01:06.12]</span>Student: Well, that's a big <span class="highlight">relief</span>.<span class="time" data-times="2.22" data-time="68.18">[01:08.18]</span> But it brings us to my <span class="highlight">second</span> problem.<span class="time" data-times="3.97" data-time="70.4">[01:10.40]</span> I'd really <span class="highlight">focus</span> my studies on old and Middle English <span class="highlight">literature</span>.<span class="time" data-times="5.32" data-time="74.37">[01:14.37]</span>I am <span class="highlight">even</span> thinking about doing a graduate <span class="highlight">degree</span> with a <span class="highlight">concentration</span> in that after I taught for a while. <span class="time" data-times="8.22" data-time="79.69">[01:19.69]</span>So I was hoping to do my <span class="highlight">senior</span> <span class="highlight">thesis</span> on Chaucer, on The Canterbury Tales, because that would <span class="highlight">obviously</span> be useful if I do go on. But ... </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.95" data-time="87.91">[01:27.91]</span>Professor: Ah. But Professor Johnson ... </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.18" data-time="90.86">[01:30.86]</span>Student: Exactly. Professor Johnson is going to be taking a sabbatical to do research in France during the <span class="highlight">second</span> half of the year. <span class="time" data-times="5.99" data-time="97.04">[01:37.04]</span>So without him around, I am not sure how I could do a <span class="highlight">senior</span> <span class="highlight">thesis</span> on The Canterbury Tales.<span class="time" data-times="3.42" data-time="103.03">[01:43.03]</span> I mean, the <span class="highlight">focus</span> of his teaching and research is <span class="highlight">unique</span> around here. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.54" data-time="106.45">[01:46.45]</span>Professor: Yes. I understand.<span class="time" data-times="3.38" data-time="107.99">[01:47.99]</span> It would be difficult to do your paper without Professor Johnson around. <span class="time" data-times="5.03" data-time="111.37">[01:51.37]</span>Hmmm... would you allow me to try to sell you on an <span class="highlight">alternate</span> plan? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.79" data-time="116.4">[01:56.40]</span>Student: Well, you can try.<span class="time" data-times="3.24" data-time="118.19">[01:58.19]</span> But Chaucer is <span class="highlight">sort</span> of my hero, if you know what I mean. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.87" data-time="121.43">[02:01.43]</span>Professor: Well, I am teaching a <span class="highlight">course</span> on the <span class="highlight">literature</span> of the Renaissance in the first half of the year.<span class="time" data-times="3.79" data-time="126.3">[02:06.30]</span> It'll meet late in the day, so it won't <span class="highlight">interfere</span> with your teaching. <span class="time" data-times="6.24" data-time="130.09">[02:10.09]</span>And I <span class="highlight">haven</span>'t offered it in quite a while now, so I <span class="highlight">doubt</span> you ever studied that period on the college <span class="highlight">level</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.04" data-time="136.33">[02:16.33]</span>Student: No. I <span class="highlight">haven</span>'t. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.57" data-time="137.37">[02:17.37]</span>Professor: If you would be interested in taking the <span class="highlight">course</span>, I'd be happy to give you supplemental readings, and I'd also be happy to be your advisor for your paper later on. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.35" data-time="144.94">[02:24.94]</span>Student: Well, I never looked at that area before, but I have always had an <span class="highlight">interest</span> in it. <span class="time" data-times="1.81" data-time="149.29">[02:29.29]</span>So that does have a certain <span class="highlight">appeal</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.81" data-time="151.1">[02:31.10]</span>Professor: Well, if you do decide to go this <span class="highlight">route</span>, I would make that decision soon and I would use this summer productively. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="157.91">[02:37.91]</span>After all, this is not going to be like taking an intro <span class="highlight">course</span>. </p>
