          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.53" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in a <span class="highlight">philosophy</span> class. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="17.09" data-time="4.53">[00:04.53]</span>Professor: Okay. So, uh, to continue our discussion... When philosophers talk about the basis of knowledge, they don't mean the <span class="highlight">source</span> of information about any <span class="highlight">particular</span> <span class="highlight">subject</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.03" data-time="21.62">[00:21.62]</span>They mean how we know what we know. <span class="time" data-times="4.43" data-time="24.65">[00:24.65]</span>Let's start with one philosophical view-foundationalism. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="15.18" data-time="29.08">[00:29.08]</span>Foundationalism is the view that our knowledge claims, what we think we know, that is, they need to have a <span class="highlight">base</span>.<span class="time" data-times="5.98" data-time="44.26">[00:44.26]</span>And think of knowledge as a house, you need a <span class="highlight">solid</span> <span class="highlight">foundation</span> on which to build your house. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.93" data-time="50.24">[00:50.24]</span>And if you have a strong <span class="highlight">foundation</span>, your house is more likely to be <span class="highlight">solid</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.83" data-time="54.17">[00:54.17]</span>Well, foundationalists think the same thing is true of knowledge. <span class="time" data-times="8.95" data-time="59">[00:59.00]</span>If you have a <span class="highlight">solid</span> <span class="highlight">base</span> for your knowledge claims, then your knowledge structure is more likely to be strong, <span class="highlight">valid</span>, true. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="7.32" data-time="67.95">[01:07.95]</span>First, you need some good foundational knowledge claims, and then the rest of the knowledge claims can be based on these. <span class="time" data-times="10.48" data-time="75.27">[01:15.27]</span>Now, as to what kinds of knowledge claims are foundational, well, that's where this gets particularly interesting, in fact it <span class="highlight">sort</span> of depends on which <span class="highlight">philosopher</span> you ask. <span class="time" data-times="2.54" data-time="85.75">[01:25.75]</span>Take John Locke for <span class="highlight">instance</span>. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="15.24" data-time="88.29">[01:28.29]</span>Locke's viewpoint <span class="highlight">essentially</span> was that when humans are born, their minds are like blank slates, that is, we don't have any kind of knowledge when we are born. <span class="time" data-times="5.93" data-time="103.53">[01:43.53]</span>We get our knowledge from our senses, you know, <span class="highlight">taste</span>, touch, smell, sight, hearing. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.82" data-time="109.46">[01:49.46]</span>So, when we look at the world, first as babies and then as we grow, that's where our knowledge comes from. <span class="time" data-times="5.23" data-time="116.28">[01:56.28]</span>Our senses, our experiences serve as the <span class="highlight">foundation</span> for our knowledge. <span class="time" data-times="6.33" data-time="121.51">[02:01.51]</span>Now, for a very different view, let's turn to another <span class="highlight">philosopher</span>-René Dartes. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="9.71" data-time="127.84">[02:07.84]</span>Descartes thought that you have to go much deeper to find the foundations. <span class="time" data-times="2.79" data-time="137.55">[02:17.55]</span>He believed that our senses are not to be trusted. <span class="time" data-times="3.54" data-time="140.34">[02:20.34]</span>So he <span class="highlight">wanted</span> to find a more <span class="highlight">solid</span> <span class="highlight">foundation</span> for knowledge. <span class="time" data-times="3.85" data-time="143.88">[02:23.88]</span>He began with what has come to be called methodological <span class="highlight">doubt</span>. <span class="time" data-times="23.52" data-time="147.73">[02:27.73]</span>And when we say methodological <span class="highlight">doubt</span>, well ... Descartes believed that everything should be questioned, that is, <span class="highlight">approach</span> it with <span class="highlight">doubt</span> and that if you could find one thing that cannot be false, that one thing would serve as a <span class="highlight">foundation</span> for all other knowledge claims. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="16.55" data-time="171.25">[02:51.25]</span>So unlike John Locke, Descartes doubts that knowledge comes to him from his senses. <span class="time" data-times="5" data-time="187.8">[03:07.80]</span>He points out that at some time or another, everyone has been deceived by their senses. <span class="time" data-times="6.25" data-time="192.8">[03:12.80]</span>We have all had experiences where our senses have been wrong-illusions, perhaps, mirages. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="12" data-time="199.05">[03:19.05]</span>When driving in a car on a hot summer day, you may see what looks like <span class="highlight">shimmering</span> water on the road, which, as science tells us, is really just a mirage, an <span class="highlight">illusion</span> caused by the heating of the <span class="highlight">air</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.54" data-time="211.05">[03:31.05]</span>Our senses are wrong, they've deceived us. <span class="time" data-times="7.32" data-time="214.59">[03:34.59]</span>And Descartes thinks that since our senses can <span class="highlight">deceive</span> us, we ought not to take for granted that what they tell us is really true. <span class="time" data-times="3.76" data-time="221.91">[03:41.91]</span>That's the first step in his methodological <span class="highlight">doubt</span>. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="7.26" data-time="225.67">[03:45.67]</span>From there he wonders, well, ok, I can <span class="highlight">doubt</span> my senses, but can I <span class="highlight">doubt</span> that I am sitting in this room? <span class="time" data-times="2.79" data-time="232.93">[03:52.93]</span>Can it <span class="highlight">seem</span> that we are not really here? <span class="time" data-times="1.39" data-time="235.72">[03:55.72]</span>That we are somewhere else? <span class="time" data-times="3.85" data-time="237.11">[03:57.11]</span>He conceives that most of us would know that we are sitting in the room.<span class="time" data-times="3.38" data-time="240.96">[04:00.96]</span> But then he says, well, couldn't I just be dreaming? </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.17" data-time="244.34">[04:04.34]</span>He's had dreams that were so real that he thought he was <span class="highlight">awake</span> when in fact he was actually asleep. <span class="time" data-times="1.94" data-time="250.51">[04:10.51]</span>And this is another good point.<span class="time" data-times="3.68" data-time="252.45">[04:12.45]</span> It's really hard to be sure that you are not actually dreaming. <span class="time" data-times="6.42" data-time="256.13">[04:16.13]</span>Yet another <span class="highlight">proof</span> for Descartes that we can't always trust what our senses are apparently telling us. <span class="time" data-times="1.5" data-time="262.55">[04:22.55]</span>We could be dreaming.<span class="time" data-times="2.94" data-time="264.05">[04:24.05]</span> And there's really no good way to prove that we are not. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="11.55" data-time="266.99">[04:26.99]</span>So the <span class="highlight">common</span> <span class="highlight">sense</span> picture of reality that the world is really the way it looks to us, Descartes shows that we cannot just <span class="highlight">assume</span> this to be true beyond all <span class="highlight">doubt</span>.<span class="time" data-times="6.24" data-time="278.54">[04:38.54]</span>And he does this by talking about illusions and also by arguing that we could be dreaming. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="9.7" data-time="284.78">[04:44.78]</span>But <span class="highlight">consider</span> this, he says, while one is thinking or doubting, or doing any of those sorts of <span class="highlight">mental</span> activities, one has to exist, right? <span class="time" data-times="4.44" data-time="294.48">[04:54.48]</span>To <span class="highlight">even</span> think that I <span class="highlight">doubt</span> that I exist, you have to exist! <span class="time" data-times="5.48" data-time="298.92">[04:58.92]</span>And so what Descartes has done is find at <span class="highlight">least</span> one thing that he can be certain of. <span class="time" data-times="2.39" data-time="304.4">[05:04.40]</span>He says, "I exist." <span class="time" data-times="1.34" data-time="306.79">[05:06.79]</span>And that's a start.<span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="308.13">[05:08.13]</span> And other knowledge he tells us can be based on that <span class="highlight">foundation</span>. </p>
