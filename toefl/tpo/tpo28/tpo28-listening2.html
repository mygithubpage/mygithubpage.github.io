So, uh, to continue our discussion... When philosophers talk about the basis of knowledge, they don't mean the <span class="highlight">source</span> of information about any <span class="highlight">particular</span><span class="highlight">subject</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.03" data-time="21.62">[00:21.62]</span>They mean how we know what we know. <span class="time" data-times="4.43" data-time="24.65">[00:24.65]</span>Let's start with one philosophical view-foundationalism. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="15.18" data-time="29.08">[00:29.08]</span>Foundationalism is the view that our knowledge claims, what we think we know, that is, they need to have a <span class="highlight">base</span>.<span class="time" data-times="5.98" data-time="44.26">[00:44.26]</span>And think of knowledge as a house, you need a <span class="highlight">solid</span><span class="highlight">foundation</span> on which to build your house. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.93" data-time="50.24">[00:50.24]</span>And if you have a strong <span class="highlight">foundation</span>, your house is more likely to be <span class="highlight">solid</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.83" data-time="54.17">[00:54.17]</span>Well, foundationalists think the same thing is true of knowledge. <span class="time" data-times="8.95" data-time="59">[00:59.00]</span>If you have a <span class="highlight">solid</span><span class="highlight">base</span> for your knowledge claims, then your knowledge structure is more likely to be strong, <span class="highlight">valid</span>, true. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.32" data-time="67.95">[01:07.95]</span>First, you need some good foundational knowledge claims, and then the rest of the knowledge claims can be based on these. <span class="time" data-times="10.48" data-time="75.27">[01:15.27]</span>Now, as to what kinds of knowledge claims are foundational, well, that's where this gets particularly interesting, in fact it <span class="highlight">sort</span> of depends on which <span class="highlight">philosopher</span> you ask. <span class="time" data-times="2.54" data-time="85.75">[01:25.75]</span>Take John Locke for <span class="highlight">instance</span>. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="15.24" data-time="88.29">[01:28.29]</span>Locke's viewpoint <span class="highlight">essentially</span> was that when humans are born, their minds are like blank slates, that is, we don't have any kind of knowledge when we are born. <span class="time" data-times="5.93" data-time="103.53">[01:43.53]</span>We get our knowledge from our senses, you know, <span class="highlight">taste</span>, touch, smell, sight, hearing. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.82" data-time="109.46">[01:49.46]</span>So, when we look at the world, first as babies and then as we grow, that's where our knowledge comes from. <span class="time" data-times="5.23" data-time="116.28">[01:56.28]</span>Our senses, our experiences serve as the <span class="highlight">foundation</span> for our knowledge. <span class="time" data-times="6.33" data-time="121.51">[02:01.51]</span>Now, for a very different view, let's turn to another <span class="highlight">philosopher</span>-René Dartes. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="9.71" data-time="127.84">[02:07.84]</span>Descartes thought that you have to go much deeper to find the foundations. <span class="time" data-times="2.79" data-time="137.55">[02:17.55]</span>He believed that our senses are not to be trusted. <span class="time" data-times="3.54" data-time="140.34">[02:20.34]</span>So he <span class="highlight">wanted</span> to find a more <span class="highlight">solid</span><span class="highlight">foundation</span> for knowledge. <span class="time" data-times="3.85" data-time="143.88">[02:23.88]</span>He began with what has come to be called methodological <span class="highlight">doubt</span>. <span class="time" data-times="23.52" data-time="147.73">[02:27.73]</span>And when we say methodological <span class="highlight">doubt</span>, well ... Descartes believed that everything should be questioned, that is, <span class="highlight">approach</span> it with <span class="highlight">doubt</span> and that if you could find one thing that cannot be false, that one thing would serve as a <span class="highlight">foundation</span> for all other knowledge claims. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="16.55" data-time="171.25">[02:51.25]</span>So unlike John Locke, Descartes doubts that knowledge comes to him from his senses. <span class="time" data-times="5" data-time="187.8">[03:07.80]</span>He points out that at some time or another, everyone has been deceived by their senses. <span class="time" data-times="6.25" data-time="192.8">[03:12.80]</span>We have all had experiences where our senses have been wrong-illusions, perhaps, mirages. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="12" data-time="199.05">[03:19.05]</span>When driving in a car on a hot summer day, you may see what looks like <span class="highlight">shimmering</span> water on the road, which, as science tells us, is really just a mirage, an <span class="highlight">illusion</span> caused by the heating of the <span class="highlight">air</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.54" data-time="211.05">[03:31.05]</span>Our senses are wrong, they've deceived us. <span class="time" data-times="7.32" data-time="214.59">[03:34.59]</span>And Descartes thinks that since our senses can <span class="highlight">deceive</span> us, we ought not to take for granted that what they tell us is really true. <span class="time" data-times="3.76" data-time="221.91">[03:41.91]</span>That's the first step in his methodological <span class="highlight">doubt</span>. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.26" data-time="225.67">[03:45.67]</span>From there he wonders, well, ok, I can <span class="highlight">doubt</span> my senses, but can I <span class="highlight">doubt</span> that I am sitting in this room? <span class="time" data-times="2.79" data-time="232.93">[03:52.93]</span>Can it <span class="highlight">seem</span> that we are not really here? <span class="time" data-times="1.39" data-time="235.72">[03:55.72]</span>That we are somewhere else? <span class="time" data-times="3.85" data-time="237.11">[03:57.11]</span>He conceives that most of us would know that we are sitting in the room.<span class="time" data-times="3.38" data-time="240.96">[04:00.96]</span> But then he says, well, couldn't I just be dreaming? </p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.17" data-time="244.34">[04:04.34]</span>He's had dreams that were so real that he thought he was <span class="highlight">awake</span> when in fact he was actually asleep. <span class="time" data-times="1.94" data-time="250.51">[04:10.51]</span>And this is another good point.<span class="time" data-times="3.68" data-time="252.45">[04:12.45]</span> It's really hard to be sure that you are not actually dreaming. <span class="time" data-times="6.42" data-time="256.13">[04:16.13]</span>Yet another <span class="highlight">proof</span> for Descartes that we can't always trust what our senses are apparently telling us. <span class="time" data-times="1.5" data-time="262.55">[04:22.55]</span>We could be dreaming.<span class="time" data-times="2.94" data-time="264.05">[04:24.05]</span> And there's really no good way to prove that we are not. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="11.55" data-time="266.99">[04:26.99]</span>So the <span class="highlight">common</span><span class="highlight">sense</span> picture of reality that the world is really the way it looks to us, Descartes shows that we cannot just <span class="highlight">assume</span> this to be true beyond all <span class="highlight">doubt</span>.<span class="time" data-times="6.24" data-time="278.54">[04:38.54]</span>And he does this by talking about illusions and also by arguing that we could be dreaming. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="9.7" data-time="284.78">[04:44.78]</span>But <span class="highlight">consider</span> this, he says, while one is thinking or doubting, or doing any of those sorts of <span class="highlight">mental</span> activities, one has to exist, right? <span class="time" data-times="4.44" data-time="294.48">[04:54.48]</span>To <span class="highlight">even</span> think that I <span class="highlight">doubt</span> that I exist, you have to exist! <span class="time" data-times="5.48" data-time="298.92">[04:58.92]</span>And so what Descartes has done is find at <span class="highlight">least</span> one thing that he can be certain of. <span class="time" data-times="2.39" data-time="304.4">[05:04.40]</span>He says, "I exist." <span class="time" data-times="1.34" data-time="306.79">[05:06.79]</span>And that's a start.<span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="308.13">[05:08.13]</span> And other knowledge he tells us can be based on that <span class="highlight">foundation</span>. </p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the lecture mainly about?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

How two philosophers viewed foundational knowledge claims.</p><p>D. The difference between foundationalism and methodological thought.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The lecture has been talking about foundationalism, Locke, and Descartes, which correspond to two philosophers and foundation knowledge claims.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor mention a house?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To explain an idea about the organization of human knowledge.</p><p>B. To illustrate the unreliability of our perception of physical objects.</p><p>C. To clarify the difference between two points of view about the basis of human knowledge.</p><p>D. To remind students of a point he made about Descartes in a previous lecture.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>If you have a solid base for your knowledge claims, then your knowledge structure is more likely to be strong, valid, true. The professor says foundationalists think that if there is a solid base for knowledge, then the structure (organization of human knowledge in the options) is also Will be stronger, same as building a house, corresponding to A option</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What did Locke believed to be the most basic type of human knowledge?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Knowledge of one's own existence.</p><p>B. Knowledge acquired through the senses.</p><p>C. Knowledge humans are born with.</p><p>D. Knowledge passed down from the previous generations.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>We get our knowledge from our senses, you know, taste, touch, smell, sight, hearing. Basic type of knowledge in the foundation correspondence. Locke thinks that these basic knowledge comes from people's perception of the outside world, that is, senses.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor,what was Descartes' purpose for using methodological doubt?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

To demonstrate that Locke's view were essentially correct.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>Descartes thought that you have to go much deeper to find the foundations. Descartes thinks it needs go much deeper (corresponding to discover) to find foundations (corresponding foundational knowledge claims), corresponding to option A</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>For Descartes,what was the significance of dreaming?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. He believed that his best ideas came to him in dreams.</p><p>B. He regarded dreaming as the strongest proof that human exists.</p><p>C. Dreaming supports his contention that reality has many aspects.</p><p>D. Dreaming illustrates why human experience of reality cannot always be trusted.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>In lecture, Professor Descartes raised Descartes that people may be experienced or sense deceived. That is, experience cannot be trusted. Descartes believes that the reality we feel may also be that we are dreaming and not necessarily a real reality.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to Descartes,what type of belief should serve as a foundation for all other knowledge claims?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.
