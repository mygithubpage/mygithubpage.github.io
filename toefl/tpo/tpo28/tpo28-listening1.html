            <span class="time" data-times="5.63" data-time="121.09">[02:01.09]</span>Student: No. I mean, I look at it online when I was working on this <span class="highlight">assignment</span>. </p>

              <p>Professor is of the opinion that the student's paper does not describe the most important influence on Dewey's political thinking and should be added, corresponding to the A option.
