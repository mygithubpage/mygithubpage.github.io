              <span class="time" data-times="12.07" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a <span class="underline">conversation</span> between a student and a professor. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.08" data-time="12.07">[00:12.07]</span>Student: I am so sorry I am late. Professor Mills. <span class="time" data-times="2.24" data-time="16.15">[00:16.15]</span>I just finished at the student medical center.<span class="time" data-times="2.39" data-time="18.39">[00:18.39]</span>I twisted my ankle playing <span class="underline">soccer</span> this morning. <span class="time" data-times="2.53" data-time="20.78">[00:20.78]</span>It took longer than I expected to see the doctor. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="0.9" data-time="23.31">[00:23.31]</span>Professor: That's okay. <span class="time" data-times="1.43" data-time="24.21">[00:24.21]</span>Don't worry about it. David. <span class="time" data-times="1.84" data-time="25.64">[00:25.64]</span>So let's get started. <span class="time" data-times="4.78" data-time="27.48">[00:27.48]</span>Your paper on John Dewey's <span class="underline">political</span> <span class="underline">philosophy</span> has a few issues I'd like to cover. <span class="time" data-times="3.13" data-time="32.26">[00:32.26]</span>You gave a great biographical <span class="underline">sketch</span> in the beginning. Okay. <span class="time" data-times="7.72" data-time="35.39">[00:35.39]</span>But then as you get into his <span class="underline">political</span> <span class="underline">philosophy</span>, I don't think you've done enough to situate his <span class="underline">philosophy</span> <span class="underline">within</span> the time period. <span class="time" data-times="5.29" data-time="43.11">[00:43.11]</span>In other words, you <span class="underline">haven</span>'t connected Dewey's <span class="underline">philosophy</span> to the thinking of other intellectuals of the time. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.43" data-time="48.4">[00:48.40]</span>Student: So I <span class="underline">haven</span>'t captured the most <span class="underline">critical</span> influences, the influences that were most <span class="underline">significant</span> to his <span class="underline">political</span> thinking? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.24" data-time="55.83">[00:55.83]</span>Professor: Exactly. <span class="time" data-times="11.15" data-time="60.07">[01:00.07]</span>OK. Now, look back up at the <span class="underline">section</span> here, where you wrote about Dewey's view of individuality. <span class="time" data-times="2.01" data-time="71.22">[01:11.22]</span>This is all good <span class="underline">content</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.25" data-time="73.23">[01:13.23]</span>But you <span class="underline">haven</span>'t presented the information in a <span class="underline">systematic</span> way. <span class="time" data-times="6.87" data-time="76.48">[01:16.48]</span>I really think this <span class="underline">portion</span> on individuality needs to come later, after your paragraphs on Dewey's <span class="underline">intellectual</span> influences </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.77" data-time="83.35">[01:23.35]</span>Student: After my revised paragraphs on what influenced them. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.38" data-time="87.12">[01:27.12]</span>Professor: Yes. Revised. Let me ask. <span class="time" data-times="5.53" data-time="90.5">[01:30.50]</span>Uh. When you were finished writing, did you go back and ask yourself if all of the <span class="underline">material</span> was <span class="underline">relevant</span>? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.7" data-time="96.03">[01:36.03]</span>Student: Well, no. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.79" data-time="97.73">[01:37.73]</span>Professor: I do think there are areas that can be cut. <span class="time" data-times="4.47" data-time="100.52">[01:40.52]</span>I guess what I am saying is that your paragraphs aren't really presented in a <span class="underline">logical</span> order. <span class="time" data-times="2.61" data-time="104.99">[01:44.99]</span>The direction of your <span class="underline">argument</span> isn't <span class="underline">crystal</span> <span class="underline">clear</span>.<span class="time" data-times="2.98" data-time="107.6">[01:47.60]</span> And there's some unnecessary <span class="underline">material</span> getting in the way. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.19" data-time="110.58">[01:50.58]</span>Student: OK. Sounds like I have a lot to do. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.32" data-time="113.77">[01:53.77]</span>Professor: And one more thing, do you have a copy of the <span class="underline">department</span>'s document on the correct <span class="underline">format</span> for index, citations and references? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.63" data-time="121.09">[02:01.09]</span>Student: No. I mean, I look at it online when I was working on this <span class="underline">assignment</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.68" data-time="126.72">[02:06.72]</span>Professor: You really should print it out. <span class="time" data-times="4.62" data-time="129.4">[02:09.40]</span>You are going to need it for every paper you write in the <span class="underline">political</span> science <span class="underline">department</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.74" data-time="134.02">[02:14.02]</span>It looks like you are getting it mix up with another referencing system. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.45" data-time="137.76">[02:17.76]</span>Student: Oh. Yeah. I used something different in high school.<span class="time" data-times="2.69" data-time="141.21">[02:21.21]</span> It's so confusing switching to a new system. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5" data-time="143.9">[02:23.90]</span>Professor: I know. But remember, everything needs to be <span class="underline">consistent</span> when it comes to referencing. <span class="time" data-times="2.37" data-time="148.9">[02:28.90]</span>It is a very important <span class="underline">academic</span> <span class="underline">convention</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.47" data-time="151.27">[02:31.27]</span>Oh, also, I <span class="underline">wanted</span> to ask you... Will you be at the <span class="underline">political</span> science <span class="underline">club</span> meeting Saturday? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.51" data-time="156.74">[02:36.74]</span>Student: Definitely. The topic is John Dewey. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.39" data-time="159.25">[02:39.25]</span>Professor: Yes. Are you interested in <span class="underline">leading</span> part of the discussion? <span class="time" data-times="2.19" data-time="162.64">[02:42.64]</span>Tom Hayward is looking for someone to help out. <span class="time" data-times="1.86" data-time="164.83">[02:44.83]</span>I think you'll have a lot to <span class="underline">contribute</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="0.91" data-time="166.69">[02:46.69]</span>Student: That'll be fun. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="167.6">[02:47.60]</span>I will give him a call. </p>
