Anyone ever heard of Proteus? Proteus was a God in Greek mythology who could change form. He could make himself look like a lion or a stone or a tree, anything you wanted, and he could Go through a whole series of changes very quickly. Well, the octopus is the real world version of Proteus. Just like Proteus, the octopus can go through all kinds of incredible transformations. And it does this in three ways: by changing color, by Changing its texture, and by changing its size and shape. For me, the most fascinating transformation is when it changes its color.</p><p>First of all, Proteus was positioned. After introducing Proteus, Professor Well said that octopus is the real-world version of Proteus. Like the Proteus, the octopus also changes into various shapes. Therefore, the professor cited the example of Proteus to introduce the characteristics of octopus.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>How does an octopus change color to match the colors in its environment?Click on 2 answers.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

(D)</p><p>Just below the chromatophores is a layer of cells that reflect light from the environment, and these cells help the octopus create a precise match with the colors that surround them.(C)</p><p>There was a long pause before Forme here, followed by the most advanced, indicating that there may be a focus here. There are two Buts that need attention. One But said that the octopus will pick from the surrounding environment, which is Option C. Another point is that if the muscle contracts, the small bag in the pigment cells will expand and you will see the color. This is the principle of octopus discoloration. So the D option must also be selected.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor say about the function of the papillae?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

They help the octopus contract into a smaller shape.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>But they don't just mimic the colors in their environment; they can also mimic the texture of objects in their environment. They have these little projections on their skin that allow them to resemble various textures. The projections are called papillae. If the octopus So you want to have a smooth texture, it flattens out the papillae, so it can acquire a smooth texture to blend in with sandy bottom of the sea. So the octopus has the Ability to mimic both the color and the texture of its environment. And it's truly amazing how well it can blend in with its surroundings. You can easily swim within a few feet of an octopus and never see it.</p><p>Locate papillae. After the projections are called papillae, there was a noticeable pause. If the octopus wants a rough texture, it highlights papillary protrusions. If the octopus wants a smooth texture, it flattens the protrusions. Thus, papillae can change their skin.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>What two examples does the professor mention to describe the octopus ability to change its shape?Click on 2 answers.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

The third way of octopus deformation is to mimic the surrounding environment by changing its size and shape. Pay attention to So.
