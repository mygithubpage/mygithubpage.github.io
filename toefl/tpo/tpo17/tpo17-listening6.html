            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.33" data-time="6.12">[00:06.12]</span>Professor: Ok, now I want to talk about an animal that has a <span class="highlight">fascinating</span> set of <span class="highlight">defense</span> mechanisms. <span class="time" data-times="5.02" data-time="13.45">[00:13.45]</span>And that's the <span class="highlight">octopus</span>, one of the unusual creatures that live in the sea. <span class="time" data-times="7.68" data-time="18.47">[00:18.47]</span>The <span class="highlight">octopus</span> is <span class="highlight">prey</span> to many <span class="highlight">species</span>, including humans, so how does it <span class="highlight">escape</span> its predators?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.32" data-time="26.15">[00:26.15]</span>Well, let me back up here a <span class="highlight">second</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.32" data-time="28.47">[00:28.47]</span>Anyone ever heard of Proteous? <span class="time" data-times="5.32" data-time="32.79">[00:32.79]</span>Proteus was a God in Greek <span class="highlight">mythology</span> who could change form. <span class="time" data-times="9.67" data-time="38.11">[00:38.11]</span>He could make himself look like a lion or a stone or a tree, anything you <span class="highlight">wanted</span>, and he could go <span class="highlight">through</span> a whole <span class="highlight">series</span> of changes very quickly.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.01" data-time="47.78">[00:47.78]</span>Well, the <span class="highlight">octopus</span> is the real world <span class="highlight">version</span> of Proteus. <span class="time" data-times="5.59" data-time="52.79">[00:52.79]</span>Just like Proteus, the <span class="highlight">octopus</span> can go <span class="highlight">through</span> all kinds of <span class="highlight">incredible</span> transformations. <span class="time" data-times="9.32" data-time="58.38">[00:58.38]</span>And it does this in three ways: by changing color, by changing its <span class="highlight">texture</span>, and by changing its size and <span class="highlight">shape</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.58" data-time="67.7">[01:07.70]</span>For me, the most <span class="highlight">fascinating</span> <span class="highlight">transformation</span> is when it changes its color.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="11.82" data-time="76.28">[01:16.28]</span>It's a normal skin color, the one it generally presents, is either red or brown or <span class="highlight">even</span> grey, and it's speckled with dark spots. <span class="time" data-times="13.67" data-time="88.1">[01:28.10]</span>But when it wants to <span class="highlight">blend</span> in with its environment to <span class="highlight">hide</span> from its enemies, it can take on the color of its <span class="highlight">immediate</span> surroundings: the ocean floor, a rock, a piece of <span class="highlight">coral</span>, whatever. Charles? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.03" data-time="101.77">[01:41.77]</span>Student: Do we know how that works, I mean, how they change colors?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.67" data-time="105.8">[01:45.80]</span>Professor: Well, we know that the <span class="highlight">reaction</span> that takes place is not chemical in nature. <span class="time" data-times="11.81" data-time="110.47">[01:50.47]</span>The color changes are executed by two different kinds of cells in the <span class="highlight">octopus</span>' skin, mainly by color cells on the skin's surface call chromatophores.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.84" data-time="122.28">[02:02.28]</span>Chromatophores <span class="highlight">consist</span> of tiny sacks filled with color <span class="highlight">dye</span>. <span class="time" data-times="11.8" data-time="129.12">[02:09.12]</span>There might be a <span class="highlight">couple</span> hundred of these color sacks per <span class="highlight">square</span> <span class="highlight">millimeter</span> of the <span class="highlight">octopus</span> ' skin, and depending on the <span class="highlight">species</span>, they can come in as many as five different colors. <span class="time" data-times="3.65" data-time="140.92">[02:20.92]</span>Each one of these sacks is controlled by muscles. <span class="time" data-times="6.29" data-time="144.57">[02:24.57]</span>If the muscles are relaxed, the sack shrinks, and all you see is a little white point. <span class="time" data-times="5.43" data-time="150.86">[02:30.86]</span>But if the <span class="highlight">muscle</span>'s <span class="highlight">contract</span>, then the sack expands, and you can see the colors. <span class="time" data-times="11.55" data-time="156.29">[02:36.29]</span>And by expanding different combinations of these color sacks to different degrees, the <span class="highlight">octopus</span> can create all sorts of colors. Yes, Elisabaze?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.55" data-time="167.84">[02:47.84]</span>Student: And just with various combinations of those five colors, they can recreate any color in their environment?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="11.09" data-time="176.39">[02:56.39]</span>Professor: Well, they can no <span class="highlight">doubt</span> create a lot with just those five colors, but you are right, maybe they can't <span class="highlight">mimic</span> every color around them, so that's where the <span class="highlight">second</span> kind of <span class="highlight">cell</span> comes in.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="12.43" data-time="187.48">[03:07.48]</span>Just below the chromatophores is a <span class="highlight">layer</span> of cells that <span class="highlight">reflect</span> light from the environment, and these cells help the <span class="highlight">octopus</span> create a <span class="highlight">precise</span> <span class="highlight">match</span> with the colors that <span class="highlight">surround</span> them. <span class="time" data-times="10.82" data-time="199.91">[03:19.91]</span>The colors from the color sacks are supplemented with colors that are reflected from the environment, and that's how they are able to <span class="highlight">mimic</span> colors with such precision. <span class="time" data-times="2.98" data-time="210.73">[03:30.73]</span>So, that's how <span class="highlight">octopus</span> <span class="highlight">mimic</span> colors.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.44" data-time="213.71">[03:33.71]</span>But they don't just <span class="highlight">mimic</span> the colors in their environment; they can also <span class="highlight">mimic</span> the <span class="highlight">texture</span> of objects in their environment. <span class="time" data-times="5.98" data-time="221.15">[03:41.15]</span>They have these little projections on their skin that allow them to <span class="highlight">resemble</span> various textures. <span class="time" data-times="3.57" data-time="227.13">[03:47.13]</span>The projections are called papillae.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.01" data-time="230.7">[03:50.70]</span>If the <span class="highlight">octopus</span> wants to have a <span class="highlight">rough</span> <span class="highlight">texture</span>, it raises the papillae. <span class="time" data-times="8.95" data-time="237.71">[03:57.71]</span>If it wants to have a smooth <span class="highlight">texture</span>, it flattens out the papillae, so it can <span class="highlight">acquire</span> a smooth <span class="highlight">texture</span> to <span class="highlight">blend</span> in with the sandy bottom of the sea. <span class="time" data-times="7.25" data-time="246.66">[04:06.66]</span>So the <span class="highlight">octopus</span> has the <span class="highlight">ability</span> to <span class="highlight">mimic</span> both the color and the <span class="highlight">texture</span> of its environment. <span class="time" data-times="4.47" data-time="253.91">[04:13.91]</span>And it's truly amazing how well it can <span class="highlight">blend</span> in with its surroundings. <span class="time" data-times="5.06" data-time="258.38">[04:18.38]</span>You can easily swim <span class="highlight">within</span> a few feet of an <span class="highlight">octopus</span> and never see it.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.26" data-time="263.44">[04:23.44]</span>Student: I read that they often <span class="highlight">hide</span> from predators by squirting out a cloud of ink, or something like that.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.51" data-time="271.7">[04:31.70]</span>Professor: Yes. The <span class="highlight">octopus</span> can <span class="highlight">release</span> a cloud of ink if it feels threatened. <span class="time" data-times="4.55" data-time="277.21">[04:37.21]</span>But it doesn't <span class="highlight">hide</span> behind it, as is generally believed. <span class="time" data-times="7.34" data-time="281.76">[04:41.76]</span>Um, the ink cloud is ... it serves to <span class="highlight">distract</span> a <span class="highlight">predator</span> while the <span class="highlight">octopus</span> makes its <span class="highlight">escape</span>. <span class="time" data-times="14.18" data-time="289.1">[04:49.10]</span>Um, now there's a third way that <span class="highlight">octopus</span> can <span class="highlight">transform</span> themselves to <span class="highlight">blend</span> in with or <span class="highlight">mimic</span> their environment, and that's by changing their <span class="highlight">shape</span> and size, well, at <span class="highlight">least</span> their <span class="highlight">apparent</span> size.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.33" data-time="303.28">[05:03.28]</span>The <span class="highlight">muscular</span> system of the <span class="highlight">octopus</span> enables it to be very <span class="highlight">flexible</span> to <span class="highlight">assume</span> all sorts of shapes and postures. <span class="time" data-times="7.27" data-time="311.61">[05:11.61]</span>So it can <span class="highlight">contract</span> into the <span class="highlight">shape</span> of a little round stone, and sit perfectly still on the seafloor. <span class="time" data-times="5.25" data-time="318.88">[05:18.88]</span>Or it can nestle up in the middle of a plant and take the <span class="highlight">shape</span> of one of the leaves. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="324.13">[05:24.13]</span> <span class="highlight">Even</span> Proteus would be impressed, I think.</p>
