Both animals and plants have different appearances in these various lighting conditions. A color or <span class="highlight">pattern</span> that is <span class="highlight">relatively</span> indistinct in one kind of light may be quite <span class="highlight question1">conspicuous</span> in another.</p><p>In the <span class="highlight">varied</span> and <span class="highlight">constantly</span> changing light environment of the forest, an animal must be able to send <span class="highlight">visual</span> signals to members of its own <span class="highlight">species</span> and at the same time <span class="highlight">avoid</span> being detected by predators. An animal can <span class="highlight">hide</span> from predators by choosing the light environment in which its <span class="highlight">pattern</span> is <span class="highlight">least</span><span class="highlight">visible</span>. This may <span class="highlight">require</span> moving to different parts of the forest at different times of the day or under different weather conditions, or it may be achieved by changing color according to the changing light conditions. Many <span class="highlight">species</span> of amphibians (frogs and toads) and reptiles (lizards and snakes) are able to change their color patterns to <span class="highlight">camouflage</span> themselves. Some also <span class="highlight"><span class="question3">signal</span></span> by changing color. The <span class="highlight">chameleon</span><span class="highlight">lizard</span> has the most <span class="highlight">striking</span><span class="highlight">ability</span> to do this. Some <span class="highlight">chameleon</span><span class="highlight">species</span> can change from a rather <span class="highlight">dull</span><span class="highlight">appearance</span> to a full riot of <span class="highlight">carnival</span> colors in seconds. By this means, they <span class="highlight">signal</span> their <span class="highlight">level</span> of <span class="highlight">aggression</span> or readiness to <span class="highlight">mate</span>.</p><p>Other <span class="highlight">species</span> take into <span class="highlight">account</span> the changing conditions of light by performing their <span class="highlight">visual</span> displays only when the light is <span class="highlight">favorable</span>. A <span class="highlight">male</span> bird of paradise may put himself in the limelight by displaying his <span class="highlight">spectacular</span><span class="highlight">plumage</span> in the best <span class="highlight">stage</span><span class="highlight">setting</span> to <span class="highlight">attract</span> a <span class="highlight">female</span>. Certain butterflies move into spots of sunlight that have penetrated to the forest floor and <span class="highlight">display</span> by opening and closing their beautifully patterned wings in the bright spotlights They also <span class="highlight">compete</span> with each other for the best <span class="highlight">spot</span> of sunlight.</p><p>Very little light filters <span class="highlight">through</span> the <span class="highlight">canopy</span> of leaves and branches in a rain forest to <span class="highlight">reach</span> ground <span class="highlight">level</span>-or close to the ground-and at those levels the yellow-to-green wavelengths <span class="highlight">predominate</span>. A <span class="highlight">signal</span> might be most easily seen if it is maximally bright. <span class="question7">In the green-to yellow lighting conditions of the lowest levels of the forest, yellow and green would be the brightest colors, but when an animal is signaling, these colors would not be very <span class="highlight">visible</span> if the animal was sitting in an area with a yellowish or greenish background.</span> The best <span class="highlight">signal</span> depends not only on its brightness but also on how well it contrasts with the background against which it must be seen. In this part of the rain forest, <span class="highlight">therefore</span>, red and orange are the best colors for signaling, and they are the colors used in signals by the ground-walking Australian <span class="highlight">brush</span><span class="highlight">turkey</span>. This <span class="highlight">species</span>, which lives in the rain forests and scrublands of the east <span class="highlight">coast</span> of Australia, has a brown to-black <span class="highlight">plumage</span> with <span class="highlight">bare</span>, bright-red skin on the head and neck and a neck <span class="highlight">collar</span> of orange-yellow loosely hanging skin. During <span class="highlight">courtship</span> and <span class="highlight">aggressive</span> displays, the <span class="highlight">turkey</span> enlarges its colored neck <span class="highlight">collar</span> by <span class="question8">inflating</span> sacs in the neck <span class="highlight">region</span> and then flings about a pendulous part of the colored signaling <span class="highlight">apparatus</span> as it utters calls designed to <span class="highlight">attract</span> or <span class="highlight">repel</span>. This <span class="highlight">impressive</span><span class="highlight">display</span> is clearly <span class="highlight">visible</span> in the light <span class="highlight">spectrum</span> illuminating the forest floor.</p><p>Less colorful birds and animals that <span class="highlight">inhabit</span> the rain forest <span class="highlight">tend</span> to <span class="highlight">rely</span> on forms of signaling other than the <span class="highlight">visual</span>, particularly over long distances.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> The piercing cries of the <span class="highlight">rhinoceros</span> hornbill <span class="highlight">characterize</span> the Southeast Asian rain forest, as do the <span class="highlight">unmistakable</span> calls of the gibbons.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>In densely wooded environments,<span class="highlight">sound</span> is the best means of communication over distance because in <span class="highlight">comparison</span> with light, it travels with little <span class="question11">impediment</span> from trees and other <span class="highlight">vegetation</span>.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span> In forests, <span class="highlight">visual</span> signals can be seen only at short distances, where they are not obstructed by trees. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>The <span class="highlight">male</span> riflebird <span class="question12">exploits</span> both of these modes of signaling simultaneously 
in his <span class="highlight">courtship</span><span class="highlight">display</span>. The sounds made as each wing is opened carry extremely well over distance and <span class="highlight">advertise</span> his presence widely. The ritualized <span class="highlight">visual</span><span class="highlight">display</span> communicates in close 
quarters when a <span class="highlight">female</span> has approached.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The phrase |conspicuous|in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Common</p><p>B. Noticeable</p><p>C. Different</p><p>D. Colorful</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B conspicuous: Obvious, obvious. A is common, universal; B is so B is obvious and significant; C is different; D is colorful and interesting. So B's noticeable is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 2, what is problematic about an animal's sending visual signals to members of its own species?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Signs that make an animal visible to its species also make it visible to predators.</p><p>B. An animal that changes color to avoid predators can confuse members of its species.</p><p>C. Changing light may require an animal to move beyond the visual range of other members.</p><p>D. The animal may mistakenly signal aggression when it meant to signal readiness to mate.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A uses the members of its own species as a key word to locate the first sentence. When an animal signals one of its own species, it must also avoid being seen by natural enemies. So the answer is A. The animal's signal is also seen by the predator. B's change colours, C's beyond the visual range and D's signal aggression did not say anything.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word signal in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. change</p><p>B. imitate</p><p>C. communicate</p><p>D. hide</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C, signal: verb. Signaling, signalling (the intention is the signal, this is the meaning of the noun, the article is a verb, and the meaning of the verb must be associated with the meaning of the noun). A is the change; B is the imitation; C is the contact, communication; D is hidden. So the answer is C's companion.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 2, all of the following are reasons amphibians and reptiles change color EXCEPT</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. changing seasons</p><p>B. to signal others of their species</p><p>C. to match the light</p><p>D. to hide from predators</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A EXCEPT questions, exclusion method, A in the original no corresponding point, so A wrong, election; B's signal others do keyword positioning to the penultimate sentence, correct, not selected; C's light keyword positioning to the first sentence Said that the light is constantly changing, so C is correct, not selected; D's hide from predators do keyword positioning to the fourth last sentence, say camouflage themselves, so D is correct, not selected.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 3, butterflies move into spots of sunlight in order to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. warm their wings in order to open them</p><p>B. compete with each other</p><p>C. take advantage of favorable light conditions on the forest floor</p><p>D. imitate birds of paradise</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C uses the butterfly keyword to navigate to the third sentence, saying that the butterfly moves into and displays blabla, but it doesn't say why the butterfly wants to move. The last sentence makes it very clear that the butterflies will compete with each other for the best sunshine, that is, C said. The use of light conditions, so the answer is C, B, although said compete, but did not say what the compiler, so wrong, the other is simply saying that the incident did not say the reason, so wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, what is true about light that reaches ground level?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It reveals only the yellow and green colors animals use to signal each other.</p><p>B. It reflects the yellow and green colors to make the floor as bright as sunshine.</p><p>C. It camouflages animals whose natural colors are yellow and green.</p><p>D. It consists mostly of yellow-to-green wavelengths.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D. Use light that reaches ground level as the key word to locate the first sentence. The light that reaches the ground is dominated by the yellow-green wavelengths. D is faithful rewriting of the original text. Nothing else is said. Can quickly and easily come up with answers.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. When an animal is signaling in an area with green-to yellow lighting condition. It's signal will not be visible if the background is brightly lit.</p><p>B. In the lowest levels of the forest, an animal's signals are not easily seen unless there is a yellowish or greenish background.</p><p>C. In the green-to-yellow lighting conditions at the lowest levels of the forest, only signals that are themselves green or yellow will be bright enough to be seen in most areas.</p><p>D. Although green and yellow would be the brightest colors near the forest floor, these colors would make poor signals whenever the forest background was also in the green-to-yellow range.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The main logic of the D original sentence is the turning point. The backbone is: originally yellow and green are the brightest, but if the background is yellowish green, it is not bright. D is correct and reproduces the main content and logic. A's brightly lit original did not say; B opposed the original; C's only wrong, and most areas did not say the original.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word |<span class="question8">inflating</span>|in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Coloring</p><p>B. Enlarging</p><p>C. Loosening</p><p>D. Heating</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B inflate: It is inflated and inflated. A is a whitewash, makes ... discolored; B is enlarged; C is relaxed; D is heated. So B's enlarging is the answer.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the following can be inferred from paragraph 4 about yellow and green colors compared with red and orange colors at the bottom of the forest?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Yellow and green are better colors for signaling than red and orange colors.</p><p>B. Orange and red are brighter colors than yellow and green.</p><p>C. Yellow and green are likely to be more common in the background than red and orange.</p><p>D. Orange and red colors do not contrast as well with the forest floor as yellow and green do.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C. Position the word red and orange colours into the fifth sentence. Say in the forest near the ground, red and orange are the best signal colors. In contrast, yellow and green are parts other than those near the ground. The best signal color, that is, the yellow-green color in Answer C, is more useful for signals than red-orange. A is not comprehensive. If you are near the surface, yellow and green are not good; B and D are antithetical.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What can be inferred from paragraph 5 about the less colorful birds and animals that inhabit the forest?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. These species are less able to see color. and therefore they communicate with one another using nonvisual signals.</p><p>B. These species generally live in less densely wooded environments than more colorful birds and animals do.</p><p>C. The cries of these species do not carry as well over distances as the cries of more colorful birds and animals.</p><p>D. These species depend more on nonvisual signals for communication because they are less visible in their environment.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D. Targeting to the first sentence with keywords less than the birds and animals, the original sentence said that these animals will rely on non-visual signals to communicate, the answer is D. B and C did not say, A said that they rely on non-visual, and the original text says more depends on non-visual, it is not the same, and the original did not say that these animals cannot see the color, so A is wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word |<span class="question11">impediment</span>|in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. obstruction</p><p>B. effort</p><p>C. delay</p><p>D. resistance</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A <span class="question11">impediment</span>: Obstruction, obstruction. A is an obstacle; B is an effort; C is a delay; D is a resistance, resistance, resistance. So the obstruction of A is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word |<span class="question12">exploits</span>|in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. repeats</p><p>B. makes use of</p><p>C. increases the intensity of</p><p>D. recognizes</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B,exploit: use, exploitation, development, exploitation.
