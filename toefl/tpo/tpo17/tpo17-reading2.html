            <b>Animal Signals in the Rain Forest</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>The daytime <span class="highlight">quality</span> of light in forests varies with the <span class="highlight">density</span> of the <span class="highlight">vegetation</span>, the <span class="highlight">angle</span> of the Sun, and the <span class="highlight">amount</span> of cloud in the sky. Both animals and plants have different appearances in these various lighting conditions. A color or <span class="highlight">pattern</span> that is <span class="highlight">relatively</span> indistinct in one kind of light may be quite <span class="question1"><span class="highlight">conspicuous</span></span> in another.</p>
          <p>In the <span class="highlight">varied</span> and <span class="highlight">constantly</span> changing light environment of the forest, an animal must be able to send <span class="highlight">visual</span> signals to members of its own <span class="highlight">species</span> and at the same time <span class="highlight">avoid</span> being detected by predators. An animal can <span class="highlight">hide</span> from predators by choosing the light environment in which its <span class="highlight">pattern</span> is <span class="highlight">least</span> <span class="highlight">visible</span>. This may <span class="highlight">require</span> moving to different parts of the forest at different times of the day or under different weather conditions, or it may be achieved by changing color according to the changing light conditions. Many <span class="highlight">species</span> of amphibians (frogs and toads) and reptiles (lizards and snakes) are able to change their color patterns to <span class="highlight">camouflage</span> themselves. Some also <span class="highlight">signal</span> by changing color. The <span class="highlight">chameleon</span> <span class="highlight">lizard</span> has the most <span class="highlight">striking</span> <span class="highlight">ability</span> to do this. Some <span class="highlight">chameleon</span> <span class="highlight">species</span> can change from a rather <span class="highlight">dull</span> <span class="highlight">appearance</span> to a full riot of <span class="highlight">carnival</span> colors in seconds. By this means, they <span class="highlight">signal</span> their <span class="highlight">level</span> of <span class="highlight">aggression</span> or readiness to <span class="highlight">mate</span>.</p>
          <p>Other <span class="highlight">species</span> take into <span class="highlight">account</span> the changing conditions of light by performing their <span class="highlight">visual</span> displays only when the light is <span class="highlight">favorable</span>. A <span class="highlight">male</span> bird of paradise may put himself in the limelight by displaying his <span class="highlight">spectacular</span> <span class="highlight">plumage</span> in the best <span class="highlight">stage</span> <span class="highlight">setting</span> to <span class="highlight">attract</span> a <span class="highlight">female</span>. Certain butterflies move into spots of sunlight that have penetrated to the forest floor and <span class="highlight">display</span> by opening and closing their beautifully patterned wings in the bright spotlights They also <span class="highlight">compete</span> with each other for the best <span class="highlight">spot</span> of sunlight.</p>
          <p>Very little light filters <span class="highlight">through</span> the <span class="highlight">canopy</span> of leaves and branches in a rain forest to <span class="highlight">reach</span> ground <span class="highlight">level</span>-or close to the ground-and at those levels the yellow-to-green wavelengths <span class="highlight">predominate</span>. A <span class="highlight">signal</span> might be most easily seen if it is maximally bright. <span class="question7">In the green-to yellow lighting conditions of the lowest levels of the forest, yellow and green would be the brightest colors, but when an animal is signaling, these colors would not be very <span class="highlight">visible</span> if the animal was sitting in an area with a yellowish or greenish background. </span>The best <span class="highlight">signal</span> depends not only on its brightness but also on how well it contrasts with the background against which it must be seen. In this part of the rain forest, <span class="highlight">therefore</span>, red and orange are the best colors for signaling, and they are the colors used in signals by the ground-walking Australian <span class="highlight">brush</span> <span class="highlight">turkey</span>. This <span class="highlight">species</span>, which lives in the rain forests and scrublands of the east <span class="highlight">coast</span> of Australia, has a brown to-black <span class="highlight">plumage</span> with <span class="highlight">bare</span>, bright-red skin on the head and neck and a neck <span class="highlight">collar</span> of orange-yellow loosely hanging skin. During <span class="highlight">courtship</span> and <span class="highlight">aggressive</span> displays, the <span class="highlight">turkey</span> enlarges its colored neck <span class="highlight">collar</span> by <span class="question8">inflating </span>sacs in the neck <span class="highlight">region</span> and then flings about a pendulous part of the colored signaling <span class="highlight">apparatus</span> as it utters calls designed to <span class="highlight">attract</span> or <span class="highlight">repel</span>. This <span class="highlight">impressive</span> <span class="highlight">display</span> is clearly <span class="highlight">visible</span> in the light <span class="highlight">spectrum</span> illuminating the forest floor.</p>
          <p>Less colorful birds and animals that <span class="highlight">inhabit</span> the rain forest <span class="highlight">tend</span> to <span class="highlight">rely</span> on forms of signaling other than the <span class="highlight">visual</span>, particularly over long distances.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> The piercing cries of the <span class="highlight">rhinoceros</span> hornbill <span class="highlight">characterize</span> the Southeast Asian rain forest, as do the <span class="highlight">unmistakable</span> calls of the gibbons.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>In densely wooded environments,<span class="highlight">sound</span> is the best means of communication over distance because in <span class="highlight">comparison</span> with light, it travels with little <span class="question11">impediment </span>from trees and other <span class="highlight">vegetation</span>.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span> In forests, <span class="highlight">visual</span> signals can be seen only at short distances, where they are not obstructed by trees. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>The <span class="highlight">male</span> riflebird <span class="question12">exploits </span>both of these modes of signaling simultaneously 
in his <span class="highlight">courtship</span> <span class="highlight">display</span>. The sounds made as each wing is opened carry extremely well over distance and <span class="highlight">advertise</span> his presence widely. The ritualized <span class="highlight">visual</span> <span class="highlight">display</span> communicates in close 
quarters when a <span class="highlight">female</span> has approached.</p>
