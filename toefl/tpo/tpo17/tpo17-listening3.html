              <span class="time" data-times="6.77" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> science class. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.81" data-time="6.77">[00:06.77]</span>Professor: Ok, so we have been talking about theories that <span class="highlight">deal</span> with the effects of human <span class="highlight">activity</span> on the <span class="highlight">climate</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.62" data-time="14.58">[00:14.58]</span>But today I'd like to talk a little bit about other theories that can explain variations in <span class="highlight">climate</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.58" data-time="19.2">[00:19.20]</span>And one of the best-known is called the Milankovitch <span class="highlight">Hypothesis</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.8" data-time="25.78">[00:25.78]</span>Now what the Milankovitch <span class="highlight">Hypothesis</span> is about? <span class="time" data-times="12.85" data-time="31.58">[00:31.58]</span>It says that variations in earth's movements, <span class="highlight">specifically</span> in its <span class="highlight">orbit</span> around the sun, these variations <span class="highlight">lead</span> to differences in the <span class="highlight">amount</span> of <span class="highlight">solar</span> energy that reaches the earth. <span class="time" data-times="8.34" data-time="44.43">[00:44.43]</span>And it is these differences in the <span class="highlight">amount</span> of energy that's reaching earth from the sun, it is what causes variations in earth's <span class="highlight">climate</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="18" data-time="52.77">[00:52.77]</span>Ok, a lot of people think of earth's <span class="highlight">orbit</span> around the sun as being perfectly <span class="highlight">circular</span>, as smooth and as <span class="highlight">regular</span> as, say, the way that hands move on a well-made watch, but it just doesn't work that way. <span class="time" data-times="8.07" data-time="70.77">[01:10.77]</span>You are probably <span class="highlight">aware</span> that the earth's <span class="highlight">orbit</span> around the sun, it is not shaped like a <span class="highlight">perfect</span> circle. <span class="time" data-times="3" data-time="78.84">[01:18.84]</span>It is more of an <span class="highlight">oval</span>, it is <span class="highlight">elliptical</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.38" data-time="81.84">[01:21.84]</span>But the <span class="highlight">shape</span> of this <span class="highlight">orbit</span> isn't <span class="highlight">consistent</span>, it varies over time, over a period of about a thousand years. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.63" data-time="88.22">[01:28.22]</span>Sometimes it is a little more <span class="highlight">circular</span>, sometimes it is more <span class="highlight">elliptical</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.81" data-time="91.85">[01:31.85]</span>And when earth's <span class="highlight">orbit</span> is more <span class="highlight">elliptical</span>, earth is actually closer to the sun during part of the year. <span class="time" data-times="3.74" data-time="98.66">[01:38.66]</span>Which makes earth, and in <span class="highlight">particular</span>, the northern <span class="highlight">hemisphere</span>, warmer. <span class="time" data-times="1.55" data-time="102.4">[01:42.40]</span>And why is that important? <span class="time" data-times="8.58" data-time="103.95">[01:43.95]</span>Well, because most of the <span class="highlight">planet</span>'s glaciers are in the northern <span class="highlight">hemisphere</span>, and if it gets too warm, then glaciers will stop forming. <span class="time" data-times="5.21" data-time="112.53">[01:52.53]</span>And we've already talked about how that affects earth's <span class="highlight">overall</span> <span class="highlight">temperature</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.3" data-time="117.74">[01:57.74]</span>The <span class="highlight">second</span> movement involved in the <span class="highlight">hypothesis</span> has to do with axial <span class="highlight">tilt</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.06" data-time="123.04">[02:03.04]</span>The <span class="highlight">tilt</span> of earth's <span class="highlight">axis</span>, that <span class="highlight">imaginary</span> <span class="highlight">pole</span> that runs <span class="highlight">through</span> the center of the earth. <span class="time" data-times="6.8" data-time="128.1">[02:08.10]</span>And depending on the <span class="highlight">angle</span> it tilts at, the seasons can be more or less <span class="highlight">severe</span>. <span class="time" data-times="10.52" data-time="134.9">[02:14.90]</span>It makes winters cooler and summers warmer, or what some might say it is doing now, it makes summers less hot, and more importantly, the winters less cold. <span class="time" data-times="9.57" data-time="145.42">[02:25.42]</span>Which just like what I mentioned before, can also stop, prevent glaciers from forming, or cause them to <span class="highlight">melt</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.98" data-time="154.99">[02:34.99]</span>There is a third movement the <span class="highlight">hypothesis</span> covers called <span class="highlight">precession</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.86" data-time="159.97">[02:39.97]</span> <span class="highlight">Precession</span>, basically is the change in the direction of earth's <span class="highlight">axis</span> of <span class="highlight">rotation</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.42" data-time="165.83">[02:45.83]</span>It will take me a million years to explain <span class="highlight">even</span> just the basics of this movement as <span class="highlight">precession</span> is quite <span class="highlight">complex</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.32" data-time="172.25">[02:52.25]</span>And all these details are way beyond our <span class="highlight">scope</span>. <span class="time" data-times="15.75" data-time="175.57">[02:55.57]</span>What's important for you to understand is that these three movements, well, they are cyclical, and they work together to form, to produce <span class="highlight">complex</span> but <span class="highlight">regular</span> variations in earth's <span class="highlight">climate</span>, and <span class="highlight">lead</span> to the growth or <span class="highlight">decline</span> of glaciers. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.93" data-time="191.32">[03:11.32]</span>Now, when Milankovitch first proposed this <span class="highlight">theory</span> in the 1920s, many of his colleagues were <span class="highlight">skeptical</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.12" data-time="197.25">[03:17.25]</span>Milankovitch didn't have any <span class="highlight">proof</span>. <span class="time" data-times="13.55" data-time="199.37">[03:19.37]</span>Actually there wouldn't be any <span class="highlight">evidence</span> to support his <span class="highlight">hypothesis</span> until the 1970s, when oceanographers were able to <span class="highlight">drill</span> deep into the seafloor and <span class="highlight">collect</span> samples, samples which were then analyzed by geologists. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="15.27" data-time="212.92">[03:32.92]</span>And from these samples they were able to put together a <span class="highlight">history</span> of ocean temperatures going back hundreds of thousands of years, and this showed that earth's <span class="highlight">climate</span> had changed <span class="highlight">pretty</span> much the way Milankovitch's <span class="highlight">hypothesis</span> suggested it would. <span class="time" data-times="4.82" data-time="228.19">[03:48.19]</span>So this <span class="highlight">evidence</span> was <span class="highlight">pretty</span> strong support for the Milankovitch <span class="highlight">Hypothesis</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.43" data-time="233.01">[03:53.01]</span>And by the 1980s, most people accepted this <span class="highlight">theory</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="15.9" data-time="237.44">[03:57.44]</span>However, in the late 1980s, some scientists were exploring <span class="highlight">Devil</span>'s Hole, which is basically an <span class="highlight">extensive</span> water-filled cave, far from the ocean, in Nevada, in the western United States. <span class="time" data-times="7.81" data-time="253.34">[04:13.34]</span>Over millions of years, <span class="highlight">groundwater</span> left deposits of a <span class="highlight">mineral</span> called calcite, on the rock <span class="highlight">within</span> <span class="highlight">Devil</span>'s Hole. <span class="time" data-times="8.35" data-time="261.15">[04:21.15]</span>And by studying these calcite deposits, we can <span class="highlight">determine</span> the <span class="highlight">climate</span> conditions, the temperatures over the last half million years. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="13.28" data-time="269.5">[04:29.50]</span>Well, the <span class="highlight">Devil</span>' s Hole findings contradicted the ones obtained during the 1970s, so basically the question was: Were the ages of one or both the samples were wrong? <span class="time" data-times="5.74" data-time="282.78">[04:42.78]</span>Or were scientists misunderstanding the <span class="highlight">significance</span> of the <span class="highlight">evidence</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.63" data-time="288.52">[04:48.52]</span>Well, in the 1990s, a new study was done on the two samples. <span class="time" data-times="5.75" data-time="296.15">[04:56.15]</span>And the ocean floor samples were found to be correct, as were the samples from <span class="highlight">Devil</span>'s Hole. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="301.9">[05:01.90]</span>And now it is generally believed that the <span class="highlight">sample</span> from <span class="highlight">Devil</span>'s Hole <span class="highlight"><span class="highlight">correspond</span></span> to variations in <span class="highlight">local</span> <span class="highlight">climate</span>, in the western United States, rather than global <span class="highlight">climate</span> changes. </p>
