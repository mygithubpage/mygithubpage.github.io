part of a lecture in an <span class="highlight">environmental</span> science class. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.81" data-time="6.77">[00:06.77]</span>Professor: Ok, so we have been talking about theories that <span class="highlight">deal</span> with the effects of human <span class="highlight">activity</span> on the <span class="highlight">climate</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.62" data-time="14.58">[00:14.58]</span>But today I'd like to talk a little bit about other theories that can explain variations in <span class="highlight">climate</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.58" data-time="19.2">[00:19.20]</span>And one of the best-known is called the Milankovitch <span class="highlight">Hypothesis</span>. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.8" data-time="25.78">[00:25.78]</span>Now what the Milankovitch <span class="highlight">Hypothesis</span> is about? <span class="time" data-times="12.85" data-time="31.58">[00:31.58]</span>It says that variations in earth's movements, <span class="highlight">specifically</span> in its <span class="highlight">orbit</span> around the sun, these variations <span class="highlight">lead</span> to differences in the <span class="highlight">amount</span> of <span class="highlight">solar</span> energy that reaches the earth. <span class="time" data-times="8.34" data-time="44.43">[00:44.43]</span>And it is these differences in the <span class="highlight">amount</span> of energy that's reaching earth from the sun, it is what causes variations in earth's <span class="highlight">climate</span>. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="18" data-time="52.77">[00:52.77]</span>Ok, a lot of people think of earth's <span class="highlight">orbit</span> around the sun as being perfectly <span class="highlight">circular</span>, as smooth and as <span class="highlight">regular</span> as, say, the way that hands move on a well-made watch, but it just doesn't work that way. <span class="time" data-times="8.07" data-time="70.77">[01:10.77]</span>You are probably <span class="highlight">aware</span> that the earth's <span class="highlight">orbit</span> around the sun, it is not shaped like a <span class="highlight">perfect</span> circle. <span class="time" data-times="3" data-time="78.84">[01:18.84]</span>It is more of an <span class="highlight">oval</span>, it is <span class="highlight">elliptical</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.38" data-time="81.84">[01:21.84]</span>But the <span class="highlight">shape</span> of this <span class="highlight">orbit</span> isn't <span class="highlight">consistent</span>, it varies over time, over a period of about a thousand years. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.63" data-time="88.22">[01:28.22]</span>Sometimes it is a little more <span class="highlight">circular</span>, sometimes it is more <span class="highlight">elliptical</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.81" data-time="91.85">[01:31.85]</span>And when earth's <span class="highlight">orbit</span> is more <span class="highlight">elliptical</span>, earth is actually closer to the sun during part of the year. <span class="time" data-times="3.74" data-time="98.66">[01:38.66]</span>Which makes earth, and in <span class="highlight">particular</span>, the northern <span class="highlight">hemisphere</span>, warmer. <span class="time" data-times="1.55" data-time="102.4">[01:42.40]</span>And why is that important? <span class="time" data-times="8.58" data-time="103.95">[01:43.95]</span>Well, because most of the <span class="highlight">planet</span>'s glaciers are in the northern <span class="highlight">hemisphere</span>, and if it gets too warm, then glaciers will stop forming. <span class="time" data-times="5.21" data-time="112.53">[01:52.53]</span>And we've already talked about how that affects earth's <span class="highlight">overall</span><span class="highlight">temperature</span>. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.3" data-time="117.74">[01:57.74]</span>The <span class="highlight">second</span> movement involved in the <span class="highlight">hypothesis</span> has to do with axial <span class="highlight">tilt</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.06" data-time="123.04">[02:03.04]</span>The <span class="highlight">tilt</span> of earth's <span class="highlight">axis</span>, that <span class="highlight">imaginary</span><span class="highlight">pole</span> that runs <span class="highlight">through</span> the center of the earth. <span class="time" data-times="6.8" data-time="128.1">[02:08.10]</span>And depending on the <span class="highlight">angle</span> it tilts at, the seasons can be more or less <span class="highlight">severe</span>. <span class="time" data-times="10.52" data-time="134.9">[02:14.90]</span>It makes winters cooler and summers warmer, or what some might say it is doing now, it makes summers less hot, and more importantly, the winters less cold. <span class="time" data-times="9.57" data-time="145.42">[02:25.42]</span>Which just like what I mentioned before, can also stop, prevent glaciers from forming, or cause them to <span class="highlight">melt</span>. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.98" data-time="154.99">[02:34.99]</span>There is a third movement the <span class="highlight">hypothesis</span> covers called <span class="highlight">precession</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.86" data-time="159.97">[02:39.97]</span><span class="highlight">Precession</span>, basically is the change in the direction of earth's <span class="highlight">axis</span> of <span class="highlight">rotation</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.42" data-time="165.83">[02:45.83]</span>It will take me a million years to explain <span class="highlight">even</span> just the basics of this movement as <span class="highlight">precession</span> is quite <span class="highlight">complex</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.32" data-time="172.25">[02:52.25]</span>And all these details are way beyond our <span class="highlight">scope</span>. <span class="time" data-times="15.75" data-time="175.57">[02:55.57]</span>What's important for you to understand is that these three movements, well, they are cyclical, and they work together to form, to produce <span class="highlight">complex</span> but <span class="highlight">regular</span> variations in earth's <span class="highlight">climate</span>, and <span class="highlight">lead</span> to the growth or <span class="highlight">decline</span> of glaciers. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.93" data-time="191.32">[03:11.32]</span>Now, when Milankovitch first proposed this <span class="highlight">theory</span> in the 1920s, many of his colleagues were <span class="highlight">skeptical</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.12" data-time="197.25">[03:17.25]</span>Milankovitch didn't have any <span class="highlight">proof</span>. <span class="time" data-times="13.55" data-time="199.37">[03:19.37]</span>Actually there wouldn't be any <span class="highlight">evidence</span> to support his <span class="highlight">hypothesis</span> until the 1970s, when oceanographers were able to <span class="highlight">drill</span> deep into the seafloor and <span class="highlight">collect</span> samples, samples which were then analyzed by geologists. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="15.27" data-time="212.92">[03:32.92]</span>And from these samples they were able to put together a <span class="highlight">history</span> of ocean temperatures going back hundreds of thousands of years, and this showed that earth's <span class="highlight">climate</span> had changed <span class="highlight">pretty</span> much the way Milankovitch's <span class="highlight">hypothesis</span> suggested it would. <span class="time" data-times="4.82" data-time="228.19">[03:48.19]</span>So this <span class="highlight">evidence</span> was <span class="highlight">pretty</span> strong support for the Milankovitch <span class="highlight">Hypothesis</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.43" data-time="233.01">[03:53.01]</span>And by the 1980s, most people accepted this <span class="highlight">theory</span>. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="15.9" data-time="237.44">[03:57.44]</span>However, in the late 1980s, some scientists were exploring <span class="highlight">Devil</span>'s Hole, which is basically an <span class="highlight">extensive</span> water-filled cave, far from the ocean, in Nevada, in the western United States. <span class="time" data-times="7.81" data-time="253.34">[04:13.34]</span>Over millions of years, <span class="highlight">groundwater</span> left deposits of a <span class="highlight">mineral</span> called calcite, on the rock <span class="highlight">within</span><span class="highlight">Devil</span>'s Hole. <span class="time" data-times="8.35" data-time="261.15">[04:21.15]</span>And by studying these calcite deposits, we can <span class="highlight">determine</span> the <span class="highlight">climate</span> conditions, the temperatures over the last half million years. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="13.28" data-time="269.5">[04:29.50]</span>Well, the <span class="highlight">Devil</span>' s Hole findings contradicted the ones obtained during the 1970s, so basically the question was: Were the ages of one or both the samples were wrong? <span class="time" data-times="5.74" data-time="282.78">[04:42.78]</span>Or were scientists misunderstanding the <span class="highlight">significance</span> of the <span class="highlight">evidence</span>. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.63" data-time="288.52">[04:48.52]</span>Well, in the 1990s, a new study was done on the two samples. <span class="time" data-times="5.75" data-time="296.15">[04:56.15]</span>And the ocean floor samples were found to be correct, as were the samples from <span class="highlight">Devil</span>'s Hole. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="301.9">[05:01.90]</span>And now it is generally believed that the <span class="highlight">sample</span> from <span class="highlight">Devil</span>'s Hole <span class="highlight">correspond</span> to variations in <span class="highlight">local</span><span class="highlight">climate</span>, in the western United States, rather than global <span class="highlight">climate</span> changes. </p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the lecture mainly about?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. A hypothesis that explains how changes in Earth s motions affect climate.</p><p>B. A hypothesis that explains why the shape of Earth's orbit varies over time.</p><p>C. Reasons it is difficult to find evidence to support hypotheses about the climate.</p><p>D. Analyses of the accuracy of data collected in different ways.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>Professor:Ok,so we have been talking about theories that deal with the effects of human activity on the climate. But today I'd like to talk a little bit about other theories that can explain variations in climate. And one of the best- Known is called the Milankovitch Hypothesis.</p><p>The professor said that But today... I'd like to talk here is a sign that he is going to say the topic. He will introduce some theories that can explain the climate variables. One of the most famous theories is the Milankovitch Hypothesis. The three movements in this hypothesis are described later, as well as the historical process in which this hypothesis was approved. It can be seen that this topic is Milankovitch Hypothesis.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor compare Earth's movements to a watch</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To clarify a common misunderstanding.</p><p>B. To show in what way Earth is similar to a watch.</p><p>C. To emphasize the regularity of Earth s movements.</p><p>D. To connect the concepts of orbits and time.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>Professor: Ok, a lot of people think of earth's orbit around the sun as being perfectly circular, as smooth and as regular as, say, the way that hands move on a well -made watch, but it just doesn't work that way . You are probably aware that the earth's orbit around the sun, it is not shaped like a perfect circle. It is more of an oval, it is elliptical.</p><p>Watch locates the example for say here. But turning the key word, it is clear that the refer of it refers to earth's orbit, and the professor said that it is not a regular circle-like movement like a table. Go ahead and find out what the professor said before calling the watch. He said a lot of people think. Together, you can find why you mentioned watch. Many people think that earth's orbit moves around the circle regularly like a watch, but it does not. So here the professor mentioned that watch is to show that people have misunderstood the movement of earth's orbit.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor mention Northern Hemisphere glaciers?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They have a significant effect on the axial tilt of Earth.</p><p>B. They play a moderating role on Earth's climate.</p><p>C. Their formation could be affected by changes in Earth s orbit.</p><p>D. Their melting could result in longer warm seasons.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>And when earth's orbit is more elliptical, earth is actually closer to the sun during the year. Which makes earth, and in particular, the northern hemisphere, warmer. And why is that important? well, because most of the planet's glaciers are In the northern hemisphere, and if it gets too warm, then glaciers will stop forming. And we've already talked about how that affects earth's overall temperature.</p><p>Positioning the Northern Hemisphere glaciers and discovering that the professor immediately asks himself, why is that important? Well, because... It is important to point out here. He said that because most of the earth's glaciers are in the northern hemisphere, if it is too hot, the glaciers cannot form. Why is it so hot? Before relocating the professor to Northern Hemisphere, it is said that the elliptical motion of the earth's orbit is sometimes closer to the sun during the year. From this, we can know that it is the earth's orbit that affects the temperature and thus the formation of glaciers.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the significance of the evidence found on the ocean floor?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It negated earlier evidence that Milankovitch found.</p><p>B. It led to the development of new methods to measure global climate changes.</p><p>C. It helped Milankovitch first formulate his hypothesis.</p><p>D. It confirmed Milankovitch s hypothesis.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>Now, when Milankovitch first proposed this theory in the 1920s, many of his colleagues were skeptical. Milankovitch didn't have any proof. Actually there wouldn't be any evidence to support his hypothesis until the 1970s, when oceanographers were able to drill deep Into the seafloor and collect samples, samples which were then analyzed by geologists.</p><p>Now is the keyword. Milankovitch assumed that the first time he was asked was questioned by many colleagues, and Milankovitch had no evidence. It was not until the 1980s that there was evidence to support this hypothesis. Oceanographers dug out and collected samples from the seafloor. These samples were analyzed by geologists. So obviously the answer is D.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What did calcite deposits from Devils Hole reveal?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Inaccurate information about long-term climate changes.</p><p>B. Evidence that contradicted Milankovitch s hypothesis.</p><p>C. Evidence that climate changes occur only locally.</p><p>D. Variations in Earth's orbit that had little impact on climate.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Professor:Over millions of years, groundwater left deposits of a mineral called calcite, on the rock within Devil's Hole. And by studying these calcite deposits, we can determine the climate conditions, the temperatures over the last half million years. Well, the Devil 'S hole content contradicted the ones obtained during the 1970s, so basically the question was, were the ages of one or both the samples were wrong, or were scientists misunderstanding the significance of the evidence.</p><p>Target calcite, Devil's Hole. The professor said that studying calcite we can determine the climate of the past 500,000 years. Well is a keyword, and contradict means that negative words are also key. The key to this question is to make sure that the object of contradict is the ones during the 1970s, which is the Milankovitch Hypothesis. So the answer is B.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor say this:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To inform the students about what he will not discuss.</p><p>B. To indicate the difficulty of measuring precession.</p><p>C. To explain why he plans to spend a long time discussing precession.</p><p>D. To clarify that he will provide additional information later.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>It is taking a a million years to explain even just the basics of this movement as precession is quite complex. And all These details are way beyond our scope. What's important for you to understand is that these three movements, well, they are cyclical, and they work together to form, to produce complex but regular variations in earth's climate, and lead to the growth or decline Of glaciers.</p><p>Listening to some of the professors has already hinted that it may take a million years to explain because the precession movement is too complicated. The focus is And all these details are way beyond our scope. What's important for you to understand tells the students that they only need to understand that the three movements are periodic and work together to form a regular climate change.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
