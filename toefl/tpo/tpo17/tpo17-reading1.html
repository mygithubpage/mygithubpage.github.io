          <h4 class="w3-center">Europe's Early Sea Trade with Asia</h4>
          <p>In the fourteenth <span class="highlight">century</span>, a number of <span class="highlight">political</span> developments cut Europe's overland <span class="highlight">trade</span> routes to southern and eastern Asia, with which Europe had had important and highly <span class="highlight">profitable</span> <span class="highlight">commercial</span> ties since the twelfth <span class="highlight">century</span>. This <span class="highlight">development</span>, coming as it did when the bottom had fallen out of the European <span class="highlight">economy</span>, provided an <span class="highlight question1">impetus</span> to a long-held <span class="highlight">desire</span> to <span class="highlight">secure</span> direct relations with the East by establishing a sea <span class="highlight">trade</span>. Widely reported, if <span class="highlight">somewhat</span> distrusted, accounts by figures like the famous traveler from Venice, Marco Polo, of the willingness of people in China to <span class="highlight">trade</span> with Europeans and of the immensity of the wealth to be gained by such <span class="highlight">contact</span> made the idea <span class="highlight">irresistible</span>. Possibilities for <span class="highlight">trade</span> seemed <span class="highlight">promising</span>, but no hope existed for maintaining the <span class="highlight">traditional</span> routes over land. A new way had to be found.</p>
          <p>The <span class="highlight">chief</span> problem was technological: How were the Europeans to <span class="highlight">reach</span> the East? Europe's <span class="highlight">maritime</span> tradition had developed in the <span class="highlight">context</span> of easily navigable seas-the <span class="highlight">Mediterranean</span>, the Baltic, and, to a lesser <span class="highlight">extent</span>, the North Sea between England and the <span class="highlight">Continent</span>-not of <span class="highlight">vast</span> oceans. New types of ships were needed, new methods of finding one's way, new techniques for financing so <span class="highlight">vast</span> a <span class="highlight">scheme</span>. <span class="question4">The <span class="highlight">sheer</span> <span class="highlight">scale</span> of the investment it took to begin <span class="highlight">commercial</span> <span class="highlight">expansion</span> at sea reflects the immensity of the profits that such East-West <span class="highlight">trade</span> could create.</span> <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>Spices were the most sought-after commodities. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>Spices not only <span class="highlight"><span class="question5">dramatically</span></span> improved the <span class="highlight">taste</span> of the European <span class="highlight">diet</span> but also were used to <span class="highlight">manufacture</span> perfumes and certain medicines. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>But <span class="highlight">even</span> high-priced commodities like spices had to be transported in large <span class="highlight">bulk</span> in order to <span class="highlight">justify</span> the expense and trouble of sailing around the African <span class="highlight">continent</span> all the way to India and China. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p>
          <p>The <span class="highlight">principal</span> seagoing ship used <span class="highlight">throughout</span> the Middle Ages was the galley, a long, low ship fitted with sails but driven <span class="highlight">primarily</span> by oars. The largest galleys had as many as 50 oarsmen. Since they had <span class="highlight">relatively</span> <span class="highlight">shallow</span> hulls, they were unstable when driven by sail or when on <span class="highlight">rough</span> water: hence they were unsuitable for the <span class="highlight">voyage</span> to the East. <span class="highlight">Even</span> if they hugged the African <span class="highlight">coastline</span>, they had little <span class="highlight">chance</span> of surviving a <span class="highlight">crossing</span> of the Indian Ocean. <span class="highlight">Shortly</span> after 1400, shipbuilders began developing a new type of <span class="highlight">vessel</span> properly designed to <span class="highlight">operate</span> in <span class="highlight">rough</span>, open water: the caravel. It had a wider and deeper <span class="highlight">hull</span> than the galley and hence could carry more cargo: increased <span class="highlight">stability</span> made it possible to add <span class="highlight">multiple</span> masts and sails. In the largest caravels, two main masts held large <span class="highlight">square</span> sails that provided the <span class="highlight">bulk</span> of the thrust driving the ship <span class="highlight">forward</span>, while a smaller <span class="highlight">forward</span> <span class="highlight">mast</span> held a triangular-shaped sail, called a lateen sail, which could be moved into a <span class="highlight">variety</span> of positions to <span class="highlight">maneuver</span> the ship.</p>
          <p>The astrolabe had long been the <span class="highlight">primary</span> <span class="highlight">instrument</span> for <span class="highlight">navigation</span>, having been introduced in the eleventh <span class="highlight">century</span>. It operated by measuring the height of the Sun and the fixed stars: by calculating the angles created by these points, it <span class="highlight">determined</span> the <span class="highlight">degree</span> of <span class="highlight">latitude</span> at which one stood (The problem of determining <span class="highlight">longitude</span>, though, was not solved until the eighteenth <span class="highlight">century</span>.) By the early thirteenth <span class="highlight">century</span>,Western Europeans had also <span class="question9">developed and put into use the <span class="highlight">magnetic</span> <span class="highlight">compass</span></span>, which helped when clouds obliterated both the Sun and the stars. Also beginning in the thirteenth <span class="highlight">century</span>, there were new maps <span class="highlight"><span class="question10">refined</span></span> by <span class="highlight">precise</span> calculations and the reports of sailors that made it possible to <span class="highlight">trace</span> one's <span class="highlight">path</span> with <span class="highlight">reasonable</span> <span class="highlight">accuracy</span>. Certain institutional and <span class="highlight">practical</span> <span class="question11">norms</span> had become established as well. A <span class="highlight">maritime</span> <span class="highlight">code</span> known as the <span class="highlight">Consulate</span> of the Sea, which originated in the western <span class="highlight">Mediterranean</span> <span class="highlight">region</span> in the fourteenth <span class="highlight">century</span>, won acceptance by a <span class="highlight">majority</span> of sea goers as the <span class="highlight">normative</span> <span class="highlight">code</span> for <span class="highlight">maritime</span> <span class="highlight">conduct</span>; it defined such matters as the <span class="highlight">authority</span> of a ship's officers, protocols of <span class="highlight">command</span>, <span class="highlight">pay</span> structures, the rights of sailors, and the rules of engagement when ships met one another on the sea-lanes. Thus by about 1400 the key elements were in place to enable Europe to begin its seaward <span class="highlight">adventure</span>.</p>

To see the beginning of this section, we began by saying that political factors have cut off land trade, so the answer is D.</p>

              <p>The subject of C rhetoric, the sentence where the rhetorical point is just simply to explain a fact, no view, look ahead, the previous sentence is an example, not a point of view, give up again, the first sentence is not the center sentence, so it does not work; the latter sentence is also An example is still wrong. If you think about this situation, isn't the whole paragraph an example, what is the support for the previous paragraph? The second paragraph emphasized technical difficulties. Then in the third paragraph it said that a new ship had been invented. This section said the use of astrolable, so it seems that the distance shows that technological progress makes maritime trade possible. So the answer is C. It is also possible to use the exclusion method. Both B and D are simply saying examples. They talk about things and they are not elected; A's original words are not stated; therefore, C is the answer, and from the second paragraph it has been said how to solve the technical problems of East-West trade, This is one of the technical issues.</p>
