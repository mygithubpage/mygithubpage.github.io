This <span class="highlight">development</span>, coming as it did when the bottom had fallen out of the European <span class="highlight">economy</span>, provided an <span class="highlight question1">impetus</span> to a long-held <span class="highlight">desire</span> to <span class="highlight">secure</span> direct relations with the East by establishing a sea <span class="highlight">trade</span>. Widely reported, if <span class="highlight">somewhat</span> distrusted, accounts by figures like the famous traveler from Venice, Marco Polo, of the willingness of people in China to <span class="highlight">trade</span> with Europeans and of the immensity of the wealth to be gained by such <span class="highlight">contact</span> made the idea <span class="highlight">irresistible</span>. Possibilities for <span class="highlight">trade</span> seemed <span class="highlight">promising</span>, but no hope existed for maintaining the <span class="highlight">traditional</span> routes over land. A new way had to be found.</p><p>The <span class="highlight">chief</span> problem was technological: How were the Europeans to <span class="highlight">reach</span> the East? Europe's <span class="highlight">maritime</span> tradition had developed in the <span class="highlight">context</span> of easily navigable seas-the <span class="highlight">Mediterranean</span>, the Baltic, and, to a lesser <span class="highlight">extent</span>, the North Sea between England and the <span class="highlight">Continent</span>-not of <span class="highlight">vast</span> oceans. New types of ships were needed, new methods of finding one's way, new techniques for financing so <span class="highlight">vast</span> a <span class="highlight">scheme</span>. <span class="question4">The <span class="highlight">sheer</span><span class="highlight">scale</span> of the investment it took to begin <span class="highlight">commercial</span><span class="highlight">expansion</span> at sea reflects the immensity of the profits that such East-West <span class="highlight">trade</span> could create.</span><span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>Spices were the most sought-after commodities. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>Spices not only <span class="highlight"><span class="question5">dramatically</span></span> improved the <span class="highlight">taste</span> of the European <span class="highlight">diet</span> but also were used to <span class="highlight">manufacture</span> perfumes and certain medicines. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>But <span class="highlight">even</span> high-priced commodities like spices had to be transported in large <span class="highlight">bulk</span> in order to <span class="highlight">justify</span> the expense and trouble of sailing around the African <span class="highlight">continent</span> all the way to India and China. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p><p>The <span class="highlight">principal</span> seagoing ship used <span class="highlight">throughout</span> the Middle Ages was the galley, a long, low ship fitted with sails but driven <span class="highlight">primarily</span> by oars. The largest galleys had as many as 50 oarsmen. Since they had <span class="highlight">relatively</span><span class="highlight">shallow</span> hulls, they were unstable when driven by sail or when on <span class="highlight">rough</span> water: hence they were unsuitable for the <span class="highlight">voyage</span> to the East. <span class="highlight">Even</span> if they hugged the African <span class="highlight">coastline</span>, they had little <span class="highlight">chance</span> of surviving a <span class="highlight">crossing</span> of the Indian Ocean. <span class="highlight">Shortly</span> after 1400, shipbuilders began developing a new type of <span class="highlight">vessel</span> properly designed to <span class="highlight">operate</span> in <span class="highlight">rough</span>, open water: the caravel. It had a wider and deeper <span class="highlight">hull</span> than the galley and hence could carry more cargo: increased <span class="highlight">stability</span> made it possible to add <span class="highlight">multiple</span> masts and sails. In the largest caravels, two main masts held large <span class="highlight">square</span> sails that provided the <span class="highlight">bulk</span> of the thrust driving the ship <span class="highlight">forward</span>, while a smaller <span class="highlight">forward</span><span class="highlight">mast</span> held a triangular-shaped sail, called a lateen sail, which could be moved into a <span class="highlight">variety</span> of positions to <span class="highlight">maneuver</span> the ship.</p><p>The astrolabe had long been the <span class="highlight">primary</span><span class="highlight">instrument</span> for <span class="highlight">navigation</span>, having been introduced in the eleventh <span class="highlight">century</span>. It operated by measuring the height of the Sun and the fixed stars: by calculating the angles created by these points, it <span class="highlight">determined</span> the <span class="highlight">degree</span> of <span class="highlight">latitude</span> at which one stood (The problem of determining <span class="highlight">longitude</span>, though, was not solved until the eighteenth <span class="highlight">century</span>.) By the early thirteenth <span class="highlight">century</span>,Western Europeans had also <span class="question9">developed and put into use the <span class="highlight">magnetic</span><span class="highlight">compass</span></span>, which helped when clouds obliterated both the Sun and the stars. Also beginning in the thirteenth <span class="highlight">century</span>, there were new maps <span class="highlight"><span class="question10">refined</span></span> by <span class="highlight">precise</span> calculations and the reports of sailors that made it possible to <span class="highlight">trace</span> one's <span class="highlight">path</span> with <span class="highlight">reasonable</span><span class="highlight">accuracy</span>. Certain institutional and <span class="highlight">practical</span><span class="question11">norms</span> had become established as well. A <span class="highlight">maritime</span><span class="highlight">code</span> known as the <span class="highlight">Consulate</span> of the Sea, which originated in the western <span class="highlight">Mediterranean</span><span class="highlight">region</span> in the fourteenth <span class="highlight">century</span>, won acceptance by a <span class="highlight">majority</span> of sea goers as the <span class="highlight">normative</span><span class="highlight">code</span> for <span class="highlight">maritime</span><span class="highlight">conduct</span>; it defined such matters as the <span class="highlight">authority</span> of a ship's officers, protocols of <span class="highlight">command</span>, <span class="highlight">pay</span> structures, the rights of sailors, and the rules of engagement when ships met one another on the sea-lanes. Thus by about 1400 the key elements were in place to enable Europe to begin its seaward <span class="highlight">adventure</span>.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word |impetus|in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Return</p><p>B. Opportunity</p><p>C. Stimulus</p><p>D. Obstacle</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C impetus: Promote, promote, and motivate. A is a reward, B is an opportunity, C is a promotion, D is a barrier. So C's stimulus is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 1 why was it necessary to find a new way for European merchants to reach the East?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. People in China were finally ready to trade with Europeans</p><p>B. The European economy was failing because there was no trade with the East</p><p>C. Traditional ways of trading with the East had become very costly</p><p>D. Commercial routes over land had become blocked because of political events</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D. From a new way to keyword positioning to the last sentence, this information is too few. In the past, the previous sentence said that it was impossible to maintain the traditional land trade, but still did not say why. At this time, the elimination method can be used. To see the beginning of this section, we began by saying that political factors have cut off land trade, so the answer is D.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 2, what was the main difficulty Europeans had to overcome in order to develop a new way of trading with the East?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Europeans were unwilling to invest in large-scale commercial ventures.</p><p>B. Europeans lacked the means for navigating long distances across oceans.</p><p>C. Europeans were unwilling to experiment with new business techniques.</p><p>D. Europeans lacked knowledge about the commercial methods of other peoples.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B. Using the keyword "main difficulty" to locate the first sentence, saying that the main problem is technical issues. How do Westerners reach the East, that is, navigational technology issues, and then they also say where the European traditional route is, so the answer is B. Europeans very much want to trade with Asians, so A and C's unwilling is wrong; D's commercial methods did not say.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The high cost to investors of developing trade by sea between East and West indicates the great size of the profits that such trade could produce.</p><p>B. The profits that could be created by sea trade between East and West were immense compared with the investment required to develop such trade.</p><p>C. The increase in commercial activity by using sea routes reflects the importance trade between East and West had for investors seeking great profits.</p><p>D. Because people made large investments in sea commerce between East and West. They expected to make immense profits.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The structure of A original sentence is scale reflecting the immensity of profits, that is, the scale of the investment reflects the scale of the benefit, so the answer is A. B's predicate changes, not comparing the two; C's subject and object are not right, and the original does not match; D's causal relationship is baffling.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word |<span class="question5">dramatically</span>|in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

A is artificially; B is greatly; C is immediately; D is conventionally. So the answer is B, indicating a great degree.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>It can be inferred from paragraph 2 that spices from Asia were desirable in Europe in the Middle Ages because they</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. were easily transported in large quantities</p><p>B. could not be produced in European countries</p><p>C. could be traded for products such as perfumes and medicines</p><p>D. were expected to increase in value over time</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B. With spice as the key word to the bottom three sentences, said that the most popular pepper can be used to do this, and then said that even high-priced peppers must be transported in large quantities to balance the high transportation costs. Since it is shipped, it shows that the local production, so the answer is B. A is it easy to transport the original text no information; C steals the original concept, the original text can be used to produce perfumes and medicines, not for trade; D value-added original did not say at all.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 3, all of the following statements comparing the caravel with the galley are true EXCEPT:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The caravel had fewer masts than the galley.</p><p>B. The caravel had a wider hull than the galley.</p><p>C. The caravel could carry more cargo than the galley.</p><p>D. The caravel was more stable in rough water than the galley.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A EXCEPT questions, exclusion method, A's masts keyword positioning to the last two sentences, said that caravel's mast is more than galley, so A said anti-, election; B's hull do keyword positioning to the penultimate sentence, said Caravel hul bigger and deeper, can hold more goods, B and C are correct, not selected; D's stable keyword positioning to the penultimate sentence, said increased stability, so D correct, not selected.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 3, what did the lateen sail contribute to the caravel as a sailing ship?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It provided stability for the front part of the ship.</p><p>B. It made it possible for the hull to be wider and deeper.</p><p>C. It added considerably to the speed of the wind-driven ship.</p><p>D. It improved the capacity of the ship to be guided.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D. Using the lateen sail as a key word to position the last sentence, said lateen sail can be moved to many locations to operate the ship, so the answer is D, guiding the ship's ability. Nothing else was said.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the author include the information that Western Europeans had |developed and put into use the magnetic compass|</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

To identify one of the technological advances that made sea trade with the East possible</p><p>D. To explain how the problem of determining longitude was solved</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The subject of C rhetoric, the sentence where the rhetorical point is just simply to explain a fact, no view, look ahead, the previous sentence is an example, not a point of view, give up again, the first sentence is not the center sentence, so it does not work; the latter sentence is also An example is still wrong. If you think about this situation, isn't the whole paragraph an example, what is the support for the previous paragraph? The second paragraph emphasized technical difficulties. Then in the third paragraph it said that a new ship had been invented. This section said the use of astrolable, so it seems that the distance shows that technological progress makes maritime trade possible. So the answer is C. It is also possible to use the exclusion method. Both B and D are simply saying examples. They talk about things and they are not elected; A's original words are not stated; therefore, C is the answer, and from the second paragraph it has been said how to solve the technical problems of East-West trade, This is one of the technical issues.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word |<span class="question10">refined</span>|in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.
