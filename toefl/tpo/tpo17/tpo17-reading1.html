            <b>Europe's Early Sea Trade with Asia</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>In the fourteenth <span class="underline">century</span>, a number of <span class="underline">political</span> developments cut Europe's overland <span class="underline">trade</span> routes to southern and eastern Asia, with which Europe had had important and highly <span class="underline">profitable</span> <span class="underline">commercial</span> ties since the twelfth <span class="underline">century</span>. This <span class="underline">development</span>, coming as it did when the bottom had fallen out of the European <span class="underline">economy</span>, provided an <span class="light"><span class="underline">impetus</span></span> to a long-held <span class="underline">desire</span> to <span class="underline">secure</span> direct relations with the East by establishing a sea <span class="underline">trade</span>. Widely reported, if <span class="underline">somewhat</span> distrusted, accounts by figures like the famous traveler from Venice, Marco Polo, of the willingness of people in China to <span class="underline">trade</span> with Europeans and of the immensity of the wealth to be gained by such <span class="underline">contact</span> made the idea <span class="underline">irresistible</span>. Possibilities for <span class="underline">trade</span> seemed <span class="underline">promising</span>, but no hope existed for maintaining the <span class="underline">traditional</span> routes over land. A new way had to be found.</p>
          <p>The <span class="underline">chief</span> problem was technological: How were the Europeans to <span class="underline">reach</span> the East? Europe's <span class="underline">maritime</span> tradition had developed in the <span class="underline">context</span> of easily navigable seas-the <span class="underline">Mediterranean</span>, the Baltic, and, to a lesser <span class="underline">extent</span>, the North Sea between England and the <span class="underline">Continent</span>-not of <span class="underline">vast</span> oceans. New types of ships were needed, new methods of finding one's way, new techniques for financing so <span class="underline">vast</span> a <span class="underline">scheme</span>. The <span class="underline">sheer</span> <span class="underline">scale</span> of the investment it took to begin <span class="underline">commercial</span> <span class="underline">expansion</span> at sea reflects the immensity of the profits that such East-West <span class="underline">trade</span> could create. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>Spices were the most sought-after commodities. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>Spices not only <span class="underline">dramatically</span> improved the <span class="underline">taste</span> of the European <span class="underline">diet</span> but also were used to <span class="underline">manufacture</span> perfumes and certain medicines. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>But <span class="underline">even</span> high-priced commodities like spices had to be transported in large <span class="underline">bulk</span> in order to <span class="underline">justify</span> the expense and trouble of sailing around the African <span class="underline">continent</span> all the way to India and China. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p>
          <p>The <span class="underline">principal</span> seagoing ship used <span class="underline">throughout</span> the Middle Ages was the galley, a long, low ship fitted with sails but driven <span class="underline">primarily</span> by oars. The largest galleys had as many as 50 oarsmen. Since they had <span class="underline">relatively</span> <span class="underline">shallow</span> hulls, they were unstable when driven by sail or when on <span class="underline">rough</span> water: hence they were unsuitable for the <span class="underline">voyage</span> to the East. <span class="underline">Even</span> if they hugged the African <span class="underline">coastline</span>, they had little <span class="underline">chance</span> of surviving a <span class="underline">crossing</span> of the Indian Ocean. <span class="underline">Shortly</span> after 1400, shipbuilders began developing a new type of <span class="underline">vessel</span> properly designed to <span class="underline">operate</span> in <span class="underline">rough</span>, open water: the caravel. It had a wider and deeper <span class="underline">hull</span> than the galley and hence could carry more cargo: increased <span class="underline">stability</span> made it possible to add <span class="underline">multiple</span> masts and sails. In the largest caravels, two main masts held large <span class="underline">square</span> sails that provided the <span class="underline">bulk</span> of the thrust driving the ship <span class="underline">forward</span>, while a smaller <span class="underline">forward</span> <span class="underline">mast</span> held a triangular-shaped sail, called a lateen sail, which could be moved into a <span class="underline">variety</span> of positions to <span class="underline">maneuver</span> the ship.</p>
          <p>The astrolabe had long been the <span class="underline">primary</span> <span class="underline">instrument</span> for <span class="underline">navigation</span>, having been introduced in the eleventh <span class="underline">century</span>. It operated by measuring the height of the Sun and the fixed stars: by calculating the angles created by these points, it <span class="underline">determined</span> the <span class="underline">degree</span> of <span class="underline">latitude</span> at which one stood (The problem of determining <span class="underline">longitude</span>, though, was not solved until the eighteenth <span class="underline">century</span>.) By the early thirteenth <span class="underline">century</span>,Western Europeans had also developed and put into use the <span class="underline">magnetic</span> <span class="underline">compass</span>, which helped when clouds obliterated both the Sun and the stars. Also beginning in the thirteenth <span class="underline">century</span>, there were new maps <span class="underline">refined</span> by <span class="underline">precise</span> calculations and the reports of sailors that made it possible to <span class="underline">trace</span> one's <span class="underline">path</span> with <span class="underline">reasonable</span> <span class="underline">accuracy</span>. Certain institutional and <span class="underline">practical</span> norms had become established as well. A <span class="underline">maritime</span> <span class="underline">code</span> known as the <span class="underline">Consulate</span> of the Sea, which originated in the western <span class="underline">Mediterranean</span> <span class="underline">region</span> in the fourteenth <span class="underline">century</span>, won acceptance by a <span class="underline">majority</span> of sea goers as the <span class="underline">normative</span> <span class="underline">code</span> for <span class="underline">maritime</span> <span class="underline">conduct</span>; it defined such matters as the <span class="underline">authority</span> of a ship's officers, protocols of <span class="underline">command</span>, <span class="underline">pay</span> structures, the rights of sailors, and the rules of engagement when ships met one another on the sea-lanes. Thus by about 1400 the key elements were in place to enable Europe to begin its seaward <span class="underline">adventure</span>.</p>
