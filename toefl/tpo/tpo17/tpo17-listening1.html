To get the professor's approval for his paper topic.</p><p>B. To ask for source material for his paper.</p><p>C. To ask the professor's opinion about a particular production of a Shakespeare play.</p><p>D. To get help finding articles about a play.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Professor: Yes, I like that.Straightforward and to the point.So how is the research going? Student: Well, that's what I came to talk to you about. I was wondering if you happen to have a copy of the Peter Brook production Of A Midsummer Night's Dream in your video collection. I've been looking for it everywhere and I am having a really hard time tracking it down.</p><p>The student said well, this is a sign, behind that's what I came to talk to you about, it clearly stated what he was going to say to the teacher. This question confused option D, but as long as you hear the video collection you can exclude D.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the subject of the man's paper</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The influence of film on theater.</p><p>B. The transient nature of theater.</p><p>C. Modern interpretations of a play by Shakespeare.</p><p>D. A comparison of different film versions of Shakespeare s plays.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Professor: OK, let's see. Right, Modern Staging of a Shakespearian Classic. Well, like I told you last week, I think that's a great topic for you paper. So the title would be something like ... uh ... OK, ..Right is a sign word. This sentence is at the beginning, so it is not very easy to determine the object of this sentence service. But immediately after listening, there appears topic for you paper, which echoes the subject in the question as the key to solving the problem.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>What do the speakers say about Peter Brook's production of A Midsummer Nights Dream?Click on 2 answers.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It influenced subsequent productions.</p><p>B. It was performed only a few times.</p><p>C. Written accounts of it are difficult to find.</p><p>D. Film versions of it probably do not exist.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="AD"><p>Professor:I mean at all. That particular production was never filmed or recorded. Student:Oh no. I had no idea. From what I read, that production, like, it influenced every other production of the play that came after it. So I just assumed it had been filmed or videotaped.</p><p>Professor:Oh,It definitely was a landmark production. And it's not like it ran for just a week, but either it was never filmed or if it was the film's been lost. And it's ironic because there's even a film about the making of the Production, but none of the production itself.</p><p>The teacher's answer to the student's question is likely to focus. An answer can be found in the teacher's answer. That particular production was never filmed or recorded is an interpretation of the meaning of at all. Note that never is a keyword. Another answer comes from students like to give examples and focus. Then I heard 1 minute and 17 seconds later and confused similarity with option B, but here it's not like it ran for just a week, so B's answer is wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What point does the professor make when she mentions that some students are writing about nineteenth- century productions of Shakespeare's plays?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Other students paper topics are even more difficult than the man's topic.</p><p>B. The man should refer to some nineteenth-century productions in his paper.</p><p>C. Students should focus their research on film adaptations of the plays.</p><p>D. Theater students often face the same problem the man is facing.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>Professor: That's it. Unless it's filmed, it's gone. But that doesn't mean we can't study it. And of course some students in this class are writing about productions in the 19th century, there are no videos of those. You Know,one of the challenges for people who study theater is to find way of talking about something that's really so transient,about something that, in a sense, doesn't exist.</p><p>You know the key words. The teacher said that one of the challenges faced by students studying drama is to discuss some things that are either instantaneous or non-existent. It can be seen that the boy's problemcan't study it is often encountered by students who study drama. So the teacher is comforting the boys. Don't worry. Many people are just like you.</p></div></div><div class="replay" id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor say this:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To point out that the topic of the student's paper has been covered before.</p><p>B. To convince the student to write about the production.</p><p>C. To persuade the student to change the topic of his paper.</p><p>D. To see if the student agrees with her opinion about the production.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Student:So now what do I do? If there is no video. Professor:Well, think about it. This is the most important 20th century staging of A Midsummer Night's Dream, right?</p><p>Why do teachers who ask questions say so? Then we will find what the students said before. Students feel helpless about not having video. The teacher's answer is "well, think about it,....most important...., right," stressing that this is the most important segment. It is clear that the teacher is persuading the student to continue to do this topic.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
