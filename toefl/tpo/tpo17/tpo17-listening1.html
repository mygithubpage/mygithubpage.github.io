              <span class="time" data-times="7.58" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to a <span class="underline">conversation</span> between a student and a professor.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.12" data-time="7.58">[00:07.58]</span>Professor: OK, let's see. <span class="time" data-times="4.28" data-time="12.7">[00:12.70]</span>Right, Modern Stagings of a Shakespearian <span class="underline">Classic</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.95" data-time="16.98">[00:16.98]</span>Well, like I told you last week, I think that's a great topic for your paper. <span class="time" data-times="3.17" data-time="22.93">[00:22.93]</span>So the title would be something like ... uh ...</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.58" data-time="26.1">[00:26.10]</span>Student: I am not really sure, probably something like 20th <span class="underline">century</span> stagings of A Midsummer Night's Dream.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.41" data-time="32.68">[00:32.68]</span>Professor: Yes, I like that. <span class="time" data-times="1.88" data-time="34.09">[00:34.09]</span>Straightforward and to the point. <span class="time" data-times="1.96" data-time="35.97">[00:35.97]</span>So how is the research going?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.38" data-time="37.93">[00:37.93]</span>Student: Well, that's what I came to talk to you about. <span class="time" data-times="6.74" data-time="40.31">[00:40.31]</span>I was wondering if you happen to have a copy of the Peter Brook production of A Midsummer Night's Dream in your video collection. <span class="time" data-times="5.16" data-time="47.05">[00:47.05]</span>I've been looking for it everywhere and I am having a really hard time tracking it down.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.65" data-time="52.21">[00:52.21]</span>Professor: that's because it doesn't exist.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.93" data-time="53.86">[00:53.86]</span>Student: You mean in your collection? Or at all?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.2" data-time="56.79">[00:56.79]</span>Professor: I mean at all. <span class="time" data-times="3.64" data-time="57.99">[00:57.99]</span>That <span class="underline">particular</span> production was never filmed or recorded.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.76" data-time="61.63">[01:01.63]</span>Student: Oh no. I had no idea. <span class="time" data-times="6.14" data-time="64.39">[01:04.39]</span>From what I read, that production, like, it influenced every other production of the play that came after it. <span class="time" data-times="3.66" data-time="70.53">[01:10.53]</span>So I just assumed it had been filmed or videotaped.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.43" data-time="74.19">[01:14.19]</span>Professor: Oh, It <span class="underline">definitely</span> was a <span class="underline">landmark</span> production. <span class="time" data-times="7.63" data-time="76.62">[01:16.62]</span>And it's not like it ran for just a week, but either it was never filmed or if it was the <span class="underline">film</span>'s been lost. <span class="time" data-times="6.37" data-time="84.25">[01:24.25]</span>And it's <span class="underline">ironic</span> because there's <span class="underline">even</span> a <span class="underline">film</span> about the making of the production, but none of the production itself.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.5" data-time="90.62">[01:30.62]</span>Student: So now what do I do? <span class="time" data-times="1.5" data-time="92.12">[01:32.12]</span>If there is no video.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.31" data-time="93.62">[01:33.62]</span>Professor: Well, think about it. <span class="time" data-times="5.22" data-time="94.93">[01:34.93]</span>This is the most important 20th <span class="underline">century</span> staging of A Midsummer Night's Dream, right?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.97" data-time="100.15">[01:40.15]</span>Student: But how can I write about Brook's <span class="underline">interpretation</span> of the play if I can't see his production.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.43" data-time="105.12">[01:45.12]</span>Professor: Just because there's no recording doesn't mean you can't <span class="underline">figure</span> out how it influenced other productions.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.02" data-time="110.55">[01:50.55]</span>Student: Yeah, I guess there's enough <span class="underline">material</span> around, but it will be a <span class="underline">challenge</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.62" data-time="115.57">[01:55.57]</span>Professor: True. But think about it, you are writing about <span class="underline">dramatic</span> arts, the theater, and that's the nature of theater, isn't it?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.71" data-time="123.19">[02:03.19]</span>Student: You mean because it is live, when the performance is finished ...</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.93" data-time="126.9">[02:06.90]</span>Professor: That's it. Unless it's filmed, it's gone. <span class="time" data-times="2.17" data-time="129.83">[02:09.83]</span>But that doesn't mean we can't study it. <span class="time" data-times="7" data-time="132">[02:12.00]</span>And of <span class="underline">course</span> some students in this class are writing about productions in the 19th <span class="underline">century</span>, there are no videos of those. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="139">[02:19.00]</span>You know, one of the challenges for people who study theater is to find way of talking about something that's really so <span class="underline">transient</span>, about something that, in a <span class="underline">sense</span>, doesn't exist.</p>
