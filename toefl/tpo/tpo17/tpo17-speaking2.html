One important purpose of cell-phone is that we can reach anyone at any time anywhere. If students' parents need to inform them of some important things and students don't have mobile phones with them, parents will have to come to the classroom or call others to reach the kids. This sounds pretty inconvenient in a modern age. On the other hand, simply bringing cell-phones into classroom won't disturb other students or interrupt the class. Students just need to turn their sound off and make the signal to vibration. And if they receive some urgent phone-calls, they can go out to reply.</p></article></section></main></body></html>
