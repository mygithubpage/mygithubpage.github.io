          <p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.22" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in a <span class="underline">history</span> class. <span class="time" data-times="5.05" data-time="5.22">[00:05.22]</span>The professor has been discussing <span class="underline">ancient</span> Egypt.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.08" data-time="10.27">[00:10.27]</span>Professor: Ok, so one of the challenges that faced <span class="underline">ancient</span> civilizations like Egypt was timekeeping, calendars. <span class="time" data-times="7.21" data-time="20.35">[00:20.35]</span>When you have to grow food for whole cities of people, it is important to plant your crops at the right time. <span class="time" data-times="8.31" data-time="27.56">[00:27.56]</span>And when you start having <span class="underline">financial</span> obligations, rents, taxes, you have to keep <span class="underline">track</span> of how often you <span class="underline">pay</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.43" data-time="35.87">[00:35.87]</span>So today we will look at how the Egyptians addressed these problems. <span class="time" data-times="15.02" data-time="41.3">[00:41.30]</span>In fact, they ended up using two different calendars, one to keep <span class="underline">track</span> of the natural world, or their <span class="underline">agriculture</span> concerns, and another one, that was used to keep <span class="underline">track</span> of the business functions of the <span class="underline">Kingdom</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.41" data-time="56.32">[00:56.32]</span>So let's take a look at the hows and whys of one <span class="underline">ancient</span> Egyptian <span class="underline">calendar</span> system, starting with the Nile River.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.98" data-time="64.73">[01:04.73]</span>Why the Nile? <span class="time" data-times="2.04" data-time="66.71">[01:06.71]</span>Well, there's no other way to put it. <span class="time" data-times="5.65" data-time="68.75">[01:08.75]</span>Egyptian life basically revolved around the <span class="underline">mysterious</span> rise and fall of the river. <span class="time" data-times="7.62" data-time="74.4">[01:14.40]</span>The success of their <span class="underline">agriculture</span> system depended upon them knowing when the river would change. <span class="time" data-times="13.09" data-time="82.02">[01:22.02]</span>So, naturally, their first <span class="underline">calendar</span> was divided up into three seasons, each based on the river's changes: <span class="underline">inundation</span>, subsidence and <span class="underline">harvest</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="12.72" data-time="95.11">[01:35.11]</span>The first <span class="underline">season</span> was the flooding, or <span class="underline">inundation</span>, when the Nile <span class="underline">valley</span> was <span class="underline">essentially</span> submerged in water for a few months or so. <span class="time" data-times="14.06" data-time="107.83">[01:47.83]</span>And afterwards during the <span class="underline">season</span> of subsidence, the water would subside, or <span class="underline">recede</span>, revealing a new <span class="underline">layer</span> of <span class="underline">fertile</span> black <span class="underline">silt</span> and allowing for the planting of various crops. <span class="time" data-times="12.34" data-time="121.89">[02:01.89]</span>And finally the time of the year would arrive when the <span class="underline">valley</span> would produce crops, such as wheat, barley, fruit, all ready to <span class="underline">harvest</span>. <span class="time" data-times="14.46" data-time="134.23">[02:14.23]</span>Ok, so it was important to the <span class="underline">ancient</span> Egyptians to know when their Nile based seasons would <span class="underline">occur</span>, their way of life depended upon it.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="15.78" data-time="148.69">[02:28.69]</span>Now, the way they used to <span class="underline">count</span> time was based on the phases of the moon, which, regularly and <span class="underline">predictably</span>, goes <span class="underline">through</span> a <span class="underline">cycle</span>, starting with a new moon, then to a full moon, and back again to the new moon. <span class="time" data-times="4.91" data-time="164.47">[02:44.47]</span>Now this <span class="underline">cycle</span> was then used to <span class="underline">determine</span> the length of their month. <span class="time" data-times="10.12" data-time="169.38">[02:49.38]</span>So, um, one <span class="underline">lunar</span> <span class="underline">cycle</span> was one Egyptian month, and about four of the months would <span class="underline">constitute</span> a <span class="underline">season</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.69" data-time="179.5">[02:59.50]</span>Now, 12 of these months was an <span class="underline">approximately</span> 354-day year. <span class="time" data-times="11.86" data-time="187.19">[03:07.19]</span>So they had a 354-day agricultural <span class="underline">calendar</span> that was designed to help them <span class="underline">determine</span> when the Nile would <span class="underline">inundate</span> the land.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.49" data-time="199.05">[03:19.05]</span>Well, of <span class="underline">course</span> it had to be more <span class="underline">complicated</span> than that. <span class="time" data-times="5.39" data-time="203.54">[03:23.54]</span>The <span class="underline">average</span> <span class="underline">amount</span> of time between floodings wasn't actually 354 days. <span class="time" data-times="6.92" data-time="208.93">[03:28.93]</span>I mean, although it varies, the <span class="underline">average</span> was clearly longer than 354 days. <span class="time" data-times="7.1" data-time="215.85">[03:35.85]</span>So how did they keep this short <span class="underline">calendar</span> in step with the actual flooding of the Nile?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.98" data-time="222.95">[03:42.95]</span>Well, their astronomers had discovered that at a certain time of year the brightest star, Sirius, would disappear. <span class="time" data-times="4.06" data-time="232.93">[03:52.93]</span>Actually, it'd be hidden in the <span class="underline">glare</span> of the Sun. <span class="time" data-times="9.24" data-time="236.99">[03:56.99]</span>And then, a <span class="underline">couple</span> of months later, one morning in the eastern sky just before <span class="underline">dawn</span>, Sirius would reappear. <span class="time" data-times="7.11" data-time="246.23">[04:06.23]</span>And it happened regularly, about every 365 days. <span class="time" data-times="8.77" data-time="253.34">[04:13.34]</span> <span class="underline">Even</span> more <span class="underline">significantly</span>, the reappearance of Sirius would <span class="underline">occur</span> around the same time as the Nile's flooding. <span class="time" data-times="5.29" data-time="262.11">[04:22.11]</span>And this <span class="underline">annual</span> event is called a heliacal rising.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.45" data-time="267.4">[04:27.40]</span>The heliacal rising was a <span class="underline">fair</span> indicator of when the Nile would flood. <span class="time" data-times="11.18" data-time="275.85">[04:35.85]</span>The next new moon, after the heliacal rising of Sirius, which happened in the last month of the <span class="underline">calendar</span> year, <span class="underline">marked</span> the New Year. <span class="time" data-times="20.07" data-time="287.03">[04:47.03]</span>And because the <span class="underline">ancient</span> Egyptians were using the <span class="underline">lunar</span> <span class="underline">cycle</span> in <span class="underline">combination</span> with this heliacal rising, some years ended up having 12 <span class="underline">lunar</span> months, while others had 13 <span class="underline">lunar</span> <span class="underline">calendar</span> months, if Sirius didn't rise in the 12th month.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="13.42" data-time="307.1">[05:07.10]</span>
              <span class="underline">Even</span> though the length of the agricultural <span class="underline">calendar</span> still fluctuated, with some years having 12 months and others having 13, it ended up being much more <span class="underline">reliable</span> than it was before. <span class="time" data-times="9.93" data-time="320.52">[05:20.52]</span>They continually adjusted it to the heliacal rising of Sirius, ensuring that they never got too far off in their seasons. <span class="time" data-times="11.13" data-time="330.45">[05:30.45]</span>This new <span class="underline">calendar</span> was <span class="underline">ideal</span>, because, well, it worked well for agricultural purposes as well as for knowing when to have <span class="underline">traditional</span> <span class="underline">religious</span> festivals. <span class="time" data-times="4.27" data-time="341.58">[05:41.58]</span>So, that was their first <span class="underline">calendar</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.07" data-time="345.85">[05:45.85]</span>But was it any way to run a <span class="underline">government</span>? <span class="time" data-times="1.83" data-time="351.92">[05:51.92]</span>They didn't think so. <span class="time" data-times="8.36" data-time="353.75">[05:53.75]</span>For administrative purposes, it was very <span class="underline">inconvenient</span> to have years of different lengths. <span class="time" data-times="4.65" data-time="362.11">[06:02.11]</span>So another <span class="underline">calendar</span> was introduced, an administrative one. <span class="time" data-times="17.16" data-time="366.76">[06:06.76]</span>Probably soon after 3,000 BC, they declared a 365-day year, with 12 months per year, with exactly 30 days each month, with an <span class="underline">extra</span> 5 days at the end of each year.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="12.24" data-time="383.92">[06:23.92]</span>This administrative <span class="underline">calendar</span> existed alongside the earlier agricultural and <span class="underline">religious</span> <span class="underline">calendar</span> that depended on the heliacal rising of Sirius. <span class="time" data-times="11.5" data-time="396.16">[06:36.16]</span>This administrative <span class="underline">calendar</span> was much easier to use for things like scheduling taxes and other things that had to be paid on time. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="407.66">[06:47.66]</span>Over time, the <span class="underline">calendar</span> got out of step with seasons and the flooding of the Nile, but for bureaucratic purposes, they didn't <span class="underline">mind</span>.</p>
