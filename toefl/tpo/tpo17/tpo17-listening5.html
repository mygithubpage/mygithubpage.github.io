            <span class="time" data-times="5.22" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in a <span class="highlight">history</span> class. <span class="time" data-times="5.05" data-time="5.22">[00:05.22]</span>The professor has been discussing <span class="highlight">ancient</span> Egypt.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="10.08" data-time="10.27">[00:10.27]</span>Professor: Ok, so one of the challenges that faced <span class="highlight">ancient</span> civilizations like Egypt was timekeeping, calendars. <span class="time" data-times="7.21" data-time="20.35">[00:20.35]</span>When you have to grow food for whole cities of people, it is important to plant your crops at the right time. <span class="time" data-times="8.31" data-time="27.56">[00:27.56]</span>And when you start having <span class="highlight">financial</span> obligations, rents, taxes, you have to keep <span class="highlight">track</span> of how often you <span class="highlight">pay</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.43" data-time="35.87">[00:35.87]</span>So today we will look at how the Egyptians addressed these problems. <span class="time" data-times="15.02" data-time="41.3">[00:41.30]</span>In fact, they ended up using two different calendars, one to keep <span class="highlight">track</span> of the natural world, or their <span class="highlight">agriculture</span> concerns, and another one, that was used to keep <span class="highlight">track</span> of the business functions of the <span class="highlight">Kingdom</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.41" data-time="56.32">[00:56.32]</span>So let's take a look at the hows and whys of one <span class="highlight">ancient</span> Egyptian <span class="highlight">calendar</span> system, starting with the Nile River.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.98" data-time="64.73">[01:04.73]</span>Why the Nile? <span class="time" data-times="2.04" data-time="66.71">[01:06.71]</span>Well, there's no other way to put it. <span class="time" data-times="5.65" data-time="68.75">[01:08.75]</span>Egyptian life basically revolved around the <span class="highlight">mysterious</span> rise and fall of the river. <span class="time" data-times="7.62" data-time="74.4">[01:14.40]</span>The success of their <span class="highlight">agriculture</span> system depended upon them knowing when the river would change. <span class="time" data-times="13.09" data-time="82.02">[01:22.02]</span>So, naturally, their first <span class="highlight">calendar</span> was divided up into three seasons, each based on the river's changes: <span class="highlight">inundation</span>, subsidence and <span class="highlight">harvest</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="12.72" data-time="95.11">[01:35.11]</span>The first <span class="highlight">season</span> was the flooding, or <span class="highlight">inundation</span>, when the Nile <span class="highlight">valley</span> was <span class="highlight">essentially</span> submerged in water for a few months or so. <span class="time" data-times="14.06" data-time="107.83">[01:47.83]</span>And afterwards during the <span class="highlight">season</span> of subsidence, the water would subside, or <span class="highlight">recede</span>, revealing a new <span class="highlight">layer</span> of <span class="highlight">fertile</span> black <span class="highlight">silt</span> and allowing for the planting of various crops. <span class="time" data-times="12.34" data-time="121.89">[02:01.89]</span>And finally the time of the year would arrive when the <span class="highlight">valley</span> would produce crops, such as wheat, barley, fruit, all ready to <span class="highlight">harvest</span>. <span class="time" data-times="14.46" data-time="134.23">[02:14.23]</span>Ok, so it was important to the <span class="highlight">ancient</span> Egyptians to know when their Nile based seasons would <span class="highlight">occur</span>, their way of life depended upon it.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="15.78" data-time="148.69">[02:28.69]</span>Now, the way they used to <span class="highlight">count</span> time was based on the phases of the moon, which, regularly and <span class="highlight">predictably</span>, goes <span class="highlight">through</span> a <span class="highlight">cycle</span>, starting with a new moon, then to a full moon, and back again to the new moon. <span class="time" data-times="4.91" data-time="164.47">[02:44.47]</span>Now this <span class="highlight">cycle</span> was then used to <span class="highlight">determine</span> the length of their month. <span class="time" data-times="10.12" data-time="169.38">[02:49.38]</span>So, um, one <span class="highlight">lunar</span> <span class="highlight">cycle</span> was one Egyptian month, and about four of the months would <span class="highlight">constitute</span> a <span class="highlight">season</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.69" data-time="179.5">[02:59.50]</span>Now, 12 of these months was an <span class="highlight">approximately</span> 354-day year. <span class="time" data-times="11.86" data-time="187.19">[03:07.19]</span>So they had a 354-day agricultural <span class="highlight">calendar</span> that was designed to help them <span class="highlight">determine</span> when the Nile would <span class="highlight">inundate</span> the land.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.49" data-time="199.05">[03:19.05]</span>Well, of <span class="highlight">course</span> it had to be more <span class="highlight">complicated</span> than that. <span class="time" data-times="5.39" data-time="203.54">[03:23.54]</span>The <span class="highlight">average</span> <span class="highlight">amount</span> of time between floodings wasn't actually 354 days. <span class="time" data-times="6.92" data-time="208.93">[03:28.93]</span>I mean, although it varies, the <span class="highlight">average</span> was clearly longer than 354 days. <span class="time" data-times="7.1" data-time="215.85">[03:35.85]</span>So how did they keep this short <span class="highlight">calendar</span> in step with the actual flooding of the Nile?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="9.98" data-time="222.95">[03:42.95]</span>Well, their astronomers had discovered that at a certain time of year the brightest star, Sirius, would disappear. <span class="time" data-times="4.06" data-time="232.93">[03:52.93]</span>Actually, it'd be hidden in the <span class="highlight">glare</span> of the Sun. <span class="time" data-times="9.24" data-time="236.99">[03:56.99]</span>And then, a <span class="highlight">couple</span> of months later, one morning in the eastern sky just before <span class="highlight">dawn</span>, Sirius would reappear. <span class="time" data-times="7.11" data-time="246.23">[04:06.23]</span>And it happened regularly, about every 365 days. <span class="time" data-times="8.77" data-time="253.34">[04:13.34]</span> <span class="highlight">Even</span> more <span class="highlight">significantly</span>, the reappearance of Sirius would <span class="highlight">occur</span> around the same time as the Nile's flooding. <span class="time" data-times="5.29" data-time="262.11">[04:22.11]</span>And this <span class="highlight">annual</span> event is called a heliacal rising.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="8.45" data-time="267.4">[04:27.40]</span>The heliacal rising was a <span class="highlight">fair</span> indicator of when the Nile would flood. <span class="time" data-times="11.18" data-time="275.85">[04:35.85]</span>The next new moon, after the heliacal rising of Sirius, which happened in the last month of the <span class="highlight">calendar</span> year, <span class="highlight">marked</span> the New Year. <span class="time" data-times="20.07" data-time="287.03">[04:47.03]</span>And because the <span class="highlight">ancient</span> Egyptians were using the <span class="highlight">lunar</span> <span class="highlight">cycle</span> in <span class="highlight">combination</span> with this heliacal rising, some years ended up having 12 <span class="highlight">lunar</span> months, while others had 13 <span class="highlight">lunar</span> <span class="highlight">calendar</span> months, if Sirius didn't rise in the 12th month.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="13.42" data-time="307.1">[05:07.10]</span>
            <span class="highlight">Even</span> though the length of the agricultural <span class="highlight">calendar</span> still fluctuated, with some years having 12 months and others having 13, it ended up being much more <span class="highlight">reliable</span> than it was before. <span class="time" data-times="9.93" data-time="320.52">[05:20.52]</span>They continually adjusted it to the heliacal rising of Sirius, ensuring that they never got too far off in their seasons. <span class="time" data-times="11.13" data-time="330.45">[05:30.45]</span>This new <span class="highlight">calendar</span> was <span class="highlight">ideal</span>, because, well, it worked well for agricultural purposes as well as for knowing when to have <span class="highlight">traditional</span> <span class="highlight">religious</span> festivals. <span class="time" data-times="4.27" data-time="341.58">[05:41.58]</span>So, that was their first <span class="highlight">calendar</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.07" data-time="345.85">[05:45.85]</span>But was it any way to run a <span class="highlight">government</span>? <span class="time" data-times="1.83" data-time="351.92">[05:51.92]</span>They didn't think so. <span class="time" data-times="8.36" data-time="353.75">[05:53.75]</span>For administrative purposes, it was very <span class="highlight">inconvenient</span> to have years of different lengths. <span class="time" data-times="4.65" data-time="362.11">[06:02.11]</span>So another <span class="highlight">calendar</span> was introduced, an administrative one. <span class="time" data-times="17.16" data-time="366.76">[06:06.76]</span>Probably soon after 3,000 BC, they declared a 365-day year, with 12 months per year, with exactly 30 days each month, with an <span class="highlight">extra</span> 5 days at the end of each year.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="12.24" data-time="383.92">[06:23.92]</span>This administrative <span class="highlight">calendar</span> existed alongside the earlier agricultural and <span class="highlight">religious</span> <span class="highlight">calendar</span> that depended on the heliacal rising of Sirius. <span class="time" data-times="11.5" data-time="396.16">[06:36.16]</span>This administrative <span class="highlight">calendar</span> was much easier to use for things like scheduling taxes and other things that had to be paid on time. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="407.66">[06:47.66]</span>Over time, the <span class="highlight">calendar</span> got out of step with seasons and the flooding of the Nile, but for bureaucratic purposes, they didn't <span class="highlight">mind</span>.</p>

              <p>Why the Nile? Well, there's no other way to put it. Egyptian life basically revolved around the mysterious rise and fall of the river. The success of their agriculture system depended upon them knowing when the river would change. So, naturally, their first Calendar was divided up into three seasons, each based on the river 's changes: inundation, subsidence and harvest</p>
              <p>Position Nile River. Note why, Well sign word. Then go back to the names of the three seasons. Inundation, subsidence and harvest. The example given by the professors for the three seasons is to illustrate the relationship between the Nile and the calendar and to show that the Nile has a tremendous influence on the survival of Egyptian life. This question can also be made using exclusions.</p>

              <p>The next new moon, after the heliacal rising of Sirius, which happened in the last month of the calendar year, marked the New Year even more significantly, the reappearance of Sirius would occur around the same time as the Nile's flooding. Even more meaningful There are important points here. There are two points here, one is: heliacal rising is the sign of the flooding of the Nile. The other is that after the heliacal rising, that is, the next new moon, the arrival of the new year.</p>

              <p>And because the ancient Egyptians were using the lunar cycle in combination with this heliacal rising, some years ended up having 12 lunar months, while others had 13 lunar calender months, if Sirius didn't rise in the 12th month</p>
              <p>Even though is a key word, the turning point is that Egyptians have been adjusting annual months based on heliacal rising of Sirius to ensure that each season does not deviate too far. So answer D.</p>
