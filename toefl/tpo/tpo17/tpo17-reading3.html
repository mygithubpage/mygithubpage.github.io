There are three main types of symbiotic relationships: parasitism, commensalism, and <span class="highlight">mutualism</span>. The first and the third can be key factors in the structure of a biological <span class="highlight">community</span>; that is, all the populations of organisms living together and potentially interacting in a <span class="highlight">particular</span> area.</p><p>Parasitism is a kind of predator-prey relationship in which one <span class="highlight">organism</span>, the <span class="highlight">parasite</span>, <span class="question2">derives</span> its food at the expense of its symbiotic <span class="highlight">associate</span>, the <span class="highlight">host</span>. Parasites are usually smaller than their hosts. An example of a <span class="highlight">parasite</span> is a tapeworm that lives inside the intestines of a larger animal and absorbs nutrients from its <span class="highlight">host</span>. Natural <span class="highlight">selection</span> favors the parasites that are best able to find and feed on hosts. At the same time, <span class="highlight">defensive</span> abilities of hosts are also selected for. As an example, plants make chemicals <span class="highlight">toxic</span> to <span class="highlight">fungal</span> and <span class="highlight">bacterial</span> parasites, <span class="highlight">along</span> with ones <span class="highlight">toxic</span> to <span class="highlight">predatory</span> animals (sometimes they are the same chemicals). In vertebrates, the <span class="highlight">immune</span> system provides a <span class="highlight">multiple</span><span class="highlight">defense</span> against <span class="highlight">internal</span> parasites.</p><p>At times, it is actually possible to watch the effects of natural <span class="highlight">selection</span> in host-parasite relationships. For example, Australia during the 1940 s was overrun by hundreds of 
millions of European rabbits. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>The rabbits destroyed huge expanses of Australia and threatened the sheep and <span class="highlight">cattle</span> industries. 
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> In 1950, myxoma <span class="highlight">virus</span>, a <span class="highlight">parasite</span> that affects rabbits, 
was <span class="highlight">deliberately</span> introduced into Australia to control the rabbit <span class="highlight">population</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span><span class="highlight">Spread</span> rapidly by mosquitoes, the <span class="highlight">virus</span><span class="question4">devastated</span> the rabbit <span class="highlight">population</span>.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>The <span class="highlight">virus</span> was less <span class="highlight">deadly</span> to the <span class="highlight">offspring</span> of surviving rabbits, however, and it caused less and less harm over the years. Apparently, genotypes (the <span class="highlight">genetic</span> make-up of an <span class="highlight">organism</span>) 
in the rabbit <span class="highlight">population</span> were selected that were better able to <span class="highlight">resist</span> the <span class="highlight">parasite</span>. Meanwhile, the deadliest strains of the <span class="highlight">virus</span> perished with their hosts as natural <span class="highlight">selection</span><span class="highlight">favored</span> 
strains that could infect hosts but not kill them. Thus, natural <span class="highlight">selection</span> stabilized this host-parasite relationship.</p><p>In <span class="highlight">contrast</span> to parasitism, in commensalism, one partner benefits without <span class="highlight">significantly</span> affecting the other. Few cases of <span class="highlight">absolute</span> commensalism probably exist, because it is <span class="highlight">unlikely</span> that one of the partners will be completely unaffected. <span class="highlight">Commensal</span> associations sometimes <span class="highlight">involve</span> one <span class="highlight">species</span>' obtaining food that is <span class="highlight"><span class="question7">inadvertently</span></span><span class="highlight">exposed</span> by another. For <span class="highlight">instance</span>, several kinds of birds feed on insects flushed out of the grass by <span class="highlight">grazing</span><span class="highlight">cattle</span>. It is difficult to imagine how this could <span class="highlight">affect</span> the <span class="highlight">cattle</span>, but the relationship may help or <span class="highlight">hinder</span> them in some way not yet recognized.</p><p>The third type of symbiosis, <span class="highlight">mutualism</span>, benefits both partners in the relationship Legume plants and their nitrogen-fixing <span class="highlight">bacteria</span>, and the interactions between flowering plants and their pollinators, are examples of <span class="highlight">mutualistic</span><span class="highlight">association</span>. In the first case, the plants provide the <span class="highlight">bacteria</span> with carbohydrates and other <span class="highlight">organic</span> compounds, and the <span class="highlight">bacteria</span> have enzymes that act as catalysts that <span class="highlight">eventually</span> add <span class="highlight">nitrogen</span> to the soil, enriching it. <span class="question9">In the <span class="highlight">second</span> case, pollinators (insects, birds) <span class="highlight">obtain</span> food from the flowering plant, and the plant has its <span class="highlight">pollen</span> distributed and seeds dispersed much more efficiently than they would be if they were carried by the wind only.</span> Another example of <span class="highlight">mutualism</span> would be the bull's <span class="highlight">horn</span> acacia tree, which grows in Central and South America. The tree provides a place to live for ants of the <span class="highlight"><span class="highlight"><span class="highlight">genus</span></span></span> Pseudomyrmex. The ants live in large, <span class="highlight">hollow</span> thorns and eat sugar secreted by the tree. The ants also eat yellow structures at the tip of leaflets: these are <span class="highlight">protein</span> rich and <span class="highlight">seem</span> to have no <span class="highlight">function</span> for the tree except to <span class="highlight">attract</span> ants. The ants <span class="highlight">benefit</span> the <span class="highlight">host</span> tree by attacking <span class="highlight">virtually</span> anything that touches it. They <span class="highlight">sting</span> other insects and large herbivores (animals that eat only plants) and <span class="highlight">even</span> clip surrounding <span class="highlight">vegetation</span> that grows near the tree. When the ants are removed, the trees usually die, probably because herbivores damage them so much that they are unable to <span class="highlight">compete</span> with surrounding <span class="highlight">vegetation</span> for light and growing <span class="highlight">space</span>.</p><p>The <span class="highlight">complex</span><span class="highlight">interplay</span> of <span class="highlight">species</span> in symbiotic relationships <span class="question11">highlights</span> an important point about communities: Their structure depends on a web of <span class="highlight">diverse</span> connections among organisms.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the following statements about commensalism can be inferred from paragraph 1?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It excludes interactions between more than two species.</p><p>B. It makes it less likely for species within a community to survive.</p><p>C. Its significance to the organization of biological communities is small.</p><p>D. Its role in the structure of biological populations is a disruptive one.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C. With commensalism as the key word to the second sentence, there are three types. The first and the third are very important. According to the comparison, the second commensalism is not important, so the answer is C.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word |<span class="question2">derives</span>|in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Digests</p><p>B. Obtains</p><p>C. Controls</p><p>D. Discovers</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B derive: Originated from, derived from. A is digestion; B is obtained; C is control; D is found. So the correct answer is B's obtain.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 2. which of the following is true of the action of natural selection on hosts and parasites?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Hosts benefit more from natural selection than parasites do.</p><p>B. Both aggression in predators and defensive capacities in hosts are favored for species survival.</p><p>C. The ability to make toxic chemicals enables a parasite to find and isolate its host.</p><p>D. Larger size equips a parasite to prey on smaller host organisms.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Natural selection is the key word to the third sentence: Natural selection favors the parasites that are able able to find and feed on hosts. At the same time, defensive abilities of hosts are also selected for. It is easy to find the parasite of the host and also choose the host's defense ability, so the answer is B. There is no relevant information about the comparison of A, the toxic material and isolate of C, and the size of D.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word |<span class="question4">devastated</span>|in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Influenced</p><p>B. Infected</p><p>C. strengthened</p><p>D. destroyed</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D devastate: Destruction. A is the effect; B is the infection; C is the reinforcement; D is the destruction. So D's destroy is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the following can be concluded from the discussion in paragraph 3 about the Australian rabbit population?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Human intervention may alter the host, the parasite. and the relationship between them.</p><p>B. The risks of introducing outside organisms into a biological community are not worth the benefits.</p><p>C. Humans should not interfere in host-parasite relationships.</p><p>D. Organisms that survive a parasitic attack do so in spite of the natural selection process.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>Question A asks what conclusion rabbit experiment has drawn. First find a rabbit experiment and find that rabbit experiment is an example of human intervention in natural selection. But don't look at the content of the experiment in too much detail, because the question is a conclusion, so the first and last sentences are concerned. . The first sentence says that the influence of natural selection on parasitism can be foreseen; while in the last sentence, natural selection stabilizes the parasitism, and after the human intervention described in the example, the parasite relationship finally settled by human intervention through natural selection. So the answer is A. Humans can change the parasitic relationship; the original does not compare the advantages and disadvantages of the imported organisms, and B is wrong; and there is no way for the author to refer to the attitudes of the imported organisms. C is wrong; D did not say either.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 3, all of the following characterize the way natural selection stabilized the Australian rabbit population EXCEPT:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The most toxic viruses died with their hosts.</p><p>B. The surviving rabbits were increasingly immune to the virus.</p><p>C. The decline of the mosquito population caused the spread of the virus to decline.</p><p>D. Rabbits with specific genetic make-ups were favored.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C EXCEPT questions, exclusion, A most toxic viruses do keyword positioning to the last sentence deadliest strains of the virus, so A correct, not selected; B surviving rabbits do keyword positioning to the penultimate sentence, correct , Do not select; C mosquito population to do keyword positioning to the fifth sentence, with nothing to say about the options, so C wrong, election; D genetic make-up keyword positioning to the penultimate sentence, so D correct, Do not choose.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word |<span class="question7">inadvertently</span>|in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Indefensibly</p><p>B. Substantially</p><p>C. Unintentionally</p><p>D. Partially</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C <span class="question7">inadvertently</span>: Unintentionally, <span class="question7">inadvertently</span>. A is undefended; B is substantially, substantially; C is unintentionally; D is partially, partial. So the correct answer is C's unintentionally.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 5, the relationship between legumes and bacteria benefits the soil by</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. adding enriching carbohydrates</p><p>B. speeding the decay of organic matter</p><p>C. destroying enzymes that pollute it</p><p>D. contributing nitrogen to it</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D. Position the word legume, bacteria, and soil as the key words to the second sentence, saying that plants provide organisms with bacteria, and the enzymes in the bacteria can add nitrogen to the soil as a catalyst. So the answer is D, and nothing else.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The relationship between flowering plants and pollinators provides pollinators with food and flowers with efficient reproduction.</p><p>B. In some cases birds obtain food from the seeds that are dispersed in the wind.</p><p>C. The wind not only helps the flowers distribute their seeds but enables birds to find more food.</p><p>D. Animals and insects are more effective in distributing pollen and seeds than the wind.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The structure of the original sentence is a pollinator and plant mutual benefit, so the correct answer is A. B confuses the concept that the pollinator does not eat the seed; C also confuses the concept, not the wind thing; D just said that the plant benefits from it, did not say the benefit of the pollinator, lacked important information, and was wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 5. which of the following is NOT true of the relationship between the bull's horn acacia tree and the Pseudomyrmex ants?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Ants defend the host trees against the predatory actions of insects and animals.</p><p>B. The acacia trees are a valuable source of nutrition for the ants.</p><p>C. The ants enable the acacia tree to produce its own chemical defenses.</p><p>D. The ants protect the acacia from having to compete with surrounding vegetation.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C EXCEPT questions, exclusions, A's predatory actions and insects and animals keywords positioning to the penultimate sentence, so A correct, not selected; B nutrition do keyword positioning to the fourth sentence of the last sentence protein rich, correct, Not selected; C's chemical defenses in the original text does not have a corresponding point C wrong, selected; D's surrounding vegetation does keyword positioning to the last sentence, so D is correct, not selected</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word |<span class="question11">highlights</span>|in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Defines</p><p>B. Emphasizes</p><p>C. Reflects</p><p>D. Suggests</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B: highlight: Emphasize, highlight. A is the definition; B is the emphasis; C is the response; D is the suggestion. So B's emphasize is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the main purpose of this passage?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To explain the concept of symbiosis by expanded descriptions of its principal types</p><p>B. To make a comparison between human relationships and symbiotic interactions in the natural world</p><p>C. To demonstrate the unforeseen benefits of natural processes that at first seem wholly destructive</p><p>D. To argue that parasitism is a problem that can be solved by scientific intervention</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A, what is the purpose of the entire article, so we should pay attention to the central sentence of each paragraph. The first paragraph of the article states that there are many types of symbiotic relationships. Then there are several categories of symbiotic relationships, which are divided into several segments. So the answer is A. Categories describe concepts. B is wrong, not natural and human; neither C nor D is the full text.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>This massive population began a century earlier as a mere twelve pairs of imported rabbits that reproduced quickly and developed into a major problem..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A Three transition points, pronouns this, massive population and noun problems. Note that simply looking for population does not work, because the sentence to be inserted specifically emphasizes a large number of populations, corresponding to the hundreds of millions of European rabbits before the A option, and the pronoun should indicate that there should be a noun before the answer, so the answer is A.</p></div></div><div id="question14" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>Symbiotic relationships involve the interaction of two or more organisms acting as partners.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.Parasitic relationships involve the interplay of aggression by the parasite and resistance and adaptation by the host.</p><p>B.Mutualism ordinarily involves an interaction between two members of the same species.</p><p>C.Mutualism is unique among symbiotic relationships in that it r benefits both partners involved in the relationship.</p><p>D.Parasitic damage to Australian rabbits was never reversed because the rabbits were unable to adapt to the parasites' attacks.</p><p>E.The rarity of commensal relationships stems from the difficulty of finding relationships that benefit one species without affecting the other.</p><p>F.The structure of biological communities depends on the types of relationships that exist among the species within.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="ACE"><p>The ACE Parasitic relationships option corresponds to the second paragraph of the original text. The correct species parameter of the Mutualism ordinarily option is not stated. The item Mutualism is not selected to correspond to the first sentence of the fifth paragraph. The correct Parasitic damage option is opposed to the third sentence of the third paragraph. And even if it is a detail, the second choice of the rarity option does not correspond to the fourth paragraph of the original text. The correct among species of the structure option is different from the last paragraph of the original text. The last paragraph is the among organism.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
