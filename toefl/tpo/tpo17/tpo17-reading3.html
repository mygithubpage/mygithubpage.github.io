            <b>Symbiotic Relationships</b>
          </h4>
          <p>A symbiotic relationship is an <span class="highlight">interaction</span> between two or more <span class="highlight">species</span> in which one <span class="highlight">species</span> lives in or on another <span class="highlight">species</span>. There are three main types of symbiotic relationships: parasitism, commensalism, and <span class="highlight">mutualism</span>. The first and the third can be key factors in the structure of a biological <span class="highlight">community</span>; that is, all the populations of organisms living together and potentially interacting in a <span class="highlight">particular</span> area.</p>
          <p>Parasitism is a kind of predator-prey relationship in which one <span class="highlight">organism</span>, the <span class="highlight">parasite</span>, <span class="question2">derives</span> its food at the expense of its symbiotic <span class="highlight">associate</span>, the <span class="highlight">host</span>. Parasites are usually smaller than their hosts. An example of a <span class="highlight">parasite</span> is a tapeworm that lives inside the intestines of a larger animal and absorbs nutrients from its <span class="highlight">host</span>. Natural <span class="highlight">selection</span> favors the parasites that are best able to find and feed on hosts. At the same time, <span class="highlight">defensive</span> abilities of hosts are also selected for. As an example, plants make chemicals <span class="highlight">toxic</span> to <span class="highlight">fungal</span> and <span class="highlight">bacterial</span> parasites, <span class="highlight">along</span> with ones <span class="highlight">toxic</span> to <span class="highlight">predatory</span> animals (sometimes they are the same chemicals). In vertebrates, the <span class="highlight">immune</span> system provides a <span class="highlight">multiple</span> <span class="highlight">defense</span> against <span class="highlight">internal</span> parasites.</p>
          <p>At times, it is actually possible to watch the effects of natural <span class="highlight">selection</span> in host-parasite relationships. For example, Australia during the 1940 s was overrun by hundreds of 
millions of European rabbits. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>The rabbits destroyed huge expanses of Australia and threatened the sheep and <span class="highlight">cattle</span> industries. 
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> In 1950, myxoma <span class="highlight">virus</span>, a <span class="highlight">parasite</span> that affects rabbits, 
was <span class="highlight">deliberately</span> introduced into Australia to control the rabbit <span class="highlight">population</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span> <span class="highlight">Spread</span> rapidly by mosquitoes, the <span class="highlight">virus</span> <span class="question4">devastated</span> the rabbit <span class="highlight">population</span>.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>The <span class="highlight">virus</span> was less <span class="highlight">deadly</span> to the <span class="highlight">offspring</span> of surviving rabbits, however, and it caused less and less harm over the years. Apparently, genotypes (the <span class="highlight">genetic</span> make-up of an <span class="highlight">organism</span>) 
in the rabbit <span class="highlight">population</span> were selected that were better able to <span class="highlight">resist</span> the <span class="highlight">parasite</span>. Meanwhile, the deadliest strains of the <span class="highlight">virus</span> perished with their hosts as natural <span class="highlight">selection</span> <span class="highlight">favored</span> 
strains that could infect hosts but not kill them. Thus, natural <span class="highlight">selection</span> stabilized this host-parasite relationship.</p>
          <p>In <span class="highlight">contrast</span> to parasitism, in commensalism, one partner benefits without <span class="highlight">significantly</span> affecting the other. Few cases of <span class="highlight">absolute</span> commensalism probably exist, because it is <span class="highlight">unlikely</span> that one of the partners will be completely unaffected. <span class="highlight">Commensal</span> associations sometimes <span class="highlight">involve</span> one <span class="highlight">species</span>' obtaining food that is <span class="highlight question7">inadvertently</span> <span class="highlight">exposed</span> by another. For <span class="highlight">instance</span>, several kinds of birds feed on insects flushed out of the grass by <span class="highlight">grazing</span> <span class="highlight">cattle</span>. It is difficult to imagine how this could <span class="highlight">affect</span> the <span class="highlight">cattle</span>, but the relationship may help or <span class="highlight">hinder</span> them in some way not yet recognized.</p>
          <p>The third type of symbiosis, <span class="highlight">mutualism</span>, benefits both partners in the relationship Legume plants and their nitrogen-fixing <span class="highlight">bacteria</span>, and the interactions between flowering plants and their pollinators, are examples of <span class="highlight">mutualistic</span> <span class="highlight">association</span>. In the first case, the plants provide the <span class="highlight">bacteria</span> with carbohydrates and other <span class="highlight">organic</span> compounds, and the <span class="highlight">bacteria</span> have enzymes that act as catalysts that <span class="highlight">eventually</span> add <span class="highlight">nitrogen</span> to the soil, enriching it. <span class="question9">In the <span class="highlight">second</span> case, pollinators (insects, birds) <span class="highlight">obtain</span> food from the flowering plant, and the plant has its <span class="highlight">pollen</span> distributed and seeds dispersed much more efficiently than they would be if they were carried by the wind only.</span> Another example of <span class="highlight">mutualism</span> would be the bull's <span class="highlight">horn</span> acacia tree, which grows in Central and South America. The tree provides a place to live for ants of the <span class="highlight"><span class="highlight"><span class="highlight">genus</span></span></span> Pseudomyrmex. The ants live in large, <span class="highlight">hollow</span> thorns and eat sugar secreted by the tree. The ants also eat yellow structures at the tip of leaflets: these are <span class="highlight">protein</span> rich and <span class="highlight">seem</span> to have no <span class="highlight">function</span> for the tree except to <span class="highlight">attract</span> ants. The ants <span class="highlight">benefit</span> the <span class="highlight">host</span> tree by attacking <span class="highlight">virtually</span> anything that touches it. They <span class="highlight">sting</span> other insects and large herbivores (animals that eat only plants) and <span class="highlight">even</span> clip surrounding <span class="highlight">vegetation</span> that grows near the tree. When the ants are removed, the trees usually die, probably because herbivores damage them so much that they are unable to <span class="highlight">compete</span> with surrounding <span class="highlight">vegetation</span> for light and growing <span class="highlight">space</span>.</p>
          <p>The <span class="highlight">complex</span> <span class="highlight">interplay</span> of <span class="highlight">species</span> in symbiotic relationships <span class="question11">highlights</span> an important point about communities: Their structure depends on a web of <span class="highlight">diverse</span> connections among organisms.</p>
