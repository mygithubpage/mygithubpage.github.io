Professor:That's a fair question. We are talking about prehistory here. So obviously the artists didn't put a signature or a date on anything they did.

When the object has decomposed over time.</p><p>B. When the object is older than the site at which it was found.</p><p>C. When the object is found in the lowest soil layer of a site.</p><p>D. When the object was broken during excavation.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>That would be stratigraphy. Stratigraphy is used for dating portable art. When archaeologists are digging at a site, they make very carefully notes about which stratum(strata), which layer of earth they find things in. And, you know, the general rule a that with the dating method is that an object could have been carrying around, used for several generations Before it was discarded. So it might be much older than the layer or even the site where it was found. The stratification technique gives us the minimum age of an object, which isn't urgent its true age. Tom, in your archaeology class , did you talk about radiocarbon dating?</p><p>But indicates that the application of stratigraphy is conditional. Only when the ground is untouched, the test is accurate with this method. A problem is followed by a shortcoming of this method: Items that are dug out are likely to have been used for a long period of time before they are discarded. So the items dug out may be older than the buried soil (that is, B's answer). Stratigraphy can only tell us at least how many years of history, not its true age.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>What are two disadvantages of radiocarbon dating?Click on 2 answers.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

So it turns out that radiocarbon dating works for a lot of prehistoric art. But again there's a problem. This technique destroys what it analyzes, so you have to chip off bits of The object for testing. Obviously we are reluctant to do that in some cases. And apart from that, there's another problems. The date tells you the age of the material, say, a bone or a tree, the object is made from, but Not the date when the artist actually created it. So, with radiocarbon dating, we get the maximum possible age for the object, but it could be younger. Ok, let' s say our scientific analysis has produced an age range. Can we narrow It down?</p><p>The professor first answered Amy's question and confirmed the role of radiocarbon dating. Then, after turning, Butt said it was still flawed. Problem 1 occurs: The work will be destroyed. Note that another, problem2:radiocarbon dating can only show the production time of bones or trees, not the artist's creation time.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the professor's opinion about the practice of dating a piece of art by analyzing its artistic style?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It provides the strongest type of dating evidence.</p><p>B. It is more useful for some types of art than others.</p><p>C. Use of the practice has improved over the last century.</p><p>D.

For example, a lot of people think the presence of details demonstrates that the work was done by a more sophisticated artist. While a lack of detail suggests a But we need to be careful with the idea that artistic development occurs In a straight line, from simple to complex representations.</p><p>Position artistic styles and find what the professor said.
