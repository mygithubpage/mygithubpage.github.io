That's <span class="highlight">organic</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.11" data-time="200.31">[03:20.31]</span>Professor: <span class="highlight">Absolutely</span>. Any other examples?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.37" data-time="203.42">[03:23.42]</span>Amy: Well, when they did those cave drawings. <span class="time" data-times="5.9" data-time="206.79">[03:26.79]</span>Didn't they use, like <span class="highlight">charcoal</span> or maybe colors, dyes made from plants?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.24" data-time="212.69">[03:32.69]</span>Professor: Fortunately, they did, at <span class="highlight">least</span> some of the time. <span class="time" data-times="5.72" data-time="215.93">[03:35.93]</span>So it turns out that <span class="highlight">radiocarbon</span> dating works for a lot of <span class="highlight">prehistoric</span> art. <span class="time" data-times="2.72" data-time="221.65">[03:41.65]</span>But again there's a problem. <span class="time" data-times="7.89" data-time="224.37">[03:44.37]</span>This <span class="highlight">technique</span> destroys what it analyzes, so you have to <span class="highlight">chip</span> off bits of the object for testing.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.59" data-time="232.26">[03:52.26]</span><span class="highlight">Obviously</span> we are <span class="highlight">reluctant</span> to do that in some cases. <span class="time" data-times="2.57" data-time="236.85">[03:56.85]</span>And apart from that, there's another problems. <span class="time" data-times="12.11" data-time="239.42">[03:59.42]</span>The <span class="highlight">date</span> tells you the age of the <span class="highlight">material</span>, say, a bone or a tree, the object is made from, but not the <span class="highlight">date</span> when the artist actually created it. <span class="time" data-times="9.15" data-time="251.53">[04:11.53]</span>So, with <span class="highlight">radiocarbon</span> dating, we get the <span class="highlight">maximum</span> possible age for the object, but it could be younger. <span class="time" data-times="6.84" data-time="260.68">[04:20.68]</span>Ok, let's say our <span class="highlight">scientific</span><span class="highlight">analysis</span> has produced an age <span class="highlight">range</span>. <span class="time" data-times="1.86" data-time="267.52">[04:27.52]</span>Can we narrow it down?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.17" data-time="269.38">[04:29.38]</span>Amy: Could we look for <span class="highlight">similar</span> styles or motives?<span class="time" data-times="3.34" data-time="274.55">[04:34.55]</span> You know, try to find things <span class="highlight">common</span> to one time period.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.04" data-time="277.89">[04:37.89]</span>Professor: We do that all the time. <span class="time" data-times="7.26" data-time="279.93">[04:39.93]</span>And when we see similarities in pieces of art, we <span class="highlight">assume</span> some connection in time or place. <span class="time" data-times="7.11" data-time="287.19">[04:47.19]</span>But is it possible that we could be imposing our own values on that <span class="highlight">analysis</span>?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="1.2" data-time="294.3">[04:54.30]</span>Tom: I am sorry. <span class="time" data-times="1.54" data-time="295.5">[04:55.50]</span>I don't get your point.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.8" data-time="297.04">[04:57.04]</span>Professor: Well, we have all kinds of pre-conceived ideas about how <span class="highlight">artistic</span> styles develop. <span class="time" data-times="8.4" data-time="303.84">[05:03.84]</span>For example, a lot of people think the presence of details demonstrates that the work was done by a more <span class="highlight">sophisticated</span> artist. <span class="time" data-times="4.65" data-time="312.24">[05:12.24]</span>While a <span class="highlight">lack</span> of <span class="highlight">detail</span> suggests a <span class="highlight">primitive</span> style. <span class="time" data-times="6.01" data-time="316.89">[05:16.89]</span>But trends in art in the last <span class="highlight">century</span> or so certainly <span class="highlight">challenge</span> that idea.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.14" data-time="322.9">[05:22.90]</span>Don't get me wrong though, analyzing the styles of <span class="highlight">prehistoric</span> art can help dating them. <span class="time" data-times="11.1" data-time="329.04">[05:29.04]</span>But we need to be careful with the idea that <span class="highlight">artistic</span><span class="highlight">development</span> occurs in a straight <span class="highlight">line</span>, from simple to <span class="highlight">complex</span> representations.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="12.12" data-time="340.14">[05:40.14]</span>Amy: What you are saying is, I mean, I get the feeling that this is like a legal <span class="highlight">process</span>, like building a legal case, the more pieces of <span class="highlight">evidence</span> we have, the closer we get to the truth. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="352.26">[05:52.26]</span>Professor: Great <span class="highlight">analogy</span>. And now you can see why we don't have an <span class="highlight">exact</span><span class="highlight">date</span> for our <span class="highlight">sculpture</span>, the lady with the hood.</p></p></article></section><div id="question"><div id="question1"><p>What is the talk mainly about?</p><label class="my-label"><span>A.
