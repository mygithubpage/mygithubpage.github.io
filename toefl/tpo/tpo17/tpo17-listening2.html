              <span class="time" data-times="6.7" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in an art <span class="underline">history</span> class.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.53" data-time="6.7">[00:06.70]</span>Professor: Good morning, ready to continue our <span class="underline">review</span> of <span class="underline">prehistoric</span> art? <span class="time" data-times="11.95" data-time="13.23">[00:13.23]</span>Today, we will be covering the Upper <span class="underline">Paleolithic</span> Period, which I am <span class="underline">roughly</span> defining as the period from 35,000 to 8,000 BC. <span class="time" data-times="5.2" data-time="25.18">[00:25.18]</span>A lot of those cave drawings you have all seen come from this period.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.58" data-time="30.38">[00:30.38]</span>But we are also be talking about <span class="underline">portable</span> works of art, things that could be carried around from place to place. <span class="time" data-times="2.4" data-time="37.96">[00:37.96]</span>Here is one example. <span class="time" data-times="11.81" data-time="40.36">[00:40.36]</span>This <span class="underline">sculpture</span> is called the Lady with the Hood, and it was carved from <span class="underline">ivory</span>, probably a <span class="underline">mammoth</span>'s tusk. <span class="time" data-times="2.92" data-time="52.17">[00:52.17]</span>Its age is a bit of a mystery. <span class="time" data-times="5.12" data-time="55.09">[00:55.09]</span>According to one <span class="underline">source</span>, it dates from 22,000 BC. <span class="time" data-times="7.54" data-time="60.21">[01:00.21]</span>But other sources claimed it has been <span class="underline">dated</span> closer to 30,000 BC. Amy?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.3" data-time="67.75">[01:07.75]</span>Amy: Why don't we know the <span class="underline">exact</span> <span class="underline">date</span> when this head was made?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.63" data-time="75.05">[01:15.05]</span>Professor: That's a <span class="underline">fair</span> question. <span class="time" data-times="3.2" data-time="76.68">[01:16.68]</span>We are talking about prehistory here. <span class="time" data-times="7.32" data-time="79.88">[01:19.88]</span>So <span class="underline">obviously</span> the artists didn't put a signature or a <span class="underline">date</span> on anything they did. <span class="time" data-times="3.66" data-time="87.2">[01:27.20]</span>So how do we know when this <span class="underline">figure</span> was carved?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.21" data-time="90.86">[01:30.86]</span>Tom: Last <span class="underline">semester</span> I took an <span class="underline">archaeology</span> class and we spent a lot time on, studying ways to <span class="underline">date</span> things. <span class="time" data-times="6.31" data-time="99.07">[01:39.07]</span>One <span class="underline">technique</span> I remember was using the location of an object to <span class="underline">date</span> it, like how deep it was buried.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.59" data-time="105.38">[01:45.38]</span>Professor: That would be <span class="underline">Stratigraphy</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.94" data-time="108.97">[01:48.97]</span> <span class="underline">Stratigraphy</span> is used for dating <span class="underline">portable</span> art. <span class="time" data-times="9.41" data-time="114.91">[01:54.91]</span>When archaeologists are digging at a site, they make very careful notes about which <span class="underline">stratum</span> (<span class="underline">strata</span>), which <span class="underline">layer</span> of earth they find things in. <span class="time" data-times="6.19" data-time="124.32">[02:04.32]</span>And, you know, the general rule is that the oldest layers are at the lowest <span class="underline">level</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.02" data-time="130.51">[02:10.51]</span>But this only works if the site hasn't been touched, and the layers are <span class="underline">intact</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.23" data-time="136.53">[02:16.53]</span>A problem with this dating <span class="underline">method</span> is that an object could have been carried around, used for several generations before it was discarded. <span class="time" data-times="6.47" data-time="146.76">[02:26.76]</span>So it might be much older than the <span class="underline">layer</span> or <span class="underline">even</span> the site where it was found. <span class="time" data-times="8.95" data-time="153.23">[02:33.23]</span>The <span class="underline">stratification</span> <span class="underline">technique</span> gives us the <span class="underline">minimum</span> age of an object, which isn't necessarily its true age. <span class="time" data-times="6.47" data-time="162.18">[02:42.18]</span>Tom, in your <span class="underline">archaeology</span> class, did you talk about <span class="underline">radiocarbon</span> dating?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.54" data-time="168.65">[02:48.65]</span>Tom: Yeah, we did. <span class="time" data-times="8.74" data-time="172.19">[02:52.19]</span>That had to do with chemical <span class="underline">analysis</span>, something to do with measuring the <span class="underline">amount</span> of <span class="underline">radiocarbon</span> that's left in <span class="underline">organic</span> <span class="underline">stuff</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.28" data-time="180.93">[03:00.93]</span>Because we know how fast <span class="underline">radiocarbon</span> decays, we can <span class="underline">figure</span> out the age of the <span class="underline">organic</span> <span class="underline">material</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.69" data-time="188.21">[03:08.21]</span>Professor: The key word there is <span class="underline">organic</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.6" data-time="191.9">[03:11.90]</span>Is art made of <span class="underline">organic</span> <span class="underline">material</span>?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.81" data-time="195.5">[03:15.50]</span>Tom: Well, you said the lady with the hood was carved out of <span class="underline">ivory</span>. That's <span class="underline">organic</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.11" data-time="200.31">[03:20.31]</span>Professor: <span class="underline">Absolutely</span>. Any other examples?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.37" data-time="203.42">[03:23.42]</span>Amy: Well, when they did those cave drawings. <span class="time" data-times="5.9" data-time="206.79">[03:26.79]</span>Didn't they use, like <span class="underline">charcoal</span> or maybe colors, dyes made from plants?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.24" data-time="212.69">[03:32.69]</span>Professor: Fortunately, they did, at <span class="underline">least</span> some of the time. <span class="time" data-times="5.72" data-time="215.93">[03:35.93]</span>So it turns out that <span class="underline">radiocarbon</span> dating works for a lot of <span class="underline">prehistoric</span> art. <span class="time" data-times="2.72" data-time="221.65">[03:41.65]</span>But again there's a problem. <span class="time" data-times="7.89" data-time="224.37">[03:44.37]</span>This <span class="underline">technique</span> destroys what it analyzes, so you have to <span class="underline">chip</span> off bits of the object for testing.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.59" data-time="232.26">[03:52.26]</span>
              <span class="underline">Obviously</span> we are <span class="underline">reluctant</span> to do that in some cases. <span class="time" data-times="2.57" data-time="236.85">[03:56.85]</span>And apart from that, there's another problems. <span class="time" data-times="12.11" data-time="239.42">[03:59.42]</span>The <span class="underline">date</span> tells you the age of the <span class="underline">material</span>, say, a bone or a tree, the object is made from, but not the <span class="underline">date</span> when the artist actually created it. <span class="time" data-times="9.15" data-time="251.53">[04:11.53]</span>So, with <span class="underline">radiocarbon</span> dating, we get the <span class="underline">maximum</span> possible age for the object, but it could be younger. <span class="time" data-times="6.84" data-time="260.68">[04:20.68]</span>Ok, let's say our <span class="underline">scientific</span> <span class="underline">analysis</span> has produced an age <span class="underline">range</span>. <span class="time" data-times="1.86" data-time="267.52">[04:27.52]</span>Can we narrow it down?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.17" data-time="269.38">[04:29.38]</span>Amy: Could we look for <span class="underline">similar</span> styles or motives?<span class="time" data-times="3.34" data-time="274.55">[04:34.55]</span> You know, try to find things <span class="underline">common</span> to one time period.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.04" data-time="277.89">[04:37.89]</span>Professor: We do that all the time. <span class="time" data-times="7.26" data-time="279.93">[04:39.93]</span>And when we see similarities in pieces of art, we <span class="underline">assume</span> some connection in time or place. <span class="time" data-times="7.11" data-time="287.19">[04:47.19]</span>But is it possible that we could be imposing our own values on that <span class="underline">analysis</span>?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.2" data-time="294.3">[04:54.30]</span>Tom: I am sorry. <span class="time" data-times="1.54" data-time="295.5">[04:55.50]</span>I don't get your point.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.8" data-time="297.04">[04:57.04]</span>Professor: Well, we have all kinds of pre-conceived ideas about how <span class="underline">artistic</span> styles develop. <span class="time" data-times="8.4" data-time="303.84">[05:03.84]</span>For example, a lot of people think the presence of details demonstrates that the work was done by a more <span class="underline">sophisticated</span> artist. <span class="time" data-times="4.65" data-time="312.24">[05:12.24]</span>While a <span class="underline">lack</span> of <span class="underline">detail</span> suggests a <span class="underline">primitive</span> style. <span class="time" data-times="6.01" data-time="316.89">[05:16.89]</span>But trends in art in the last <span class="underline">century</span> or so certainly <span class="underline">challenge</span> that idea.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.14" data-time="322.9">[05:22.90]</span>Don't get me wrong though, analyzing the styles of <span class="underline">prehistoric</span> art can help dating them. <span class="time" data-times="11.1" data-time="329.04">[05:29.04]</span>But we need to be careful with the idea that <span class="underline">artistic</span> <span class="underline">development</span> occurs in a straight <span class="underline">line</span>, from simple to <span class="underline">complex</span> representations.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="12.12" data-time="340.14">[05:40.14]</span>Amy: What you are saying is, I mean, I get the feeling that this is like a legal <span class="underline">process</span>, like building a legal case, the more pieces of <span class="underline">evidence</span> we have, the closer we get to the truth. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="352.26">[05:52.26]</span>Professor: Great <span class="underline">analogy</span>. And now you can see why we don't have an <span class="underline">exact</span> <span class="underline">date</span> for our <span class="underline">sculpture</span>, the lady with the hood.</p>
