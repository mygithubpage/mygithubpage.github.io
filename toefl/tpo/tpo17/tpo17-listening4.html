        <article>
          <p>Narrator: Listen to a conversation between a student and a food service manager.</p>
          <p>:Student: Excuse me, Mrs. Hanson. My name is John, John Grant. I work as a waiter in the campus dining hall, in the faculty dining room.</p>
          <p>:Manager: What can I do for you, John?</p>
          <p>:Student: Well, I work week nights, except for Friday. I was wondering if I could switch from working the dinner service to working at lunch.</p>
          <p>:Manager: That's going to be a problem. I am afraid we don't have any openings at lunch time. A lot of students want to work then, so it is really rare for us to have an open spot at that time of day.</p>
          <p>:Student: Oh, you see, I have joined this group, the University Jazz Band, and the band's practice time is right around dinner time. You know, it is so hard to get into this group, I must have auditioned like ten times since I have been at the school, so I am ... Anyway, so I was really hoping to have the dinner hour free so I can go to practice.</p>
          <p>:Manager: Well, we do have other open times, like breakfast.</p>
          <p>:Student: Eh, that won't work, I am sorry. I mean that, I can't work that early. I have this very important music class I got to take, and it is like, first thing in the morning.</p>
          <p>:Manager: Well, if you don't mind working in the kitchen, we've got some pretty flexible hours for students doing food-prep work, anything from early morning to late afternoon.</p>
          <p>:Student: What's prep work?</p>
          <p>:Manager: You prepare food for the cooks. You know, like cutting up vegetables for soup, or cleaning greens for salads.</p>
          <p>:Student: Oh, that doesn't sound, I mean... Being a waiter, I get to see a lot of the professors, like in a different light, we joke around a little you know. In the classroom, they always have to be pretty formal, but ...</p>
          <p>:Manager: Well, the money is no different since we pay students the same amount for any of the jobs here in food service, so it's up to you.</p>
          <p>:Student: Oh, man. I always thought that sacrificing for my art, that'd mean working long hours as a musician for, like, no money. I didn't think it'd mean, peeling carrots.</p>
          <p>:Manager: Let me see, I am offering you something that has the hours you want, it is right here on campus, and you make as much money as you did being a waiter, quite a sacrifice.</p>
          <p>:Student: I am sorry, I know you are just trying to help. I guess I should look into the food-prep job.</p>
          <p>:Manager: Ok, then, I'll tell the kitchen manager that you will stop by tomorrow to talk about the job and schedule your hours. And I will let the dining hall manager know that he needs to find a new waiter for the evening.</p>
          <p>:Student: Oh, ok, I guess that's it. Thanks, Mrs. Hanson. </p>
