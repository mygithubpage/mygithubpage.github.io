              <span class="time" data-times="4.93" data-time="6.64">[00:06.64]</span>Student: Excuse me, Mrs. Hanson. <span class="time" data-times="2.61" data-time="11.57">[00:11.57]</span>My name is John, John <span class="underline">Grant</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.21" data-time="14.18">[00:14.18]</span>I work as a waiter in the <span class="underline">campus</span> dining hall, in the <span class="underline">faculty</span> dining room. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.67" data-time="18.39">[00:18.39]</span>Manager: What can I do for you, John? </p>

              <span class="time" data-times="3.35" data-time="20.06">[00:20.06]</span>Student: Well, I work week nights, except for Friday. <span class="time" data-times="6.32" data-time="23.41">[00:23.41]</span>I was wondering if I could <span class="underline">switch</span> from working the dinner service to working at lunch. </p>

              <span class="time" data-times="1.51" data-time="29.73">[00:29.73]</span>Manager: That's going to be a problem. <span class="time" data-times="3.19" data-time="31.24">[00:31.24]</span>I am afraid we don't have any openings at lunch time. <span class="time" data-times="4.96" data-time="34.43">[00:34.43]</span>A lot of students want to work then, so it is really <span class="underline">rare</span> for us to have an open <span class="underline">spot</span> at that time of day. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.6" data-time="39.39">[00:39.39]</span>Student: Oh, you see, I have joined this group, the University Jazz <span class="underline">Band</span>, and the <span class="underline">band</span>'s practice time is right around dinner time. <span class="time" data-times="6.95" data-time="47.99">[00:47.99]</span>You know, it is so hard to get into this group, I must have auditioned like ten times since I have been at the school, so I am ... <span class="time" data-times="5.7" data-time="54.94">[00:54.94]</span>Anyway, so I was really hoping to have the dinner hour free so I can go to practice. </p>

              <span class="time" data-times="4.22" data-time="60.64">[01:00.64]</span>Manager: Well, we do have other open times, like breakfast. </p>

              <span class="time" data-times="1.91" data-time="87.93">[01:27.93]</span>Manager: You <span class="underline">prepare</span> food for the cooks. <span class="time" data-times="4.7" data-time="89.84">[01:29.84]</span>You know, like cutting up vegetables for soup, or cleaning greens for salads. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.74" data-time="94.54">[01:34.54]</span>Student: Oh, that doesn't <span class="underline">sound</span>, I mean... <span class="time" data-times="6.86" data-time="98.28">[01:38.28]</span>Being a waiter, I get to see a lot of the professors, like in a different light, we joke around a little you know. <span class="time" data-times="3.14" data-time="105.14">[01:45.14]</span>In the classroom, they always have to be <span class="underline">pretty</span> <span class="underline">formal</span>, but ... </p>

              <span class="time" data-times="6.79" data-time="108.28">[01:48.28]</span>Manager: Well, the money is no different since we <span class="underline">pay</span> students the same <span class="underline">amount</span> for any of the jobs here in food service, so it's up to you. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.55" data-time="115.07">[01:55.07]</span>Student: Oh, man. I always thought that sacrificing for my art, that'd mean working long hours as a <span class="underline">musician</span> for, like, no money. <span class="time" data-times="3.2" data-time="124.62">[02:04.62]</span>I didn't think it'd mean, peeling carrots. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="11.52" data-time="127.82">[02:07.82]</span>Manager: Let me see, I am offering you something that has the hours you want, it is right here on <span class="underline">campus</span>, and you make as much money as you did being a waiter, quite a sacrifice. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.26" data-time="139.34">[02:19.34]</span>Student: I am sorry, I know you are just trying to help. <span class="time" data-times="3.87" data-time="142.6">[02:22.60]</span>I guess I should look into the food-prep job. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.16" data-time="146.47">[02:26.47]</span>Manager: Ok, then, I'll tell the kitchen manager that you will stop by tomorrow to talk about the job and <span class="underline">schedule</span> your hours. <span class="time" data-times="4.7" data-time="153.63">[02:33.63]</span>And I will let the dining hall manager know that he needs to find a new waiter for the evening. </p>
