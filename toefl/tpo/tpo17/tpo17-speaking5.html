        <h3>Listening Text</h3>
        <article>
          <p>Listen to a conversation between two students.</p>
          <p>Man: Hey Sally, I just got the first copy of my research paper back from professor Stone.</p>
          <p>Woman: Just now? I got mine back a few days ago.</p>
          <p>Man: Yeah, everyone else in the class that I know of got theirs back a few days ago too.</p>
          <p>Woman: But, the deadline...you're running out of time.</p>
          <p>Man: Yeah. I only have one day to review all his comments and write my final draft. He made a lot of suggestions.</p>
          <p>Woman: You should definitely ask Professor Stone for a deadline extension. He should take some responsibility for the situation; it is sort of his fault you won't have much time to work on it before the due date.</p>
          <p>Man: I thought about that, but would he think I was being pushy, or...criticizing him for not getting the paper back to me right away? I don't want to offend him.</p>
          <p>Woman: True, but it's your grade we're talking about. You've got a legitimate concern, but it's understandable if you're uncomfortable asking.</p>
          <p>Man: Yeah... I'm in a tough spot.</p>
          <p>Woman: You know you could always just do your best with the time you have left. You're a good student, I bet you can finish it quickly; work really fast and it'll still turn out good.</p>
          <p>Man:Do my best with the time I have left. Well...if I worked really hard, I imagine I might ok, but I have to be sure to deal with all of those comments. I need a good grade.</p>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>The man's problem is that he just got the first copy of his research paper back from his professor but he's got only one day before the deadline of his final draft, so obviously he is running out of time. The woman offers to the man two solutions: he could ask his professor for an deadline extension or he could try his best to make good use of the time left. Well, I suggest that the man should go talking to the professor and ask for a deadline extension, and I have two main reasons. Firstly, it is unfair for the man to have less time preparing for his final draft than any other students, because everyone needs appropriate time to combine suggestions and to review structures and main points, and only in this way their papers can be scored equally. Secondly, no one is at fault and the man doesn't have to worry that he may be too pushy at all, since the professor might have forgotten the dead line too. So I think asking the professor for the man's legitimate deadline extension could be a better idea. (189 words)</p>
