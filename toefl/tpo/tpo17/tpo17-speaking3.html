          <h4 class="w3-center">New Library Workspaces</h4>
          <p>Say good-bye to the big, multiperson study tables in Turner Library. This summer, the tables will be exchanged for new personal study cubicles-small, one-person desks enclosed by walls. These new units will allow students to have privacy and work in isolation and will therefore eliminate noise in the library so students can concentrate. Additionally, the cubicles will enable the library to accommodate the recent increase in the number of students attending our university. Although the current tables seat six students each, they make poor use of the available floor space. The cubicles, on the other hand, are designed for maximum space efficiency, and the library can therefore add 50 new seats.</p>

          <p>Now listen to two students discussing the announcement.</p>
          <p>Man: They're making a mistake.</p>
          <p>Woman: What do you mean?</p>
          <p>Man: Look, They're trying to do away with distractions so that we can study better. But with this change, we won't have anywhere in the library to get together to work on group projects.</p>
          <p>Woman: True. Group project work is common these days.</p>
          <p>Man: So, instead of buying these new units. They should use the money to build meeting rooms, and that would reduce any noise in the main library areas. Woman: Yeah, that's what we could really use. There's just not as much need to work in isolation.</p>
          <p>Man: Exactly. And the other thing is, what's this about overcrowding? Well, sure we have more students enrolled in the university this year, but do we really have a problem with over crowding?</p>
          <p>Woman: I don't think so. I always get a whole table to myself.</p>
          <p>Man: Right. I see empty tables there all the time. It'll just be a waste of money to replace what we have. Since what we have now is sufficient for the amount of students that use the library.</p>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>The man disagrees with the upcoming change for two main reasons. First of all, he believes the students would have nowhere to get together for their group projects in the library, so he figures that the money should be spent on building meeting rooms instead of buying new units to reduce the noise in the main library area. Besides, he thinks that there is no such problem as overcrowding. He says there are empty tables all the time in the library even when the university enrolls in more students, and therefore replacing the tables would be a waste of money, since there is quite sufficient room for the students who use the library. So the man thinks that the upcoming change is quite a mistake. (127 words)</p>
