        <h3>Listening Text</h3>
        <article>
          <p>Listen to a conversation between two students.</p>
          <p>Man: Hey Julie, what's up?</p>
          <p>Woman: Oh, hi George. I'm just waiting for my friend Amy. We're supposed to drive into town together to see a film at one of the movie theaters there.</p>
          <p>Man: Sounds great!</p>
          <p>Woman: Yeah, our professor from film class wants us to go see it. It's a film by one of the directors we've been studying and we'll be discussing the film next week in class.</p>
          <p>Man: Cool!</p>
          <p>Woman: Yeah, but I'm the one with the car, and we were supposed to meet like 15 minutes ago, and Amy hasn't shown up. She's really late, if we don't leave in like the next few minutes we're going to miss the beginning of the movie.</p>
          <p>Man: Have you tried calling her?</p>
          <p>Woman: Yeah, I've called her several times and left voice mails. She hasn't responded to any of my messages, so, anyway, I don't know what I should do.</p>
          <p>Man: Well, I know Amy's your friend and everything, but if you need to see the film, and you've already been waiting 15 minutes for her, I mean...maybe you should just go by yourself?</p>
          <p>(woman) You mean, just leave now, without her? Yeah, I guess she could see it another time. They are showing the film again tomorrow, so Amy could still go see it then, but I'll be busy tomorrow, so I need to go today.</p>
          <p>(man) Maybe you could just leave Amy a voicemail saying that you had to leave without her.</p>
          <p>(woman) That's true, but... I don't know, maybe I should just wait 10 more minutes and go late to the film. She might be on her way over here right now! She did mention that she had a lot of other things to do first before she met me...and besides, Amy's often late for stuff.</p>
          <p>(man) But if you wait another 10 minutes for her, you'll be late for the movie, right?</p>
          <p>(woman) Yep.</p>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>Well, the woman's got a problem that she is supposed to meet her friend to drive her to a movie that they are assigned by the professor to watch and discuss in class but her friend is late and if she keeps waiting she will be late for the movie. Accordingly, there are two solutions for the woman. First, she could call her friend or second, she could just go by herself and leave a voicemail telling her friend about it. Well, I think the woman should take the second solution for two main reasons. First of all, watching the movie is more important than watching it together with her friend, since the movie will be discussed in class, which makes it an assignment instead of entertainment. Besides, if her friend can't make it to the movie, since in that way, at least she could fill in for her friend. So I recommend the second solution. (158 words)</p>
