Parents should be involved in the process of helping their children to choose a career.
Use specific examples and details to support your opinion.</p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>I don't agree with the statement for two reasons. First, kids need to do what they like. Kids will be successful doing what they feel is right for them rather than living an unhappy life working in a career and living a life that their parents forced them in to. Life is short; we all need to be living happily doing what we like and never should feel obligated to do anything just because of parents. Second, kids should learn to make decisions by themselves. Take my experience for example, when I was young, my parents always made decisions for me. But later when I went to school in another city and started to live on my own, I felt so helpless and confused. I didn't know how to make any decisions by myself. Therefore, I think it's important for children to make their own decisions.</p></article></div></main></body></html>
