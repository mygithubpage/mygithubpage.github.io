              <span class="time" data-times="3.91" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in an <span class="underline">astronomy</span> class. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.8" data-time="3.91">[00:03.91]</span>Professor: There's been a lot of talk recently about life on Mars, at the <span class="underline">level</span> of microorganisms anyway, mainly because of a few important discoveries and inventions. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.42" data-time="13.71">[00:13.71]</span>For example, one <span class="underline">major</span> discovery was that at one point water was present on Mars. <span class="time" data-times="1.06" data-time="19.13">[00:19.13]</span>How do we know?<span class="time" data-times="5.4" data-time="20.19">[00:20.19]</span> Well, in 2004, an <span class="underline">exploration</span> robot discovered jarosite there. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.07" data-time="25.59">[00:25.59]</span>Jarosite is a yellowish brown <span class="underline">mineral</span> with a <span class="underline">crystalline</span> structure that's also found on Earth. <span class="time" data-times="3.17" data-time="31.66">[00:31.66]</span>It contains iron, <span class="underline">potassium</span> and hydroxide.<span class="time" data-times="5.35" data-time="34.83">[00:34.83]</span>The interesting thing is that on Earth at <span class="underline">least</span> it needs highly <span class="underline">acidic</span> water to form.<span class="time" data-times="3.47" data-time="40.18">[00:40.18]</span>So we've got water or had it at one point. <span class="time" data-times="9.1" data-time="43.65">[00:43.65]</span>And since most <span class="underline">planetary</span> scientists believe that water is <span class="underline">essential</span> to life, the presence of jarosite means that one <span class="underline">prerequisite</span> for life was once present on Mars. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.58" data-time="52.75">[00:52.75]</span>But there's another thing about jarosite. <span class="time" data-times="7.93" data-time="57.33">[00:57.33]</span>One step in its <span class="underline">formation</span> on Earth involves microorganisms; they actually speed up the <span class="underline">formation</span> of jarosite <span class="underline">dramatically</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.41" data-time="65.26">[01:05.26]</span>Now, <span class="underline">theoretically</span> it is possible for jarosite to form without the help of biological life forms. <span class="time" data-times="6.5" data-time="71.67">[01:11.67]</span>But we don't really know for sure if this happens 'cause... well, because every corner of Earth has some form of biological life. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.67" data-time="78.17">[01:18.17]</span>But jarosite on Earth incorporates all kinds of microorganisms into its <span class="underline">crystalline</span> structure. <span class="time" data-times="10.34" data-time="84.84">[01:24.84]</span>So it's possible that if the jarosite on Mars was also formed with the help of microorganisms, we might be able to <span class="underline">detect</span> remnants of them in the samples we find. <span class="time" data-times="3.97" data-time="95.18">[01:35.18]</span>And we have instruments now that will enable us to try to do this. <span class="time" data-times="7.59" data-time="99.15">[01:39.15]</span>For example, there's a new <span class="underline">instrument</span> called the microfabricated <span class="underline">organic</span> analyzer, or M.O.A. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.6" data-time="106.74">[01:46.74]</span>The <span class="underline">organic</span> analyzer is an amazing tool. <span class="time" data-times="7.57" data-time="111.34">[01:51.34]</span>It will be able to <span class="underline">collect</span> soil samples and <span class="underline">analyze</span> them right there on Mars, <span class="underline">pure</span>, untouched samples.<span class="time" data-times="5.6" data-time="118.91">[01:58.91]</span>It will let us <span class="underline">eliminate</span> the risk we would take of contaminating the samples if they were brought back to Earth. <span class="time" data-times="5.36" data-time="124.51">[02:04.51]</span>And what they'll look for <span class="underline">specifically</span> in the soil is <span class="underline">amino</span> acids. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.16" data-time="129.87">[02:09.87]</span>
              <span class="underline">Amino</span> acids, as you may know, are the building blocks of proteins. <span class="time" data-times="5.76" data-time="136.03">[02:16.03]</span>In fact, there are twenty <span class="underline">standard</span> <span class="underline">amino</span> acids involved in making proteins and lots more that aren't. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.05" data-time="141.79">[02:21.79]</span>And here's the important thing. <span class="time" data-times="2.55" data-time="143.84">[02:23.84]</span> <span class="underline">Amino</span> acids are what we call handed.<span class="time" data-times="5.35" data-time="146.39">[02:26.39]</span>They can exist in two forms, which are <span class="underline">mirror</span> images of each other like hands.<span class="time" data-times="5.11" data-time="151.74">[02:31.74]</span>Right and left hands have the same number of fingers in the same order plus one thumb. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.96" data-time="156.85">[02:36.85]</span>But right and left hands are not the same; they are <span class="underline">mirror</span> images. <span class="time" data-times="4.21" data-time="160.81">[02:40.81]</span>Well, like hands, <span class="underline">amino</span> acids can be right or left-handed. <span class="time" data-times="3.96" data-time="165.02">[02:45.02]</span>And the twenty that make up the proteins on Earth are all left-handed. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="13.86" data-time="168.98">[02:48.98]</span>Now, one <span class="underline">reason</span> the M.O.A., the <span class="underline">organic</span> analyzer is so <span class="underline">impressive</span> is that it tests not just for the presence of <span class="underline">amino</span> acids but also for the handedness of <span class="underline">amino</span> acids. <span class="time" data-times="10.22" data-time="182.84">[03:02.84]</span>If <span class="underline">amino</span> acids are found, it would be especially interesting if they show a prevalence of one type of handedness, either left, like <span class="underline">amino</span> acids on Earth, or right. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.88" data-time="193.06">[03:13.06]</span>See, other <span class="underline">physical</span> processes in <span class="underline">space</span>, processes that don't <span class="underline">involve</span> living organisms, can create <span class="underline">amino</span> acids.<span class="time" data-times="9.98" data-time="200.94">[03:20.94]</span>But the ones synthesized <span class="underline">through</span> <span class="underline">abiotic</span> processes, which is to say not involving microorganisms, <span class="underline">occur</span> in <span class="underline">equal</span> numbers of right- and left-handed. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.01" data-time="210.92">[03:30.92]</span>So, a prevalence of left-handed <span class="underline">amino</span> acids would <span class="underline">indicate</span> they were biological in <span class="underline">origin</span>, which would be amazing! <span class="time" data-times="5.44" data-time="218.93">[03:38.93]</span>A prevalence of right-handed ones...well, that would be really amazing!! <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="224.37">[03:44.37]</span>Because the organisms that created them would be unlike anything we have on Earth, which produce only left-handed ones. </p>
