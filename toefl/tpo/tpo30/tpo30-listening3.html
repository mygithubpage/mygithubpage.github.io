            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.08" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in a paleontology class. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="12.27" data-time="4.08">[00:04.08]</span>Professor: As we've discussed, birds are apparently descendants of dinosaurs and shared many commonalities with some <span class="underline">dinosaur</span> <span class="underline">species</span>, like...um...feathers and maybe <span class="underline">even</span> flight and of <span class="underline">course</span> egg laid. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.95" data-time="16.35">[00:16.35]</span>OK. So, many paleontologists, myself included, have wondered about other similarities between dinosaurs and birds. <span class="time" data-times="8.35" data-time="23.3">[00:23.30]</span>Since adult <span class="underline">dinosaur</span> fossils have sometimes been discovered near or on top of nests, we've been looking at the <span class="underline">dinosaur</span> parenting <span class="underline">behavior</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.47" data-time="31.65">[00:31.65]</span>Student: Parenting <span class="underline">behavior</span>, well, that sounds so <span class="underline">gentle</span> and caring.<span class="time" data-times="5.31" data-time="35.12">[00:35.12]</span> But dinosaurs were ferocious reptiles and reptiles don't take <span class="underline">care</span> of their young, do they? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.86" data-time="40.43">[00:40.43]</span>Professor: Well, some reptiles <span class="underline">incubate</span> their eggs, crocodiles do.<span class="time" data-times="6.15" data-time="44.29">[00:44.29]</span> And as for <span class="underline">popular</span> attitudes towards dinosaurs...well, take the Oviraptor for <span class="underline">instance</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.63" data-time="50.44">[00:50.44]</span>In the 1920s, a <span class="underline">paleontologist</span> discovered the <span class="underline">fossil</span> remains of a small <span class="underline">dinosaur</span> near a <span class="underline">nest</span> containing eggs. <span class="time" data-times="13.55" data-time="59.07">[00:59.07]</span>He assumed the <span class="underline">dinosaur</span> was stealing the eggs, so he named it Oviraptor that means egg thief in <span class="underline">Latin</span>, which fueled the generally <span class="underline">negative</span> public <span class="underline">image</span> of such dinosaurs. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.72" data-time="72.62">[01:12.62]</span>But by the 1990s, other experts had convincingly made the case that <span class="underline">instead</span> of robbing the <span class="underline">nest</span>; the Oviraptor was probably taking <span class="underline">care</span> of the eggs.<span class="time" data-times="7.09" data-time="82.34">[01:22.34]</span>You see, dinosaurs' closest living relatives – birds and crocodiles – <span class="underline">display</span> nesting <span class="underline">behavior</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.64" data-time="89.43">[01:29.43]</span>And <span class="underline">dinosaur</span> fossils have been found in postures that we now believe to <span class="underline">indicate</span> brooding behavior--that is, sitting on the eggs until they <span class="underline">hatch</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.06" data-time="98.07">[01:38.07]</span>So we are <span class="underline">curious</span> about the type of <span class="underline">care</span> dinosaurs gave to their young. <span class="time" data-times="4.52" data-time="102.13">[01:42.13]</span>And we'd like to <span class="underline">figure</span> out which <span class="underline">dinosaur</span> parent, the <span class="underline">male</span> or the <span class="underline">female</span> gave the <span class="underline">care</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.82" data-time="106.65">[01:46.65]</span>Student: Shouldn't the <span class="underline">behavior</span> of crocodiles and birds give us some clues then? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.74" data-time="111.47">[01:51.47]</span>Professor: Well, with crocodiles, it is the <span class="underline">female</span> who guards the <span class="underline">nest</span>, and with birds, it depends on the <span class="underline">species</span>, it can be the <span class="underline">male</span> or the <span class="underline">female</span> that takes <span class="underline">care</span> the eggs, or both.<span class="time" data-times="6.43" data-time="122.21">[02:02.21]</span>In over 90 percent of all bird <span class="underline">species</span>, both parents take <span class="underline">care</span> of the eggs and the young birds. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.85" data-time="128.64">[02:08.64]</span>Student: But sometimes it's just the <span class="underline">male</span>? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.13" data-time="132.49">[02:12.49]</span>Professor: Well, <span class="underline">exclusive</span> <span class="underline">care</span> by the <span class="underline">male</span> parent is much less <span class="underline">common</span>, but it does <span class="underline">occur</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.62" data-time="136.62">[02:16.62]</span>Now, for animals other than birds, the <span class="underline">care</span> of young by both parents is <span class="underline">pretty</span> unusual in the animal <span class="underline">kingdom</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.92" data-time="143.24">[02:23.24]</span>Males <span class="underline">contribute</span> to parental <span class="underline">care</span> in fewer than five percent of all <span class="underline">mammalian</span> <span class="underline">species</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.36" data-time="148.16">[02:28.16]</span>It's <span class="underline">even</span> less frequent among reptiles. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.21" data-time="150.52">[02:30.52]</span>And <span class="underline">exclusive</span> <span class="underline">care</span> by the <span class="underline">male</span> is very <span class="underline">rare</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.92" data-time="154.73">[02:34.73]</span>So researchers have wondered about the <span class="underline">evolution</span> of <span class="underline">male</span> parenting <span class="underline">behavior</span> in birds for quite some time.<span class="time" data-times="8.69" data-time="159.65">[02:39.65]</span>And now there's research showing that for some of the birds' <span class="underline">dinosaur</span> relatives, it's likely that the <span class="underline">male</span> parent was also in charge of taking <span class="underline">care</span> of the eggs. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.17" data-time="168.34">[02:48.34]</span>Student: How did they <span class="underline">figure</span> that out? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="12.83" data-time="170.51">[02:50.51]</span>Professor: Well, first they looked at <span class="underline">clutch</span> <span class="underline">volume</span>, that's the number of eggs in the <span class="underline">nest</span> of crocodiles, birds and three types of dinosaurs, including Oviraptors that are thought to be closely related to the <span class="underline">dinosaur</span> ancestors of birds. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="11.52" data-time="183.34">[03:03.34]</span>So when researchers examined fossilized remains of nests, they found that the dinosaurs had larger <span class="underline">clutch</span> volumes, more eggs in the nests that is, than most of the crocodiles and birds that were studied.<span class="time" data-times="7.86" data-time="194.86">[03:14.86]</span>But, and this is important, their <span class="underline">clutch</span> volumes matched those of birds that have only <span class="underline">male</span> parental <span class="underline">care</span>.<span class="time" data-times="7.21" data-time="202.72">[03:22.72]</span>You see, bird <span class="underline">species</span> in which only the males take <span class="underline">care</span> of the <span class="underline">nest</span> <span class="underline">tend</span> to have the largest clutches of eggs. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.92" data-time="209.93">[03:29.93]</span>Student: So what's the connection between bird and <span class="underline">dinosaur</span> <span class="underline">behavior</span>? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.06" data-time="214.85">[03:34.85]</span>Professor: Well, researchers now believe, because of this study, that the <span class="underline">male</span> parenting <span class="underline">behavior</span> of these birds might have its origins in the <span class="underline">behavior</span> of dinosaurs. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.74" data-time="223.91">[03:43.91]</span>Student: Based only on <span class="underline">evidence</span> of <span class="underline">clutch</span> <span class="underline">volume</span> size, the number of eggs? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.22" data-time="228.65">[03:48.65]</span>Professor: No, there's more. <span class="time" data-times="7.88" data-time="229.87">[03:49.87]</span>They also examined the fossilized bones of those three types of dinosaurs that were found on or near nests to <span class="underline">determine</span> their sex.<span class="time" data-times="8.44" data-time="237.75">[03:57.75]</span>You see, adult <span class="underline">female</span> birds during egg production produce a <span class="underline">layer</span> of spongy bone <span class="underline">tissue</span> inside certain long bones.<span class="time" data-times="3.88" data-time="246.19">[04:06.19]</span>And so did <span class="underline">female</span> dinosaurs of the kinds that were investigated. <span class="time" data-times="4.81" data-time="250.07">[04:10.07]</span>This spongy <span class="underline">tissue</span> serves as a <span class="underline">source</span> of <span class="underline">calcium</span> for <span class="underline">eggshell</span> <span class="underline">formation</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.67" data-time="254.88">[04:14.88]</span>But when the <span class="underline">dinosaur</span> fossils were examined, there were no spongy bone deposits. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.37" data-time="259.55">[04:19.55]</span>Student: Meaning that those dinosaurs on the nests were probably adult males who wouldn't have needed <span class="underline">calcium</span> for making eggshells. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.16" data-time="266.92">[04:26.92]</span>Professor: Exactly. And then there's this: birds like the kiwi, the <span class="underline">ostrich</span> and the emu; they share certain <span class="underline">physical</span> characteristics with these dinosaurs.<span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="276.08">[04:36.08]</span>And interestingly, they also show a <span class="underline">consistent</span> <span class="underline">pattern</span> of <span class="underline">nest</span> <span class="underline">care</span> by the <span class="underline">male</span>. </p>
