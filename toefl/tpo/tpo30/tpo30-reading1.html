          <h4 class="w3-center">Role of Play in Development</h4>
          <p>Play is easier to <span class="highlight">define</span> with examples than with concepts. In any case, in animals it consists of leaping, running, climbing, throwing, wrestling, and other movements, either <span class="highlight">along</span>, with objects, or with other animals. Depending on the <span class="highlight">species</span>, play may be <span class="highlight">primarily</span> for social <span class="highlight">interaction</span>, <span class="highlight">exercise</span>, or <span class="highlight">exploration</span>. One of the problems in providing a <span class="highlight">clear</span> <span class="highlight">definition</span> of play is that it involves the same behaviors that take place in other circumstance--dominance, <span class="highlight">predation</span>, competition, and real fighting. Thus, whether play occurs or not depends on the intention of the animals, and the intentions are not always <span class="highlight">clear</span> from behaviors alone.</p>
          <p>Play appears to be a developmental <span class="highlight">characteristic</span> of animals with <span class="highlight">fairly</span> <span class="highlight">sophisticated</span> nervous systems, mainly birds and mammals. Play has been studied most extensively in primates and canids (dogs). Exactly why animals play is still a matter debated in the research <span class="highlight">literature</span>, and the reasons may not be the same for every <span class="highlight">species</span> that plays. Determining the functions of play is difficult because the functions may be long-term, with <span class="highlight">beneficial</span> effects not showing up until the animal's adulthood.</p>
          <p>Play is not without <span class="highlight"><span class="question3">considerable</span></span> costs to the <span class="highlight">individual</span> animal. Play is usually very active, involving movement in <span class="highlight">space</span> and, at times, noisemaking. <span class="highlight">Therefore</span>, it results in the loss of <span class="highlight">fuel</span> or energy that might better be used for growth or for building up fat stores in a young animal. Another <span class="highlight">potential</span> <span class="highlight">cost</span> of this <span class="highlight">activity</span> is greater <span class="highlight">exposure</span> to predators since play is attention-getting <span class="highlight">behavior</span>. Great activities also increase the risk of injury in slipping or falling.</p>
          <p>The benefits of play must <span class="highlight">outweigh</span> costs, or play would not have evolved, according to Darwin' s <span class="highlight">theory</span>. Some of the <span class="highlight">potential</span> benefits <span class="highlight">relate</span> directly to the healthy <span class="highlight">development</span> of the brain and nervous system. In one research study, two groups of young rats were raised under different conditions. One group developed in an "enriched" environment, which allowed the rats to <span class="highlight">interact</span> with other rats, play with toys, and receive <span class="highlight">maze</span> training. The other group lived in an "impoverished" environment in <span class="highlight">individual</span> cages in a dimly lit room with little <span class="highlight">stimulation</span>. At the end of the experiments, the results showed that the actual weight of the brains of the impoverished rats was less than that of those raised in the enriched environment (<span class="question5">though they were fed the same diets</span>). Other studies have shown that greater <span class="highlight">stimulation</span> not only affects the size of the brain but also increase the number of connections between the nerve cells. Thus, active play may provide necessary <span class="highlight">stimulation</span> to the growth of synaptic connections in the brain, especially the cerebellum, which is <span class="highlight">responsible</span> for <span class="highlight">motor</span> functioning and movements.</p>
          <p>Play also stimulates the <span class="highlight">development</span> of the <span class="highlight">muscle</span> tissues themselves and may provide the opportunities to practice those movements needed for <span class="highlight">survival</span>. Prey <span class="highlight">species</span>, like young deer or goats, for example, typically play by performing sudden flight movements and turns, whereas <span class="highlight">predator</span> <span class="highlight">species</span>, such as cats, practice stalking, pouncing, and biting.</p>
          <p>Play allows a young animal to <span class="highlight">explore</span> its environment and practice skill in <span class="highlight"><span class="question8">comparative</span></span> safety since the surrounding adults generally do not <span class="highlight">expect</span> the young to <span class="highlight">deal</span> with threats or predators. Play can also provide practice in social behaviors needed for <span class="highlight">courtship</span> and mating. <span class="question9">Learning <span class="highlight">appropriate</span> social behaviors is especially important for <span class="highlight">species</span> that live in groups, like young monkeys that needed to learn to control selfishness and <span class="highlight">aggression</span> and to understand the give-and-take involved in social groups.</span> They need to learn how to be <span class="highlight">dominant</span> and <span class="highlight">submissive</span> because each monkey might have to play either role in the future. Most of these things are learned in the long developmental periods that primates have, during which they <span class="highlight">engage</span> in countless play experiences with their peers.</p>
          <p>There is a danger, of <span class="highlight">course</span>, that play may be misinterpreted or not recognized as play by others, <span class="question11">potentially</span> <span class="highlight">leading</span> to <span class="highlight">aggression</span>.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>This is especially true when play consists of practicing normal <span class="highlight">aggressive</span> or <span class="highlight">predator</span> behaviors. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>Thus, many <span class="highlight">species</span> have evolved <span class="highlight">clear</span> signals to <span class="highlight">delineate</span> playfulness. 
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>Dogs, for example, will wag their tails, get down their front legs, and <span class="highlight">stick</span> their behinds in the <span class="highlight">air</span> to <span class="highlight">indicate</span> "what follows is just for play." <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p>

The fourth sentence "One of the problems in providing a clear definition of play is that it involves the same behaviors that take place in other circumstance --dominance, predation, competition, and real fighting." It is very difficult to provide a clear definition of play, because play includes some actions that occur in other situations, such as dominance, predation, competition, and fighting. So answer B.</p>

              <p>Correct answer A. Look at the last two sentences of the second paragraph. The penultimate sentence says that the reason for animal play is still being debating. It is very difficult to say that the function of determining play is very difficult. This corresponds to the challenge of the original question. Because of the reasons behind, said that these functions are long, and its beneficial to appear until the adult animals. So match with the A option. The original options for B and C were not mentioned. The D option also has nothing to do with the problem.</p>

              <p>Correct answer A. In the original text, other views were described starting from other studies. Said greater stimulation will not only affect the size of the brain, but also increase the number of connections between nerve cells, and this stimulation is provided by the active play. According to the above, the more complex the environment is, the more active play is, so the more stimulation, the bigger the animal's brain will be. So the A option fits this idea.

              <p>Correct answer A. Comparative is relative, quite. A is relative; B is temporary; C is sufficient; D is completed. So choose A. Here, C may be an confusing option, because its meaning is brought into the original text and it is smooth, but it loses the meaning of "comparison" of the original word.</p>

            <div class="explanation">
              <p>Correct answer C. The backbone of the original sentence in this question is learning social behavior is important, especially for gregarious animals. Then use monkey for illustration. The A option only mentions that monkeys want to control themselves to be able to integrate into the group, but does not mention the main section. The B option says selfish and aggressive social behavior, which excludes other animals and changes the meaning of the original sentence. C is correct, not only mentions monke y but also other social animals (which means species that live in groups) to learn social behavior in order to integrate into groups. D is the wrong choice. The original did not say that the monkey was too selfish to understand that giving and take... was inconsistent with the original.</p>

            <div class="explanation">
              <p>Correct answer: C. Locate the first sentence of the sixth paragraph based on young and adult. Says adult animals to make young animals play in a relatively safe environment. So you can get the answer C correct. The original A did not say that young should learn how to dominate. Although the B text mentioned social group, it did not mention that it was learned from adults. There is no relevant description of D in the original text.</p>
