In any case, in animals it consists of leaping, running, climbing, throwing, wrestling, and other movements, either <span class="highlight">along</span>, with objects, or with other animals. Depending on the <span class="highlight">species</span>, play may be <span class="highlight">primarily</span> for social <span class="highlight">interaction</span>, <span class="highlight">exercise</span>, or <span class="highlight">exploration</span>. One of the problems in providing a <span class="highlight">clear</span><span class="highlight">definition</span> of play is that it involves the same behaviors that take place in other circumstance--dominance, <span class="highlight">predation</span>, competition, and real fighting. Thus, whether play occurs or not depends on the intention of the animals, and the intentions are not always <span class="highlight">clear</span> from behaviors alone.</p><p>Play appears to be a developmental <span class="highlight">characteristic</span> of animals with <span class="highlight">fairly</span><span class="highlight">sophisticated</span> nervous systems, mainly birds and mammals. Play has been studied most extensively in primates and canids (dogs). Exactly why animals play is still a matter debated in the research <span class="highlight">literature</span>, and the reasons may not be the same for every <span class="highlight">species</span> that plays. Determining the functions of play is difficult because the functions may be long-term, with <span class="highlight">beneficial</span> effects not showing up until the animal's adulthood.</p><p>Play is not without <span class="highlight"><span class="question3">considerable</span></span> costs to the <span class="highlight">individual</span> animal. Play is usually very active, involving movement in <span class="highlight">space</span> and, at times, noisemaking. <span class="highlight">Therefore</span>, it results in the loss of <span class="highlight">fuel</span> or energy that might better be used for growth or for building up fat stores in a young animal. Another <span class="highlight">potential</span><span class="highlight">cost</span> of this <span class="highlight">activity</span> is greater <span class="highlight">exposure</span> to predators since play is attention-getting <span class="highlight">behavior</span>. Great activities also increase the risk of injury in slipping or falling.</p><p>The benefits of play must <span class="highlight">outweigh</span> costs, or play would not have evolved, according to Darwin' s <span class="highlight">theory</span>. Some of the <span class="highlight">potential</span> benefits <span class="highlight">relate</span> directly to the healthy <span class="highlight">development</span> of the brain and nervous system. In one research study, two groups of young rats were raised under different conditions. One group developed in an "enriched" environment, which allowed the rats to <span class="highlight">interact</span> with other rats, play with toys, and receive <span class="highlight">maze</span> training. The other group lived in an "impoverished" environment in <span class="highlight">individual</span> cages in a dimly lit room with little <span class="highlight">stimulation</span>. At the end of the experiments, the results showed that the actual weight of the brains of the impoverished rats was less than that of those raised in the enriched environment (<span class="question5">though they were fed the same diets</span>). Other studies have shown that greater <span class="highlight">stimulation</span> not only affects the size of the brain but also increase the number of connections between the nerve cells. Thus, active play may provide necessary <span class="highlight">stimulation</span> to the growth of synaptic connections in the brain, especially the cerebellum, which is <span class="highlight">responsible</span> for <span class="highlight">motor</span> functioning and movements.</p><p>Play also stimulates the <span class="highlight">development</span> of the <span class="highlight">muscle</span> tissues themselves and may provide the opportunities to practice those movements needed for <span class="highlight">survival</span>. Prey <span class="highlight">species</span>, like young deer or goats, for example, typically play by performing sudden flight movements and turns, whereas <span class="highlight">predator</span><span class="highlight">species</span>, such as cats, practice stalking, pouncing, and biting.</p><p>Play allows a young animal to <span class="highlight">explore</span> its environment and practice skill in <span class="highlight"><span class="question8">comparative</span></span> safety since the surrounding adults generally do not <span class="highlight">expect</span> the young to <span class="highlight">deal</span> with threats or predators. Play can also provide practice in social behaviors needed for <span class="highlight">courtship</span> and mating. <span class="question9">Learning <span class="highlight">appropriate</span> social behaviors is especially important for <span class="highlight">species</span> that live in groups, like young monkeys that needed to learn to control selfishness and <span class="highlight">aggression</span> and to understand the give-and-take involved in social groups.</span> They need to learn how to be <span class="highlight">dominant</span> and <span class="highlight">submissive</span> because each monkey might have to play either role in the future. Most of these things are learned in the long developmental periods that primates have, during which they <span class="highlight">engage</span> in countless play experiences with their peers.</p><p>There is a danger, of <span class="highlight">course</span>, that play may be misinterpreted or not recognized as play by others, <span class="question11">potentially</span><span class="highlight">leading</span> to <span class="highlight">aggression</span>.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>This is especially true when play consists of practicing normal <span class="highlight">aggressive</span> or <span class="highlight">predator</span> behaviors. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>Thus, many <span class="highlight">species</span> have evolved <span class="highlight">clear</span> signals to <span class="highlight">delineate</span> playfulness. 
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>Dogs, for example, will wag their tails, get down their front legs, and <span class="highlight">stick</span> their behinds in the <span class="highlight">air</span> to <span class="highlight">indicate</span> "what follows is just for play." <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 1, why is play difficult to define?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Play must be defined with concepts, not examples.</p><p>B. Play behavior often looks like nonplay behavior</p><p>C. Play often occurs in the presence of animals that are not playing</p><p>D. Play occurs independently of an animal's intentions</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>. The fourth sentence "One of the problems in providing a clear definition of play is that it involves the same behaviors that take place in other circumstance --dominance, predation, competition, and real fighting." It is very difficult to provide a clear definition of play, because play includes some actions that occur in other situations, such as dominance, predation, competition, and fighting. So answer B.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 2, which of the following presents a particular challenge to researchers who study play behavior in animals</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The delay between activities and the benefits the animal derives from them.</p><p>B. The difficulty in determining which animal species play and which do not.</p><p>C. The fact that for most animals, there is no clear transition from youth to full adulthood.</p><p>D. The lack of research on the play behavior of animals other than canids and primates.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>Correct answer A. Look at the last two sentences of the second paragraph. The penultimate sentence says that the reason for animal play is still being debating. It is very difficult to say that the function of determining play is very difficult. This corresponds to the challenge of the original question. Because of the reasons behind, said that these functions are long, and its beneficial to appear until the adult animals. So match with the A option. The original options for B and C were not mentioned. The D option also has nothing to do with the problem.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question3">considerable</span></span>"in the passage is closest in the meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Initial</p><p>B. Practical</p><p>C. Eventually</p><p>D. Significant</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" D"><p>Correct answer: D. Considerable: Important, worth considering. Option A is initial, B is practical, C is final, and D is significant and meaningful. So D meets, and later on various costs and losses. So it can be understood that <span class="question3">considerable</span> cost can be understood as a certain amount of loss or risk.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 3, each of the following is a cost to animals that engage in play EXCEPT</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. exposure to predators</p><p>B. a buildup of fat stores</p><p>C. a loss of fuel that could be used for growth</p><p>D. risk of injury from slipping or falling</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B From the beginning of Therefore are potentialcost. The three costs have been marked in red. The B option seems to be mentioned, but the original text says that the fat store is lost, not because it builds up. So B is wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the author include the comment "<span class="highlight"><span class="question5">though they were fed the same diets</span></span>"?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To show why rats living in impoverished environments need less food than those living in enriched environments</p><p>B. To eliminate the possibility that differences in diet were responsibly for observed differences in brain weight</p><p>C. To emphasize the point that rats were fed only the amount of food needed to keep them alive</p><p>D. To suggest that rats fed the same diet have smaller brains than those fed a varied food</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>B. The results of the tests mentioned here. The test was described starting from in one research of study and referring to two contrast groups under different conditions. This is followed by the results. The contents in parentheses are explanations of the conclusions. A, C, D three options do not touch the edge. As long as mathematics in high schools knows that this is a test of controlled variables, the answer is B.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Paragraph 4 supports which of the following statements about an animal's brain.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The heavier the brain, the richer the environment in which the animal was raised.</p><p>B. The younger the animal, the harder it is to develop new connections between nerve cells.</p><p>C. The larger the animal, the harder it is to develop new connections between nerve cells.</p><p>D. The larger the animal's cerebellum, the larger will be the animal's nerve cells.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>Correct answer A. In the original text, other views were described starting from other studies. Said greater stimulation will not only affect the size of the brain, but also increase the number of connections between nerve cells, and this stimulation is provided by the active play. According to the above, the more complex the environment is, the more active play is, so the more stimulation, the bigger the animal's brain will be. So the A option fits this idea. BCD did not mention it.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 5, why might play behavior of prey species be different from those of predator species?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Unlike predator species, prey species use play to prevent inappropriate social behaviors, such as biting.</p><p>B. Some prey species are physically incapable of certain types of predator movements.</p><p>C. The survival of each species type is linked to particular sets of muscular movements.</p><p>D. Predator species have more opportunities to practice play behaviors than prey species.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Correct answer C. The key word for this question is needed for survival. Because prey species and predator species have different requirements for survival, their play behavior is also different. So choose C. A, B, D did not mention the original.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question8">comparative</span></span>"in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. relative</p><p>B. temporary</p><p>C. sufficient</p><p>D. complete</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" A"><p>Correct answer A. Comparative is relative, quite. A is relative; B is temporary; C is sufficient; D is completed. So choose A. Here, C may be an confusing option, because its meaning is brought into the original text and it is smooth, but it loses the meaning of "comparison" of the original word.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Only monkeys that have learned to control their selfish and aggressive behaviors can be involved in social groups.</p><p>B. Selfish and aggressive animals like monkeys live in groups in order to practice appropriate social behaviors.</p><p>C. Monkeys and other social animals need to learn behaviors appropriate for their social groups.</p><p>D. Some monkeys are naturally too selfish and aggressive to understand the give-and-take of social groups, so they learn such important behaviors while young.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Correct answer C. The backbone of the original sentence in this question is learning social behavior is important, especially for gregarious animals. Then use monkey for illustration. The A option only mentions that monkeys want to control themselves to be able to integrate into the group, but does not mention the main section. The B option says selfish and aggressive social behavior, which excludes other animals and changes the meaning of the original sentence. C is correct, not only mentions monke y but also other social animals (which means species that live in groups) to learn social behavior in order to integrate into groups. D is the wrong choice. The original did not say that the monkey was too selfish to understand that giving and take... was inconsistent with the original.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What can be inferred from paragraph 6 about the role of adults in play activities of the young?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Adults help their young learn to become dominant within the social group.</p><p>B. Young animals learn how to play from the adults within their social group.</p><p>C. Adults allow the young to engage in play behaviors within a protected, sage environment.</p><p>D. The long developmental period of some animals allows adults more time to teach their young how to deal with the threats of predators.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Correct answer: C. Locate the first sentence of the sixth paragraph based on young and adult. Says adult animals to make young animals play in a relatively safe environment. So you can get the answer C correct. The original A did not say that young should learn how to dominate. Although the B text mentioned social group, it did not mention that it was learned from adults. There is no relevant description of D in the original text.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question11">potentially</span></span>"in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. undoubtedly</p><p>B. possibly</p><p>C. unfortunately</p><p>D. quickly</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>Correct answer: B. Potentially. A city is without doubt; B is possible; C is unfortunately; D is fast. The first half of the sentence, May be, expresses one possibility, and there is no turning point in the latter part of the sentence. So the meaning should be near.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 7, how do some animals ensure that other animals understand that they are just playing?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. By playing only with animals who are not predator</p><p>B. By avoiding any aspects of the play behavior that are dangerous</p><p>C. By practicing nonaggressive and non-predatory behaviors</p><p>D. By using a set of signals that occurs only in play</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The first half of this paragraph has been describing the aggression between animals that they mistakenly believe, and the way in which the thus proves that there will be a solution. The solution here is to use clear signals to express playfulness. So the answer is D</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>With messages such as those, even dogs that are strangers to each other can be playing within a few minutes..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>Correct answer D. The sentence to be inserted begins with With message such as those, then the description will definitely describe a message, followed by even dogs, which proves that the dog behavior should also be mentioned. So this should be inserted in the last empty space.</p></div></div><div id="question14" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>Play appears to be a developmental characteristic of animals with fairly sophisticated nervous systems, mainly birds and mammals.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.Although play often resembles aggression, flight, or other purposeful activities, researchers do not agree on the reasons for and functions of play</p><p>B.Although many animals develop physically from play, too many young animals become victims of their natural predators while playing.</p><p>C.Animals such as rats, dogs, deer, goats and monkeys learn how to be both dominant and submissive during play activities so that they will fit in better with their adult social groups.</p><p>D.The function of play is still debated in the research literature primarily because each animal species uses so few of the many available types of play behavior.</p><p>E.Energy expenditure and security risks are some of the costs to animals of play behavior, but the costs are not so great that they outweigh the long-term benefits of play to the species.</p><p>F.As experiments and observations have shown, animals that play at some stages of their development obtain neurological, muscular, or social benefits from the play behaviors.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="AEF"><p>The AEF option A corresponds to the first paragraph of the original text. The behavior of play mentioned includes the behavior of running, climbing, fighting, etc. aggression, but it is difficult to determine its function so that A is correct. This is not mentioned in the original B. Although the third paragraph mentions the potential cost, the adults will usually let the young play under relatively safe conditions, but it does not mean that too many small animals have become victims. Do not choose. The original text of C said that although they wanted to learn social behavior, they did not mention that such animals should learn to dominate and not to choose. The D option corresponds to the first paragraph of the original text, but the reason in the option is not consistent with the original text and is not selected. E corresponds to the third paragraph of the original text, potential cost refers to the loss of energy, security risks and so on, but the first paragraph also mentioned that play is long-term beneficial, the beginning of the fourth paragraph said that the benefits will outweigh its costs. correct. The F option corresponds to the fourth and fifth paragraphs of the original text. The fourth paragraph said that play will affect brain development, the number of connections between nerve cells. The fifth paragraph speaks of the development of a muscle tissue. The sixth paragraph also mentions social benefits. Correct, choose.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
