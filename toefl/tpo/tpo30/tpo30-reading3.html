          <h4 class="w3-center">The Invention of the Mechanical Clock</h4>
          <p>In Europe, before the <span class="highlight">introduction</span> of the <span class="highlight">mechanical</span> clock, people told time by sun (using, for example, shadow sticks or sun dials) and water clocks. Sun clocks worked, of <span class="highlight">course</span>, only on <span class="highlight">clear</span> days; water clocks misbehaved when the <span class="highlight">temperature</span> fell toward freezing, to say nothing of long-run <span class="highlight">drift</span> as the result of <span class="highlight">sedimentation</span> and clogging. Both these devices worked well in sunny climates; but <span class="question1">in northern Europe the sun may be hidden by clouds for weeks at a time, while temperatures <span class="highlight">vary</span> not only seasonally but from day to night</span></p>
          <p>
            <span class="highlight">Medieval</span> Europe gave new importance to <span class="highlight">reliable</span> time. The Catholic Church had its seven daily prayers, one of which was at night, requiring an <span class="highlight">alarm</span> arrangement to waken monks before <span class="highlight">dawn</span>. And then the new cities and towns, squeezed by their walls, had to know and order time in order to organize <span class="highlight">collective</span> <span class="highlight">activity</span> and <span class="highlight">ration</span> <span class="highlight">space</span>. They set a time to go to sleep,to open the <span class="highlight">market</span> ,to close the <span class="highlight">market</span> ,to leave work ,and finally a time to put out fires and to go to sleep. All this was <span class="highlight">compatible</span> with older devices so long as there was only one <span class="question4">authoritative</span> timekeeper; but with <span class="highlight">urban</span> growth and the multiplication of time signals, discrepancy brought <span class="highlight">discord</span> and strife. Society needed a more <span class="highlight">dependable</span> <span class="highlight">instrument</span> of time <span class="highlight">measurement</span> and found it in the <span class="highlight">mechanical</span> clock.</p>
          <p>We do not know who invented this machine, or where. It seems to have appeared in Italy and England (perhaps <span class="highlight">simultaneous</span> invention) between 1275 and 1300. Once known, it <span class="highlight">spread</span> rapidly, driving out water clocks but not <span class="highlight">solar</span> dials, which were needed to <span class="highlight">check</span> the new machines against <span class="question5">the timekeeper of last <span class="highlight">resort</span>.</span> These early versions were <span class="highlight"><span class="question6">rudimentary</span></span>, inaccurate, and <span class="highlight">prone</span> to breakdown.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="highlight">Ironically</span>, the new machine tended to undermine Catholic Church <span class="highlight">authority</span>. Although church <span class="highlight">ritual</span> had <span class="highlight">sustained</span> an <span class="highlight">interest</span> in timekeeping <span class="highlight">throughout</span> the centuries of <span class="highlight">urban</span> <span class="highlight">collapse</span>
 that followed the fall of Rome, church time was nature' s time. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>Day and night were divided into the same number of parts, so that except at the equinoxes, days and night hours were <span class="highlight">unequal</span>;
 and then of <span class="highlight">course</span> the length of these hours <span class="highlight">varied</span> with the seasons. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>But the <span class="highlight">mechanical</span> clock kept <span class="highlight">equal</span> hours, and this implied a new time reckoning. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>The Catholic Church resisted, 
 not coming over to the new hours for about a <span class="highlight">century</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>From the start, however, the towns and cities took <span class="highlight">equal</span> hours as their <span class="highlight">standard</span>, and the public clocks <span class="question8">installed</span> in town halls and <span class="highlight">market</span> 
 squares became the very <span class="highlight">symbol</span> of a new, <span class="highlight">secular</span> <span class="highlight">municipal</span> <span class="highlight">authority</span>. Every town <span class="highlight">wanted</span> one; conquerors seized them as especially <span class="highlight">precious</span> spoils of war; tourists came to see and hear these 
 machines the way they made pilgrimages to <span class="highlight">sacred</span> relics.</p>
          <p>The clock was the greatest achievement of <span class="highlight">medieval</span> <span class="highlight">mechanical</span> <span class="highlight">ingenuity</span>. Its general <span class="highlight">accuracy</span> could be <span class="highlight">checked</span> against easily observed phenomena, like the rising and <span class="highlight">setting</span> of the sun. The result was <span class="highlight">relentless</span> <span class="highlight">pressure</span> to <span class="highlight">improve</span> <span class="highlight">technique</span> and design. At every <span class="highlight">stage</span>, clockmakers led the way to <span class="highlight">accuracy</span> and precision; they became masters of miniaturization, detectors and correctors of error, searchers for new and better. They were thus the <span class="question11">pioneers</span> of <span class="highlight">mechanical</span> <span class="highlight">engineering</span> and served as examples and teachers to other branches of <span class="highlight">engineering</span>.</p>
          <p>The clock brought order and control, both <span class="highlight">collective</span> and <span class="highlight">personal</span>. Its public <span class="highlight">display</span> and private <span class="highlight">possession</span> laid the basis for <span class="highlight">temporal</span> autonomy: people could now <span class="highlight">coordinate</span> comings and goings without dictation from above. The clock provided the punctuation marks for group <span class="highlight">activity</span>, while enabling individuals to order their own work (and that of others) so as to <span class="highlight">enhance</span> <span class="highlight">productivity</span>. Indeed, the very <span class="highlight">notion</span> of <span class="highlight">productivity</span> is a <span class="highlight">by-product</span> of the clock: once on can <span class="highlight">relate</span> performance to <span class="highlight">uniform</span> time units, work is never the same. One moves from the task-oriented time <span class="highlight">consciousness</span> of the peasant (working on job after another, as time and light <span class="highlight">permit</span>) and the time-filling busyness of the <span class="highlight">domestic</span> servant (who always had something to do) to an effort to maximize product per unit of time.</p>

              <p>B does not have a particularly good positioning word and requires a comprehensive understanding. The fifth paragraph mainly states that clockmaker leads the development of accurate and precise engineering. They are master, teacher, etc. Then they are said to be <span class="question11">pioneers</span>, but these are because they are watchmakers. This paragraph does not say how the tabulators work, so How can the A option not be answered. The option B's Why coincides with the first half of the entire segment. So this question chooses B. The method of mechanical clock making of the C option was not mentioned in the original text; there was no mention of the things that influenced the design of the D option.</p>

              <p>There is a key phrase division of time in the C original sentence. This phrase appears at the beginning of the insertion sentence, and is modified with the definite article the. It must be mentioned before. The sentence negates the reflected of the organization of religious ritual. The description should also have mentioned this before. The only options that match this feature are B and C. Of these two options, the obvious C option is more appropriate, because the B option has not yet begun to negate and has not begun to turn. Put B very abruptly. The sentence before the C option turns with but, placed in C just in this direction.</p>
