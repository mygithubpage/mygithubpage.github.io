            <b>The Invention of the Mechanical Clock</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>In Europe, before the <span class="underline">introduction</span> of the <span class="underline">mechanical</span> clock, people told time by sun (using, for example, shadow sticks or sun dials) and water clocks. Sun clocks worked, of <span class="underline">course</span>, only on <span class="underline">clear</span> days; water clocks misbehaved when the <span class="underline">temperature</span> fell toward freezing, to say nothing of long-run <span class="underline">drift</span> as the result of <span class="underline">sedimentation</span> and clogging. Both these devices worked well in sunny climates; but <span class="light">in northern Europe the sun may be hidden by clouds for weeks at a time, while temperatures <span class="underline">vary</span> not only seasonally but from day to night</span></p>
          <p>
            <span class="underline">Medieval</span> Europe gave new importance to <span class="underline">reliable</span> time. The Catholic Church had its seven daily prayers, one of which was at night, requiring an <span class="underline">alarm</span> arrangement to waken monks before <span class="underline">dawn</span>. And then the new cities and towns, squeezed by their walls, had to know and order time in order to organize <span class="underline">collective</span> <span class="underline">activity</span> and <span class="underline">ration</span> <span class="underline">space</span>. They set a time to go to sleep,to open the <span class="underline">market</span> ,to close the <span class="underline">market</span> ,to leave work ,and finally a time to put out fires and to go to sleep. All this was <span class="underline">compatible</span> with older devices so long as there was only one authoritative timekeeper; but with <span class="underline">urban</span> growth and the multiplication of time signals, discrepancy brought <span class="underline">discord</span> and strife. Society needed a more <span class="underline">dependable</span> <span class="underline">instrument</span> of time <span class="underline">measurement</span> and found it in the <span class="underline">mechanical</span> clock.</p>
          <p>We do not know who invented this machine, or where. It seems to have appeared in Italy and England (perhaps <span class="underline">simultaneous</span> invention) between 1275 and 1300. Once known, it <span class="underline">spread</span> rapidly, driving out water clocks but not <span class="underline">solar</span> dials, which were needed to <span class="underline">check</span> the new machines against the timekeeper of last <span class="underline">resort</span>. These early versions were <span class="underline">rudimentary</span>, inaccurate, and <span class="underline">prone</span> to breakdown.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="underline">Ironically</span>, the new machine tended to undermine Catholic Church <span class="underline">authority</span>. Although church <span class="underline">ritual</span> had <span class="underline">sustained</span> an <span class="underline">interest</span> in timekeeping <span class="underline">throughout</span> the centuries of <span class="underline">urban</span> <span class="underline">collapse</span>
 that followed the fall of Rome, church time was nature' s time. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>Day and night were divided into the same number of parts, so that except at the equinoxes, days and night hours were <span class="underline">unequal</span>;
 and then of <span class="underline">course</span> the length of these hours <span class="underline">varied</span> with the seasons. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>But the <span class="underline">mechanical</span> clock kept <span class="underline">equal</span> hours, and this implied a new time reckoning. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>The Catholic Church resisted, 
 not coming over to the new hours for about a <span class="underline">century</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>From the start, however, the towns and cities took <span class="underline">equal</span> hours as their <span class="underline">standard</span>, and the public clocks installed in town halls and <span class="underline">market</span> 
 squares became the very <span class="underline">symbol</span> of a new, <span class="underline">secular</span> <span class="underline">municipal</span> <span class="underline">authority</span>. Every town <span class="underline">wanted</span> one; conquerors seized them as especially <span class="underline">precious</span> spoils of war; tourists came to see and hear these 
 machines the way they made pilgrimages to <span class="underline">sacred</span> relics.</p>
          <p>The clock was the greatest achievement of <span class="underline">medieval</span> <span class="underline">mechanical</span> <span class="underline">ingenuity</span>. Its general <span class="underline">accuracy</span> could be <span class="underline">checked</span> against easily observed phenomena, like the rising and <span class="underline">setting</span> of the sun. The result was <span class="underline">relentless</span> <span class="underline">pressure</span> to <span class="underline">improve</span> <span class="underline">technique</span> and design. At every <span class="underline">stage</span>, clockmakers led the way to <span class="underline">accuracy</span> and precision; they became masters of miniaturization, detectors and correctors of error, searchers for new and better. They were thus the pioneers of <span class="underline">mechanical</span> <span class="underline">engineering</span> and served as examples and teachers to other branches of <span class="underline">engineering</span>.</p>
          <p>The clock brought order and control, both <span class="underline">collective</span> and <span class="underline">personal</span>. Its public <span class="underline">display</span> and private <span class="underline">possession</span> laid the basis for <span class="underline">temporal</span> autonomy: people could now <span class="underline">coordinate</span> comings and goings without dictation from above. The clock provided the punctuation marks for group <span class="underline">activity</span>, while enabling individuals to order their own work (and that of others) so as to <span class="underline">enhance</span> <span class="underline">productivity</span>. Indeed, the very <span class="underline">notion</span> of <span class="underline">productivity</span> is a <span class="underline">by-product</span> of the clock: once on can <span class="underline">relate</span> performance to <span class="underline">uniform</span> time units, work is never the same. One moves from the task-oriented time <span class="underline">consciousness</span> of the peasant (working on job after another, as time and light <span class="underline">permit</span>) and the time-filling busyness of the <span class="underline">domestic</span> servant (who always had something to do) to an effort to maximize product per unit of time.</p>
