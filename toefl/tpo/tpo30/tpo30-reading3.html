Sun clocks worked, of <span class="highlight">course</span>, only on <span class="highlight">clear</span> days; water clocks misbehaved when the <span class="highlight">temperature</span> fell toward freezing, to say nothing of long-run <span class="highlight">drift</span> as the result of <span class="highlight">sedimentation</span> and clogging. Both these devices worked well in sunny climates; but <span class="question1">in northern Europe the sun may be hidden by clouds for weeks at a time, while temperatures <span class="highlight">vary</span> not only seasonally but from day to night</span></p><p><span class="highlight">Medieval</span> Europe gave new importance to <span class="highlight">reliable</span> time. The Catholic Church had its seven daily prayers, one of which was at night, requiring an <span class="highlight">alarm</span> arrangement to waken monks before <span class="highlight">dawn</span>. And then the new cities and towns, squeezed by their walls, had to know and order time in order to organize <span class="highlight">collective</span><span class="highlight">activity</span> and <span class="highlight">ration</span><span class="highlight">space</span>. They set a time to go to sleep,to open the <span class="highlight">market</span> ,to close the <span class="highlight">market</span> ,to leave work ,and finally a time to put out fires and to go to sleep. All this was <span class="highlight">compatible</span> with older devices so long as there was only one <span class="question4">authoritative</span> timekeeper; but with <span class="highlight">urban</span> growth and the multiplication of time signals, discrepancy brought <span class="highlight">discord</span> and strife. Society needed a more <span class="highlight">dependable</span><span class="highlight">instrument</span> of time <span class="highlight">measurement</span> and found it in the <span class="highlight">mechanical</span> clock.</p><p>We do not know who invented this machine, or where. It seems to have appeared in Italy and England (perhaps <span class="highlight">simultaneous</span> invention) between 1275 and 1300. Once known, it <span class="highlight">spread</span> rapidly, driving out water clocks but not <span class="highlight">solar</span> dials, which were needed to <span class="highlight">check</span> the new machines against <span class="question5">the timekeeper of last <span class="highlight">resort</span>.</span> These early versions were <span class="highlight"><span class="question6">rudimentary</span></span>, inaccurate, and <span class="highlight">prone</span> to breakdown.</p><p><span class="highlight">Ironically</span>, the new machine tended to undermine Catholic Church <span class="highlight">authority</span>. Although church <span class="highlight">ritual</span> had <span class="highlight">sustained</span> an <span class="highlight">interest</span> in timekeeping <span class="highlight">throughout</span> the centuries of <span class="highlight">urban</span><span class="highlight">collapse</span>
 that followed the fall of Rome, church time was nature' s time. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>Day and night were divided into the same number of parts, so that except at the equinoxes, days and night hours were <span class="highlight">unequal</span>;
 and then of <span class="highlight">course</span> the length of these hours <span class="highlight">varied</span> with the seasons. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>But the <span class="highlight">mechanical</span> clock kept <span class="highlight">equal</span> hours, and this implied a new time reckoning. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>The Catholic Church resisted, 
 not coming over to the new hours for about a <span class="highlight">century</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>From the start, however, the towns and cities took <span class="highlight">equal</span> hours as their <span class="highlight">standard</span>, and the public clocks <span class="question8">installed</span> in town halls and <span class="highlight">market</span> 
 squares became the very <span class="highlight">symbol</span> of a new, <span class="highlight">secular</span><span class="highlight">municipal</span><span class="highlight">authority</span>. Every town <span class="highlight">wanted</span> one; conquerors seized them as especially <span class="highlight">precious</span> spoils of war; tourists came to see and hear these 
 machines the way they made pilgrimages to <span class="highlight">sacred</span> relics.</p><p>The clock was the greatest achievement of <span class="highlight">medieval</span><span class="highlight">mechanical</span><span class="highlight">ingenuity</span>. Its general <span class="highlight">accuracy</span> could be <span class="highlight">checked</span> against easily observed phenomena, like the rising and <span class="highlight">setting</span> of the sun. The result was <span class="highlight">relentless</span><span class="highlight">pressure</span> to <span class="highlight">improve</span><span class="highlight">technique</span> and design. At every <span class="highlight">stage</span>, clockmakers led the way to <span class="highlight">accuracy</span> and precision; they became masters of miniaturization, detectors and correctors of error, searchers for new and better. They were thus the <span class="question11">pioneers</span> of <span class="highlight">mechanical</span><span class="highlight">engineering</span> and served as examples and teachers to other branches of <span class="highlight">engineering</span>.</p><p>The clock brought order and control, both <span class="highlight">collective</span> and <span class="highlight">personal</span>. Its public <span class="highlight">display</span> and private <span class="highlight">possession</span> laid the basis for <span class="highlight">temporal</span> autonomy: people could now <span class="highlight">coordinate</span> comings and goings without dictation from above. The clock provided the punctuation marks for group <span class="highlight">activity</span>, while enabling individuals to order their own work (and that of others) so as to <span class="highlight">enhance</span><span class="highlight">productivity</span>. Indeed, the very <span class="highlight">notion</span> of <span class="highlight">productivity</span> is a <span class="highlight">by-product</span> of the clock: once on can <span class="highlight">relate</span> performance to <span class="highlight">uniform</span> time units, work is never the same. One moves from the task-oriented time <span class="highlight">consciousness</span> of the peasant (working on job after another, as time and light <span class="highlight">permit</span>) and the time-filling busyness of the <span class="highlight">domestic</span> servant (who always had something to do) to an effort to maximize product per unit of time.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the author provide the information that "<span class="highlight">in northern Europe the sun may be hidden by clouds for weeks at a time, while temperatures vary not only seasonally but from day to night</span>"?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To emphasize the variety of environments in which people used sun and water clocks to tell time</p><p>B. To illustrate the disadvantage of sun and water clocks</p><p>C. To provide an example of an area where water clocks have an advantage over sun clocks</p><p>D. To counter the claim that sun and water clocks were used all over Europe</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="in northern Europe the sun may be hidden by clouds for weeks at a time, while temperatures vary not only seasonally but from day to night B"><p>Correct answer B. Starting from the second sentence of the first paragraph, the source lists the various shortcomings of the two devices. The first sentence of the last sentence says that they work, and the latter turns but the table proves that there are situations in which they cannot be used. So choose B.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 2, all of the following are examples of the importance of timekeeping to medieval European society EXCEPT</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. the need of different towns to coordinate timekeeping with each other</p><p>B. the setting of specific times for the opening and closing of markets</p><p>C. the setting of specific time for the start and finish of the working day</p><p>D. the regulation of the performance of daily church rituals</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The correct answer A. Although the original mentions that the city and the city must be kept all the time, its purpose is to organize collective activity, and ration space.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 2, why did the medieval church need an alarm arrangement?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The alarm warned the monks of discord or strife in the town.</p><p>B. The church was responsible for regulating working hours and market hours.</p><p>C. The alarm was needed in case fires were not put out each night.</p><p>D. One of the church's daily rituals occurred during the night.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The correct answer D, corresponding to the second sentence of the original text, can be located according to the alarm configuration. The former said one of which was at night, and the latter said to waken monk before dawn. Both of these can be regarded as reasons.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question4">authoritative</span></span>"in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. actual</p><p>B. important</p><p>C. official</p><p>D. effective</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" C"><p>The correct answer C, <span class="question4">authoritative</span> is <span class="question4">authoritative</span>, A is true, B is important, C is official, and D is valid. So C is correct. The article also said only one timekeeper, so it should be the official time.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The author uses the phrase "<span class="highlight">the timekeeper of last resort</span>"to refer to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. water clocks</p><p>B. the sun</p><p>C. mechanical clocks</p><p>D. the church</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="the timekeeper of last resort B"><p>B Former said that it needed to check the machines, which was previously called solar dials so it was the sun. It is also possible to do a simple exclusion. The D option can be excluded first. This section does not mention church; then the C option can be excluded because it cannot be a new machines against (new) machines. The rest is an alternative, and the A option of the water clocks has been said in the previous "driving out water clocks", so do not choose. Then it can only be B.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question6">rudimentary</span></span>"in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. rare</p><p>B. small</p><p>C. impractical</p><p>D. basic</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" D"><p>The correct answer D, <span class="question6">rudimentary</span> is basic. A is rare, b is small, C is impractical, and D is basic. So according to the word meaning D correct. Here we can see that all the words in the parallel are negative. The <span class="question6">rudimentary</span> here also emphasizes the undeveloped and backward meanings. If you judge by negative words, C may be a confusing option, but its meaning does not match.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, how did the Catholic Church react to the introduction of mechanical clocks?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It used mechanical clocks through the period of urban collapse</p><p>B. It used clocks to better understand natural phenomena, like equinoxes</p><p>C. It tried to preserve its own method of keeping time, which was different from mechanical-clock time.</p><p>D. It used mechanical clocks to challenge secular, town authorities.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The correct answer: C, can be positioned to the red mark part, the keyword is resisted, not coming over, so prove that the church is rejecting the new timing method, that is, trying to protect yourself. So choose C</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question8">installed</span></span>"in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. required</p><p>B. expected by the majority of people</p><p>C. standardized</p><p>D. put in place</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" D"><p>The correct answer: D, <span class="question8">installed</span> is <span class="question8">installed</span>, A is needed, B is what most people want, C is standardized, D is placed in. D is the most consistent, and the original word in the original text also follows the location, so use D is most appropriate.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>It can be inferred from paragraph 5 that medieval clockmakers</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. were able to continually make improvements in the accuracy of mechanical clocks</p><p>B. were sometimes not well respected by other engineers</p><p>C. sometimes made claims about the accuracy of mechanical clocks that were not true</p><p>D. rarely shared their expertise with other engineers</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>Correct answer A. According to the clockmaker's positioning to the penultimate sentence, the watchmaker is said to be the correct and precise leader and then praises them all. The B, C, and D options all detract from the tabulator, so it is easy to rule out. The B,D option clearly conflicts with the last sentence. A is in line with the original text.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Paragraph 5 answers which of the following questions about mechanical clocks.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. How did early mechanical clocks work?</p><p>B. Why did the design of mechanical clocks affect engineering in general?</p><p>C. How were mechanical clocks made?</p><p>D. What influenced the design of the first mechanical clock?</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B does not have a particularly good positioning word and requires a comprehensive understanding. The fifth paragraph mainly states that clockmaker leads the development of accurate and precise engineering. They are master, teacher, etc. Then they are said to be <span class="question11">pioneers</span>, but these are because they are watchmakers. This paragraph does not say how the tabulators work, so How can the A option not be answered. The option B's Why coincides with the first half of the entire segment. So this question chooses B. The method of mechanical clock making of the C option was not mentioned in the original text; there was no mention of the things that influenced the design of the D option.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question11">pioneers</span></span>"in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. leaders</p><p>B. opponents</p><p>C. employers</p><p>D. guardians</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" A"><p>Correct answer: A. Pioneer is the pioneer, A is the leader, B is the opponent, C is the employer, and D is the guardian. The latter part of the sentence where the original word is located also speaks of them as a teacher, so it is easy to understand that they are leaders. Select A</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 6, how did the mechanical clock affect labor?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It encouraged workers to do more time-filling busywork.</p><p>B. It enabled workers to be more task oriented.</p><p>C. It pushed workers to work more hours every day.</p><p>D. It led to a focus on productivity.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The correct answer D, positioning to the last sentence of the original sentence, says that people have changed productivity from the mode of task-oriented and time-filling busyness to maximize product per unit of time, so choose D. A, B was mentioned in the original text, but it was in the state before conversion. C didn't mention it.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The division of time no longer reflected the organization of religious ritual..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>There is a key phrase division of time in the C original sentence. This phrase appears at the beginning of the insertion sentence, and is modified with the definite article the. It must be mentioned before. The sentence negates the reflected of the organization of religious ritual. The description should also have mentioned this before. The only options that match this feature are B and C. Of these two options, the obvious C option is more appropriate, because the B option has not yet begun to negate and has not begun to turn. Put B very abruptly. The sentence before the C option turns with but, placed in C just in this direction.</p></div></div><div id="question14" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>The introduction of the mechanical clock caused important changes to the society of medieval Europe.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.The increasing complexity of social and economic activity in medieval Europe led to the need for a more dependable means of keeping time than sun and water clocks provided.</p><p>B.Because they were unreliable even in sunny climates, sun clocks and water clocks were rarely used in Europe, even before the invention of the mechanical clock.</p><p>C.Before the mechanical clock, every city wanted a large number of timekeepers because more timekeepers allowed for better organization of collective activities.</p><p>D.Soon after the invention of mechanical clocks, sun and water clocks became obsolete because mechanical clocks were far more accurate.</p><p>E.Although society in general was quick to adopt the mechanical clock, the Catholic Church resisted it because it challenged the authority of the church .</p><p>F.Clockmakers introduced precision engineering and their clocks gave individuals and groups more control over the organization of their activities.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="AEF"><p>AEF A corresponds to the second sentence of the second paragraph and the second sentence of the penultimate sentence, correct and selected. B contradicts the first paragraph of the original text. Do not choose. The original C does not mention that there are a large number of timekeepers, and the third paragraph also states that there can only be one <span class="question4">authoritative</span> timekeeper not selected. D corresponds to the third paragraph of the original text, said that the use of mechanical clock after the water clock is quickly abandoned, but the sun clock is still left to control the accuracy of the mechanicalclock wrong, do not choose. E correct, choose. Corresponds to the fourth paragraph of the original text F is correct. It corresponds to the last paragraph of the original text.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
