One reason is that construction projects can be so disruptive; they create inconveniences and can make it hard to get where you need to go on campus. And, second, construction projects would be more likely to be completed quickly if they were scheduled for the summer when the weather is usually good.Sincerely,Eric Hughes</p></article><div><audio src="tpo30-speaking3.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></div><article id="listening-passage" class="passage"><h3>Listening Text</h3><p>Now listen to two students discussing the letter:</p><p>Man: So, Jane, what do you think of Eric's proposal?</p><p>Woman: I'm all for it.</p><p>Man: So you think it's true? What he says about the problems about the way it's being done?</p><p>Woman: Yeah, I do. Take his first reason. Like, I know you don't drive, but I do drive here everyday, so I need a place to park my car. And remember last year when they decided to repair some of the parking lots?</p><p>Man: Oh yeah, I remember that, there was a lot of work going on, wasn't there? Starting in December.</p><p>Woman: Right, at least four lots were closed, and that meant there weren't enough parking spots for students and professor's cars. I usually had to circle around looking for parking on one of the streets. And then walk from the street all the way to my classes.</p><p>Man: That's annoying.</p><p>Woman: Yeah, and it happened to a lot of other people in my classes too! People were always arriving late because of the trouble they had parking. Sometimes even my professors were late.</p><p>(man) Yeah.</p><p>(woman) And also, his second point? That makes sense too. I mean, for instance, part of the reason those parking lot repairs last year took so long was because of the big snowstorms. They had to keep stopping, sometimes for a week or two at a time, because of snow and ice on the ground.</p><p>(man) Yeah, I remember that, we had a bunch of snowstorms in a row last year.</p><p>(woman) Yeah, so with all that starting and stopping cause of the weather, the problem took them a lot longer to finish.</p></article><section id="question"><h4>Question</h4><p>The woman expresses her opinion about the student's proposal. Briefly summarize the proposal. Then state her opinion about the proposal and explain the reasons she gives for holding that opinion. </p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>Well, the proposal says whenever possible the university should schedule small construction projects to take place during the three-month summer break instead of regular school years for two main reasons. Accordingly, the woman agrees with the proposal and the reasons given. She agrees with the first reason in the proposal because she doesn't have place to park her car, and other students and professors can't find enough parking spots either. They have to circle around looking for parking places and it causes trouble since when they walk a long way back they are usually late including the professor sometimes. Besides, she agrees with the second reason too, simply because it usually takes too long for the construction to finish due to the big snowstorms and the snow and ice on ground. So she is all for the proposal and its reasons. (141 words)</p></article></div></main></body></html>
