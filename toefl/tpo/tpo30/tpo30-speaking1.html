What do you think is the most important characteristic of a good neighborhood? Use details and examples to explain your answer.</p></section><section id="sample-response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><article><p>As far as I am concerned, a good neighbor should be warmhearted and considerate. To start with, a good neighbor must be warmhearted. A warmhearted neighbor can always offer help when you need. For example, I still remember one of my neighbors Mr. Zhang, a warmhearted elder man. When I was in elementary school, I always forgot to take the key of my apartment with me, so I could not have lunch when I came back home from school. Mr. Zhang always invited me to his apartment to have lunch. I'm still touched by his kindness now. Moreover, good neighbors are considerate. They care about their local environment. Good neighbors will not throw trash on the ground, and if they see it they will pick it up. They will make decisions based with consideration to their neighbors. They won't play loud music late at night or get drunk and fight in public. They want to live in a happy, peaceful community and they believe that their personal actions have a direct effect on the happiness of all of their neighbors.</p></article></section></main></body></html>
