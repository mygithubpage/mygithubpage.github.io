            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.45" data-time="5.57">[00:05.57]</span>Professor: How was the museum?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.46" data-time="8.02">[00:08.02]</span>Student: Great. I hadn't been there for a few years.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.89" data-time="10.48">[00:10.48]</span>Professor: Did you enjoy the Van Gogh painting?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.35" data-time="12.37">[00:12.37]</span>Student: That's the thing. <span class="time" data-times="2.05" data-time="13.72">[00:13.72]</span>Looks like I have to change my topic.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.46" data-time="15.77">[00:15.77]</span>Professor: Hmm... we are getting close to the <span class="underline">deadline</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.31" data-time="18.23">[00:18.23]</span>You were writing about the theme of night in the paintings of Vincent Van Gogh. <span class="time" data-times="1.5" data-time="22.54">[00:22.54]</span>It's a wonderful topic.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.77" data-time="24.04">[00:24.04]</span>Student: I know. People don't usually think of Van Gogh as an artist of <span class="underline">nocturnal</span> themes. <span class="time" data-times="3.55" data-time="28.81">[00:28.81]</span>They think of brightness, sunshine, all that yellow and orange.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.25" data-time="32.36">[00:32.36]</span>Professor: You are right of <span class="underline">course</span> about the <span class="underline">intense</span> light <span class="underline">associated</span> with his daytime paintings. <span class="time" data-times="3.55" data-time="36.61">[00:36.61]</span>But his night paintings don't exactly <span class="underline">lack</span> brightness.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.06" data-time="40.16">[00:40.16]</span>Student: That's the paradox that I really like, the paradox of painting a nighttime <span class="underline">scene</span> using so much color and light. <span class="time" data-times="4.12" data-time="46.22">[00:46.22]</span>So I was planning to <span class="underline">focus</span> mostly on his painting Starry Night.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="0.7" data-time="50.34">[00:50.34]</span>Professor: But?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.17" data-time="51.04">[00:51.04]</span>[Student: When I went to the museum to look at the actual painting, like you told me to. <span class="time" data-times="0.9" data-time="55.21">[00:55.21]</span>It wasn't there.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.23" data-time="56.11">[00:56.11]</span>Professor: Really? Isn't it part of the <span class="underline">permanent</span> collection?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.01" data-time="59.34">[00:59.34]</span>Student: Yes. But it's on <span class="underline">loan</span> right now to a museum in Europe.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.11" data-time="62.35">[01:02.35]</span>Professor: Ah, I see. Well, I am <span class="underline">strict</span> about having students write about paintings they can <span class="underline">observe</span> firsthand.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.21" data-time="69.46">[01:09.46]</span>Student: Well, I found another painting I could study <span class="underline">instead</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.1" data-time="72.67">[01:12.67]</span>Professor: OK.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.47" data-time="73.77">[01:13.77]</span>Student: I read that there are two paintings called Starry Night.<span class="time" data-times="4.16" data-time="77.24">[01:17.24]</span>The first one was done by the French realist painter Millet.<span class="time" data-times="2.65" data-time="81.4">[01:21.40]</span>It may have been the inspiration for Van Gogh's painting. <span class="time" data-times="3.71" data-time="84.05">[01:24.05]</span>Millet's painting is located near my family's house in Connecticut.<span class="time" data-times="2.64" data-time="87.76">[01:27.76]</span>And I am going there this weekend and could study it then. <span class="time" data-times="2.21" data-time="90.4">[01:30.40]</span>I made sure it's not out on <span class="underline">loan</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.05" data-time="92.61">[01:32.61]</span>Professor: That <span class="underline">definitely</span> would work then.<span class="time" data-times="2.96" data-time="94.66">[01:34.66]</span> Van Gogh copied many of Millet's compositions. <span class="time" data-times="2.86" data-time="97.62">[01:37.62]</span>We know that he really admired Millet's work. <span class="time" data-times="6.1" data-time="100.48">[01:40.48]</span>And a lot of us think Van Gogh saw this <span class="underline">particular</span> painting by Millet in Paris in the late 1700s.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.09" data-time="106.58">[01:46.58]</span>Student: Yeah. Although Millet was a realist painter, and Van Gogh a post-impressionist, the two paintings still share lots of features, not just the name. <span class="time" data-times="3.86" data-time="114.67">[01:54.67]</span>The most <span class="underline">striking</span> shared feature has got to be the amazing light effects. <span class="time" data-times="1.56" data-time="118.53">[01:58.53]</span>I am excited to go see it. <span class="time" data-times="1.96" data-time="120.09">[02:00.09]</span>But one other thing ...</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.08" data-time="122.05">[02:02.05]</span>Professor: Uh-huh.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.47" data-time="123.13">[02:03.13]</span>Student: I was thinking about getting a head start on my next <span class="underline">assignment</span> while I am at the <span class="underline">gallery</span> in Connecticut, the <span class="underline">assignment</span> on miniatures. <span class="time" data-times="4.15" data-time="129.6">[02:09.60]</span>They have a lot of miniature portraits of children as part of their <span class="underline">permanent</span> collection.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.49" data-time="133.75">[02:13.75]</span>Professor: American miniatures?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.47" data-time="135.24">[02:15.24]</span>Student: Yeah. So I figured I could also get started on that <span class="underline">essay</span>, study a few while I am there. <span class="time" data-times="7.91" data-time="140.71">[02:20.71]</span>I'd <span class="underline">focus</span> on the meaning of the objects that some of the children are holding, some are holding flowers, one child has a <span class="underline">rattle</span>, another a toy violin...</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.4" data-time="148.62">[02:28.62]</span>Professor: That would be fine. <span class="time" data-times="2.9" data-time="150.02">[02:30.02]</span>Uh, those objects...we call them attributes. <span class="time" data-times="7.76" data-time="152.92">[02:32.92]</span>The attributes chosen to be included in a <span class="underline">particular</span> miniature was often meant to <span class="underline">communicate</span> parents' hopes and dreams for their child. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="160.68">[02:40.68]</span>So I think you'll learn a lot about how people viewed children at the time the miniature paintings were done.</p>
