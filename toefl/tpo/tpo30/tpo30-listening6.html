          <p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.69" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in a music <span class="underline">history</span> class. <span class="time" data-times="3.61" data-time="3.69">[00:03.69]</span>The professor has been discussing music of the twentieth <span class="underline">century</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.19" data-time="7.3">[00:07.30]</span>Professor: And what <span class="underline">instrument</span> comes to <span class="underline">mind</span> when you think of rock 'n' <span class="underline">roll</span>?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.27" data-time="12.49">[00:12.49]</span>Student: The electric Guitar?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.97" data-time="13.76">[00:13.76]</span>Professor: Exactly. I think it's <span class="underline">fair</span> to say that the <span class="underline">sound</span> of the electric guitar typifies the rock 'n' <span class="underline">roll</span> <span class="underline">genre</span>, which became <span class="underline">popular</span> in the 1950s.<span class="time" data-times="10.28" data-time="23.73">[00:23.73]</span>But really the <span class="underline">instrument</span> we know today was the result of a continuing <span class="underline">development</span> that started for our <span class="underline">practical</span> purposes in the 1920s.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.37" data-time="34.01">[00:34.01]</span>But long before that <span class="underline">even</span>, people were experimenting with ways to <span class="underline">modify</span> <span class="underline">traditional</span> <span class="underline">acoustic</span> guitars. <span class="time" data-times="3.1" data-time="41.38">[00:41.38]</span>The first guitars were wooden.<span class="time" data-times="5.22" data-time="44.48">[00:44.48]</span> This is the Spanish guitar and the strings were made from animal products. <span class="time" data-times="2.1" data-time="49.7">[00:49.70]</span>Then came <span class="underline">steel</span> strings. <span class="time" data-times="8.68" data-time="51.8">[00:51.80]</span>And that led to the lap guitar, which is also called the <span class="underline">steel</span> guitar because the player slides a <span class="underline">steel</span> <span class="underline">rod</span> up and down the neck.<span class="time" data-times="3.34" data-time="60.48">[01:00.48]</span>And those are all <span class="underline">acoustic</span> guitars. OK?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.12" data-time="63.82">[01:03.82]</span>But then <span class="underline">eventually</span> we have electric guitars. <span class="time" data-times="5.6" data-time="67.94">[01:07.94]</span>Over the years, many inventors and musicians contributed to the design of these instruments.<span class="time" data-times="9.29" data-time="73.54">[01:13.54]</span>And each design was intended to <span class="underline">alter</span> the <span class="underline">sound</span> in some way, at first at <span class="underline">least</span> with the electric guitar, to make it louder.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.47" data-time="82.83">[01:22.83]</span>So let's get back to when the <span class="underline">steel</span> guitar was first introduced in the United States. <span class="time" data-times="5.57" data-time="89.3">[01:29.30]</span>It was right after the Spanish-American war in the late 1890s. <span class="time" data-times="9.44" data-time="94.87">[01:34.87]</span>US sailors who were stationed in Hawaii-then a US <span class="underline">territory</span>-were very enamored with the music they heard there.<span class="time" data-times="5.43" data-time="104.31">[01:44.31]</span>Uh, Hawaiian music was based on the <span class="underline">steel</span> guitar I just described.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.96" data-time="109.74">[01:49.74]</span>Some sailors learned how to play the <span class="underline">steel</span> guitar and brought it home to the States.<span class="time" data-times="5.94" data-time="114.7">[01:54.70]</span>Before long, Hawaiian <span class="underline">steel</span> guitar music was all the <span class="underline">rage</span> in the mainland US.<span class="time" data-times="9.97" data-time="120.64">[02:00.64]</span>It actually had a strong influence on the <span class="underline">development</span> of several <span class="underline">musical</span> genres, rock 'n' <span class="underline">roll</span> most <span class="underline">notably</span>, but also jazz and <span class="underline">blues</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="10.77" data-time="130.61">[02:10.61]</span>Anyway, by the 1920s, with the <span class="underline">advent</span> of the public dance movement, people were gathering in large groups to listen to <span class="underline">steel</span> guitar music.<span class="time" data-times="5.07" data-time="141.38">[02:21.38]</span>But they had trouble hearing it, especially in large public settings.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.22" data-time="146.45">[02:26.45]</span>As I mentioned, the <span class="underline">instrument</span> was played horizontally, on the lap. <span class="time" data-times="7.93" data-time="150.67">[02:30.67]</span>Since the strings faced upward, the <span class="underline">sound</span> was projected toward the ceiling rather than outward toward the <span class="underline">audience</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.48" data-time="158.6">[02:38.60]</span>Something had to be done, because the music venues and the <span class="underline">audience</span> kept getting larger and larger.<span class="time" data-times="2.87" data-time="165.08">[02:45.08]</span> So what would you do?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.39" data-time="167.95">[02:47.95]</span>Student: Find a way to <span class="underline">amplify</span> the <span class="underline">sound</span>?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.48" data-time="171.34">[02:51.34]</span>Professor: Yes. And to do that, inventors started attaching electronic devices, electrical coils to the <span class="underline">acoustic</span> guitars. <span class="time" data-times="2.06" data-time="180.82">[03:00.82]</span>And the electronics worked!<span class="time" data-times="5.65" data-time="182.88">[03:02.88]</span> But attaching electronics didn't just <span class="underline">affect</span> how loudly you could play.<span class="time" data-times="3.01" data-time="188.53">[03:08.53]</span>It also changed the <span class="underline">quality</span> of the <span class="underline">sound</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.8" data-time="191.54">[03:11.54]</span>These early electric guitars were <span class="underline">hollow</span> and these early amplifiers caused vibrations in the bodies of the instruments. <span class="time" data-times="5.69" data-time="200.34">[03:20.34]</span>So as the <span class="underline">sound</span> got louder, it became more distorted, fuzzy-sounding.<span class="time" data-times="5.82" data-time="206.03">[03:26.03]</span>And what musicians at the time <span class="underline">wanted</span> was a <span class="underline">pure</span>, clean <span class="underline">sound</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.77" data-time="211.85">[03:31.85]</span>Student: So where does Les Paul fit in?<span class="time" data-times="2.95" data-time="214.62">[03:34.62]</span> Wasn't he the first to electrify <span class="underline">acoustic</span> guitars?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.61" data-time="217.57">[03:37.57]</span>Professor: Uh...no. Electrified guitars already existed by the time Les Paul came into the picture around 1940.<span class="time" data-times="8.19" data-time="225.18">[03:45.18]</span>What Paul did was experiment with ways of removing the distortions and he succeeded.<span class="time" data-times="6.93" data-time="233.37">[03:53.37]</span>He designed a guitar with a <span class="underline">solid</span> body that relied solely on electronics.<span class="time" data-times="5.34" data-time="240.3">[04:00.30]</span>Paul's <span class="underline">solid</span> body eliminated the vibrations, and thus the distortions.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.52" data-time="245.64">[04:05.64]</span>Student: Excuse me. But when I think of electric guitar music, I think of Jimi Hendrix.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.76" data-time="251.16">[04:11.16]</span>Professor: Jimi Hendrix, one of my favorites.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.52" data-time="254.92">[04:14.92]</span>Student: But Hendrix's style really was all about <span class="underline">distortion</span>, that's what's so great about his music, all those <span class="underline">special</span> effects. <span class="time" data-times="4.08" data-time="263.44">[04:23.44]</span>I think a lot of rock 'n' <span class="underline">roll</span> fans <span class="underline">prefer</span> that to a <span class="underline">pure</span> <span class="underline">sound</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.71" data-time="267.52">[04:27.52]</span>Professor: Yeah. You are getting ahead of me here. <span class="time" data-times="6.87" data-time="270.23">[04:30.23]</span>But good, because the point I was going to make is that the <span class="underline">sound</span> of rock 'n' <span class="underline">roll</span> changed over the years. <span class="time" data-times="5.76" data-time="277.1">[04:37.10]</span>And the designs and technology of electric guitars made those changes possible.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.66" data-time="282.86">[04:42.86]</span>So whereas Les Paul's goal was to remove the <span class="underline">distortion</span>, later musicians <span class="underline">wanted</span> to produce it.<span class="time" data-times="2.81" data-time="291.52">[04:51.52]</span>And by the time Jimi Hendrix came around.<span class="time" data-times="13.47" data-time="294.33">[04:54.33]</span> Well, <span class="underline">essentially</span>, Hendrix reinvented the electric guitar, in the <span class="underline">sense</span> that he created amazing effects and vibrations that changed the <span class="underline">sound</span> of rock 'n' <span class="underline">roll</span> completely. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="307.8">[05:07.80]</span>So <span class="underline">eventually</span>, people tried to <span class="underline">improve</span> on Les Paul's model, well, to <span class="underline">modify</span> it I should say.</p>
