I think it's <span class="highlight">fair</span> to say that the <span class="highlight">sound</span> of the electric guitar typifies the rock 'n' <span class="highlight">roll</span><span class="highlight">genre</span>, which became <span class="highlight">popular</span> in the 1950s.<span class="time" data-times="10.28" data-time="23.73">[00:23.73]</span>But really the <span class="highlight">instrument</span> we know today was the result of a continuing <span class="highlight">development</span> that started for our <span class="highlight">practical</span> purposes in the 1920s.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.37" data-time="34.01">[00:34.01]</span>But long before that <span class="highlight">even</span>, people were experimenting with ways to <span class="highlight">modify</span><span class="highlight">traditional</span><span class="highlight">acoustic</span> guitars. <span class="time" data-times="3.1" data-time="41.38">[00:41.38]</span>The first guitars were wooden.<span class="time" data-times="5.22" data-time="44.48">[00:44.48]</span> This is the Spanish guitar and the strings were made from animal products. <span class="time" data-times="2.1" data-time="49.7">[00:49.70]</span>Then came <span class="highlight">steel</span> strings. <span class="time" data-times="8.68" data-time="51.8">[00:51.80]</span>And that led to the lap guitar, which is also called the <span class="highlight">steel</span> guitar because the player slides a <span class="highlight">steel</span><span class="highlight">rod</span> up and down the neck.<span class="time" data-times="3.34" data-time="60.48">[01:00.48]</span>And those are all <span class="highlight">acoustic</span> guitars.

Electrified guitars already existed by the time Les Paul came into the picture around 1940.<span class="time" data-times="8.19" data-time="225.18">[03:45.18]</span>What Paul did was experiment with ways of removing the distortions and he succeeded.<span class="time" data-times="6.93" data-time="233.37">[03:53.37]</span>He designed a guitar with a <span class="highlight">solid</span> body that relied solely on electronics.<span class="time" data-times="5.34" data-time="240.3">[04:00.30]</span>Paul's <span class="highlight">solid</span> body eliminated the vibrations, and thus the distortions.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.52" data-time="245.64">[04:05.64]</span>Student: Excuse me.

You are getting ahead of me here. <span class="time" data-times="6.87" data-time="270.23">[04:30.23]</span>But good, because the point I was going to make is that the <span class="highlight">sound</span> of rock 'n' <span class="highlight">roll</span> changed over the years. <span class="time" data-times="5.76" data-time="277.1">[04:37.10]</span>And the designs and technology of electric guitars made those changes possible.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="8.66" data-time="282.86">[04:42.86]</span>So whereas Les Paul's goal was to remove the <span class="highlight">distortion</span>, later musicians <span class="highlight">wanted</span> to produce it.<span class="time" data-times="2.81" data-time="291.52">[04:51.52]</span>And by the time Jimi Hendrix came around.<span class="time" data-times="13.47" data-time="294.33">[04:54.33]</span> Well, <span class="highlight">essentially</span>, Hendrix reinvented the electric guitar, in the <span class="highlight">sense</span> that he created amazing effects and vibrations that changed the <span class="highlight">sound</span> of rock 'n' <span class="highlight">roll</span> completely. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="307.8">[05:07.80]</span>So <span class="highlight">eventually</span>, people tried to <span class="highlight">improve</span> on Les Paul's model, well, to <span class="highlight">modify</span> it I should say.</p></p></article></section><div id="question"><div id="question1"><p>What does the professor mainly discuss?</p><label class="my-label"><span>A.
