I think it's <span class="highlight">fair</span> to say that the <span class="highlight">sound</span> of the electric guitar typifies the rock 'n' <span class="highlight">roll</span><span class="highlight">genre</span>, which became <span class="highlight">popular</span> in the 1950s.<span class="time" data-times="10.28" data-time="23.73">[00:23.73]</span>But really the <span class="highlight">instrument</span> we know today was the result of a continuing <span class="highlight">development</span> that started for our <span class="highlight">practical</span> purposes in the 1920s.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.37" data-time="34.01">[00:34.01]</span>But long before that <span class="highlight">even</span>, people were experimenting with ways to <span class="highlight">modify</span><span class="highlight">traditional</span><span class="highlight">acoustic</span> guitars. <span class="time" data-times="3.1" data-time="41.38">[00:41.38]</span>The first guitars were wooden.<span class="time" data-times="5.22" data-time="44.48">[00:44.48]</span> This is the Spanish guitar and the strings were made from animal products. <span class="time" data-times="2.1" data-time="49.7">[00:49.70]</span>Then came <span class="highlight">steel</span> strings. <span class="time" data-times="8.68" data-time="51.8">[00:51.80]</span>And that led to the lap guitar, which is also called the <span class="highlight">steel</span> guitar because the player slides a <span class="highlight">steel</span><span class="highlight">rod</span> up and down the neck.<span class="time" data-times="3.34" data-time="60.48">[01:00.48]</span>And those are all <span class="highlight">acoustic</span> guitars.
