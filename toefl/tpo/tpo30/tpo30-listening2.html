lecture in a <span class="highlight">psychology</span> class.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.73" data-time="4.84">[00:04.84]</span>Professor: We've been talking about animal <span class="highlight">cognition</span>-the study of animal <span class="highlight">intelligence</span>.<span class="time" data-times="11.75" data-time="10.57">[00:10.57]</span>Now, much of the research in this area is motivated by the search for animal analogues, or parallels to human <span class="highlight">cognitive</span> processes.<span class="time" data-times="4.91" data-time="22.32">[00:22.32]</span>And one of the processes we've been investigating is metacognition.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.34" data-time="27.23">[00:27.23]</span>What is metacognition? <span class="time" data-times="8.27" data-time="29.57">[00:29.57]</span>Well, it's being <span class="highlight">aware</span> of what one knows or feels, uh, um... having an <span class="highlight">awareness</span> of one's <span class="highlight">state</span> of <span class="highlight">mind</span>.<span class="time" data-times="4.65" data-time="37.84">[00:37.84]</span>And making decisions about <span class="highlight">behavior</span> based on what one knows.<span class="time" data-times="10" data-time="42.49">[00:42.49]</span>Researchers have long been interested in whether animals <span class="highlight">possess</span> this <span class="highlight">capability</span>, but...but couldn't test it because animals aren't able to <span class="highlight">report</span> their feelings.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.83" data-time="52.49">[00:52.49]</span>But recently one group of researchers found a way to solve this problem. <span class="time" data-times="15.17" data-time="58.32">[00:58.32]</span>They did studies with...with monkeys and dolphins that provide <span class="highlight">evidence</span> that these animals have the <span class="highlight">ability</span> to feel uncertainty, to feel unsure about something and...and...well, to know that they are uncertain.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.56" data-time="73.49">[01:13.49]</span>So how could these researchers <span class="highlight">figure</span> out if an animal feels uncertainty? <span class="time" data-times="7.49" data-time="79.05">[01:19.05]</span>Well, it began with a study one of them did on a <span class="highlight">dolphin</span>, who had been trained to <span class="highlight">recognize</span> a <span class="highlight">particular</span> high-pitched tone.<span class="time" data-times="6.47" data-time="86.54">[01:26.54]</span>The <span class="highlight">dolphin</span> was taught to <span class="highlight">press</span> one of two paddles depending on whether it heard the high tone or one that was <span class="highlight">lower</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.06" data-time="93.01">[01:33.01]</span>Food was a <span class="highlight">reward</span> for a correct <span class="highlight">response</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.79" data-time="96.07">[01:36.07]</span>But if the wrong <span class="highlight">paddle</span> was pressed, the <span class="highlight">dolphin</span> had to wait several seconds before it could try again. <span class="time" data-times="4.5" data-time="101.86">[01:41.86]</span>The task <span class="highlight">varied</span> in difficulty according to the <span class="highlight">pitch</span> of the <span class="highlight">second</span> tone. <span class="time" data-times="7.64" data-time="106.36">[01:46.36]</span>The closer it came in <span class="highlight">pitch</span> to the first one, the harder it became for the <span class="highlight">dolphin</span> to correctly <span class="highlight">identify</span> it as low.<span class="time" data-times="9.52" data-time="114">[01:54.00]</span>And the researcher <span class="highlight">noted</span> that the <span class="highlight">dolphin</span> is quite <span class="highlight">eager</span> to <span class="highlight">press</span> the <span class="highlight">paddle</span> when it was sure of the answer, but exhibited hesitation during difficult trials.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="10.92" data-time="123.52">[02:03.52]</span>Next the researcher introduced a third option, a third <span class="highlight">paddle</span> that would <span class="highlight">initiate</span> a new <span class="highlight">trial</span>, giving the <span class="highlight">dolphin</span> the choice of passing on difficult trials.<span class="time" data-times="7.19" data-time="134.44">[02:14.44]</span>Once the <span class="highlight">dolphin</span> figured out the result of pressing this new <span class="highlight">paddle</span>, it did choose it frequently when the <span class="highlight">trial</span> was difficult. <span class="time" data-times="7.36" data-time="141.63">[02:21.63]</span>The researcher took that as an <span class="highlight">indication</span> that the animal <span class="highlight">wanted</span> to pass because it didn't know the answer and knew it didn't know.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.5" data-time="148.99">[02:28.99]</span>But there was a problem.<span class="time" data-times="8.47" data-time="151.49">[02:31.49]</span> Other researchers protested that the... the opt-out <span class="highlight">response</span> was <span class="highlight">simply</span> a learned or conditioned <span class="highlight">response</span>. <span class="time" data-times="1.81" data-time="159.96">[02:39.96]</span>You remember intro to <span class="highlight">psychology</span>, right? <span class="time" data-times="10.01" data-time="161.77">[02:41.77]</span>In other words, by pressing the pass <span class="highlight">paddle</span>, the <span class="highlight">dolphin</span> avoided having to wait and <span class="highlight">hasten</span> the possibility of a full <span class="highlight">reward</span> by moving directly to the next <span class="highlight">trial</span>.<span class="time" data-times="10.08" data-time="171.78">[02:51.78]</span>So the experiment didn't necessarily <span class="highlight">indicate</span> that the <span class="highlight">dolphin</span> had knowledge of its own uncertainty, just that it <span class="highlight">wanted</span> to <span class="highlight">avoid</span><span class="highlight">negative</span> consequences.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="8.08" data-time="181.86">[03:01.86]</span>So more recently, our researcher and his colleagues devised a new study, this time using monkeys.<span class="time" data-times="5.94" data-time="189.94">[03:09.94]</span>In this experiment, the monkeys had to <span class="highlight">identify</span> certain patterns displayed on a computer <span class="highlight">screen</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.73" data-time="195.88">[03:15.88]</span>These patterns were <span class="highlight">analogous</span> to the tones used in the <span class="highlight">dolphin</span> study.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="12.19" data-time="200.61">[03:20.61]</span>One type of <span class="highlight">pattern</span> was of a <span class="highlight">specific</span><span class="highlight">density</span> and was to be classified as <span class="highlight">dense</span>, while the <span class="highlight">second</span> type of <span class="highlight">pattern</span> could <span class="highlight">vary</span> in <span class="highlight">density</span>, but was always less <span class="highlight">dense</span> than the first one.<span class="time" data-times="5.59" data-time="212.8">[03:32.80]</span>And the monkeys' task was to <span class="highlight">identify</span> this <span class="highlight">second</span> type as <span class="highlight">sparse</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.19" data-time="218.39">[03:38.39]</span>So the denser the <span class="highlight">second</span> type of <span class="highlight">pattern</span> was, the more difficult the task became.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.86" data-time="224.58">[03:44.58]</span>And as in a <span class="highlight">previous</span> study, the monkeys were <span class="highlight">given</span> a third choice that would allow them to pass on to a new <span class="highlight">trial</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.61" data-time="231.44">[03:51.44]</span>But unlike in the <span class="highlight">dolphin</span> experiment, the monkeys had to complete four trials before they got any <span class="highlight">feedback</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.39" data-time="240.05">[04:00.05]</span>They didn't know if they responded correctly or incorrectly after each <span class="highlight">trial</span> because there was no <span class="highlight">reward</span> or punishment.<span class="time" data-times="3.63" data-time="246.44">[04:06.44]</span>At the end of four trials, <span class="highlight">feedback</span> was <span class="highlight">given</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.58" data-time="250.07">[04:10.07]</span>The monkeys received a full <span class="highlight">reward</span> for each correct <span class="highlight">response</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.28" data-time="254.65">[04:14.65]</span>And a time-out during which a buzzer was sounded for each incorrect <span class="highlight">response</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.12" data-time="259.93">[04:19.93]</span>But the monkeys had no way to tell which <span class="highlight">reward</span> or punishment was <span class="highlight">associated</span> with which <span class="highlight">response</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.42" data-time="266.05">[04:26.05]</span>And they didn't get either <span class="highlight">reward</span> or punishment for choosing the pass option, the...um...the uncertainty <span class="highlight">response</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.65" data-time="273.47">[04:33.47]</span>But <span class="highlight">nevertheless</span> they still chose this option in the <span class="highlight">appropriate</span> circumstances when the <span class="highlight">trial</span> was particularly difficult. <span class="time" data-times="7.5" data-time="280.12">[04:40.12]</span>And this is <span class="highlight">evidence</span> that it wasn't <span class="highlight">simply</span> a conditioned <span class="highlight">response</span>, because that <span class="highlight">response</span> didn't <span class="highlight">guarantee</span> a faster <span class="highlight">reward</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="8.63" data-time="287.62">[04:47.62]</span>So what does all this tell us about animal <span class="highlight">consciousness</span> or animals' <span class="highlight">awareness</span> of themselves and their <span class="highlight">state</span> of <span class="highlight">mind</span>? <span class="time" data-times="3.85" data-time="296.25">[04:56.25]</span>Can we really know what's going on in the minds of animals? <span class="time" data-times="1.77" data-time="300.1">[05:00.10]</span>No. Of <span class="highlight">course</span> not.<span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="301.87">[05:01.87]</span>But exploring the metacognitive <span class="highlight">capacity</span> of animals could become an important <span class="highlight">criterion</span> in highlighting the similarities and differences between human and animal minds.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the lecture
