Darwin' s <span class="highlight">original</span><span class="highlight">thesis</span>, and the viewpoint supported by <span class="highlight">evolutionary</span> gradualists, is that <span class="highlight">species</span> change continuously but slowly and in small increments. Such changes are all but <span class="highlight">invisible</span> over the short time <span class="highlight">scale</span> of modern observations, and, it is argued, they are usually obscured by <span class="highlight question1">innumerable</span> gaps in the imperfect <span class="highlight">fossil</span><span class="highlight">record</span>. Gradualism, with its <span class="highlight">stress</span> on the slow pace of change, is a comforting <span class="highlight">position</span>, repeated over and over again in generations of textbooks. By the early twentieth <span class="highlight">century</span>, the question about the <span class="highlight">rate</span> of <span class="highlight">evolution</span> had been answered in <span class="highlight">favor</span> of gradualism to most biologists' satisfaction.</p><p>Sometimes a closed question must be reopened as new <span class="highlight">evidence</span> or new arguments based on old <span class="highlight">evidence</span> come to light. <span class="question3">In 1972 <span class="highlight">paleontologist</span> Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge challenged <span class="highlight">conventional</span> wisdom with an opposing viewpoint, the punctuated <span class="highlight">equilibrium</span><span class="highlight">hypothesis</span>, which posits that <span class="highlight">species</span> give rise to new <span class="highlight">species</span> in <span class="highlight">relatively</span> sudden bursts, without a <span class="highlight">lengthy</span><span class="highlight">transition</span> period.</span> These episodes of rapid <span class="highlight">evolution</span> are separated by <span class="highlight">relatively</span> long <span class="highlight">static</span> spans during which a <span class="highlight">species</span> may <span class="highlight">hardly</span> change at all.</p><p>The punctuated <span class="highlight">equilibrium</span><span class="highlight">hypothesis</span> attempts to explain a <span class="highlight">curious</span> feature of the <span class="highlight">fossil</span><span class="highlight">record</span> --- one that has been <span class="highlight">familiar</span> to <span class="highlight">paleontologist</span> for more than a <span class="highlight">century</span> but has usually been ignored. Many <span class="highlight">species</span><span class="highlight">appear</span> to <span class="highlight">remain</span> unchanged in the <span class="highlight">fossil</span><span class="highlight">record</span> for millions of years --- a situation that seems to be at odds with Darwin' s model of <span class="highlight">continuous</span> change. Intermediated <span class="highlight">fossil</span> forms, predicted by gradualism, are typically lacking. In most localities a <span class="highlight">given</span><span class="highlight">species</span> of <span class="highlight">clam</span> or <span class="highlight">coral</span> persists <span class="highlight">essentially</span> unchanged <span class="highlight">throughout</span> a thick <span class="highlight">formation</span> of rock, only to be replaced suddenly by a new and different <span class="highlight">species</span>.</p><p>The <span class="highlight">evolution</span> of North American horse, which was once presented as a <span class="highlight">classic</span> textbook example of <span class="highlight">gradual</span><span class="highlight">evolution</span>, is now providing equally <span class="highlight"><span class="question6">compelling</span></span><span class="highlight">evidence</span> for punctuated <span class="highlight">equilibrium</span>. A convincing 50-million-year <span class="highlight">sequence</span> of modern horse ancestors --- each <span class="highlight">slightly</span> larger, with more <span class="highlight">complex</span> teeth, a longer face, and a more <span class="highlight">prominent</span> central toe ---seemed to provide strong support for Darwin' s contention that <span class="highlight">species</span><span class="highlight">evolve</span><span class="highlight">gradually</span>. But close examination of those <span class="highlight">fossil</span> deposits now reveals a <span class="highlight">somewhat</span> different story. Horses evolved in <span class="highlight">discrete</span> steps, each of which persisted almost unchanged for millions of years and was <span class="highlight">eventually</span> replaced by a <span class="highlight">distinctive</span> newer model. The four-toed Eohippus preceded the three-toed Miohippus, for example, but North American <span class="highlight">fossil</span><span class="highlight">evidence</span> suggests a jerky, <span class="highlight">uneven</span><span class="highlight">transition</span> between the two. If <span class="highlight">evolution</span> had been a <span class="highlight">continuous</span>, <span class="highlight">gradual</span><span class="highlight">process</span>, one might <span class="highlight">expect</span> that almost every <span class="highlight">fossil</span><span class="highlight">specimen</span> would be <span class="highlight">slightly</span> different from every year.</p><p>If it seems difficult to <span class="highlight">conceive</span> how <span class="highlight">major</span> changes could <span class="highlight">occur</span> rapidly, <span class="highlight">consider</span> this: an <span class="highlight"><span class="question8">alteration</span></span> of a single <span class="highlight">gene</span> in files is enough to turn a normal fly with a single pair of wings into one that has two pairs of wings.</p><p>The question about the <span class="highlight">rate</span> of <span class="highlight">evolution</span> must now be turned around: does <span class="highlight">evolution</span> ever <span class="highlight">proceed</span><span class="highlight">gradually</span>, or does it always <span class="highlight">occur</span> in short bursts? Detailed <span class="highlight">field</span> studies of thick rock formations containing fossils provide the best <span class="highlight">potential</span> tests of the <span class="highlight">competing</span> theories.</p><p><span class="question10">Occasionally</span> , a <span class="highlight">sequence</span> of fossil-rich layers of rock permits a <span class="highlight">comprehensive</span> look at one type of <span class="highlight">organism</span> over a long period of time. For example, Peter Sheldon' s studies of trilobites, a now <span class="highlight">extinct</span><span class="highlight">marine</span> animal with a segmented body, <span class="highlight">offer</span> a detailed <span class="highlight">glimpse</span> into three million years of <span class="highlight">evolution</span> in one <span class="highlight">marine</span> environment. In that study, each of eight different trilobite <span class="highlight">species</span> was observed to <span class="highlight">undergo</span> a <span class="highlight">gradual</span> change in the number of segments --- typically an increase of one or two segments over the whole time <span class="highlight">interval</span>. No <span class="highlight">significant</span> discontinuous were observed, <span class="highlight">leading</span> Sheldon to <span class="highlight">conclude</span> that <span class="highlight">environmental</span> conditions were quite <span class="highlight">stable</span> during the period he examined.</p><p><span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span><span class="highlight">Similar</span> exhaustive studies are required for many different kinds of organisms from many different periods. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>
Most researchers <span class="highlight">expect</span> to find that both modes of <span class="highlight">transition</span> from one <span class="highlight">species</span>
to another are at work in <span class="highlight">evolution</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>Slow, <span class="highlight">continuous</span> change may be the norm during periods of <span class="highlight">environmental</span><span class="highlight">stability</span>, while rapid <span class="highlight">evolution</span> of new <span class="highlight">species</span> occurs during periods of environment
<span class="highlight">stress</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>But a lot more studies like Sheldon' s are needed before we can say for sure.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">innumerable</span>"in the passage is closest in the meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. countless</p><p>B. occasional</p><p>C. large</p><p>D. repeated</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>Correct answer: A. Innumerable is countless, A is countless, B is accidental, C is big, D is repeated. This word is numerable plus a negation prefix and it's easy to come up with the meaning.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 1, all of the following are true EXCEPT</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Darwin saw evolutionary change as happening slowly and gradually</p><p>B. Gaps in the fossil record were used to explain why it is difficult to see continuous small changes in the evolution of species</p><p>C. Darwin's evolutionary thesis was rejected because small changes could not be observed in the evolutionary record</p><p>D. By the early twentieth century, most biologists believed that gradualism explained evolutionary change</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Correct answer C. Answer A corresponds to the second sentence of the first paragraph, B corresponds to the third sentence of the first paragraph, and D corresponds to the last sentence of the paragraph. C conflicts with the original text. The original text has always said that the darwin theory is widely accepted by people.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The punctuated equilibrium hypothesis challenged gradualism, which holds that species evolve in relatively sudden bursts of brief duration.</p><p>B. The punctuated equilibrium hypothesis developed by Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge was challenged in 1972.</p><p>C. In 1972 Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge challenged gradualism by positing that change from one species to another cannot occur without a lengthy transition period.</p><p>D. The punctuate equilibrium hypothesis, in opposition to gradualism, holds that transitions from one species to another occur in comparatively sudden burst.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>Correct answer D. The main part of the stroked sentence is that the breakpoint equilibrium theory challenges the original asymptotic theory, and then explains the content of the breakpoint equilibrium theory. The original option A did not mention the brief duration; the B option was inconsistent with the original, C was not consistent with the original, and the original views of S and N were that the occurrence of change was without lengthy transition. D is consistent with the original meaning, and also contains all the main parts. Correct</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 1 and paragraph 2, the punctuated equilibrium hypothesis and the gradualism hypothesis differed about</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Whether the fossil record is complete</p><p>B. Whether all species undergo change</p><p>C. Whether evolution proceeds an a constant rate</p><p>D. How many new species occur over long periods of time</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Correct answer C. According to the original, asymptotic theory states that species evolution takes place through long-term slow changes; breakpoint equilibrium theory means that species evolution is a short-term outbreak. So choose C, whether evolution occurs at a constant rate.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 3, the lack of intermediate fossils in the fossil record of some species</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. has been extensively studied by paleontologist for over a century</p><p>B. contradicts the idea that most species have remained unchanged for millions of years</p><p>C. challenges the view that evolutionary change is gradual</p><p>D. is most common in the fossil records of clam and coral species</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>A contradicts the dash of the first sentence of the original text. The original said that this phenomenon has been contradicted by the original Ignored, B option. This phenomenon should be opposed to the Darwin literature and supports the argument that the species does not change for a long time. Although D is correct but it is only the details of this paragraph and cannot express the subject, it is not selected.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question6">compelling</span></span>"in the passage is closest in the meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. surprising</p><p>B. persuasive</p><p>C. controversial</p><p>D. detailed</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>B <span class="question6">compelling</span>: eye-catching, irresistible. The persuasive (persuasive) echoes with the B option.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Paragraph 4 mentions that North American horses have changed in all the following ways EXCEPT in</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. the number of toes they have</p><p>B. the length of their face</p><p>C. their overall size</p><p>D. the number of years they live</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>Correct answer: D. Corresponding parts in the second and fifth sentences of the fourth paragraph have been marked in red. Only the D option is not present.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question8">alteration</span></span>"in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. imperfection</p><p>B. replacement</p><p>C. change</p><p>D. duplication</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" C"><p>This sentence says how a single gene is enough to change the normal wing of a pair of ordinary birds into two pairs of wings, so there is reasoning to change the gene. So choose C</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 7, Peter Sheldon's studies demonstrated which of the following about trilobites?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They underwent gradual change over a long time period</p><p>B. They experienced a number of discontinuous transitions during their history</p><p>C. They remained unchanged during a long period of environmental stability</p><p>D. They evolved in ways that cannot be counted for by either of the two competing theories.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A According to Peter Sheldon, locate the second sentence of the original sentence. The trilobites are described later. The A option corresponds to the third sentence of the original text. After that, it continues to say that there is no obvious breakpoint. So A is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question10">Occasionally</span></span>"in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. undoubtedly</p><p>B. basically</p><p>C. once in a while</p><p>D. to some extent</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" C"><p>C occasionally: <span class="question10">Occasionally</span>, occasionally. Corresponds to the C option once in a while (occasionally)</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The main purpose of paragraph 7 is to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Describe one test of the competing theories</p><p>B. Provide an example of punctuated equilibrium</p><p>C. Describe how segmented animals evidence both competing theories</p><p>D. Explain why trilobites became extinct</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A The above said that the field survey will provide a test for competing theories, and the seventh paragraph will give a test example. Then it is proved that A is correct. B conflicts with the original text. This example supports the theory of gradualism. C is not right, for the same reason. D is inconsistent with the original purpose.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>They believe that environmental conditions may play a crucial role in determining which of the two modes will be in operation over a given period..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C. At the beginning of the sentence, the first thing that appears is that we should be able to find a place where the person is mentioned in the previous sentence. The sentence also proposes the role of environmental condition. Then the following text should explain the theory. Then C is consistent with it. It can be brought into verification.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="table"><div class="question"><p>selected from the seven phrases below the phrases that correctly characterize punctuated equilibrium and the phrases that correctly characterize gradualism. Two of the phrases will not be used.
