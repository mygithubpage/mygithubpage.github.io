            <b>The Pace of Evolutionary Change</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span id="arrow">
            </span>static2.zhan.com/beikao/images/icon.png?v=201803081738"&gt;A heated <span class="underline">debate</span> has enlivened recent studies of <span class="underline">evolution</span>. Darwin' s <span class="underline">original</span> <span class="underline">thesis</span>, and the viewpoint supported by <span class="underline">evolutionary</span> gradualists, is that <span class="underline">species</span> change continuously but slowly and in small increments. Such changes are all but <span class="underline">invisible</span> over the short time <span class="underline">scale</span> of modern observations, and, it is argued, they are usually obscured by <span class="light"><span class="underline">innumerable</span></span> gaps in the imperfect <span class="underline">fossil</span> <span class="underline">record</span>. Gradualism, with its <span class="underline">stress</span> on the slow pace of change, is a comforting <span class="underline">position</span>, repeated over and over again in generations of textbooks. By the early twentieth <span class="underline">century</span>, the question about the <span class="underline">rate</span> of <span class="underline">evolution</span> had been answered in <span class="underline">favor</span> of gradualism to most biologists' satisfaction.</p>
          <p>Sometimes a closed question must be reopened as new <span class="underline">evidence</span> or new arguments based on old <span class="underline">evidence</span> come to light. In 1972 <span class="underline">paleontologist</span> Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge challenged <span class="underline">conventional</span> wisdom with an opposing viewpoint, the punctuated <span class="underline">equilibrium</span> <span class="underline">hypothesis</span>, which posits that <span class="underline">species</span> give rise to new <span class="underline">species</span> in <span class="underline">relatively</span> sudden bursts, without a <span class="underline">lengthy</span> <span class="underline">transition</span> period. These episodes of rapid <span class="underline">evolution</span> are separated by <span class="underline">relatively</span> long <span class="underline">static</span> spans during which a <span class="underline">species</span> may <span class="underline">hardly</span> change at all.</p>
          <p>The punctuated <span class="underline">equilibrium</span> <span class="underline">hypothesis</span> attempts to explain a <span class="underline">curious</span> feature of the <span class="underline">fossil</span> <span class="underline">record</span> --- one that has been <span class="underline">familiar</span> to <span class="underline">paleontologist</span> for more than a <span class="underline">century</span> but has usually been ignored. Many <span class="underline">species</span> <span class="underline">appear</span> to <span class="underline">remain</span> unchanged in the <span class="underline">fossil</span> <span class="underline">record</span> for millions of years --- a situation that seems to be at odds with Darwin' s model of <span class="underline">continuous</span> change. Intermediated <span class="underline">fossil</span> forms, predicted by gradualism, are typically lacking. In most localities a <span class="underline">given</span> <span class="underline">species</span> of <span class="underline">clam</span> or <span class="underline">coral</span> persists <span class="underline">essentially</span> unchanged <span class="underline">throughout</span> a thick <span class="underline">formation</span> of rock, only to be replaced suddenly by a new and different <span class="underline">species</span>.</p>
          <p>The <span class="underline">evolution</span> of North American horse, which was once presented as a <span class="underline">classic</span> textbook example of <span class="underline">gradual</span> <span class="underline">evolution</span>, is now providing equally <span class="underline">compelling</span> <span class="underline">evidence</span> for punctuated <span class="underline">equilibrium</span>. A convincing 50-million-year <span class="underline">sequence</span> of modern horse ancestors --- each <span class="underline">slightly</span> larger, with more <span class="underline">complex</span> teeth, a longer face, and a more <span class="underline">prominent</span> central toe ---seemed to provide strong support for Darwin' s contention that <span class="underline">species</span> <span class="underline">evolve</span> <span class="underline">gradually</span>. But close examination of those <span class="underline">fossil</span> deposits now reveals a <span class="underline">somewhat</span> different story. Horses evolved in <span class="underline">discrete</span> steps, each of which persisted almost unchanged for millions of years and was <span class="underline">eventually</span> replaced by a <span class="underline">distinctive</span> newer model. The four-toed Eohippus preceded the three-toed Miohippus, for example, but North American <span class="underline">fossil</span> <span class="underline">evidence</span> suggests a jerky, <span class="underline">uneven</span> <span class="underline">transition</span> between the two. If <span class="underline">evolution</span> had been a <span class="underline">continuous</span>, <span class="underline">gradual</span> <span class="underline">process</span>, one might <span class="underline">expect</span> that almost every <span class="underline">fossil</span> <span class="underline">specimen</span> would be <span class="underline">slightly</span> different from every year.</p>
          <p>If it seems difficult to <span class="underline">conceive</span> how <span class="underline">major</span> changes could <span class="underline">occur</span> rapidly, <span class="underline">consider</span> this: an <span class="underline">alteration</span> of a single <span class="underline">gene</span> in files is enough to turn a normal fly with a single pair of wings into one that has two pairs of wings.</p>
          <p>The question about the <span class="underline">rate</span> of <span class="underline">evolution</span> must now be turned around: does <span class="underline">evolution</span> ever <span class="underline">proceed</span> <span class="underline">gradually</span>, or does it always <span class="underline">occur</span> in short bursts? Detailed <span class="underline">field</span> studies of thick rock formations containing fossils provide the best <span class="underline">potential</span> tests of the <span class="underline">competing</span> theories.</p>
          <p>Occasionally , a <span class="underline">sequence</span> of fossil-rich layers of rock permits a <span class="underline">comprehensive</span> look at one type of <span class="underline">organism</span> over a long period of time. For example, Peter Sheldon' s studies of trilobites, a now <span class="underline">extinct</span> <span class="underline">marine</span> animal with a segmented body, <span class="underline">offer</span> a detailed <span class="underline">glimpse</span> into three million years of <span class="underline">evolution</span> in one <span class="underline">marine</span> environment. In that study, each of eight different trilobite <span class="underline">species</span> was observed to <span class="underline">undergo</span> a <span class="underline">gradual</span> change in the number of segments --- typically an increase of one or two segments over the whole time <span class="underline">interval</span>. No <span class="underline">significant</span> discontinuous were observed, <span class="underline">leading</span> Sheldon to <span class="underline">conclude</span> that <span class="underline">environmental</span> conditions were quite <span class="underline">stable</span> during the period he examined.</p>

            <span class="underline">Similar</span> exhaustive studies are required for many different kinds of organisms from many different periods. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>
Most researchers <span class="underline">expect</span> to find that both modes of <span class="underline">transition</span> from one <span class="underline">species</span> 
to another are at work in <span class="underline">evolution</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>Slow, <span class="underline">continuous</span> change may be the norm during periods of <span class="underline">environmental</span> <span class="underline">stability</span>, while rapid <span class="underline">evolution</span> of new <span class="underline">species</span> occurs during periods of environment
<span class="underline">stress</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>But a lot more studies like Sheldon' s are needed before we can say for sure.</p>
