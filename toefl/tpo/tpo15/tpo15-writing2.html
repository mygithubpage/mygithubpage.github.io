In order to become financially responsible adults, children should learn to manage their own money at young age. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. </p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>Sometime some parents just think that it is unnecessary to let their young children learn how to manage money. Nevertheless I cannot disagree with this statement more. As far as I'm concern, it is crucial for children to learn how to manage their money, though maybe only small amount of, in order to be a financially responsible adult.</p><p>On one hand, learning to manage money makes a child know how precious the money is. Therefore, they won't exploit their money on things of no use when they grow up. Taking myself as an example, when I was young I used to waste money on snacks and toys which is of no use. Then one day, my mother gave me 10 dollars and told me that this was all the money available in this month. I reluctantly managed my money and felt that it was really hard to get enough money. Therefore I never waste money any longer as I grow up.</p><p>On the other hand, learning to manage money teaches children how to increase their fortune. As I have said in the last statement, money is precious and it is hard to get enough money to use. Therefore, the best way to get adequate money is to increase our fortune by ourselves. We manage our budget and put our money into things that can increase our fortune – for instance, a child may use a part of his pocket money to buy some cards and sell the cards to his friends to gain some extra money. Children who are familiar with how to increase their fortune by managing their money are more likely to gain financial success in the future.</p><p>In addition, learning how to manage money can also help children to manage other aspects of their daily life. As a child is used to managing his pocket money, he tends to put this practice into managing other aspects in life, such as time. People who do good time management usually have a balanced life. They work and study happily and enjoy their life.</p><p>To conclude, I strongly recommend children be taught how to manage their money when they are young. This practice can provide them with a greater likelihood to succeed and a well-balanced life when they become adults. It will benefit not only themselves but also their whole life.</p></article></div></main></body></html>
