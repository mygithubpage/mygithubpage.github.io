          </h4>

            <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A">
            </span>Cases in which many <span class="underline">species</span> become <span class="underline">extinct</span> <span class="underline">within</span> a geologically short <span class="underline">interval</span> of time are called <span class="underline">mass</span> extinctions. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>There was one such event at the end of the Cretaceous period 
(around 70 million years ago). <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>There was another, <span class="underline">even</span> larger, <span class="underline">mass</span> <span class="underline">extinction</span> at the end of the Permian period (around 250 million years ago).
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>The Permian event has attracted much less <span class="underline">attention</span> than other <span class="underline">mass</span> extinctions because mostly unfamiliar <span class="underline">species</span> perished at that time.</p>
          <p>The <span class="underline">fossil</span> <span class="underline">record</span> shows at <span class="underline">least</span> five <span class="underline">mass</span> extinctions in which many families of <span class="underline">marine</span> organisms died out. The rates of <span class="underline">extinction</span> happening today are as great as the rates during these <span class="underline">mass</span> extinctions. Many scientists have <span class="underline">therefore</span> concluded that a sixth great <span class="underline">mass</span> <span class="underline">extinction</span> is currently in progress.</p>
          <p>What could cause such high rates of <span class="underline">extinction</span>? There are several hypotheses, including warming or cooling of Earth, changes in <span class="underline">seasonal</span> fluctuations or ocean currents, and changing positions of the continents. Biological hypotheses include <span class="underline">ecological</span> changes brought about by the <span class="underline">evolution</span> of <span class="underline">cooperation</span> between insects and flowering plants or of bottom-feeding predators in the oceans. Some of the proposed mechanisms required a very <span class="underline">brief</span> period during which all extinctions suddenly took place; other mechanisms would be more likely to have taken place more <span class="underline">gradually</span>, over an extended period, or at different times on different continents. Some hypotheses fail to <span class="underline">account</span> for <span class="underline">simultaneous</span> extinctions on land and in the seas. Each <span class="underline">mass</span> <span class="underline">extinction</span> may have had a different cause. <span class="underline">Evidence</span> points to hunting by humans and <span class="underline">habitat</span> <span class="underline">destruction</span> as the likely causes for the <span class="underline">current</span> <span class="underline">mass</span> <span class="underline">extinction</span>.</p>
          <p>American paleontologists David Raup and John Sepkoski, who have studied <span class="underline">extinction</span> rates in a number of <span class="underline">fossil</span> groups, suggest that episodes of increased <span class="underline">extinction</span> have recurred <span class="underline">periodically</span>, <span class="underline">approximately</span> every 26 million years since the mid-Cretaceous period. The late Cretaceous <span class="underline">extinction</span> of the dinosaurs and ammonoids was just one of the more <span class="underline">drastic</span> in a whole <span class="underline">series</span> of such recurrent <span class="underline">extinction</span> episodes. The possibility that <span class="underline">mass</span> extinctions may <span class="underline">recur</span> <span class="underline">periodically</span> has <span class="underline">given</span> rise to such hypotheses as that of a <span class="underline">companion</span> star with a long-period <span class="underline">orbit</span> deflecting other bodies from their normal orbits, making some of them fall to Earth as meteors and causing <span class="underline">widespread</span> devastation upon <span class="underline">impact</span>.</p>
          <p>Of the various hypotheses attempting to <span class="underline">account</span> for the late Cretaceous extinctions, the one that has attracted the most <span class="underline">attention</span> in recent years is the asteroid-impact <span class="underline">hypothesis</span> first suggested by Luis and Walter Alvarez. According to this <span class="underline">hypothesis</span>, Earth collided with an <span class="underline">asteroid</span> with an estimated <span class="underline">diameter</span> of 10 kilometers, or with several asteroids, the combined <span class="underline">mass</span> of which was <span class="underline">comparable</span>. The force of <span class="underline">collision</span> spewed large amounts of <span class="underline">debris</span> into the <span class="underline">atmosphere</span>, darkening the skies for several years before the finer particles settled. The reduced <span class="underline">level</span> of <span class="underline">photosynthesis</span> led to a <span class="underline">massive</span> <span class="underline">decline</span> in plant life of all kinds, and this caused <span class="underline">massive</span> <span class="underline">starvation</span> first of herbivores and <span class="underline">subsequently</span> of carnivores. The <span class="underline">mass</span> <span class="underline">extinction</span> would have occurred very suddenly under this <span class="underline">hypothesis</span>.</p>
          <p>One interesting test of the Alvarez <span class="underline">hypothesis</span> is based on the presence of the rare-earth <span class="underline">element</span> <span class="underline">iridium</span> (Ir). Earth's <span class="underline">crust</span> contains very little of this <span class="underline">element</span>, but most asteroids <span class="underline">contain</span> a lot more. <span class="underline">Debris</span> thrown into the <span class="underline">atmosphere</span> by an <span class="underline">asteroid</span> <span class="underline">collision</span> would <span class="underline">presumably</span> <span class="underline">contain</span> large amounts of <span class="underline">iridium</span>, and <span class="underline">atmospheric</span> currents would carry this <span class="underline">material</span> all over the globe. A search of <span class="underline">sedimentary</span> deposits that <span class="underline">span</span> the <span class="underline">boundary</span> between the Cretaceous and <span class="underline">Tertiary</span> periods shows that there is a <span class="underline">dramatic</span> increase in the <span class="underline">abundance</span> of <span class="underline">iridium</span> <span class="underline">briefly</span> and precisely at this <span class="underline">boundary</span>. This <span class="underline">iridium</span> <span class="underline">anomaly</span> offers strong support for the Alvarez <span class="underline">hypothesis</span> <span class="underline">even</span> though no <span class="underline">asteroid</span> itself has ever been recovered.</p>
          <p>An <span class="underline">asteroid</span> of this size would be expected to leave an <span class="underline">immense</span> <span class="underline">crater</span>, <span class="underline">even</span> if the <span class="underline">asteroid</span> itself was disintegrated by the <span class="underline">impact</span>. The <span class="underline">intense</span> heat of the <span class="underline">impact</span> would produce heat-shocked <span class="underline">quartz</span> in many types of rock. Also, large blocks thrown aside by the <span class="underline">impact</span> would form secondary craters surrounding the main <span class="underline">crater</span>. To <span class="underline">date</span>, several such secondary craters have been found <span class="underline">along</span> Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, and heat-shocked <span class="underline">quartz</span> has been found both in Mexico and in Haiti. A location called Chicxulub, <span class="underline">along</span> the Yucatan <span class="underline">coast</span>, has been suggested as the <span class="underline">primary</span> <span class="underline">impact</span> site.</p>
