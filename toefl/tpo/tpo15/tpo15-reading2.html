          <h4 class="w3-center">Mass Extinctions</h4>
          <p>
            <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A">
            </span>Cases in which many <span class="highlight">species</span> become <span class="highlight">extinct</span> <span class="highlight">within</span> a geologically short <span class="highlight">interval</span> of time are called <span class="highlight">mass</span> extinctions. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>There was one such event at the end of the Cretaceous period 
(around 70 million years ago). <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>There was another, <span class="highlight">even</span> larger, <span class="highlight">mass</span> <span class="highlight">extinction</span> at the end of the Permian period (around 250 million years ago).
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>The Permian event has attracted much less <span class="highlight">attention</span> than other <span class="highlight">mass</span> extinctions because mostly unfamiliar <span class="highlight">species</span> perished at that time.</p>
          <p>The <span class="highlight">fossil</span> <span class="highlight">record</span> shows at <span class="highlight">least</span> five <span class="highlight">mass</span> extinctions in which many families of <span class="highlight">marine</span> organisms died out. The rates of <span class="highlight">extinction</span> happening today are as great as the rates during these <span class="highlight">mass</span> extinctions. Many scientists have <span class="highlight">therefore</span> concluded that a sixth great <span class="highlight">mass</span> <span class="highlight">extinction</span> is currently in progress.</p>
          <p>What could cause such high rates of <span class="highlight">extinction</span>? There are several hypotheses, including warming or cooling of Earth, changes in <span class="highlight">seasonal</span> fluctuations or ocean currents, and changing positions of the continents. Biological hypotheses include <span class="highlight">ecological</span> changes brought about by the <span class="highlight">evolution</span> of <span class="highlight">cooperation</span> between insects and flowering plants or of bottom-feeding predators in the oceans. Some of the proposed mechanisms required a very <span class="highlight">brief</span> period during which all extinctions suddenly took place; other mechanisms would be more likely to have taken place more <span class="highlight">gradually</span>, over an <span class="question3">extended</span> period, or at different times on different continents. Some hypotheses fail to <span class="highlight">account</span> for <span class="highlight">simultaneous</span> extinctions on land and in the seas. Each <span class="highlight">mass</span> <span class="highlight">extinction</span> may have had a different cause. <span class="highlight">Evidence</span> points to hunting by humans and <span class="highlight">habitat</span> <span class="highlight">destruction</span> as the likely causes for the <span class="highlight">current</span> <span class="highlight">mass</span> <span class="highlight">extinction</span>.</p>
          <p><span class="question6">American paleontologists David Raup and John Sepkoski, who have studied <span class="highlight">extinction</span> rates in a number of <span class="highlight">fossil</span> groups, suggest that episodes of increased <span class="highlight">extinction</span> have recurred <span class="highlight">periodically</span>, <span class="highlight">approximately</span> every 26 million years since the mid-Cretaceous period.</span> The late Cretaceous <span class="highlight">extinction</span> of the dinosaurs and ammonoids was just one of the more <span class="highlight">drastic</span> in a whole <span class="highlight">series</span> of such recurrent <span class="highlight">extinction</span> episodes. The possibility that <span class="highlight">mass</span> extinctions may <span class="highlight">recur</span> <span class="highlight">periodically</span> has <span class="highlight">given</span> rise to such hypotheses as that of a <span class="highlight">companion</span> star with a long-period <span class="highlight">orbit</span> deflecting other bodies from their normal orbits, making some of them fall to Earth as meteors and causing <span class="highlight">widespread</span> devastation upon <span class="highlight">impact</span>.</p>
          <p>Of the various hypotheses attempting to <span class="highlight">account</span> for the late Cretaceous extinctions, the one that has attracted the most <span class="highlight">attention</span> in recent years is the asteroid-impact <span class="highlight">hypothesis</span> first suggested by Luis and Walter Alvarez. According to this <span class="highlight">hypothesis</span>, Earth collided with an <span class="highlight">asteroid</span> with an estimated <span class="highlight">diameter</span> of 10 kilometers, or with several asteroids, the combined <span class="highlight">mass</span> of which was <span class="highlight">comparable</span>. The force of <span class="highlight">collision</span> spewed large amounts of <span class="highlight">debris</span> into the <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span>, darkening the skies for several years before the finer particles settled. The reduced <span class="highlight">level</span> of <span class="highlight">photosynthesis</span> led to a <span class="highlight">massive</span> <span class="highlight">decline</span> in plant life of all kinds, and this caused <span class="highlight">massive</span> <span class="highlight">starvation</span> first of herbivores and <span class="highlight">subsequently</span> of carnivores. The <span class="highlight">mass</span> <span class="highlight">extinction</span> would have occurred very suddenly under this <span class="highlight">hypothesis</span>.</p>
          <p>One interesting test of the Alvarez <span class="highlight">hypothesis</span> is based on the presence of the rare-earth <span class="highlight">element</span> <span class="highlight">iridium</span> (Ir). Earth's <span class="highlight">crust</span> contains very little of this <span class="highlight">element</span>, but most asteroids <span class="highlight">contain</span> a lot more. <span class="highlight">Debris</span> thrown into the <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span> by an <span class="highlight">asteroid</span> <span class="highlight">collision</span> would <span class="highlight">presumably</span> <span class="highlight">contain</span> large amounts of <span class="highlight">iridium</span>, and <span class="highlight">atmospheric</span> currents would carry this <span class="highlight">material</span> all over the globe. A search of <span class="highlight">sedimentary</span> deposits that <span class="highlight">span</span> the <span class="highlight">boundary</span> between the Cretaceous and <span class="highlight">Tertiary</span> periods shows that there is a <span class="highlight">dramatic</span> increase in the <span class="highlight">abundance</span> of <span class="highlight">iridium</span> <span class="highlight">briefly</span> and precisely at this <span class="highlight">boundary</span>. This <span class="highlight">iridium</span> <span class="highlight">anomaly</span> offers strong support for the Alvarez <span class="highlight">hypothesis</span> <span class="highlight">even</span> though <span class="question10">no <span class="highlight">asteroid</span> itself has ever been recovered.</span></p>
          <p>An <span class="highlight">asteroid</span> of this size would be expected to leave an <span class="highlight">immense</span> <span class="highlight">crater</span>, <span class="highlight">even</span> if the <span class="highlight">asteroid</span> itself was disintegrated by the <span class="highlight">impact</span>. The <span class="highlight"><span class="question11">intense</span></span> heat of the <span class="highlight">impact</span> would produce heat-shocked <span class="highlight">quartz</span> in many types of rock. Also, large blocks thrown aside by the <span class="highlight">impact</span> would form secondary craters surrounding the main <span class="highlight">crater</span>. To <span class="highlight">date</span>, several such secondary craters have been found <span class="highlight">along</span> Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, and heat-shocked <span class="highlight">quartz</span> has been found both in Mexico and in Haiti. A location called Chicxulub, <span class="highlight">along</span> the Yucatan <span class="highlight">coast</span>, has been suggested as the <span class="highlight">primary</span> <span class="highlight">impact</span> site.</p>

C is a synonymous replacement of the original text, so it is the correct answer. 70 million and 250 million are the time when the two mass extinctions took place. It is not that 70 million years that A said has been happening. It is not what D said that occurs every 25 million years. The began of B is opposite to the end of the original text. wrong.</p>

              <p>A uses at present as the key word to locate the last sentence, but this paragraph is very short. After the quick sweep, there is an answer.

The original sentence says that among all the hypotheses of what the late Cretaceous biological extinction event was, the comet impact was the most attractive. How the impact of the operation can be biologically extinct. A's challenge and D's test have similar meanings. The two are explanatory relationships. They are not to refute or test each other, so neither answer is correct, and the comet impact is not a simple description of the late Cretaceous extinction. So describe is wrong</p>
