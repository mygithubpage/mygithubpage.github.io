(around 70 million years ago). <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>There was another, <span class="highlight">even</span> larger, <span class="highlight">mass</span><span class="highlight">extinction</span> at the end of the Permian period (around 250 million years ago).
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>The Permian event has attracted much less <span class="highlight">attention</span> than other <span class="highlight">mass</span> extinctions because mostly unfamiliar <span class="highlight">species</span> perished at that time.</p><p>The <span class="highlight">fossil</span><span class="highlight">record</span> shows at <span class="highlight">least</span> five <span class="highlight">mass</span> extinctions in which many families of <span class="highlight">marine</span> organisms died out. The rates of <span class="highlight">extinction</span> happening today are as great as the rates during these <span class="highlight">mass</span> extinctions. Many scientists have <span class="highlight">therefore</span> concluded that a sixth great <span class="highlight">mass</span><span class="highlight">extinction</span> is currently in progress.</p><p>What could cause such high rates of <span class="highlight">extinction</span>? There are several hypotheses, including warming or cooling of Earth, changes in <span class="highlight">seasonal</span> fluctuations or ocean currents, and changing positions of the continents. Biological hypotheses include <span class="highlight">ecological</span> changes brought about by the <span class="highlight">evolution</span> of <span class="highlight">cooperation</span> between insects and flowering plants or of bottom-feeding predators in the oceans. Some of the proposed mechanisms required a very <span class="highlight">brief</span> period during which all extinctions suddenly took place; other mechanisms would be more likely to have taken place more <span class="highlight">gradually</span>, over an <span class="question3">extended</span> period, or at different times on different continents. Some hypotheses fail to <span class="highlight">account</span> for <span class="highlight">simultaneous</span> extinctions on land and in the seas. Each <span class="highlight">mass</span><span class="highlight">extinction</span> may have had a different cause. <span class="highlight">Evidence</span> points to hunting by humans and <span class="highlight">habitat</span><span class="highlight">destruction</span> as the likely causes for the <span class="highlight">current</span><span class="highlight">mass</span><span class="highlight">extinction</span>.</p><p><span class="question6">American paleontologists David Raup and John Sepkoski, who have studied <span class="highlight">extinction</span> rates in a number of <span class="highlight">fossil</span> groups, suggest that episodes of increased <span class="highlight">extinction</span> have recurred <span class="highlight">periodically</span>, <span class="highlight">approximately</span> every 26 million years since the mid-Cretaceous period.</span> The late Cretaceous <span class="highlight">extinction</span> of the dinosaurs and ammonoids was just one of the more <span class="highlight">drastic</span> in a whole <span class="highlight">series</span> of such recurrent <span class="highlight">extinction</span> episodes. The possibility that <span class="highlight">mass</span> extinctions may <span class="highlight">recur</span><span class="highlight">periodically</span> has <span class="highlight">given</span> rise to such hypotheses as that of a <span class="highlight">companion</span> star with a long-period <span class="highlight">orbit</span> deflecting other bodies from their normal orbits, making some of them fall to Earth as meteors and causing <span class="highlight">widespread</span> devastation upon <span class="highlight">impact</span>.</p><p>Of the various hypotheses attempting to <span class="highlight">account</span> for the late Cretaceous extinctions, the one that has attracted the most <span class="highlight">attention</span> in recent years is the asteroid-impact <span class="highlight">hypothesis</span> first suggested by Luis and Walter Alvarez. According to this <span class="highlight">hypothesis</span>, Earth collided with an <span class="highlight">asteroid</span> with an estimated <span class="highlight">diameter</span> of 10 kilometers, or with several asteroids, the combined <span class="highlight">mass</span> of which was <span class="highlight">comparable</span>. The force of <span class="highlight">collision</span> spewed large amounts of <span class="highlight">debris</span> into the <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span>, darkening the skies for several years before the finer particles settled. The reduced <span class="highlight">level</span> of <span class="highlight">photosynthesis</span> led to a <span class="highlight">massive</span><span class="highlight">decline</span> in plant life of all kinds, and this caused <span class="highlight">massive</span><span class="highlight">starvation</span> first of herbivores and <span class="highlight">subsequently</span> of carnivores. The <span class="highlight">mass</span><span class="highlight">extinction</span> would have occurred very suddenly under this <span class="highlight">hypothesis</span>.</p><p>One interesting test of the Alvarez <span class="highlight">hypothesis</span> is based on the presence of the rare-earth <span class="highlight">element</span><span class="highlight">iridium</span> (Ir). Earth's <span class="highlight">crust</span> contains very little of this <span class="highlight">element</span>, but most asteroids <span class="highlight">contain</span> a lot more. <span class="highlight">Debris</span> thrown into the <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span> by an <span class="highlight">asteroid</span><span class="highlight">collision</span> would <span class="highlight">presumably</span><span class="highlight">contain</span> large amounts of <span class="highlight">iridium</span>, and <span class="highlight">atmospheric</span> currents would carry this <span class="highlight">material</span> all over the globe. A search of <span class="highlight">sedimentary</span> deposits that <span class="highlight">span</span> the <span class="highlight">boundary</span> between the Cretaceous and <span class="highlight">Tertiary</span> periods shows that there is a <span class="highlight">dramatic</span> increase in the <span class="highlight">abundance</span> of <span class="highlight">iridium</span><span class="highlight">briefly</span> and precisely at this <span class="highlight">boundary</span>. This <span class="highlight">iridium</span><span class="highlight">anomaly</span> offers strong support for the Alvarez <span class="highlight">hypothesis</span><span class="highlight">even</span> though <span class="question10">no <span class="highlight">asteroid</span> itself has ever been recovered.</span></p><p>An <span class="highlight">asteroid</span> of this size would be expected to leave an <span class="highlight">immense</span><span class="highlight">crater</span>, <span class="highlight">even</span> if the <span class="highlight">asteroid</span> itself was disintegrated by the <span class="highlight">impact</span>. The <span class="highlight"><span class="question11">intense</span></span> heat of the <span class="highlight">impact</span> would produce heat-shocked <span class="highlight">quartz</span> in many types of rock. Also, large blocks thrown aside by the <span class="highlight">impact</span> would form secondary craters surrounding the main <span class="highlight">crater</span>. To <span class="highlight">date</span>, several such secondary craters have been found <span class="highlight">along</span> Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, and heat-shocked <span class="highlight">quartz</span> has been found both in Mexico and in Haiti. A location called Chicxulub, <span class="highlight">along</span> the Yucatan <span class="highlight">coast</span>, has been suggested as the <span class="highlight">primary</span><span class="highlight">impact</span> site.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Paragraph 1 supports which of the following statements about mass extinctions?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They take place over a period of 70 million years.</p><p>B. They began during the Cretaceous period.</p><p>C. They eliminate many animal species that exist at the time they occur.</p><p>D. They occur every 250 million years.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C. Using mass extinctions as the key word to locate the first sentence, saying that a large number of creatures extinct in a short period of time is called a mass extinction event. C is a synonymous replacement of the original text, so it is the correct answer. 70 million and 250 million are the time when the two mass extinctions took place. It is not that 70 million years that A said has been happening. It is not what D said that occurs every 25 million years. The began of B is opposite to the end of the original text. wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 2, scientists base their belief that a mass extinction is going on at present on which of the following?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The speed with which mass extinctions are happening today is similar to the speed of past extinctions.</p><p>B. The number of species that have died out since the last extinction event is extremely large.</p><p>C. Mass extinctions occur with regularity and it is time for another one.</p><p>D. Fossil records of many marine species have disappeared.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A uses at present as the key word to locate the last sentence, but this paragraph is very short. After the quick sweep, there is an answer. It is said that the speed of modern biological extinction is about the same as the time of the mass extinction, and it is concluded that the mass extinction is now occurring. So the reason is that the extinction rate is similar to Answer A.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question3">extended</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. specific</p><p>B. unlimited</p><p>C. reasonable</p><p>D. long</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" D"><p>Extend extends, extends, and extends long, so long is the correct answer. The original sentence says that other mechanisms may gradually occur. In what period of time, since it is gradually happening, it will take a long time, of course, so the answer is D. Although long but not infinite, so unlimited; specific time and reasonable reasonable time did not say the original.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 3, each of the following has been proposed as a possible cause of mass extinctions EXCEPT</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. habitat destruction</p><p>B. continental movement</p><p>C. fierce interspecies competition</p><p>D. changes in Earth's temperature</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The first sentence of this paragraph began to answer the second sentence of the reason, so this question is better. The second sentence of warming or cooling corresponds to the D answer, correct, not selected; changing position corresponds to B answer, correct, not selected; the last sentence of the habitat destruction corresponds to A answer, correct, not selected; only C does not correspond, so C is wrong, selected.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Paragraph 3 supports which of the following ideas about mass extinctions?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Scientists know the exact causes of most mass extinctions.</p><p>B. Mass extinctions are unlikely to happen again in the future.</p><p>C. Insects, flowering plants, and bottom-feeding predators in the oceans tend to be the first organisms to disappear during episodes of mass extinctions.</p><p>D. Some mass extinctions occurred on land and in the seas at the same time.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>If you ask the whole paragraph, it is best to use exclusion. A's exact causes keyword positioning to the first two sentences, the original said there are many assumptions, so there is no accurate reason, A wrong; B's future original did not say, so wrong; C a large number of creatures do keyword positioning to the third Sentences, but the original did not say that they were the first to suffer a group of creatures, C wrong; D's land and seas do keyword positioning to the penultimate sentence, simultaneous is at the same time, correct.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Based on their studies of extinction rates of numerous fossil groups, paleontologists David Raup and John Sepkoski have determined that mass extinctions occur about every 26 million years.</p><p>B. David Raup and John Sepkoski studied extinction rates of numerous fossil groups and suggest that mass extinctions during the Cretaceous period continued for 26 million years.</p><p>C. Studies that paleontologists David Raup and John Sepkoski conducted of various fossil groups have revealed that extinction rates have increased over the past 26 million years.</p><p>D. The studies conducted by paleontologists David Raup and John Sepkoski of the fossil remains of species suggest that the extinction rate of species started to increase by the middle of the Cretaceous period.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The original sentence says that these two people think that mass extinction is repeated. The correct answer is A. The errors of C and D are easy to distinguish because the predicate verbs of C and D are not mentioned in the original, so both C and D are wrong. Item B is quite confusing, but B is wrong in juxtaposition of the two verbs suggest and study, but the original sentence is the first study, and then suggest, although it is not clearly pointed out that A's base on, but the previous study concluded that this The conclusion is of course related to research, so A is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, what aspect of extinction episodes does the companion-star hypothesis supposedly clarify?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Their location</p><p>B. Their frequency</p><p>C. Their duration</p><p>D. Their severity</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>With the companion star hypothesis as the key word to the last sentence, the recurring mass extinction supports the companion star hypothesis. This hypothesis said that the orbital deformation caused some stars to deviate from the normal orbit and became a comet that fell into the earth. The original sentence said repeatedly that it was able to Explain the frequency of extinction, the answer is B.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The phrase "<span class="highlight">account for</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. describe</p><p>B. challenge</p><p>C. explain</p><p>D. test</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="account for C"><p>Account for responsible, explain, so the correct answer is explain. The original sentence says that among all the hypotheses of what the late Cretaceous biological extinction event was, the comet impact was the most attractive. How the impact of the operation can be biologically extinct. A's challenge and D's test have similar meanings. The two are explanatory relationships. They are not to refute or test each other, so neither answer is correct, and the comet impact is not a simple description of the late Cretaceous extinction. So describe is wrong</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 6, what made iridium a useful test of the Alvarez hypothesis?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Its occurrence in a few locations on Earth against several locations on other planets</p><p>B. Its occurrence in limited quantities on Earth against its abundance in asteroids</p><p>C. Its ability to remain solid at extremely high temperatures</p><p>D. Its ease of detection even in very small amounts</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The keyword was used to locate the first sentence in the name of the person, but the first sentence did not say why the test was useful for verifying the hypothesis of A. Looking down, there was almost no Ir on earth, but the contents of other stars were much larger, and the synonyms were rewritten. The answer is B. In other words, if a large amount of Ir is found on the earth, it means that it has suffered an impact.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>In stating that "<span class="highlight">no asteroid itself has ever been recovered</span>", the author emphasizes which of the following?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The importance of the indirect evidence for a large asteroid</p><p>B. The fact that no evidence supports the asteroid impact hypothesis</p><p>C. The reason many researchers reject the Alvarez hypothesis</p><p>D. The responsibility of scientists for not making the effort to discover the asteroid itself</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="no asteroid itself has ever been recovered A"><p>The rhetoric purpose question, see this sentence first, the original sentence says Ir abnormally supports the collision, but has not discovered the concrete star body. So B said there was no evidence wrong, and he said it; C someone rejects his point of view, and D's scientists have the responsibility of the original saying that it is not selected; the correct answer is A, and only the indirect evidence of Ir abnormality can support the collision, so Is indirect evidence</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question11">intense</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. sudden</p><p>B. unusual</p><p>C. immediate</p><p>D. extreme</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" D"><p>Intense high intensity, dense, extreme, so D's extreme is correct. The original sentence said that what kind of heat generated by the impact can produce a lot of heat-shocked quartz, all heat shocked, certainly a lot of heat, while sudden and immediate mean that the concept of time does not indicate how much it is wrong; B's unusual Although it may be expressed in many ways, it is not necessarily, but it may also indicate the concept of time.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the purpose of paragraph 7 in the passage?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It proposes a decisive new test of the Alvarez hypothesis.</p><p>B. It presents additional supporting evidence for the Alvarez hypothesis.</p><p>C. It explains why evidence relating to the Alvarez hypothesis is hard to find.</p><p>D. It shows how recent evidence has raised doubts about the Alvarez hypothesis.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The whole question is focused on the head and tail. At the beginning, it is said that the impact will leave a pit, and that the heat will be blabla. At the end, it is said that the place is considered to be the place where the impact occurred, so it should be the theory of support crash, so the additional supporting evidence of B is correct. D's doubts are wrong; C said that the impact position is difficult to find opposite to the last sentence, wrong; A's test did not say the original.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>In general, it is believed that these two extinctions resulted from drastic environmental changes that followed meteorite impacts or massive volcanic eruptions..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The two transition points are the pronoun and the two extinctions. According to the two extinctions, we know that the former must have talked about two extinctions. We can determine whether B or D is the answer. Before and after C, we can't insert any sentences. ; However, this means that the sentence to be inserted must be put back, so D is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question14" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>
There have been many attempts to explain the causes of mass extinctions.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.Asteroid impacts, evolutionary developments, and changes in Earth's climate and in the positions of the continents have all been proposed as possible causes of mass extinctions.</p><p>B.Researchers have observed 26-million-year cycles in extinction rates of a number of fossil groups that could all be attributed to the same cause.</p><p>C.According to the Alvarez hypothesis, much of the iridium originally present on Earth was thrown into the atmosphere as a result of an asteroid impact that also caused a mass extinction.</p><p>D.The unusual distribution of iridium on Earth and the presence of craters and heat-shocked quartz are central to the theory that an asteroid impact caused the late Cretaceous event.</p><p>E.The collision between Earth and a large asteroid resulted in massive damage and generated enough heat to cause irreversible changes in Earth's atmosphere.</p><p>F.There was a particularly large mass extinction that occurred around 250 million years ago at the end of the Permian period, whose cause could not be determined.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="ABD"><p>The Astroid option corresponds to the entire third paragraph, correct. The Researchers option corresponds to the last sentence of the fourth paragraph of the original text, correct. The According option is a detail of the sixth paragraph, not selected. The unusual option corresponds to the first two paragraphs of the original paragraph, correct. The irreversible in the collision option is contrary to the original text. In the fifth paragraph of the original text, the atmosphere will be restored after particles settle, instead of being irreversible. The There was option is a detail in the first paragraph, not selected.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
