In a group activity, people usually have same interests and they perform some tasks together, so there's a chance that some of the group members need to cooperate. Through cooperation, people start to know each other and then make friends. For example, I always play basketball with strangers. At the beginning, I don't even know my teammates' names. But after a few hours' cooperation, we become friends and start to talk about each other. Sometimes, we even go to have a meal after playing. And actually, this is how I make friends.</p></article></div></main></body></html>
