The women should participate in a sport that takes less of her time.</p><p>B. The women may not have enough time to study for class.</p><p>C.

Are you having a similar</p><p>The professor mentioned that he played football when he was in college, so he dealt with the relationship between bad learning and contact and asked students if they had similar problems. Although the professor did not finish, but through the student's answer, we can infer that he wanted to ask whether the student had the same time as he did not have time to study.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What did the woman study in her laboratory project?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

The ACD has been mentioned in the text, but the students are mainly working in the laboratory to observe each process of cell division, but not for preservation but observation.

Several short study sessions are more effective than one extended study session.</p><p>B. Studying in the library increases the brain's ability to absorb details.</p><p>C. Studying for extended periods of time is good exercise for the brain.</p><p>D. Students who excel at laboratory work usually perform well on exams.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>There is research that shows that after about an hour of intense focus, your brain needs a break. It needs to, you know, shift gears a little. Your brain's ability to absorb information starts to decline after about the first hour.</p><p>It is useful for professors in the dialogue to explicitly lose more than one hour per day for review. Corresponds to the A option.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>At the end of the conversation,why does the professor return to the topic of running on the track team?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

To illustrate the point he is making about study habits.</p><p>D. To find out if the next track meet will interfere with the next exam.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Think of your brain as a muscle. If you didn't practice regularly with your track team, and then tried to squeeze in three weeks worth of running practice the day before a track meet, how well do you think you'd perform in your Races?</p><p>An analogy is made with track and field races. Muscles are used to train and the brain is trained. Use students' familiar examples to illustrate the development of learning habits.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
