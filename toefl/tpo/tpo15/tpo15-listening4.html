            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.64" data-time="10.65">[00:10.65]</span>Professor: Hi, Samantha, how did your <span class="underline">track</span> meet go? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.29" data-time="14.29">[00:14.29]</span>Student: Great! I placed first in one race and third in another. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.51" data-time="17.58">[00:17.58]</span>Professor: Congratulations, you must practice a lot. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.94" data-time="20.09">[00:20.09]</span>Student: Three times a week pre-season, but now that we are <span class="underline">competing</span> every weekend. <span class="time" data-times="2.72" data-time="24.03">[00:24.03]</span>We practice six days a week from 3:30 to 5. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.29" data-time="26.75">[00:26.75]</span>Professor: Athletics places a heavy demand on your time, don't they? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.59" data-time="30.04">[00:30.04]</span>Student: Yeah, but I really love <span class="underline">competing</span>, so... </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.25" data-time="33.63">[00:33.63]</span>Professor: You know, I played <span class="underline">soccer</span> in college and my biggest <span class="underline">challenge</span>, and I didn't always succeed, was getting my studying in during <span class="underline">soccer</span> <span class="underline">season</span>. <span class="time" data-times="1.93" data-time="40.88">[00:40.88]</span>Are you having a <span class="underline">similar</span>? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.42" data-time="42.81">[00:42.81]</span>Student: No. I really do make time to study, and I actually study more for this class than I do for all my other classes. <span class="time" data-times="5.96" data-time="50.23">[00:50.23]</span>But I didn't see the grade I expected on my mid-term exam which is why I came by. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.63" data-time="56.19">[00:56.19]</span>Professor: Well, you didn't do badly on the exam but I agree it did not <span class="underline">reflect</span> your <span class="underline">potential</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.59" data-time="61.82">[01:01.82]</span>I say this because your work on the lab <span class="underline">project</span> was <span class="underline">exemplary</span>. <span class="time" data-times="12.85" data-time="65.41">[01:05.41]</span>I was so impressed with the way you handled the <span class="underline">microscope</span> and the samples of onion cells and, well, how careful you observed and diagramed and interpreted each <span class="underline">stage</span> of <span class="underline">cell</span> <span class="underline">division</span>, and I don't think you could have done that if you hadn't understood the chapter. <span class="time" data-times="2.93" data-time="78.26">[01:18.26]</span>I mean, it seemed you really had a good understanding of it. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.21" data-time="81.19">[01:21.19]</span>Student: I thought so, too. <span class="time" data-times="3.39" data-time="82.4">[01:22.40]</span>But I missed some questions about <span class="underline">cell</span> <span class="underline">division</span> on the exam. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.63" data-time="85.79">[01:25.79]</span>Professor: So, what happened? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.6" data-time="87.42">[01:27.42]</span>Student: I just <span class="underline">sort</span> of blanked out, I guess. <span class="time" data-times="2.43" data-time="90.02">[01:30.02]</span>I had a hard time remembering details. <span class="time" data-times="1.53" data-time="92.45">[01:32.45]</span>It was so frustrating. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.58" data-time="93.98">[01:33.98]</span>Professor: All right. Let's back up. <span class="time" data-times="1.72" data-time="95.56">[01:35.56]</span>You say you studied. <span class="time" data-times="1.78" data-time="97.28">[01:37.28]</span>Where? At home? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.93" data-time="99.06">[01:39.06]</span>Student: At my kitchen table, actually. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.85" data-time="100.99">[01:40.99]</span>Professor: And that's supposed to be a quiet environment? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.3" data-time="103.84">[01:43.84]</span>Student: Not exactly. My brother and parents try to keep it down when I'm studying but the phone <span class="underline">pretty</span> much rings off the <span class="underline">hook</span>, so. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.49" data-time="111.14">[01:51.14]</span>Professor: So you might try a place with fewer distractions, like, the library. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.7" data-time="114.63">[01:54.63]</span>Student: But the library closes at midnight and I like to study all night before a test. <span class="time" data-times="2.11" data-time="119.33">[01:59.33]</span>You know, so everything is fresh in my <span class="underline">mind</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.82" data-time="121.44">[02:01.44]</span>I studied six straight hours the night before the mid-term exam. <span class="time" data-times="2.62" data-time="125.26">[02:05.26]</span>That's why I expected to do so much better. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.15" data-time="127.88">[02:07.88]</span>Professor: Oh, OK. You know that studying six <span class="underline">consecutive</span> hours is not <span class="underline">equivalent</span> to studying one hour a day for six days. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="0.99" data-time="135.03">[02:15.03]</span>Student: It isn't? </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.64" data-time="136.02">[02:16.02]</span>Professor: No, there's a research that shows that after an hour of <span class="underline">intensive</span> <span class="underline">focus</span>, your brain needs a <span class="underline">break</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.9" data-time="141.66">[02:21.66]</span>It needs to, you know, <span class="underline">shift</span> gears a little. <span class="time" data-times="4.44" data-time="144.56">[02:24.56]</span>Your brain's <span class="underline">ability</span> to <span class="underline">absorb</span> information starts to <span class="underline">decline</span> after about the first hour. <span class="time" data-times="12.17" data-time="149">[02:29.00]</span>So if you are dealing with a lot of new concepts and <span class="underline">vocabulary</span>, anyway, if you just <span class="underline">review</span> your notes <span class="underline">even</span> twenty minutes a day, it'd be much better than waiting until the night before the exam to try and <span class="underline">absorb</span> all those details. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.49" data-time="161.17">[02:41.17]</span>Student: Oh, I didn't realize. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="1.88" data-time="163.66">[02:43.66]</span>Professor: Think of your brain as a <span class="underline">muscle</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="165.54">[02:45.54]</span>If you didn't practice regularly with your <span class="underline">track</span> team, and then try to <span class="underline">squeeze</span> in three weeks' <span class="underline">worth</span> of running practice the day before a <span class="underline">track</span> meet, how well do you think you will <span class="underline">perform</span> in the races? </p>
