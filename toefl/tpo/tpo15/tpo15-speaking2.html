          <p>I totally agree with this statement that it's important to remember and learn from the past.We all make mistakes and we all have to remember mistakes. Because mistakes tell us what isn't right. For example, when I was in the first grade primary school, I took a toy car from another student without informing him. I was too young to know that taking things from others without mentioning isn't right. Then my teacher helped the other student find this toy car and labeled me as a thieve. I didn't realize how serious this matter was until my father told me that this was humiliating. I swore to myself that I would never take anything from others without informing the owners. I think this is a valuable lesson and I'll remember it forever.</p>
