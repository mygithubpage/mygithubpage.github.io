              <span class="time" data-times="7.52" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in an Art <span class="underline">History</span> class. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="20.3" data-time="7.52">[00:07.52]</span>
              <span class="underline">Male</span> Professor: Now in Europe in the Middle Ages before the invention of printing and printing <span class="underline">press</span>, all books, all manuscripts were hand made, and the <span class="underline">material</span> typically used for the pages was <span class="underline">parchment</span>, which is animal skin that's stretched and dried under <span class="underline">tension</span> so it becomes really <span class="underline">flat</span> and can be written on. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.47" data-time="27.82">[00:27.82]</span>During the 1400s when printing was being developed, paper became the <span class="underline">predominant</span> <span class="underline">material</span> for books in Europe. <span class="time" data-times="2.93" data-time="35.29">[00:35.29]</span>But <span class="underline">prior</span> to that, it was <span class="underline">parchment</span>. <span class="time" data-times="10.52" data-time="38.22">[00:38.22]</span> <span class="underline">Parchment</span> is <span class="underline">durable</span>, much more so than paper, and it could be reused which came in <span class="underline">handy</span> since it was a costly <span class="underline">material</span> and in short <span class="underline">supply</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.6" data-time="48.74">[00:48.74]</span>So it wasn't uncommon for the scribes or monks who produced the manuscripts. <span class="time" data-times="4.39" data-time="53.34">[00:53.34]</span>Uh, remember before printing, books were made mainly in monasteries. <span class="time" data-times="5.9" data-time="57.73">[00:57.73]</span>Well, the scribes often recycled the <span class="underline">parchment</span> that had been used for earlier manuscripts. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.74" data-time="63.63">[01:03.63]</span>They <span class="underline">simply</span> erased the ink off the <span class="underline">parchment</span> and wrote something new in its place. <span class="time" data-times="6.62" data-time="69.37">[01:09.37]</span>A <span class="underline">manuscript</span> page that was written on, erased and used again, is called a palimpsest. <span class="time" data-times="8.8" data-time="75.99">[01:15.99]</span>Palimpsests were created ...well, we know about two methods that were used for removing ink from <span class="underline">parchment</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.97" data-time="84.79">[01:24.79]</span>In the late Middle Ages, it was customary to <span class="underline">scrape</span> away the surface of the <span class="underline">parchment</span> with an abrasive, which completely wiped out any writing that was there. <span class="time" data-times="7.76" data-time="94.76">[01:34.76]</span>But earlier, in the Middle Ages, the <span class="underline">original</span> ink was usually removed by washing the used <span class="underline">parchment</span> with milk. <span class="time" data-times="2.33" data-time="102.52">[01:42.52]</span>That removed the ink. <span class="time" data-times="12.01" data-time="104.85">[01:44.85]</span>But with the passing of time, the <span class="underline">original</span> writing might reappear; in fact, it might reappear to the <span class="underline">extent</span> that scholars could make out and <span class="underline">even</span> <span class="underline">decipher</span> the <span class="underline">original</span> text. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.04" data-time="116.86">[01:56.86]</span>Perhaps the most famous example is the <span class="underline">Archimedes</span> palimpsest. <span class="time" data-times="4.88" data-time="121.9">[02:01.90]</span> <span class="underline">Archimedes</span> lived in Greece around 200 BCE. <span class="time" data-times="5.35" data-time="126.78">[02:06.78]</span>And as you probably know, he's considered one of the greatest mathematicians who ever lived.<span class="time" data-times="9.4" data-time="132.13">[02:12.13]</span> <span class="underline">Even</span> though many of his writings have been lost, including what many now think to be his most important work, called The <span class="underline">Method</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="13.3" data-time="141.53">[02:21.53]</span>But in 1998, a book of prayers from the Middle Ages sold in an art <span class="underline">auction</span> for a lot of money, more money than anyone would <span class="underline">pay</span> for a damaged book from the 12th <span class="underline">century</span>, beautiful or not. Why? <span class="time" data-times="7.77" data-time="154.83">[02:34.83]</span>It had been discovered that the book was a palimpsest, and <span class="underline">beneath</span> the surface writing of the <span class="underline">manuscript</span> laid, guess what? <span class="time" data-times="4.33" data-time="162.6">[02:42.60]</span>Mathematical theorems and diagrams from <span class="underline">Archimedes</span>. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.02" data-time="166.93">[02:46.93]</span>
              <span class="underline">Archimedes</span>' writings were originally done on the <span class="underline">papyrus</span> scrolls. <span class="time" data-times="7.49" data-time="173.95">[02:53.95]</span>Then in the tenth <span class="underline">century</span>, a scribe made a copy on <span class="underline">parchment</span> of some of his texts and diagrams including, as it turns out, The <span class="underline">Method</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.95" data-time="181.44">[03:01.44]</span>This was extremely fortunate, since later on, the <span class="underline">original</span> <span class="underline">papyrus</span> scrolls disappeared. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="20.4" data-time="188.39">[03:08.39]</span>About two hundred years later in the 12th <span class="underline">century</span>, this <span class="underline">parchment</span> <span class="underline">manuscript</span> became a palimpsest when a scribe used the <span class="underline">parchment</span> to make a prayer book, so the pages, the pieces of <span class="underline">parchment</span> themselves, had been preserved, but the <span class="underline">Archimedes</span> text was erased and written over and no one knew it existed. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="12.26" data-time="208.79">[03:28.79]</span>It wasn't until 1906 that a <span class="underline">scholar</span> came <span class="underline">across</span> the prayer book in the library and realized it was a palimpsest, and that the <span class="underline">underlying</span> <span class="underline">layer</span> of text could only have come from <span class="underline">Archimedes</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.28" data-time="221.05">[03:41.05]</span>That was when his work The <span class="underline">Method</span> was discovered for the first time. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="13.9" data-time="225.33">[03:45.33]</span>Um, the palimpsest then went <span class="underline">through</span> some more <span class="underline">tough</span> times but <span class="underline">eventually</span> it ended up in an art <span class="underline">auction</span> where it was bought and then donated to an art museum in Baltimore for <span class="underline">conservation</span> and study. <span class="time" data-times="10.19" data-time="239.23">[03:59.23]</span>To <span class="underline">avoid</span> further damage to the <span class="underline">manuscript</span>, research team at the art museum has had to be extremely <span class="underline">selective</span> in the techniques they used to see the <span class="underline">original</span> writing. </p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="8.49" data-time="249.42">[04:09.42]</span>They've used <span class="underline">ultraviolet</span> light and some other techniques, and if you're interested in that <span class="underline">sort</span> of thing, you can learn more about it in an art <span class="underline">conservation</span> class. <span class="time" data-times="4.65" data-time="257.91">[04:17.91]</span>But, actually, it was a physicist who came up with the <span class="underline">method</span> that was a <span class="underline">breakthrough</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.21" data-time="262.56">[04:22.56]</span>He realized that the iron in the <span class="underline">ancient</span> ink would <span class="underline">display</span> if <span class="underline">exposed</span> to a certain X-ray imaging <span class="underline">method</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="269.77">[04:29.77]</span>And except for small portions of the text that couldn't be deciphered, this <span class="underline">technique</span>'s been very helpful in seeing <span class="underline">Archimedes</span> texts and drawings <span class="underline">through</span> <span class="underline">medieval</span> over-writing.  </p>
