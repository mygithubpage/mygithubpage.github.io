How Archimedes was identified as the author of some ancient texts.</p><p>B. The recovery of some ancient writings on mathematics.</p><p>C. Differences among various writing materials used in the Middle Ages.</p><p>D. Techniques for restoring ancient manuscripts.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The lecture begins with a presentation of his point of parchment and a method of rewriting the book. The second way of doing this rewrites the original self after a period of time, and even reappears to an identifiable level. Then use Archimedes's rewrite as an example to illustrate</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>What are two points the professor makes about parchment?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It is more long lasting than paper.</p><p>B. It was inexpensive to produce during the Middle Ages.</p><p>C. It was the material Archimedes used for his writings.</p><p>D. Its use for books decreased after the 1400s.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="AD"><p>During the 1400s, when printing was being developed, paper became the predominant material for books in Europe, but prior to that, it was parchment. Parchment is durable, much more so than than paper</p><p>It was learned from the lecture that before 1400s, parchment was the main material of the book, but then it was paper. Parchment is relatively more durable but expensive and short supply.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor imply when he explains the washing and scraping methods that were used to remove ink from a parchment surface?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Washing made parchment more able to retain newly applied ink than scraping did.</p><p>B. Washing was less effective than scraping as a means of permanently erasing ink.</p><p>C. The scraping method was used in the creation of the Archimedes palimpsest.</p><p>D. Neither method completely erased the original text.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>But with the passing of time, the original writing might reappear. It was learned from the lecture that the use of an abrasive scraper would completely erase the handwriting, whereas with milk, the handwriting would reappear after a period of time, and it would be difficult to identify it. It is easy to infer that the method of using milk is less.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What type of book became known as the Archimedes palimpsest?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. A history book.</p><p>B. A physics book.</p><p>C. A prayer book.</p><p>D. An artist's book.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>It wasn't until 1906 that a scholar came across the prayer book in a library and realized it was a palimpsest, and that the underlying layer of texts could only have come from Archimedes.</p><p>It was learned from the lecture that scholars had accidentally seen a prayer book in the library and discovered that this was a rewrite of the Archimedes manuscript.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor imply about the various techniques used to view Archimedes'text?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The students should be familiar with most of the techniques.</p><p>B. Different techniques were used to analyze the iron content of ancient ink.</p><p>C. The use of ultraviolet light was more damaging than the other techniques</p><p>D. X-ray imaging was more effective than the other techniques</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>He realized that the iron in the ancient ink would display if exposed to a certain X-ray imaging method, and except for small portions of the text that couldn't be deciphered, this technique's been very helpful in seeing Archimedes' texts and drawings through The medieval overwriting.</p><p>Professors of ultraviolet light and other technologies did not finish, and they immediately turned to X-ray breakthroughs. With X-rays, most of Archimedes' texts are recognizable. Therefore, it can be inferred that the X-ray image method is better than other techniques.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor imply about the significance of the Archimedes palimpsest?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It is significant because it contains what may be Archimedes' most important work</p><p>B. It is significant because it proves that a certain mathematics text was written by Archimedes.</p><p>C. It is significant because it is the oldest one ever discovered.</p><p>D. It is significant because it is the first one to be completely deciphered.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>This was extremely fortunate, since later on, the original papyrus scrolls disappeared.</p><p>From the article we can infer the importance of Archimedes to rewrite this book because it has Archimedes' most important work Methodology.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
