            <b>Glacier Formation</b>
          </h4>

            </span>static2.zhan.com/beikao/images/icon.png?v=201803081738"&gt;Glaciers are slowly moving masses of ice that have accumulated on land in areas where more snowfalls during a year than melts. Snow falls as hexagonal crystals, but once on the ground, snow is soon transformed into a compacted <span class="underline">mass</span> of smaller, rounded grains. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> As the <span class="underline">air</span> <span class="underline">space</span> around them is lessened by compaction and <span class="underline">melting</span>, the grains become denser. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>With further <span class="underline">melting</span>, refreezing, and increased weight from newer snowfall above, the snow reaches a <span class="underline">granular</span> recrystallized <span class="underline">stage</span> <span class="underline">intermediate</span> between flakes and ice known as firn. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>With <span class="underline">additional</span> time, <span class="underline">pressure</span>, and refrozen meltwater from above, the small firn granules become larger, <span class="light">interlocked</span> crystals of blue <span class="underline">glacial</span> ice. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>When the ice is thick enough, usually over 30 meters, the weight of the snow and firn will cause the ice crystals toward the bottom to become <span class="underline">plastic</span> and to flow outward or <span class="underline">downward</span> from the area of snow <span class="underline">accumulation</span>.</p>
          <p>Glaciers are open systems, with snow as the system's input and meltwater as the system's main <span class="underline">output</span>. The <span class="underline">glacial</span> system is governed by two <span class="underline">basic</span> <span class="underline">climatic</span> variables: <span class="underline">precipitation</span> and <span class="underline">temperature</span>. For a <span class="underline">glacier</span> to grow or <span class="underline">maintain</span> its <span class="underline">mass</span>, there must be <span class="underline">sufficient</span> snowfall to <span class="underline">match</span> or <span class="underline">exceed</span> the <span class="underline">annual</span> loss <span class="underline">through</span> <span class="underline">melting</span>, <span class="underline">evaporation</span>, and calving, which occurs when the <span class="underline">glacier</span> loses <span class="underline">solid</span> chunks as icebergs to the sea or to large lakes. If summer temperatures are high for too long, then all the snowfall from the <span class="underline">previous</span> winter will <span class="underline">melt</span>. <span class="underline">Surplus</span> snowfall is <span class="underline">essential</span> for a <span class="underline">glacier</span> to develop. A <span class="underline">surplus</span> allows snow to <span class="underline">accumulate</span> and for the <span class="underline">pressure</span> of snow accumulated over the years to <span class="underline">transform</span> buried snow into <span class="underline">glacial</span> ice with a depth great enough for the ice to flow. Glaciers are sometimes classified by <span class="underline">temperature</span> as faster-flowing <span class="underline">temperate</span> glaciers or as slower-flowing <span class="underline">polar</span> glaciers.</p>
          <p>Glaciers are part of Earth's <span class="underline">hydrologic</span> <span class="underline">cycle</span> and are <span class="underline">second</span> only to the oceans in the total <span class="underline">amount</span> of water contained. About 2 percent of Earth's water is currently frozen as ice. Two percent may be a deceiving <span class="underline">figure</span>, however, since over 80 percent of the world's freshwater is locked up as ice in glaciers, with the <span class="underline">majority</span> of it in <span class="underline">Antarctica</span>. The total <span class="underline">amount</span> of ice is <span class="underline">even</span> more <span class="underline">awesome</span> if we <span class="underline">estimate</span> the water released upon the <span class="underline">hypothetical</span> <span class="underline">melting</span> of the world's glaciers. Sea <span class="underline">level</span> would rise about 60 meters. This would change the geography of the <span class="underline">planet</span> <span class="underline">considerably</span>. In <span class="underline">contrast</span>, should another ice age <span class="underline">occur</span>, sea <span class="underline">level</span> would <span class="underline">drop</span> <span class="underline">drastically</span>. During the last ice age, sea <span class="underline">level</span> dropped about 120 meters.</p>
          <p>When snowfalls on high mountains or in <span class="underline">polar</span> regions, it may become part of the <span class="underline">glacial</span> system. Unlike rain, which returns rapidly to the sea or <span class="underline">atmosphere</span>, the snow that becomes part of a <span class="underline">glacier</span> is involved in a much more slowly cycling system. Here water may be stored in ice form for hundreds or <span class="underline">even</span> hundreds of thousands of years before being released again into the <span class="underline">liquid</span> water system as meltwater. In the <span class="underline">meantime</span>, however, this ice is not <span class="underline">static</span>. Glaciers move slowly <span class="underline">across</span> the land with <span class="underline">tremendous</span> energy, carving into <span class="underline">even</span> the hardest rock formations and <span class="underline">thereby</span> reshaping the <span class="underline">landscape</span> as they <span class="underline">engulf</span>, push, <span class="underline">drag</span>, and finally <span class="underline">deposit</span> rock <span class="underline">debris</span> in places far from its <span class="underline">original</span> location. As a result, glaciers create a great <span class="underline">variety</span> of landforms that <span class="underline">remain</span> long after the surface is released from its icy covering.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="underline">Throughout</span> most of Earth's <span class="underline">history</span>, glaciers did not exist, but at the present time about 10 percent of Earth's land surface is covered by glaciers. Present-day glaciers are found in <span class="underline">Antarctica</span>, in Greenland, and at high elevations on all the continents except Australia. In the recent past, from about 2.4 million to about 10,000 years ago, nearly a third of Earth's land area was <span class="underline">periodically</span> covered by ice thousands of meters thick. In the much more <span class="underline">distant</span> past, other ice ages have occurred.</p>
