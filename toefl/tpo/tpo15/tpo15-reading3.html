Snow falls as hexagonal crystals, but once on the ground, snow is soon transformed into a compacted <span class="highlight">mass</span> of smaller, rounded grains. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> As the <span class="highlight">air</span><span class="highlight">space</span> around them is lessened by compaction and <span class="highlight">melting</span>, the grains become denser. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>With further <span class="highlight">melting</span>, refreezing, and increased weight from newer snowfall above, the snow reaches a <span class="highlight">granular</span> recrystallized <span class="highlight">stage</span><span class="highlight">intermediate</span> between flakes and ice known as firn. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>With <span class="highlight">additional</span> time, <span class="highlight">pressure</span>, and refrozen meltwater from above, the small firn granules become larger, <span class="highlight question1">interlocked</span> crystals of blue <span class="highlight">glacial</span> ice. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>When the ice is thick enough, usually over 30 meters, the weight of the snow and firn will cause the ice crystals toward the bottom to become <span class="highlight">plastic</span> and to flow outward or <span class="highlight">downward</span> from the area of snow <span class="highlight">accumulation</span>.</p><p>Glaciers are open systems, with snow as the system's input and meltwater as the system's main <span class="highlight">output</span>. The <span class="highlight">glacial</span> system is governed by two <span class="highlight">basic</span><span class="highlight">climatic</span> variables: <span class="highlight">precipitation</span> and <span class="highlight">temperature</span>. For a <span class="highlight">glacier</span> to grow or <span class="highlight">maintain</span> its <span class="highlight">mass</span>, there must be <span class="highlight">sufficient</span> snowfall to <span class="highlight"><span class="question3">match</span></span> or <span class="highlight">exceed</span> the <span class="highlight">annual</span> loss <span class="highlight">through</span><span class="highlight">melting</span>, <span class="highlight">evaporation</span>, and calving, which occurs when the <span class="highlight">glacier</span> loses <span class="highlight">solid</span> chunks as icebergs to the sea or to large lakes. If summer temperatures are high for too long, then all the snowfall from the <span class="highlight">previous</span> winter will <span class="highlight">melt</span>. <span class="highlight">Surplus</span> snowfall is <span class="highlight">essential</span> for a <span class="highlight">glacier</span> to develop. A <span class="highlight">surplus</span> allows snow to <span class="highlight">accumulate</span> and for the <span class="highlight">pressure</span> of snow accumulated over the years to <span class="highlight"><span class="question4">transform</span></span> buried snow into <span class="highlight">glacial</span> ice with a depth great enough for the ice to flow. Glaciers are sometimes classified by <span class="highlight">temperature</span> as faster-flowing <span class="highlight">temperate</span> glaciers or as slower-flowing <span class="highlight">polar</span> glaciers.</p><p>Glaciers are part of Earth's <span class="highlight">hydrologic</span><span class="highlight">cycle</span> and are <span class="highlight">second</span> only to the oceans in the total <span class="highlight">amount</span> of water contained. About 2 percent of Earth's water is currently frozen as ice. Two percent may be a <span class="question7">deceiving</span><span class="highlight">figure</span>, however, since over 80 percent of the world's freshwater is locked up as ice in glaciers, with the <span class="highlight">majority</span> of it in <span class="highlight">Antarctica</span>. The total <span class="highlight">amount</span> of ice is <span class="highlight">even</span> more <span class="highlight">awesome</span> if we <span class="highlight">estimate</span> the water released upon the <span class="highlight">hypothetical</span><span class="highlight">melting</span> of the world's glaciers. Sea <span class="highlight">level</span> would rise about 60 meters. This would change the geography of the <span class="highlight">planet</span><span class="highlight">considerably</span>. In <span class="highlight">contrast</span>, should another ice age <span class="highlight">occur</span>, sea <span class="highlight">level</span> would <span class="highlight">drop</span><span class="highlight">drastically</span>. During the last ice age, sea <span class="highlight">level</span> dropped about 120 meters.</p><p>When snowfalls on high mountains or in <span class="highlight">polar</span> regions, it may become part of the <span class="highlight">glacial</span> system. Unlike rain, which returns rapidly to the sea or <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span>, the snow that becomes part of a <span class="highlight">glacier</span> is involved in a much more slowly cycling system. Here water may be stored in ice form for hundreds or <span class="highlight">even</span> hundreds of thousands of years before being released again into the <span class="highlight">liquid</span> water system as meltwater. In the <span class="highlight">meantime</span>, however, this ice is not <span class="highlight">static</span>. <span class="question11">Glaciers move slowly <span class="highlight">across</span> the land with <span class="highlight">tremendous</span> energy, carving into <span class="highlight">even</span> the hardest rock formations and <span class="highlight">thereby</span> reshaping the <span class="highlight">landscape</span> as they <span class="highlight">engulf</span>, push, <span class="highlight">drag</span>, and finally <span class="highlight">deposit</span> rock <span class="highlight">debris</span> in places far from its <span class="highlight">original</span> location.</span> As a result, glaciers create a great <span class="highlight">variety</span> of landforms that <span class="highlight">remain</span> long after the surface is released from its icy covering.</p><p><span class="highlight">Throughout</span> most of Earth's <span class="highlight">history</span>, glaciers did not exist, but at the present time about 10 percent of Earth's land surface is covered by glaciers. Present-day glaciers are found in <span class="highlight">Antarctica</span>, in Greenland, and at high elevations on all the continents except Australia. In the recent past, from about 2.4 million to about 10,000 years ago, nearly a third of Earth's land area was <span class="highlight">periodically</span> covered by ice thousands of meters thick. In the much more <span class="highlight">distant</span> past, other ice ages have occurred.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">interlocked</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. intermediate</p><p>B. linked</p><p>C. frozen</p><p>D. fully developed</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Interlock chain, connection, so B's link is correct. From the word itself, inter is represented between ..., lock represents the lock, so the word should be what the middle meaning of the lock, so link fly, frozen only represents the lock, there is no between, so wrong; while intermediate only There is no fixed meaning between ..., so it's not right;</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 1, which of the following does NOT describe a stage in the development of firn?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Hexagonal crystals become larger and interlock to form a thick layer.</p><p>B. Snow crystals become compacted into grains.</p><p>C. Granules recrystallize after melting, refreezing, and further compaction.</p><p>D. Grains become denser owing to reduced air space around them.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A's hexagonal crystal keyword positioning to the second sentence, but the original did not say that the formation of the thick layer, A wrong, election; B's compact and grain keywords are also positioned to the second sentence, correct, not selected; C granules do The keyword is positioned to the third sentence of the penultimate sentence, correct and not selected; D's air space is targeted to the third sentence, correct, and not selected.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question3">match</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. measure</p><p>B. enlarge</p><p>C. approximate</p><p>D. equal</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" D"><p>Match <span class="question3">match</span>es, so equal is the answer. The original sentence says that if glaciers want to keep their volume constant or increase, they must have enough snowfall to be more or less than the losses that have already been caused by other processes. It must be said to make up for it first, and then to say more than that, so equals are equal and quite correct. . The measure is not correct; approximate is not enough, because if it is close to it, there is no way to keep the volume of the glacier unchanged; enlarge means the same as the exceed, and does not choose.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">transform</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. break</p><p>B. push</p><p>C. change</p><p>D. extend</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Transform deformation, deformation, so C's change is correct. From the word itself, trans means transfer, conversion, form form, so the whole word should be metamorphic. The original sentence says that snowfall exceeds the amount of melting snow. The remaining snow can form the necessary pressure on how to make snow into glaciers after several years. It is, of course, turned into a glacier, so the change is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 2, surplus snow affects a glacier in all the following ways EXCEPT:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It provides the pressure needed to cause glacial ice to flow.</p><p>B. It offsets losses of ice due to melting, evaporation, and calving.</p><p>C. It brings about the formation of firn in the snow it buries.</p><p>D. It results in temperate glaciers that are thicker than polar glaciers.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>EXCEPT questions, exclusion. A's pressure keyword positioning to the penultimate sentence, correct, not selected; B's three gerunds and keyword positioning to the second sentence, correct, not selected; C's firn keyword positioning to the previous paragraph The third sentence of the penultimate sentence is correct and not selected; the two glaciers of D do keyword positioning to the last sentence, and the two are tied together. No one compares to anyone, so D is wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Paragraph 2 implies that which of the following conditions produces the fastest moving glaciers?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. A climate characteristic of the polar regions</p><p>B. A thick layer of ice in a temperate climate</p><p>C. Long, warm summers</p><p>D. Snow, firn, and ice that have been buried for several years</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>With fast moving glaciers doing the key word positioning to the last sentence, said that the glaciers can be divided into fast-temperate and slow-moving polar according to temperature, so to move quickly, it must be temperate, so A and C are anti-D. Did not mention the climate thing, so the correct answer is B.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question7">deceiving</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. approximate</p><p>B. exaggerated</p><p>C. unusual</p><p>D. misleading</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" D"><p>Deceive deception, so <span class="question7">deceiving</span> is deceptive, so D's misleading is correct. The original sentence said that 2% is what kind of figure, because about 80% of the world's fresh water is in the form of glaciers, most of them are in Antarctica, from the author's however guess the author's attitude towards this figure is not trust , so the answer is D, the author's meaning is less than 2%, so exaggerated exaggeration wrong; approximate without derogatory; unusual completely unreliable.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the author consider "<span class="highlight">the hypothetical melting of the world's glaciers</span>"?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To contrast the effects of this event with the opposite effects of a new ice age</p><p>B. To emphasize how much water is frozen in glaciers</p><p>C. To illustrate the disastrous effects of a warming trend</p><p>D. To support the claim that glaciers are part of Earth's hydrologic cycle</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="the hypothetical melting of the world's glaciers B"><p>It said that if we take into account the amount of water released from the global melting of glaciers, this amount is quite astonishing. If we do not know what to choose, look ahead, but the foregoing is still an example, so it is not right, the central sentence says that glaciers are the only times on earth. The second largest source of water in the ocean, so these are nothing less than the glacier water, so the answer is B.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The discussion in paragraph 3 answers all the following questions EXCEPT:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Where is most of Earth's freshwater?</p><p>B. What effect would a new ice age have on sea levels?</p><p>C. What is the total amount of water in Earth's oceans?</p><p>D. How much of Earth's water is in ice?</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>A's freshwater keyword positioning to the third sentence, the original said 80%, is definitely the largest source, so A right, not selected; B's ice age and sea level keywords to locate the last two sentences, correct, not selected ;C's total amount has no corresponding point in the original, wrong, selected; D's ice and Earth's water do keyword positioning to the second sentence, correct, not selected.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">static</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. unchanging</p><p>B. usable</p><p>C. thick</p><p>D. harmless</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A static: static. A is unchanged; B is usable; C is thick; D is harmless. So A's unchanging is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. As a glacier moves, it leaves behind rock formations that have been engulfed, pushed, and dragged by the glacier.</p><p>B. Glaciers reshape the landscape by carving into rock and transporting the resulting debris to distant locations.</p><p>C. Glaciers carve the hardest rock formations with great energy and slowly reshape them into debris.</p><p>D. The tremendous energy of slowly moving glaciers transports and finally deposits rock debris into large rock formations.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The structure of the original sentence of B is that the glaciers pass through the land, and caring blabla are only reshaping blabla, so B is correct. A missed the original text reshaping this key message, wrong; C wrong, the original reshape is landscape, the answer reshape is stone; D completely changed the original structure, wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 5, in what way is the present time unusual in the history of Earth?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. There are glaciers.</p><p>B. More land is covered by glaciers than at anytime in the past.</p><p>C. There is no ice age.</p><p>D. No glaciers are found in Australia.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>Targeting to the first sentence with the present time keyword, said that the history of the Earth is that there is no glaciers, and now 10% of the Earth's surface covered by glaciers, which is now the cause of the unusual, so the answer is A, there are glaciers. B's anytime is too much absolute, the original only said that most of the time there is no glaciers; C and the original anti-D; D answer non-questioning.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Firn has the appearance of wet sugar, but it is almost as hard as ice..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C firns a sufficient transition point.
