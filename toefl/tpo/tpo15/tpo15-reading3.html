          <h4 class="w3-center">Glacier Formation</h4>
          <p>Glaciers are slowly moving masses of ice that have accumulated on land in areas where more snowfalls during a year than melts. Snow falls as hexagonal crystals, but once on the ground, snow is soon transformed into a compacted <span class="highlight">mass</span> of smaller, rounded grains. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span> As the <span class="highlight">air</span> <span class="highlight">space</span> around them is lessened by compaction and <span class="highlight">melting</span>, the grains become denser. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>With further <span class="highlight">melting</span>, refreezing, and increased weight from newer snowfall above, the snow reaches a <span class="highlight">granular</span> recrystallized <span class="highlight">stage</span> <span class="highlight">intermediate</span> between flakes and ice known as firn. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>With <span class="highlight">additional</span> time, <span class="highlight">pressure</span>, and refrozen meltwater from above, the small firn granules become larger, <span class="highlight question1">interlocked</span> crystals of blue <span class="highlight">glacial</span> ice. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>When the ice is thick enough, usually over 30 meters, the weight of the snow and firn will cause the ice crystals toward the bottom to become <span class="highlight">plastic</span> and to flow outward or <span class="highlight">downward</span> from the area of snow <span class="highlight">accumulation</span>.</p>
          <p>Glaciers are open systems, with snow as the system's input and meltwater as the system's main <span class="highlight">output</span>. The <span class="highlight">glacial</span> system is governed by two <span class="highlight">basic</span> <span class="highlight">climatic</span> variables: <span class="highlight">precipitation</span> and <span class="highlight">temperature</span>. For a <span class="highlight">glacier</span> to grow or <span class="highlight">maintain</span> its <span class="highlight">mass</span>, there must be <span class="highlight">sufficient</span> snowfall to <span class="highlight"><span class="question3">match</span></span> or <span class="highlight">exceed</span> the <span class="highlight">annual</span> loss <span class="highlight">through</span> <span class="highlight">melting</span>, <span class="highlight">evaporation</span>, and calving, which occurs when the <span class="highlight">glacier</span> loses <span class="highlight">solid</span> chunks as icebergs to the sea or to large lakes. If summer temperatures are high for too long, then all the snowfall from the <span class="highlight">previous</span> winter will <span class="highlight">melt</span>. <span class="highlight">Surplus</span> snowfall is <span class="highlight">essential</span> for a <span class="highlight">glacier</span> to develop. A <span class="highlight">surplus</span> allows snow to <span class="highlight">accumulate</span> and for the <span class="highlight">pressure</span> of snow accumulated over the years to <span class="highlight"><span class="question4">transform</span></span> buried snow into <span class="highlight">glacial</span> ice with a depth great enough for the ice to flow. Glaciers are sometimes classified by <span class="highlight">temperature</span> as faster-flowing <span class="highlight">temperate</span> glaciers or as slower-flowing <span class="highlight">polar</span> glaciers.</p>
          <p>Glaciers are part of Earth's <span class="highlight">hydrologic</span> <span class="highlight">cycle</span> and are <span class="highlight">second</span> only to the oceans in the total <span class="highlight">amount</span> of water contained. About 2 percent of Earth's water is currently frozen as ice. Two percent may be a <span class="question7">deceiving</span> <span class="highlight">figure</span>, however, since over 80 percent of the world's freshwater is locked up as ice in glaciers, with the <span class="highlight">majority</span> of it in <span class="highlight">Antarctica</span>. The total <span class="highlight">amount</span> of ice is <span class="highlight">even</span> more <span class="highlight">awesome</span> if we <span class="highlight">estimate</span> the water released upon the <span class="highlight">hypothetical</span> <span class="highlight">melting</span> of the world's glaciers. Sea <span class="highlight">level</span> would rise about 60 meters. This would change the geography of the <span class="highlight">planet</span> <span class="highlight">considerably</span>. In <span class="highlight">contrast</span>, should another ice age <span class="highlight">occur</span>, sea <span class="highlight">level</span> would <span class="highlight">drop</span> <span class="highlight">drastically</span>. During the last ice age, sea <span class="highlight">level</span> dropped about 120 meters.</p>
          <p>When snowfalls on high mountains or in <span class="highlight">polar</span> regions, it may become part of the <span class="highlight">glacial</span> system. Unlike rain, which returns rapidly to the sea or <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span>, the snow that becomes part of a <span class="highlight">glacier</span> is involved in a much more slowly cycling system. Here water may be stored in ice form for hundreds or <span class="highlight">even</span> hundreds of thousands of years before being released again into the <span class="highlight">liquid</span> water system as meltwater. In the <span class="highlight">meantime</span>, however, this ice is not <span class="highlight">static</span>. <span class="question11">Glaciers move slowly <span class="highlight">across</span> the land with <span class="highlight">tremendous</span> energy, carving into <span class="highlight">even</span> the hardest rock formations and <span class="highlight">thereby</span> reshaping the <span class="highlight">landscape</span> as they <span class="highlight">engulf</span>, push, <span class="highlight">drag</span>, and finally <span class="highlight">deposit</span> rock <span class="highlight">debris</span> in places far from its <span class="highlight">original</span> location.</span> As a result, glaciers create a great <span class="highlight">variety</span> of landforms that <span class="highlight">remain</span> long after the surface is released from its icy covering.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="highlight">Throughout</span> most of Earth's <span class="highlight">history</span>, glaciers did not exist, but at the present time about 10 percent of Earth's land surface is covered by glaciers. Present-day glaciers are found in <span class="highlight">Antarctica</span>, in Greenland, and at high elevations on all the continents except Australia. In the recent past, from about 2.4 million to about 10,000 years ago, nearly a third of Earth's land area was <span class="highlight">periodically</span> covered by ice thousands of meters thick. In the much more <span class="highlight">distant</span> past, other ice ages have occurred.</p>

The original sentence says that if glaciers want to keep their volume constant or increase, they must have enough snowfall to be more or less than the losses that have already been caused by other processes. It must be said to make up for it first, and then to say more than that, so equals are equal and quite correct. . The measure is not correct; approximate is not enough, because if it is close to it, there is no way to keep the volume of the glacier unchanged; enlarge means the same as the exceed, and does not choose.</p>

It is, of course, turned into a glacier, so the change is correct.</p>

              <p>Deceive deception, so <span class="question7">deceiving</span> is deceptive, so D's misleading is correct. The original sentence said that 2% is what kind of figure, because about 80% of the world's fresh water is in the form of glaciers, most of them are in Antarctica, from the author's however guess the author's attitude towards this figure is not trust , so the answer is D, the author's meaning is less than 2%, so exaggerated exaggeration wrong; approximate without derogatory; unusual completely unreliable.</p>

              <p>It said that if we take into account the amount of water released from the global melting of glaciers, this amount is quite astonishing. If we do not know what to choose, look ahead, but the foregoing is still an example, so it is not right, the central sentence says that glaciers are the only times on earth. The second largest source of water in the ocean, so these are nothing less than the glacier water, so the answer is B.</p>
