            <span class="highlight">Female</span> Professor: OK, we've being talking till now about the two <span class="highlight">basic</span> needs of biological community: an energy <span class="highlight">source</span> to produce <span class="highlight">organic</span> materials, you know, uh, food for the organisms and the <span class="highlight">waste</span> recycling or breakdown of materials back into inorganic molecules, <span class="time" data-times="16.79" data-time="26.33">[00:26.33]</span>and about how all this requires <span class="highlight">photosynthesis</span>, when green plants or microbes converts sunlight into energy, and also requires microorganisms, <span class="highlight">bacteria</span>, to <span class="highlight">secrete</span> chemicals that <span class="highlight">break</span> down or <span class="highlight">recycle</span> the <span class="highlight">organic</span> <span class="highlight">material</span> to complete the <span class="highlight">cycle</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="9.13" data-time="43.12">[00:43.12]</span>So, now we're done with this chapter of the textbook, we can just <span class="highlight">review</span> for the weekly <span class="highlight">quiz</span> and move on to the next chapter, right? <span class="time" data-times="2.69" data-time="52.25">[00:52.25]</span>Well, not so fast. <span class="time" data-times="8.96" data-time="54.94">[00:54.94]</span>First, I'd like to talk about some discoveries that have challenged one of these <span class="highlight">fundamental</span> assumptions about what you need in order to have a biological <span class="highlight">community</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.99" data-time="63.9">[01:03.90]</span>And, well, there actually were quite a few surprises!</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.08" data-time="68.89">[01:08.89]</span>It all began in 1977 with the <span class="highlight">exploration</span> of <span class="highlight">hydrothermal</span> vents on the ocean floor. <span class="time" data-times="11.6" data-time="74.97">[01:14.97]</span> <span class="highlight">Hydrothermal</span> vents are cracks on the Earth surface that <span class="highlight">occur</span>, well, the ones we're talking about here, are found deep at the bottom of the ocean. <span class="time" data-times="12.08" data-time="86.57">[01:26.57]</span>And these vents on the ocean floor, they <span class="highlight">release</span> this incredibly hot water, three to four times the <span class="highlight">temperature</span> that you boil water at, because this water's being heated deep <span class="highlight">within</span> the Earth.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="9.52" data-time="98.65">[01:38.65]</span>Well, about 30 years ago, researchers sent a deep-sea <span class="highlight">vessel</span> to <span class="highlight">explore</span> the ocean's depth, about three kilometers down, way deep to the ocean floor. <span class="time" data-times="3.35" data-time="108.17">[01:48.17]</span>No one had ever explored that far down before. <span class="time" data-times="4.02" data-time="111.52">[01:51.52]</span>Nobody expected there to be any life down there because of the conditions.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.31" data-time="115.54">[01:55.54]</span>First of all, sunlight doesn't <span class="highlight">reach</span> that far down so it's totally dark. <span class="time" data-times="5.67" data-time="119.85">[01:59.85]</span>There couldn't be any plant or animal life, since there's no sunlight, no <span class="highlight">source</span> of energy to make food. <span class="time" data-times="9.49" data-time="125.52">[02:05.52]</span>If there was any life at all, it'd just be some <span class="highlight">bacteria</span> breaking down any dead materials that might have fallen to the bottom of the ocean. Ann?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.41" data-time="135.01">[02:15.01]</span>
            <span class="highlight">Female</span> Student: And what about the water <span class="highlight">pressure</span>? <span class="time" data-times="5.17" data-time="138.42">[02:18.42]</span>Didn't we talk before about how the deeper down into the ocean you go, the greater the <span class="highlight">pressure</span>?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="7.55" data-time="143.59">[02:23.59]</span>Professor: Excellent point! And not only the <span class="highlight">extreme</span> <span class="highlight">pressure</span>, but also the <span class="highlight">extreme</span> <span class="highlight">temperature</span> of the water around these vents. <span class="time" data-times="8.63" data-time="151.14">[02:31.14]</span>If the <span class="highlight">lack</span> of sunlight didn't rule out the <span class="highlight">existence</span> of a biological <span class="highlight">community</span> down there, then these factors certainly would, or so they thought.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.23" data-time="159.77">[02:39.77]</span>
            <span class="highlight">Male</span> Student: So you're telling us they did find <span class="highlight">organism</span> that could live under those conditions?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.44" data-time="164">[02:44.00]</span>Professor: They did indeed, something like three hundred different <span class="highlight">species</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.38" data-time="168.44">[02:48.44]</span>
            <span class="highlight">Female</span> Student: But, but, how could that be? <span class="time" data-times="4.7" data-time="170.82">[02:50.82]</span>I mean, without sunlight, no energy, no, no...</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="11.86" data-time="175.52">[02:55.52]</span>Professor: What they discovered was that microorganisms, <span class="highlight">bacteria</span>, had taken over both functions of the biological community: the recycling of <span class="highlight">waste</span> materials and the production of energy. <span class="time" data-times="2.82" data-time="187.38">[03:07.38]</span>They were the energy <span class="highlight">source</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="9.77" data-time="190.2">[03:10.20]</span>You see, it turns out that certain microorganisms are chemosynthetic – they don't need sunlight because they take their energy from chemical reactions. <span class="time" data-times="15.51" data-time="199.97">[03:19.97]</span>So, as I said, unlike green plants which are <span class="highlight">photosynthetic</span> and get their energy from sunlight, these <span class="highlight">bacteria</span> that they found at the ocean floor, these are chemosynthetic, which means that they get their energy from chemical reactions. <span class="time" data-times="2.61" data-time="215.48">[03:35.48]</span>How does this work?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="16.3" data-time="218.09">[03:38.09]</span>As we said, these <span class="highlight">hydrothermal</span> vents are releasing into the ocean depth, this intensely hot water, and here's the thing, this hot water contains chemical called <span class="highlight">hydrogen</span> <span class="highlight">sulfide</span> and also a gas, <span class="highlight">carbon</span> <span class="highlight">dioxide</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.09" data-time="234.39">[03:54.39]</span>Now these <span class="highlight">bacteria</span> actually <span class="highlight">combine</span> the <span class="highlight">hydrogen</span> <span class="highlight">sulfide</span> with the <span class="highlight">carbon</span> <span class="highlight">dioxide</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.16" data-time="240.48">[04:00.48]</span>And this chemical <span class="highlight">reaction</span> is what produces <span class="highlight">organic</span> <span class="highlight">material</span>, which is the food for larger organisms. <span class="time" data-times="4.4" data-time="247.64">[04:07.64]</span>The researchers have never seen anything like it before.</p>

            <span class="highlight">Male</span> Student: Wow! So just add a chemical to a gas and bingo! <span class="time" data-times="1.42" data-time="256.76">[04:16.76]</span>You've got a food <span class="highlight">supply</span>?</p>

          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.39" data-time="282.39">[04:42.39]</span>And another thing, the <span class="highlight">tube</span> worm has no mouth or <span class="highlight">digestive</span> organs. <span class="time" data-times="3.75" data-time="287.78">[04:47.78]</span>So you're asking, how does it eat? <span class="time" data-times="13.63" data-time="291.53">[04:51.53]</span>Well, they have this <span class="highlight">special</span> organs that <span class="highlight">collect</span> the <span class="highlight">hydrogen</span> <span class="highlight">sulfide</span> and <span class="highlight">carbon</span> <span class="highlight">dioxide</span>, and then <span class="highlight">transfer</span> it to another organ where billions of <span class="highlight">bacteria</span> live, these <span class="highlight">bacteria</span> that live inside the <span class="highlight">tube</span> worms. <span class="time" data-times="10.27" data-time="305.16">[05:05.16]</span>The <span class="highlight">tube</span> worms provide them with <span class="highlight">hydrogen</span> <span class="highlight">sulfide</span> and <span class="highlight">carbon</span> <span class="highlight">dioxide</span> and the <span class="highlight">bacteria</span>, well, the <span class="highlight">bacteria</span> kind of feed the <span class="highlight">tube</span> worms <span class="highlight">through</span> chemosynthesis. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="315.43">[05:15.43]</span>Remember?

              <p>These bacteria that live inside the tube worms, the tube worms provide them with hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide. And the bacteria, well the bacteria kind of feed the tube worms through chemosynthesis, remember, that chemical reaction I described earlier.</p>
              <p>From the lecture, we can know that the role of bacteria is to provide food for tubeworms to solve the problem that tubeworms have no mouth or digestive organs.</p>

              <p>Before listening to the content, the professor explained what most people might think he wanted to start the next chapter. The emphasis on hard-of-hearing sentences is not as fast. Then he began to say what he actually had to say first today.</p>
