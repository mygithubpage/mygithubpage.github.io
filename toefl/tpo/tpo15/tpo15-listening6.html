To show how the exploration helped researchers to determine the composition of ocean water.</p><p>B. To show how the exploration challenged an assumption about biological communities.</p><p>C. To compare two competing theories concerning chemosynthesis.</p><p>D. To compare the life cycle of underwater plants to the life cycle of underwater animals.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>First, I 'd like to talk about some discoveries that have challenged one of these fundamental assumptions about what you need in order to have a biological community.</p><p>Before the example, the professor explicitly stated that discoveries that have challenged assumptions. This echoes Option B.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>What are three of the conditions of water near hydrothermal vents that made researchers think they would not find living organisms there? Click on 3 answers.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Extreme heat.</p><p>B. Extreme pressure.</p><p>C. Fast currents.</p><p>D. Lack of minerals.</p><p>E. Lack of sunlight</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="ABE"><p>First of all, sunlight does't reach that far down so it ' s totally dark. (E)</p><p>And what about the water pressure?(B)</p><p>And not only the extreme pressure, but also the extreme temperature of the water around these vents. (A)</p><p>The orange doesn't reach and E options echo; the extreme pressure directly corresponds to the B option; the extreme temperature and A options echo.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor imply about the researchers' reaction to the biological community discovered on the ocean floor?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They were surprised at the large variety of organisms living near hydrothermal vents.</p><p>B. They were surprised to find any bacteria living without sunlight.</p><p>C. They were disappointed at not finding any animal life.</p><p>D. They could not agree on the significance of the data that they collected.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>They did indeed, something like 300 different species.</p><p>The professor mentioned that because of the environment there was no one expected any life, but they actually found 300 different creatures. It can be inferred that they are very surprised.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor,what is the role of chemosynthesis in biological communities that are found near hydrothermal vents?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It enables organisms to convert hydrogen sulfide into food.</p><p>B. It enables organisms to convert tiny amounts of light into energy.</p><p>C. It enables organisms to withstand large amounts of carbon dioxide.</p><p>D. It enables organisms to regulate their temperature.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The researchers had seen the carbon dioxide and this chemical reaction is what produced organic material which is for food for larger organisms. The researchers had never seen anything like it before Carbon dioxide binds together to make a chemical reaction, producing organic matter that can provide the larger organisms as things.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor mention the bacteria that live inside a tube worm?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To give an example of organisms that pose a threat to tube worms.</p><p>B. To explain what provides the organic material that tube worms use for energy.</p><p>C. To give an example of other organisms that can withstand extreme heat.</p><p>D. To give an example of organisms that are involved in both chemosynthesis and photosynthesis.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>These bacteria that live inside the tube worms, the tube worms provide them with hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide. And the bacteria, well the bacteria kind of feed the tube worms through chemosynthesis, remember, that chemical reaction I described earlier.</p><p>From the lecture, we can know that the role of bacteria is to provide food for tubeworms to solve the problem that tubeworms have no mouth or digestive organs.</p></div></div><div class="replay" id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor imply when she says this:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. She will review information from the assigned chapter.</p><p>B. She will present additional information related to the assigned chapter.</p><p>C. The quiz on the assigned chapter will be longer than other quizzes.</p><p>D. The class has spent too much time on the assigned chapter.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>We can just review for the weekly quiz and move on to the next chapter, right? Well, not so fast.</p><p>Before listening to the content, the professor explained what most people might think he wanted to start the next chapter. The emphasis on hard-of-hearing sentences is not as fast. Then he began to say what he actually had to say first today.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
