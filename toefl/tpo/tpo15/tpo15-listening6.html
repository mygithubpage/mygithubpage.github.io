            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.44" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in a <span class="underline">Biology</span> class.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="18.89" data-time="7.44">[00:07.44]</span>
              <span class="underline">Female</span> Professor: OK, we've being talking till now about the two <span class="underline">basic</span> needs of biological community: an energy <span class="underline">source</span> to produce <span class="underline">organic</span> materials, you know, uh, food for the organisms and the <span class="underline">waste</span> recycling or breakdown of materials back into inorganic molecules, <span class="time" data-times="16.79" data-time="26.33">[00:26.33]</span>and about how all this requires <span class="underline">photosynthesis</span>, when green plants or microbes converts sunlight into energy, and also requires microorganisms, <span class="underline">bacteria</span>, to <span class="underline">secrete</span> chemicals that <span class="underline">break</span> down or <span class="underline">recycle</span> the <span class="underline">organic</span> <span class="underline">material</span> to complete the <span class="underline">cycle</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.13" data-time="43.12">[00:43.12]</span>So, now we're done with this chapter of the textbook, we can just <span class="underline">review</span> for the weekly <span class="underline">quiz</span> and move on to the next chapter, right? <span class="time" data-times="2.69" data-time="52.25">[00:52.25]</span>Well, not so fast. <span class="time" data-times="8.96" data-time="54.94">[00:54.94]</span>First, I'd like to talk about some discoveries that have challenged one of these <span class="underline">fundamental</span> assumptions about what you need in order to have a biological <span class="underline">community</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.99" data-time="63.9">[01:03.90]</span>And, well, there actually were quite a few surprises!</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="6.08" data-time="68.89">[01:08.89]</span>It all began in 1977 with the <span class="underline">exploration</span> of <span class="underline">hydrothermal</span> vents on the ocean floor. <span class="time" data-times="11.6" data-time="74.97">[01:14.97]</span> <span class="underline">Hydrothermal</span> vents are cracks on the Earth surface that <span class="underline">occur</span>, well, the ones we're talking about here, are found deep at the bottom of the ocean. <span class="time" data-times="12.08" data-time="86.57">[01:26.57]</span>And these vents on the ocean floor, they <span class="underline">release</span> this incredibly hot water, three to four times the <span class="underline">temperature</span> that you boil water at, because this water's being heated deep <span class="underline">within</span> the Earth.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.52" data-time="98.65">[01:38.65]</span>Well, about 30 years ago, researchers sent a deep-sea <span class="underline">vessel</span> to <span class="underline">explore</span> the ocean's depth, about three kilometers down, way deep to the ocean floor. <span class="time" data-times="3.35" data-time="108.17">[01:48.17]</span>No one had ever explored that far down before. <span class="time" data-times="4.02" data-time="111.52">[01:51.52]</span>Nobody expected there to be any life down there because of the conditions.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.31" data-time="115.54">[01:55.54]</span>First of all, sunlight doesn't <span class="underline">reach</span> that far down so it's totally dark. <span class="time" data-times="5.67" data-time="119.85">[01:59.85]</span>There couldn't be any plant or animal life, since there's no sunlight, no <span class="underline">source</span> of energy to make food. <span class="time" data-times="9.49" data-time="125.52">[02:05.52]</span>If there was any life at all, it'd just be some <span class="underline">bacteria</span> breaking down any dead materials that might have fallen to the bottom of the ocean. Ann?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="3.41" data-time="135.01">[02:15.01]</span>
              <span class="underline">Female</span> Student: And what about the water <span class="underline">pressure</span>? <span class="time" data-times="5.17" data-time="138.42">[02:18.42]</span>Didn't we talk before about how the deeper down into the ocean you go, the greater the <span class="underline">pressure</span>?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="7.55" data-time="143.59">[02:23.59]</span>Professor: Excellent point! And not only the <span class="underline">extreme</span> <span class="underline">pressure</span>, but also the <span class="underline">extreme</span> <span class="underline">temperature</span> of the water around these vents. <span class="time" data-times="8.63" data-time="151.14">[02:31.14]</span>If the <span class="underline">lack</span> of sunlight didn't rule out the <span class="underline">existence</span> of a biological <span class="underline">community</span> down there, then these factors certainly would, or so they thought.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.23" data-time="159.77">[02:39.77]</span>
              <span class="underline">Male</span> Student: So you're telling us they did find <span class="underline">organism</span> that could live under those conditions?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.44" data-time="164">[02:44.00]</span>Professor: They did indeed, something like three hundred different <span class="underline">species</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="2.38" data-time="168.44">[02:48.44]</span>
              <span class="underline">Female</span> Student: But, but, how could that be? <span class="time" data-times="4.7" data-time="170.82">[02:50.82]</span>I mean, without sunlight, no energy, no, no...</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="11.86" data-time="175.52">[02:55.52]</span>Professor: What they discovered was that microorganisms, <span class="underline">bacteria</span>, had taken over both functions of the biological community: the recycling of <span class="underline">waste</span> materials and the production of energy. <span class="time" data-times="2.82" data-time="187.38">[03:07.38]</span>They were the energy <span class="underline">source</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="9.77" data-time="190.2">[03:10.20]</span>You see, it turns out that certain microorganisms are chemosynthetic – they don't need sunlight because they take their energy from chemical reactions. <span class="time" data-times="15.51" data-time="199.97">[03:19.97]</span>So, as I said, unlike green plants which are <span class="underline">photosynthetic</span> and get their energy from sunlight, these <span class="underline">bacteria</span> that they found at the ocean floor, these are chemosynthetic, which means that they get their energy from chemical reactions. <span class="time" data-times="2.61" data-time="215.48">[03:35.48]</span>How does this work?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="16.3" data-time="218.09">[03:38.09]</span>As we said, these <span class="underline">hydrothermal</span> vents are releasing into the ocean depth, this intensely hot water, and here's the thing, this hot water contains chemical called <span class="underline">hydrogen</span> <span class="underline">sulfide</span> and also a gas, <span class="underline">carbon</span> <span class="underline">dioxide</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.09" data-time="234.39">[03:54.39]</span>Now these <span class="underline">bacteria</span> actually <span class="underline">combine</span> the <span class="underline">hydrogen</span> <span class="underline">sulfide</span> with the <span class="underline">carbon</span> <span class="underline">dioxide</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.16" data-time="240.48">[04:00.48]</span>And this chemical <span class="underline">reaction</span> is what produces <span class="underline">organic</span> <span class="underline">material</span>, which is the food for larger organisms. <span class="time" data-times="4.4" data-time="247.64">[04:07.64]</span>The researchers have never seen anything like it before.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="4.72" data-time="252.04">[04:12.04]</span>
              <span class="underline">Male</span> Student: Wow! So just add a chemical to a gas and bingo! <span class="time" data-times="1.42" data-time="256.76">[04:16.76]</span>You've got a food <span class="underline">supply</span>?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.97" data-time="258.18">[04:18.18]</span>Professor: Not just that, what was <span class="underline">even</span> more surprising were all the large organisms that lived down there. <span class="time" data-times="4" data-time="264.15">[04:24.15]</span>The most <span class="underline">distinctive</span> of these was something called the <span class="underline">tube</span> worm. <span class="time" data-times="2.43" data-time="268.15">[04:28.15]</span>Here, let me show you a picture. <span class="time" data-times="3.97" data-time="270.58">[04:30.58]</span>The <span class="underline">tube</span> of the <span class="underline">tube</span> worm was really, really long. <span class="time" data-times="7.84" data-time="274.55">[04:34.55]</span>They can be up to one and a half meters long, and these tubes are attached to the ocean floor, <span class="underline">pretty</span> <span class="underline">weird</span> looking, huh?</p>
            <p>
              <span class="time" data-times="5.39" data-time="282.39">[04:42.39]</span>And another thing, the <span class="underline">tube</span> worm has no mouth or <span class="underline">digestive</span> organs. <span class="time" data-times="3.75" data-time="287.78">[04:47.78]</span>So you're asking, how does it eat? <span class="time" data-times="13.63" data-time="291.53">[04:51.53]</span>Well, they have this <span class="underline">special</span> organs that <span class="underline">collect</span> the <span class="underline">hydrogen</span> <span class="underline">sulfide</span> and <span class="underline">carbon</span> <span class="underline">dioxide</span>, and then <span class="underline">transfer</span> it to another organ where billions of <span class="underline">bacteria</span> live, these <span class="underline">bacteria</span> that live inside the <span class="underline">tube</span> worms. <span class="time" data-times="10.27" data-time="305.16">[05:05.16]</span>The <span class="underline">tube</span> worms provide them with <span class="underline">hydrogen</span> <span class="underline">sulfide</span> and <span class="underline">carbon</span> <span class="underline">dioxide</span> and the <span class="underline">bacteria</span>, well, the <span class="underline">bacteria</span> kind of feed the <span class="underline">tube</span> worms <span class="underline">through</span> chemosynthesis. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="315.43">[05:15.43]</span>Remember? That chemical <span class="underline">reaction</span> I described earlier.</p>
