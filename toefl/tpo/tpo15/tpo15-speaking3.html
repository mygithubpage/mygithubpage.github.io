          <h4 class="w3-center">University Should Pave Running Trails</h4>The university has about three miles of unpaved dirt running trails that pass through the forest near campus. I think these trails should be paved with cement. One reason for paving the trails would be to increase their safety. When it rains, the dirt turns to mud and becomes very slippery, so the runners who use them can slip and fall. Pavement would solve this problem. Also, paving would make the trails look nicer, which would encourage students to use them. Bumps in the trail would be smoothed out and weeds would be paved over, making the trail more attractive to runners.
Sincerely,

        <h3>Listening Text</h3>
        <article>
          <p>Now listen to two students discussing the letter.</p>
          <p>(woman) Hey, Ted, you're a runner. Did you see this letter in the paper?</p>
          <p>(man) Yeah, I did, and I use those.</p>
          <p>(woman) And?</p>
          <p>(man) I think it's a terrible idea.</p>
          <p>(woman) How come?</p>
          <p>(man) Well, she really hasn't thought it through. Like, the thing about making them safer, what's she's not thinking about is the long-term consequence of running on a hard surface.</p>
          <p>(woman) What do you mean?</p>
          <p>(man) I mean, it's not good for you. It's too hard on your bones and joints. If you run repeatedly on hard surface, it can lead to injuries or, that's what I've been taught anyway, it's better to run on a soft surface. It does less damage to your body.</p>
          <p>(woman) Oh, I wasn't aware of that.</p>
          <p>(man) Yeah, so actually it wouldn't be safer. And her second point...</p>
          <p>(woman) About changing the way they look?</p>
          <p>(man) Yeah, I don't think people will like it.</p>
          <p>(woman) So they'd use them less?</p>
          <p>(man) Yeah, I mean, one of the main reasons people enjoy them now was it's a way of taking a break from the rest of the campus, from buildings and streets and stuff. It's, you know, a chance like you're out in the nature.</p>
          <p>(woman) Oh, so you wouldn't bet that effect anymore.</p>
          <p>(man) Right! It'd be just like you're on a regular street or sidewalk. It wouldn't be as relaxing.</p>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>Well, the proposal says that the university should pave the dirt trail with cement for two reasons. However the man doesn't agree with the proposal for some reasons. First of all, he argues that it's safer for people to run repeatedly on a trail with soft surface than on a paved one, simply because it'll do less damage and injuries to human bodies. Besides, he is against the proposal's second opinion mainly because students will take a break for walking on the trail, since it's more natural and students would have a chance to relax. So based on the reasons above the man disagrees with the proposal. (106 words)</p>
