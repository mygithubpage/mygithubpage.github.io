            <span class="highlight">Male</span> professor: Geologists, we examine layers of <span class="highlight">sediment</span> on the Earth's surface to <span class="highlight">approximate</span> the dates of past geologic time periods. <span class="time" data-times="12.88" data-time="13.92">[00:13.92]</span>Uh, <span class="highlight">sediment</span>, as you know, is <span class="highlight">material</span> like sand, <span class="highlight">gravel</span>, <span class="highlight">fossil</span> fragments that is transported by natural processes like wind, water flow or the movement of glaciers. <span class="time" data-times="8.58" data-time="26.8">[00:26.80]</span>So, uh, <span class="highlight">sediment</span> is transported and then deposited and to form layers on the Earth's surface over time. <span class="time" data-times="7.2" data-time="35.38">[00:35.38]</span>We examine these layers to learn about different geologic time periods including when they began and ended. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="10.83" data-time="42.58">[00:42.58]</span>For example, from about 1.8 million years ago to around 11,000 years ago was the <span class="highlight">Pleistocene</span> <span class="highlight">epoch</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.55" data-time="53.41">[00:53.41]</span>The <span class="highlight">Pleistocene</span> <span class="highlight">epoch</span> was an ice age. <span class="time" data-times="6.93" data-time="58.96">[00:58.96]</span>During this <span class="highlight">epoch</span>, <span class="highlight">sediment</span> was made by the kind of <span class="highlight">erosion</span> and <span class="highlight">weathering</span> that happens when the <span class="highlight">climate</span> was colder. <span class="time" data-times="6.05" data-time="65.89">[01:05.89]</span>And part of those sediments are fossils of plants and animals that lived at that time. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="8.64" data-time="71.94">[01:11.94]</span>The Holocene <span class="highlight">epoch</span> followed the <span class="highlight">Pleistocene</span> <span class="highlight">epoch</span> when the Earth's <span class="highlight">climate</span> warmed up around 11,000 years ago. <span class="time" data-times="8.76" data-time="80.58">[01:20.58]</span>The Holocene <span class="highlight">epoch</span> is characterized by different sediments, ones that formed when the <span class="highlight">climate</span> is warmer. <span class="time" data-times="6.1" data-time="89.34">[01:29.34]</span>Because the <span class="highlight">climate</span> changed, the types of plants and animals changed also. <span class="time" data-times="4.84" data-time="95.44">[01:35.44]</span>Holocene sediments <span class="highlight">contain</span> remnants of more recent plants and animals. <span class="time" data-times="6.23" data-time="100.28">[01:40.28]</span>So it's <span class="highlight">pretty</span> easy to <span class="highlight">differentiate</span>, geologically, between these two epochs. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="16.92" data-time="106.51">[01:46.51]</span>Now there is growing <span class="highlight">evidence</span> that the presence of humans has altered the Earth so much that a new <span class="highlight">epoch</span> of geologic <span class="highlight">history</span> has begun – the Anthropocene <span class="highlight">epoch</span>, a new human-influenced <span class="highlight">epoch</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.86" data-time="123.43">[02:03.43]</span>This idea, that we've entered a new Anthropocene <span class="highlight">epoch</span>, was first proposed in 2002. <span class="time" data-times="13.56" data-time="132.29">[02:12.29]</span>The idea is that around the year 1800 CE, the human <span class="highlight">population</span> became large enough, around a billion people, that its activities started altering the environment. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="8.98" data-time="145.85">[02:25.85]</span>This was also the time the <span class="highlight">Industrial</span> <span class="highlight">Revolution</span>, which brought a <span class="highlight">tremendous</span> increase in the use of <span class="highlight">fossil</span> fuels such as <span class="highlight">coal</span>. <span class="time" data-times="18.57" data-time="154.83">[02:34.83]</span>The <span class="highlight">exploitation</span> of <span class="highlight">fossil</span> fuels has brought planet-wide developments – <span class="highlight">industrialization</span>, <span class="highlight">construction</span>, um, <span class="highlight">mass</span> <span class="highlight">transport</span> – and these developments have caused <span class="highlight">major</span> changes like <span class="highlight">additional</span> <span class="highlight">erosion</span> of the Earth's surface and <span class="highlight">deforestation</span>. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="11.13" data-time="173.4">[02:53.40]</span>Also, things like the damming of rivers has caused increased <span class="highlight">sediment</span> production, not to <span class="highlight">mention</span> the <span class="highlight">addition</span> of more <span class="highlight">carbon</span> <span class="highlight">dioxide</span> and <span class="highlight">methane</span> in the <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span>. <span class="time" data-times="11.15" data-time="184.53">[03:04.53]</span>Naturally, all these changes show up in recent sediments and these sediments are quite different from pre-year 1800 <span class="highlight">sediment</span> layers. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="13.51" data-time="195.68">[03:15.68]</span>Interestingly, there are some speculation that human started having a <span class="highlight">major</span> <span class="highlight">impact</span> on Earth much earlier about 8,000 years ago – that's when <span class="highlight">agriculture</span> was becoming <span class="highlight">widespread</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.06" data-time="209.19">[03:29.19]</span>Early farmers started clearing forests and <span class="highlight">livestock</span> produced a lot of <span class="highlight">extra</span> <span class="highlight">methane</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.41" data-time="215.25">[03:35.25]</span>But I want to <span class="highlight">stress</span> this is just a <span class="highlight">hypothesis</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9.3" data-time="219.66">[03:39.66]</span>The idea that early humans could have had such a <span class="highlight">major</span> effect...well, I'm just not sure we can <span class="highlight">compare</span> it with the <span class="highlight">industrial</span> age. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="12.75" data-time="228.96">[03:48.96]</span>Geologists in the far future will be able to examine the <span class="highlight">sediment</span> being laid down today, whereas right now we can say that, yes, human <span class="highlight">impact</span> on the Earth is <span class="highlight">clear</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="241.71">[04:01.71]</span>It'll be future researchers who have a better <span class="highlight">perspective</span> and will be able to really <span class="highlight">draw</span> a <span class="highlight">line</span> between the Holocene and the Anthropocene epochs. </p>
