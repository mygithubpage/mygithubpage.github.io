lecture in a <span class="highlight">psychology</span> class.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.77" data-time="4.36">[00:04.36]</span><span class="highlight">Female</span> Professor: For decades, psychologists have been looking at our <span class="highlight">ability</span> to <span class="highlight">perform</span> tasks while other things are going on. <span class="time" data-times="5.9" data-time="11.13">[00:11.13]</span>How we're able to keep from being distracted and what the conditions for good <span class="highlight">concentration</span> are. <span class="time" data-times="8.99" data-time="17.03">[00:17.03]</span>As long ago as 1982, researchers came up with something called the CFQ, the <span class="highlight">Cognitive</span> Failures <span class="highlight">Questionnaire</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="16.72" data-time="26.02">[00:26.02]</span>This <span class="highlight">questionnaire</span> asks people to <span class="highlight">rate</span> themselves according to how often they get distracted in different situations, like, um, forgetting to <span class="highlight">save</span> a computer <span class="highlight">file</span> because they had something else on their <span class="highlight">mind</span>, or, missing a speed limit sign on the road, John?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.18" data-time="42.74">[00:42.74]</span><span class="highlight">Male</span> Student: I've lost my share of computer files but not because I'm easily distracted. <span class="time" data-times="1.56" data-time="46.92">[00:46.92]</span>I just forget to <span class="highlight">save</span> them.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.61" data-time="48.48">[00:48.48]</span>Professor: And that's part of the problem with the CFQ. <span class="time" data-times="4.29" data-time="51.09">[00:51.09]</span>It doesn't take other factors into <span class="highlight">account</span> enough like forgetfulness. <span class="time" data-times="7.73" data-time="55.38">[00:55.38]</span>Plus you really can't say you are getting <span class="highlight">objective</span><span class="highlight">scientific</span> results from a subjective <span class="highlight">questionnaire</span> where people <span class="highlight">report</span> on themselves.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.09" data-time="63.11">[01:03.11]</span>So it's no surprise that someone attempted to design an <span class="highlight">objective</span> way to <span class="highlight">measure</span><span class="highlight">distraction</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.87" data-time="69.2">[01:09.20]</span>It's a simple computer game designed by a psychologist named Nilli Lavie. <span class="time" data-times="8.36" data-time="74.07">[01:14.07]</span>In Lavie's game, people watch as the letters "N" and "X" <span class="highlight">appear</span> and disappear in a certain area on the computer <span class="highlight">screen</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.96" data-time="82.43">[01:22.43]</span>Every time they see an N, they <span class="highlight">press</span> one key and every time they see an X, they <span class="highlight">press</span> another. <span class="time" data-times="10.02" data-time="88.39">[01:28.39]</span>Except other letters also start appearing in the surrounding area of the <span class="highlight">screen</span> with increasing <span class="highlight">frequency</span> which creates a <span class="highlight">distraction</span> and makes the task more difficult. <span class="time" data-times="6.11" data-time="98.41">[01:38.41]</span>Lavie observed that people's <span class="highlight">reaction</span> time slowed as these distractions increased.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.13" data-time="104.52">[01:44.52]</span><span class="highlight">Female</span> Student: Well, that's not too surprising, is it?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="1.51" data-time="107.65">[01:47.65]</span>Professor: No, it's not. <span class="time" data-times="3.26" data-time="109.16">[01:49.16]</span>It's the next part of the experiment that was surprising. <span class="time" data-times="8.22" data-time="112.42">[01:52.42]</span>When the difficulty really increased, when the <span class="highlight">screen</span> filled up with letters, people got better at spotting the X's and N's. <span class="time" data-times="1.72" data-time="120.64">[02:00.64]</span>Why do you think that happened?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="8.15" data-time="122.36">[02:02.36]</span><span class="highlight">Male</span> Student: Well, maybe when we're really concentrating, we just don't <span class="highlight">perceive</span> irrelevant information, maybe we just don't take it in, you know?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.76" data-time="130.51">[02:10.51]</span>Professor: Yes, and that's one of the hypotheses that was proposed, that the brain <span class="highlight">simply</span> doesn't <span class="highlight">admit</span> unimportant information. <span class="time" data-times="7.57" data-time="138.27">[02:18.27]</span>The <span class="highlight">second</span><span class="highlight">hypothesis</span> is that, yes, we do <span class="highlight">perceive</span> everything, but the brain categorizes the information. <span class="time" data-times="5.72" data-time="145.84">[02:25.84]</span>And whatever's not <span class="highlight">relevant</span> to what we're concentrating on gets treated as low <span class="highlight">priority</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.97" data-time="151.56">[02:31.56]</span>So Lavie did another experiment designed to look at this <span class="highlight">ability</span> to <span class="highlight">concentrate</span> better in the face of increased difficulty. <span class="time" data-times="6.35" data-time="159.53">[02:39.53]</span>This time, she used brain scanning equipment to <span class="highlight">monitor</span><span class="highlight">activity</span> in a certain part of the brain. <span class="time" data-times="8.57" data-time="165.88">[02:45.88]</span>The area called V5, which is part of the <span class="highlight">visual</span> cortex, the part of our brains that processes <span class="highlight">visual</span> stimuli.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.13" data-time="174.45">[02:54.45]</span>V5 is the area of the <span class="highlight">visual</span> cortex that's <span class="highlight">responsible</span> for the sensation of movement. <span class="time" data-times="4.33" data-time="181.58">[03:01.58]</span>Once again, Lavie gave people a computer-based task to do. <span class="time" data-times="9.93" data-time="185.91">[03:05.91]</span>They had to <span class="highlight">distinguish</span> between words in upper- and lower-cased letters; or <span class="highlight">even</span> harder, they had to <span class="highlight">count</span> the number of syllables in different words.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.07" data-time="195.84">[03:15.84]</span>This time, the <span class="highlight">distraction</span> was a moving star <span class="highlight">field</span> in the background. <span class="time" data-times="4.57" data-time="200.91">[03:20.91]</span>You know, where it looks like you're moving <span class="highlight">through</span><span class="highlight">space</span> passing stars? <span class="time" data-times="14.73" data-time="205.48">[03:25.48]</span><span class="highlight">Normally</span>, area V5 would be <span class="highlight">stimulated</span> as those moving stars are perceived, and sure enough, Lavie found that during the task, area V5 was active, so people were <span class="highlight">aware</span> of the moving star <span class="highlight">field</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.92" data-time="220.21">[03:40.21]</span>That means people were not blocking out the <span class="highlight">distraction</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="5.07" data-time="224.13">[03:44.13]</span><span class="highlight">Female</span> Student: So doesn't that mean the first <span class="highlight">hypothesis</span> you mentioned was wrong? <span class="time" data-times="4.86" data-time="229.2">[03:49.20]</span>The one that says we don't <span class="highlight">even</span><span class="highlight">perceive</span> irrelevant information when we're concentrating?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.15" data-time="234.06">[03:54.06]</span>Professor: Yes, that's right, up to a point, but that's not all. <span class="time" data-times="6.74" data-time="238.21">[03:58.21]</span>Lavie also discovered that as she made the task more difficult, V5 became less active. <span class="time" data-times="4.83" data-time="244.95">[04:04.95]</span>So that means that now people weren't really noticing the star <span class="highlight">field</span> at all. <span class="time" data-times="1.54" data-time="249.78">[04:09.78]</span>That was quite a surprise! <span class="time" data-times="11.34" data-time="251.32">[04:11.32]</span>And it proved that the <span class="highlight">second</span><span class="highlight">hypothesis</span>, that we do <span class="highlight">perceive</span> everything all the time but the brain categorizes distractions differently, well, that wasn't true either.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.64" data-time="262.66">[04:22.66]</span>Lavie thinks the <span class="highlight">solution</span> lies in the brain's <span class="highlight">ability</span> to accept or <span class="highlight">ignore</span><span class="highlight">visual</span> information. <span class="time" data-times="2.61" data-time="269.3">[04:29.30]</span>She thinks its <span class="highlight">capacity</span> is limited. <span class="time" data-times="5.09" data-time="271.91">[04:31.91]</span>It's like a highway: when there are too many cars, traffic is stopped. <span class="time" data-times="1.31" data-time="277">[04:37.00]</span>No one can get on. <span class="time" data-times="5.86" data-time="278.31">[04:38.31]</span>So when the brain is loaded to <span class="highlight">capacity</span>, no new distractions can be perceived.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="284.17">[04:44.17]</span>Now, that maybe the correct conclusion for <span class="highlight">visual</span> distractions, but more research is needed to tell us how the brain deals with, say, the distractions of solving a math problem when we're hungry, or when someone is singing in the next room.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the lecture mainly about?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

It does not account for factors other than distractibility</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="AD"><p>And that's part of the problem with the CFQ. It doesn't take other factors into account enough, like forgetfulness. Plus you really can't say you are getting objective scientific results from a subjective questionnaire where people report on themselves.</p><p>The speaker clearly stated two shortcomings and proposed another experiment based on the second shortcoming. Not't take other factors corresponds to D; can't say Sex corresponds to A.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>What hypotheses about distraction and the brain were Lavie's experiments involving star fields designed to investigate?

To describe a limitation in the brain's processing capacity.</p><p>D. To make a point about the effect of distractions on driving.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>She thinks the capacity lies in the brain's ability to accept or ignore visual information.
