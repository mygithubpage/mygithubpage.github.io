            <span class="time" data-times="4.36" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in a <span class="highlight">psychology</span> class.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.77" data-time="4.36">[00:04.36]</span>
            <span class="highlight">Female</span> Professor: For decades, psychologists have been looking at our <span class="highlight">ability</span> to <span class="highlight">perform</span> tasks while other things are going on. <span class="time" data-times="5.9" data-time="11.13">[00:11.13]</span>How we're able to keep from being distracted and what the conditions for good <span class="highlight">concentration</span> are. <span class="time" data-times="8.99" data-time="17.03">[00:17.03]</span>As long ago as 1982, researchers came up with something called the CFQ, the <span class="highlight">Cognitive</span> Failures <span class="highlight">Questionnaire</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="16.72" data-time="26.02">[00:26.02]</span>This <span class="highlight">questionnaire</span> asks people to <span class="highlight">rate</span> themselves according to how often they get distracted in different situations, like, um, forgetting to <span class="highlight">save</span> a computer <span class="highlight">file</span> because they had something else on their <span class="highlight">mind</span>, or, missing a speed limit sign on the road, John?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.18" data-time="42.74">[00:42.74]</span>
            <span class="highlight">Male</span> Student: I've lost my share of computer files but not because I'm easily distracted. <span class="time" data-times="1.56" data-time="46.92">[00:46.92]</span>I just forget to <span class="highlight">save</span> them.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.61" data-time="48.48">[00:48.48]</span>Professor: And that's part of the problem with the CFQ. <span class="time" data-times="4.29" data-time="51.09">[00:51.09]</span>It doesn't take other factors into <span class="highlight">account</span> enough like forgetfulness. <span class="time" data-times="7.73" data-time="55.38">[00:55.38]</span>Plus you really can't say you are getting <span class="highlight">objective</span> <span class="highlight">scientific</span> results from a subjective <span class="highlight">questionnaire</span> where people <span class="highlight">report</span> on themselves.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.09" data-time="63.11">[01:03.11]</span>So it's no surprise that someone attempted to design an <span class="highlight">objective</span> way to <span class="highlight">measure</span> <span class="highlight">distraction</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.87" data-time="69.2">[01:09.20]</span>It's a simple computer game designed by a psychologist named Nilli Lavie. <span class="time" data-times="8.36" data-time="74.07">[01:14.07]</span>In Lavie's game, people watch as the letters "N" and "X" <span class="highlight">appear</span> and disappear in a certain area on the computer <span class="highlight">screen</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.96" data-time="82.43">[01:22.43]</span>Every time they see an N, they <span class="highlight">press</span> one key and every time they see an X, they <span class="highlight">press</span> another. <span class="time" data-times="10.02" data-time="88.39">[01:28.39]</span>Except other letters also start appearing in the surrounding area of the <span class="highlight">screen</span> with increasing <span class="highlight">frequency</span> which creates a <span class="highlight">distraction</span> and makes the task more difficult. <span class="time" data-times="6.11" data-time="98.41">[01:38.41]</span>Lavie observed that people's <span class="highlight">reaction</span> time slowed as these distractions increased.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.13" data-time="104.52">[01:44.52]</span>
            <span class="highlight">Female</span> Student: Well, that's not too surprising, is it?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.51" data-time="107.65">[01:47.65]</span>Professor: No, it's not. <span class="time" data-times="3.26" data-time="109.16">[01:49.16]</span>It's the next part of the experiment that was surprising. <span class="time" data-times="8.22" data-time="112.42">[01:52.42]</span>When the difficulty really increased, when the <span class="highlight">screen</span> filled up with letters, people got better at spotting the X's and N's. <span class="time" data-times="1.72" data-time="120.64">[02:00.64]</span>Why do you think that happened?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="8.15" data-time="122.36">[02:02.36]</span>
            <span class="highlight">Male</span> Student: Well, maybe when we're really concentrating, we just don't <span class="highlight">perceive</span> irrelevant information, maybe we just don't take it in, you know?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="7.76" data-time="130.51">[02:10.51]</span>Professor: Yes, and that's one of the hypotheses that was proposed, that the brain <span class="highlight">simply</span> doesn't <span class="highlight">admit</span> unimportant information. <span class="time" data-times="7.57" data-time="138.27">[02:18.27]</span>The <span class="highlight">second</span> <span class="highlight">hypothesis</span> is that, yes, we do <span class="highlight">perceive</span> everything, but the brain categorizes the information. <span class="time" data-times="5.72" data-time="145.84">[02:25.84]</span>And whatever's not <span class="highlight">relevant</span> to what we're concentrating on gets treated as low <span class="highlight">priority</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="7.97" data-time="151.56">[02:31.56]</span>So Lavie did another experiment designed to look at this <span class="highlight">ability</span> to <span class="highlight">concentrate</span> better in the face of increased difficulty. <span class="time" data-times="6.35" data-time="159.53">[02:39.53]</span>This time, she used brain scanning equipment to <span class="highlight">monitor</span> <span class="highlight">activity</span> in a certain part of the brain. <span class="time" data-times="8.57" data-time="165.88">[02:45.88]</span>The area called V5, which is part of the <span class="highlight">visual</span> cortex, the part of our brains that processes <span class="highlight">visual</span> stimuli.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="7.13" data-time="174.45">[02:54.45]</span>V5 is the area of the <span class="highlight">visual</span> cortex that's <span class="highlight">responsible</span> for the sensation of movement. <span class="time" data-times="4.33" data-time="181.58">[03:01.58]</span>Once again, Lavie gave people a computer-based task to do. <span class="time" data-times="9.93" data-time="185.91">[03:05.91]</span>They had to <span class="highlight">distinguish</span> between words in upper- and lower-cased letters; or <span class="highlight">even</span> harder, they had to <span class="highlight">count</span> the number of syllables in different words.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.07" data-time="195.84">[03:15.84]</span>This time, the <span class="highlight">distraction</span> was a moving star <span class="highlight">field</span> in the background. <span class="time" data-times="4.57" data-time="200.91">[03:20.91]</span>You know, where it looks like you're moving <span class="highlight">through</span> <span class="highlight">space</span> passing stars? <span class="time" data-times="14.73" data-time="205.48">[03:25.48]</span> <span class="highlight">Normally</span>, area V5 would be <span class="highlight">stimulated</span> as those moving stars are perceived, and sure enough, Lavie found that during the task, area V5 was active, so people were <span class="highlight">aware</span> of the moving star <span class="highlight">field</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.92" data-time="220.21">[03:40.21]</span>That means people were not blocking out the <span class="highlight">distraction</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.07" data-time="224.13">[03:44.13]</span>
            <span class="highlight">Female</span> Student: So doesn't that mean the first <span class="highlight">hypothesis</span> you mentioned was wrong? <span class="time" data-times="4.86" data-time="229.2">[03:49.20]</span>The one that says we don't <span class="highlight">even</span> <span class="highlight">perceive</span> irrelevant information when we're concentrating?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.15" data-time="234.06">[03:54.06]</span>Professor: Yes, that's right, up to a point, but that's not all. <span class="time" data-times="6.74" data-time="238.21">[03:58.21]</span>Lavie also discovered that as she made the task more difficult, V5 became less active. <span class="time" data-times="4.83" data-time="244.95">[04:04.95]</span>So that means that now people weren't really noticing the star <span class="highlight">field</span> at all. <span class="time" data-times="1.54" data-time="249.78">[04:09.78]</span>That was quite a surprise! <span class="time" data-times="11.34" data-time="251.32">[04:11.32]</span>And it proved that the <span class="highlight">second</span> <span class="highlight">hypothesis</span>, that we do <span class="highlight">perceive</span> everything all the time but the brain categorizes distractions differently, well, that wasn't true either.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.64" data-time="262.66">[04:22.66]</span>Lavie thinks the <span class="highlight">solution</span> lies in the brain's <span class="highlight">ability</span> to accept or <span class="highlight">ignore</span> <span class="highlight">visual</span> information. <span class="time" data-times="2.61" data-time="269.3">[04:29.30]</span>She thinks its <span class="highlight">capacity</span> is limited. <span class="time" data-times="5.09" data-time="271.91">[04:31.91]</span>It's like a highway: when there are too many cars, traffic is stopped. <span class="time" data-times="1.31" data-time="277">[04:37.00]</span>No one can get on. <span class="time" data-times="5.86" data-time="278.31">[04:38.31]</span>So when the brain is loaded to <span class="highlight">capacity</span>, no new distractions can be perceived.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="284.17">[04:44.17]</span>Now, that maybe the correct conclusion for <span class="highlight">visual</span> distractions, but more research is needed to tell us how the brain deals with, say, the distractions of solving a math problem when we're hungry, or when someone is singing in the next room.</p>
