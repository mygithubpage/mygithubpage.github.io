          <h4 class="w3-center">A Warm-Blooded Turtle</h4>
          <p>When it comes to <span class="highlight">physiology</span>, the leatherback <span class="highlight">turtle</span> is, in some<span class="question6"> w</span>ays, more like a reptilian whale than a <span class="highlight">turtle</span>. It swims farther into the cold of the northern and southern oceans than any other sea <span class="highlight">turtle</span>, and it deals with the chilly waters in a way <span class="question1"><span class="highlight">unique</span> among</span> reptiles.</p>
          <p>A warm-blooded <span class="highlight">turtle</span> may <span class="highlight">seem</span> to be a <span class="highlight">contradiction</span> in terms. <span class="highlight">Nonetheless</span>, an adult leatherback can <span class="highlight">maintain</span> a body <span class="highlight">temperature</span> of between 25 and 26°C (77-79°F) in seawater that is only 8°C (46.4°F). Accomplishing this <span class="highlight"><span class="question3">feat</span></span> requires adaptations both to <span class="highlight">generate</span> heat in the <span class="highlight">turtle</span>'s body and to keep it from escaping into the surrounding waters. Leatherbacks apparently do not <span class="highlight">generate</span> <span class="highlight">internal</span> heat the way we do, or the way birds do, as a <span class="highlight">by-product</span> of cellular <span class="highlight">metabolism</span>. A leatherback may be able to pick up some body heat by basking at the surface; its dark, almost black body color may help it to <span class="highlight">absorb</span> <span class="highlight">solar</span> <span class="highlight">radiation</span>. However, most of its <span class="highlight">internal</span> heat comes from the <span class="highlight">action</span> of its muscles.</p>
          <p>Leatherbacks keep their body heat in three different ways. The first, and simplest, is size. The bigger the animal is, the <span class="highlight">lower</span> its surface-to-volume <span class="highlight">ratio</span>; for every ounce of body <span class="highlight">mass</span>, 
 there is proportionately less surface <span class="highlight">through</span> which heat can <span class="highlight">escape</span>. An adult leatherback is twice the size of the biggest cheloniid sea turtles and will <span class="highlight">therefore</span> take longer to cool off.
Maintaining a high body <span class="highlight">temperature</span> <span class="highlight">through</span> <span class="highlight">sheer</span> <span class="highlight"><span class="question5">bulk</span></span> is called gigantothermy. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>It works for elephants, for whales, and, perhaps, 
 it worked for many of the larger dinosaurs. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>It apparently works,
 in a smaller way, for some other sea turtles. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>Large loggerhead and green turtles can <span class="highlight">maintain</span> their body <span class="highlight">temperature</span> at a <span class="highlight">degree</span> or two above that of the surrounding water, and gigantothermy is 
 probably the way they do it. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span> <span class="highlight">Muscular</span> <span class="highlight">activity</span> helps, too, and an actively swimming green <span class="highlight">turtle</span> may be 7°C (12.6°F) warmer than the waters it swims <span class="highlight">through</span>.</p>
          <p>Gigantothermy, though, would not be enough to keep a leatherback warm in cold northern waters. It is not enough for whales, which <span class="highlight">supplement</span> it with a thick <span class="highlight">layer</span> of insulating <span class="highlight">blubber</span> (fat). Leatherbacks do not have <span class="highlight">blubber</span>, but they do have a reptilian equivalent: thick, oil-saturated skin, with a <span class="highlight">layer</span> of <span class="highlight">fibrous</span>, fatty <span class="highlight">tissue</span> just <span class="highlight">beneath</span> it. <span class="highlight">Insulation</span> protects the leatherback everywhere but on its head and flippers. Because the flippers are <span class="highlight">comparatively</span> thin and blade-like, they are the one part of the leatherback that is likely to become <span class="highlight">chilled</span>. There is not much that the <span class="highlight">turtle</span> can do about this without compromising the aerodynamic <span class="highlight">shape</span> of the <span class="highlight">flipper</span>. The problem is that as blood flows <span class="highlight">through</span> the <span class="highlight">turtle</span>'s flippers, it risks losing enough heat to <span class="highlight">lower</span> the animal's central body <span class="highlight">temperature</span> when it returns. The <span class="highlight">solution</span> is to allow the flippers to cool down without drawing heat away from the rest of the <span class="highlight">turtle</span>'s body. The leatherback accomplishes this by arranging the blood vessels in the <span class="highlight">base</span> of its <span class="highlight">flipper</span> into a <span class="highlight">countercurrent</span> <span class="highlight">exchange</span> system.</p>
          <p><span class="question8">In a <span class="highlight">countercurrent</span> <span class="highlight">exchange</span> system, the blood vessels carrying cooled blood from the flippers run close enough to the blood vessels carrying warm blood from the body to pick up some heat from the warmer blood vessels; thus, the heat is transferred from the outgoing to the ingoing vessels before it reaches the <span class="highlight">flipper</span> itself.</span> This is the same arrangement found in an <span class="question9">old-fashioned steam radiator</span>, in which the coiled pipes pass heat back and forth as water <span class="question10">courses <span class="highlight">through</span></span> them. The leatherback is certainly not the only animal with such an arrangement; gulls have a <span class="highlight">countercurrent</span> <span class="highlight">exchange</span> in their legs. That is why a <span class="highlight">gull</span> can stand on an ice floe without freezing.</p>
          <p>All this applies, of <span class="highlight">course</span>, only to an adult leatherback. Hatchlings are <span class="highlight">simply</span> too small to <span class="highlight">conserve</span> body heat, <span class="highlight">even</span> with <span class="highlight">insulation</span> and <span class="highlight">countercurrent</span> <span class="highlight">exchange</span> systems. We do not know how old, or how large, a leatherback has to be before it can <span class="highlight">switch</span> from a cold-blooded to a warm-blooded <span class="highlight">mode</span> of life. Leatherbacks <span class="highlight">reach</span> their <span class="highlight">immense</span> size in a much shorter time than it takes other sea turtles to grow. Perhaps their <span class="highlight">rush</span> to adulthood is driven by a simple need to keep warm.</p>

              <p>Unique is unique, then unique among is a very unique meaning between a lot of things, so the answer is B. This sentence says that the leatherback turtle can swim further south or north than other turtles, and they have a set of ways to cope with cold water. C and D are just opposite to the original text. If they are all the same, why do you say this turtle alone? And these two options are close to each other and they are not selected. As for natural, it is completely insensitive.</p>

              <p>B. Using whale as the key word to position the first sentence, said leatherback turtle is more like a whale than a reptile, and then said that this turtle can swim far, that is to say, whales can swim far, so the answer is B. A said that whales are reptiles that violate common sense, and the original did not say; the original said that they physiology like, did not say whether they are related, so C is wrong; as for the two who swim far, the article did not mention, so D wrong.</p>

The most useful transition point of this question is the first, because the additional means to explain the method of maintaining body temperature after this sentence, and until D point the article is saying that gigantothermy is a method of maintaining body temperature by volume. So the answer is D. In addition, A and B after it all show that these two points are closely linked, without inserting any sentence; the muscular activity after D point is a different method from the previous one, and further proves that D is correct.</p>
