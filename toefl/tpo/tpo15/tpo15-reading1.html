It swims farther into the cold of the northern and southern oceans than any other sea <span class="highlight">turtle</span>, and it deals with the chilly waters in a way <span class="question1"><span class="highlight">unique</span> among</span> reptiles.</p><p>A warm-blooded <span class="highlight">turtle</span> may <span class="highlight">seem</span> to be a <span class="highlight">contradiction</span> in terms. <span class="highlight">Nonetheless</span>, an adult leatherback can <span class="highlight">maintain</span> a body <span class="highlight">temperature</span> of between 25 and 26ï¿½C (77-79ï¿½F) in seawater that is only 8ï¿½C (46.4ï¿½F). Accomplishing this <span class="highlight"><span class="question3">feat</span></span> requires adaptations both to <span class="highlight">generate</span> heat in the <span class="highlight">turtle</span>'s body and to keep it from escaping into the surrounding waters. Leatherbacks apparently do not <span class="highlight">generate</span><span class="highlight">internal</span> heat the way we do, or the way birds do, as a <span class="highlight">by-product</span> of cellular <span class="highlight">metabolism</span>. A leatherback may be able to pick up some body heat by basking at the surface; its dark, almost black body color may help it to <span class="highlight">absorb</span><span class="highlight">solar</span><span class="highlight">radiation</span>. However, most of its <span class="highlight">internal</span> heat comes from the <span class="highlight">action</span> of its muscles.</p><p>Leatherbacks keep their body heat in three different ways. The first, and simplest, is size. The bigger the animal is, the <span class="highlight">lower</span> its surface-to-volume <span class="highlight">ratio</span>; for every ounce of body <span class="highlight">mass</span>, 
 there is proportionately less surface <span class="highlight">through</span> which heat can <span class="highlight">escape</span>. An adult leatherback is twice the size of the biggest cheloniid sea turtles and will <span class="highlight">therefore</span> take longer to cool off.
Maintaining a high body <span class="highlight">temperature</span><span class="highlight">through</span><span class="highlight">sheer</span><span class="highlight"><span class="question5">bulk</span></span> is called gigantothermy. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>It works for elephants, for whales, and, perhaps, 
 it worked for many of the larger dinosaurs. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>It apparently works,
 in a smaller way, for some other sea turtles. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>Large loggerhead and green turtles can <span class="highlight">maintain</span> their body <span class="highlight">temperature</span> at a <span class="highlight">degree</span> or two above that of the surrounding water, and gigantothermy is 
 probably the way they do it. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span><span class="highlight">Muscular</span><span class="highlight">activity</span> helps, too, and an actively swimming green <span class="highlight">turtle</span> may be 7ï¿½C (12.6ï¿½F) warmer than the waters it swims <span class="highlight">through</span>.</p><p>Gigantothermy, though, would not be enough to keep a leatherback warm in cold northern waters. It is not enough for whales, which <span class="highlight">supplement</span> it with a thick <span class="highlight">layer</span> of insulating <span class="highlight">blubber</span> (fat). Leatherbacks do not have <span class="highlight">blubber</span>, but they do have a reptilian equivalent: thick, oil-saturated skin, with a <span class="highlight">layer</span> of <span class="highlight">fibrous</span>, fatty <span class="highlight">tissue</span> just <span class="highlight">beneath</span> it. <span class="highlight">Insulation</span> protects the leatherback everywhere but on its head and flippers. Because the flippers are <span class="highlight">comparatively</span> thin and blade-like, they are the one part of the leatherback that is likely to become <span class="highlight">chilled</span>. There is not much that the <span class="highlight">turtle</span> can do about this without compromising the aerodynamic <span class="highlight">shape</span> of the <span class="highlight">flipper</span>. The problem is that as blood flows <span class="highlight">through</span> the <span class="highlight">turtle</span>'s flippers, it risks losing enough heat to <span class="highlight">lower</span> the animal's central body <span class="highlight">temperature</span> when it returns. The <span class="highlight">solution</span> is to allow the flippers to cool down without drawing heat away from the rest of the <span class="highlight">turtle</span>'s body. The leatherback accomplishes this by arranging the blood vessels in the <span class="highlight">base</span> of its <span class="highlight">flipper</span> into a <span class="highlight">countercurrent</span><span class="highlight">exchange</span> system.</p><p><span class="question8">In a <span class="highlight">countercurrent</span><span class="highlight">exchange</span> system, the blood vessels carrying cooled blood from the flippers run close enough to the blood vessels carrying warm blood from the body to pick up some heat from the warmer blood vessels; thus, the heat is transferred from the outgoing to the ingoing vessels before it reaches the <span class="highlight">flipper</span> itself.</span> This is the same arrangement found in an <span class="question9">old-fashioned steam radiator</span>, in which the coiled pipes pass heat back and forth as water <span class="question10">courses <span class="highlight">through</span></span> them. The leatherback is certainly not the only animal with such an arrangement; gulls have a <span class="highlight">countercurrent</span><span class="highlight">exchange</span> in their legs. That is why a <span class="highlight">gull</span> can stand on an ice floe without freezing.</p><p>All this applies, of <span class="highlight">course</span>, only to an adult leatherback. Hatchlings are <span class="highlight">simply</span> too small to <span class="highlight">conserve</span> body heat, <span class="highlight">even</span> with <span class="highlight">insulation</span> and <span class="highlight">countercurrent</span><span class="highlight">exchange</span> systems. We do not know how old, or how large, a leatherback has to be before it can <span class="highlight">switch</span> from a cold-blooded to a warm-blooded <span class="highlight">mode</span> of life. Leatherbacks <span class="highlight">reach</span> their <span class="highlight">immense</span> size in a much shorter time than it takes other sea turtles to grow. Perhaps their <span class="highlight">rush</span> to adulthood is driven by a simple need to keep warm.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The phrase "<span class="highlight">unique among</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. natural to</p><p>B. different from all other</p><p>C. quite common among</p><p>D. familiar to</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="unique among B"><p>Unique is unique, then unique among is a very unique meaning between a lot of things, so the answer is B. This sentence says that the leatherback turtle can swim further south or north than other turtles, and they have a set of ways to cope with cold water. C and D are just opposite to the original text. If they are all the same, why do you say this turtle alone? And these two options are close to each other and they are not selected. As for natural, it is completely insensitive.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What can be inferred about whales from paragraph 1?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They are considered by some to be reptiles.</p><p>B. Their bodies are built in a way that helps them manage extremely cold temperatures.</p><p>C. They are distantly related to leatherback turtles.</p><p>D. They can swim farther than leatherback turtles.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B. Using whale as the key word to position the first sentence, said leatherback turtle is more like a whale than a reptile, and then said that this turtle can swim far, that is to say, whales can swim far, so the answer is B. A said that whales are reptiles that violate common sense, and the original did not say; the original said that they physiology like, did not say whether they are related, so C is wrong; as for the two who swim far, the article did not mention, so D wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question3">feat</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. remarkable achievement</p><p>B. common transformation</p><p>C. daily activity</p><p>D. complex solution</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" A"><p>A, <span class="question3">feat</span>: Achievements, achievements. A is a remarkable achievement; B is a general transformation; C is a daily activity; D is a complicated solution. So answer A is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Paragraph 2 mentions all of the following as true about the body heat of adult leatherback turtles EXCEPT:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Their muscles produce heat for maintaining body temperature.</p><p>B. Their dark bodies help trap solar radiation.</p><p>C. Their cellular metabolism produces heat as a by-product.</p><p>D. Basking at the water's surface helps them obtain heat.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C's muscles do keyword positioning to the last sentence, saying that it is possible to gain heat through muscle activity, right, not selected; B's dark body is targeted to the third sentence, saying that black body surface can capture solar radiation, correct, not Select; C's by-product keyword positioning to the fourth sentence, but the original said that unlike us and birds do the calories as a byproduct of metabolism, so contrary to what C said, C is the answer; D's basking and surface Do keyword positioning to the penultimate sentence, saying that gaining calories through basking is correct and not selected.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question5">bulk</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. strength</p><p>B. effort</p><p>C. activity</p><p>D. mass</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" D"><p>D <span class="question5">bulk</span>: volume, capacity, large blocks. A is power; B is hard; C is activity; D is massive, block. So the answer is D's mass.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "it" in paragraph 4 refers to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. the problem</p><p>B. blood</p><p>C. the turtle</p><p>D. body temperature</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B. Looking forward, find the subject of the sentence, and find that the subject is blood, and the answer is B. Bring it in to say that blood loses the heat. A and D don't make sense. Turtle, although it appeared in the previous text, is not the core noun of the phrase, so it is not selected.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, which of the following <span class="question3">feat</span>ures enables the leatherback turtle to stay warm?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. An insulating layer of blubber</p><p>B. A thick, oily skin covering fatty tissue</p><p>C. The aerodynamic shape of its flippers</p><p>D. A well-insulated head</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Keywords are not easy to find, you can use exclusion. A's blubber keyword positioning to the first half of the first sentence of the fifth paragraph, the original obviously said no, so A said anti; B's fat tissue to do keyword positioning to the second sentence of the first sentence of the fifth paragraph, the original word Reproduce, so this answer is correct; C flipper keyword positioning to the penultimate and fourth sentence, did not say flipper and maintain body temperature relationship, not selected; D head to do keyword positioning to the fifth sentence of the second sentence , also did not say that the relationship between head and maintain body temperature, do not choose.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. In a turtle's countercurrent exchange system, outgoing vessels lie near enough to ingoing ones that heat can be exchanged from the former to the latter before reaching the turtle's flippers.</p><p>B. Within the turtle's flippers, there is a countercurrent exchange system that allows colder blood vessels to absorb heat from nearby warmer blood vessels and then return warmed blood to the turtle's body.</p><p>C. In a countercurrent exchange system, a turtle can pick up body heat from being close enough to other turtles, thus raising its blood temperature as it passes them.</p><p>D. When a turtle places its flippers close to its body, it is able to use its countercurrent exchange system to transfer heat from the warmer blood vessels in its body to the cooler blood vessels in its flippers.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The structure of A original sentence is that one blood vessel is close to another blood vessel, so energy can be transferred between them, so the answer A is correct. B's within the adverbial original did not say; the original said to be a blood vessel close to another blood vessel, not a turtle close to another turtle, C completely unreliable; the original said that the two blood vessels close, not D said Cold blood vessels are in the flipper; several wrong answers have all changed the original concept.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the author mention |<span class="question9">old-fashioned steam radiator</span>|in the discussion of countercurrent exchange systems?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To argue that a turtle's central heating system is not as highly evolved as that of other warm-blooded animals</p><p>B. To provide a useful comparison with which to illustrate how a countercurrent exchange system works</p><p>C. To suggest that steam radiators were modeled after the sophisticated heating system of turtles</p><p>D. To establish the importance of the movement of water in countercurrent exchange systems</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="old-fashioned steam radiator B"><p>The title of the function, the sentence where the rhetorical point is located, is simply an example, and at the beginning, this is the same as the previous sentence. The first sentence is the sentence we analyzed in the previous question. It explains how the countercurrent exchange system works, so the answer is B. Compare the two to show how the system works. A's arguer author did not say in the original, wrong; C said steam radiator is learned with the turtle, the original no relevant information, wrong; D water is only part of the simple statement example, not opinion, wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The phrase "<span class="highlight">courses through</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. rises through</p><p>B. heats up in</p><p>C. runs through</p><p>D. collects in</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="courses through C"><p>C course: Course, trajectory, so course through means to take the trajectory, meaning "pass", so the answer is C. A is raised; B is heated and warmed; D is collected and collected.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 6, which of the following statements is most accurate about young leatherback turtles?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They lack the countercurrent exchange systems that develop in adulthood.</p><p>B. Their rate of growth is slower than that of other sea turtles.</p><p>C. They lose heat easily even with insulation and countercurrent exchange systems.</p><p>D. They switch between cold-blooded and warm-blooded modes throughout their hatchling stage.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Use the keyword young leatherback turtle to navigate to the second sentence. Note that hatchling is synonymous with the keyword in the second sentence. It is said that the cub is too small. Even though there is a countercurrent system, it cannot keep the body's calories, so the answer is C. A said that there is no heat exchange system contrary to the original; B option is the opposite of the penultimate sentence;</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>However, these animals have additional means of staying warm..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D three transition points, noun additional means, pronouns and conjunctions. The most useful transition point of this question is the first, because the additional means to explain the method of maintaining body temperature after this sentence, and until D point the article is saying that gigantothermy is a method of maintaining body temperature by volume. So the answer is D. In addition, A and B after it all show that these two points are closely linked, without inserting any sentence; the muscular activity after D point is a different method from the previous one, and further proves that D is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>
Contrary to what we would expect of reptiles, the leatherback turtle is actually warm-blooded.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.Even though they swim into cold ocean waters, leatherbacks maintain their body heat in much the same way as sea turtles in warm southern oceans do.</p><p>B.The leatherback turtle uses a countercurrent exchange system in order to keep the flippers from drawing heat away from the rest of the body.</p><p>C.The shape of the leatherback turtle's flippers is especially important in maintaining heat in extremely cold northern waters.</p><p>D.The leatherback turtle is able to maintain body heat through sheer size.</p><p>E.Leatherbacks have an insulating layer that can be considered the reptilian version of blubber.</p><p>F.Young leatherbacks often do not survive to adulthood because they are not able to switch from a cold-blooded way of life to a warm-blooded one quickly enough.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="BDE"><p>The even though option contradicts the last sentence of the first paragraph and does not choose. The leatherback turtle uses option corresponds to the first sentence of the sixth paragraph of the original text, correct. The original shape option did not say, do not choose. The leatherback turtle is option corresponds to the first sentence and second sentence of the third paragraph of the original text, correct. The first sentence of the fifth paragraph of the leatherbacks have option is correct. Young leatherbacks option MS corresponds to the seventh paragraph, but the original did not say not to be adult, not selected.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
