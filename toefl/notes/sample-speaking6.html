          <p>  (Female professor) Human beings aren't the only animals that use tools. It's generally recognized that other animals use tools as well . . . use them naturally, in the wild, without any human instruction. But when can we say that an object is a tool? Well, it depends on your definition of a tool. And in fact, there are two competing definitions-a narrow definition and a broad one. The narrow definition says that a tool is an object that's used to perform a specific task . . . but not just any object. To be a tool, according to the narrow definition, the object's gotta be purposefully changed or shaped by the animal, or human, so that it can be used that way. It's an object that's made. Wild chimpanzees use sticks to dig insects out of their nests . . . but most sticks lying around won't do the job . . . they might be too thick, for example. So the sticks have to be sharpened so they'll fit into the hole in an ant hill or the insect nest. The chimp pulls off the leaves and chews the stick and trims it down that way until it's the right size. The chimp doesn't just find the stick . . . it . . . you could say it makes it in a way.</p>
          <p>But the broad definition says an object doesn't have to be modified to be considered a tool. The broad definition says a tool is any object that's used to perform a specific task. For example, an elephant will sometimes use a stick to scratch its back . . . it just picks up a stick from the ground and scratches its back with it . . . It doesn't modify the stick, it uses it just as it's found. And it's a tool, under the broad definition, but under the narrow definition it's not because, well, the elephant doesn't change it in any way.</p>

          <p>Definitions of tools that narrow definition and the broad definition. The narrow definition is that a tool is the object. Use words for this specific purpose but it has to be modified. For example hymns use sex to drive out ends but they don't use any sticks they have to 2 engines 6 down to reasonable thought. The broad definition says that the tool is any object used very specific purpose and it doesn't have to be modified. For example elven my pickup with a branch to practice back. Under the broad definition this would be a tool even though it wasn't modified at all. But under their definition it wouldn't be a tool because elephant didn't change it in any way before using. Just use it as he found it.</p>

            <h5>Comment</h5>
            <p>This response meets the criteria at score level 4. In this response, the speaker first describes the narrow definition of a tool: an object that is used for a specific purpose and that is modified. He gives the example of a chimp that modifies a stick by trimming it down to the right size to drive out ants. He then gives the broad definition of a tool: any object that is used for a specific purpose and does not need to be modified. He gives the example of an elephant that uses a stick to scratch its back, and he explains that that example fits the broad definition because the elephant uses the tool just as it finds it and does not modify it. The content in this response has appropriate and relevant details, and the ideas are presented in a coherent manner. The speech is easy to understand and well paced, and the language is accurate and efficient.</p>
