        <h4><b>Reading Passage</b></h4>
        <p>Critics say that current voting systems used in the United States are inefficient and often lead to the inaccurate counting of votes. Miscounts can be especially damaging if an election is closely contested. Those critics would like the traditional systems to be replaced with far more efficient and trustworthy computerized voting systems.</p>
        <p>In traditional voting, one major source of inaccuracy is that people accidentally vote for the wrong candidate. Voters usually have to find the name of their candidate on a large sheet of paper containing many names-the ballot-and make a small mark next to that name. People with poor eyesight can easily mark the wrong name. The computerized voting machines have an easy-to-use touch-screen technology: to cast a vote, a voter needs only to touch the candidate's name on the screen to record a vote for that candidate; voters can even have the computer magnify the name for easier viewing.</p>
        <p>Another major problem with old voting systems is that they rely heavily on people to count the votes. Officials must often count up the votes one by one, going through every ballot and recording the vote. Since they have to deal with thousands of ballots, it is almost inevitable that they will make mistakes. If an error is detected, a long and expensive recount has to take place. In contrast, computerized systems remove the possibility of human error, since all the vote counting is done quickly and automatically by the computers.</p>
        <p>Finally, some people say it is too risky to implement complicated voting technology nationwide. But without giving it a thought, governments and individuals alike trust other complex computer technology every day to be perfectly accurate in banking transactions as well as in the communication of highly sensitive information.</p>

        <audio src="sqw1.mp3" controls="controls" ></audio>
        <p>(Female professor)</p>
        <p>While traditional voting systems have some problems, it’s doubtful that computerized voting will make the situation any better.</p>
        <p>Computerized voting may seem easy for people who are used to computers. But what about people who aren’t? People who can’t afford computers, people who don’t use them on a regular basis—these people will have trouble using computerized voting machines. These voters can easily cast the wrong vote or be discouraged from voting altogether because of fear of technology.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, it’s true that humans make mistakes when they count up ballots by hand. But are we sure that computers will do a better job? After all, computers are programmed by humans, so “human error” can show up in mistakes in their programs. And the errors caused by these defective programs may be far more serious. The worst a human official can do is miss a few ballots. But an error in a computer program can result in thousands of votes being miscounted or even permanently removed from the record. And in many voting systems, there is no physical record of the votes, so a computer recount in the case of a suspected error is impossible!</p>
        <p>As for our trust of computer technology for banking and communications, remember one thing: these systems are used daily and they are used heavily. They didn’t work flawlessly when they were first introduced. They had to be improved on and improved on until they got as reliable as they are today. But voting happens only once every two years nationally in the United States and not much more than twice a year in many local areas. This is hardly sufficient for us to develop confidence that computerized voting can be fully trusted.</p>

        <h4><b>Score 5 Essay</b></h4>
        <p>The lecture explained why the computerized voting system can not replace the traditional voting system. There are the following three reasons.</p>
        <p>First of all, not everyoen can use computers correctly. Some poele do not have access to computers, some people are not used of computers, and some people are even scared of this new technology. If the voters do not know how to use a computer, how do you expect them to finish the voting process through computers? This directly refutes the reading passage which states that computerized voting is easier by just touchingthe screen.</p>
        <p>Secondly, computers may make mistakes as the people do. As computers are programmed by the human beings, thus erros are inevitable in the computer system. Problems caused by computer voting systems may be more serious than those caused by people. A larger number of votes might be miss counted or even removed from the system. Furthermore, it would take more energy to recount the votes. Again this contradicts what is stated in the reading which stated that only people will make mistakes in counting.</p>
        <p>Thirdly, computerized voting system is not reliable because it has not reached a stable status. People trust computers to conduct banking transactions because the computerized banking system is being used daily and frecuently and has been stable. How ever, the voting does not happen as often as banking thus the computerized voting system has not been proved to be totally reliable.</p>
        <p>All in all, not everyone can use a computer properly, computer cause mistakes and computerized voting system is not reliable are the main reasons why computerized voting system can not replace the traditional voting system.</p>
        
        <h5><b>Comments</b></h5>
        <p>This response is well organized, selects the important information from all three points made in the lecture, and explains its relationship to the claims made in the reading passage about the advantages of computerized voting over traditional voting methods.</p>
        <p>First, it counters the argument that computerized voting is more user-friendly and prevents distortion of the vote by saying that many voters find computers unfamiliar and some voters may end up not voting at all.</p>
        <p>Second, it challenges the argument that computerized voting will result in fewer miscounts by pointing out that programming errors may result in large-scale miscounts and that some errors may result in the loss of voting records.</p>
        <p>Third, it rejects the comparison of computerized voting with computerized banking by pointing out that the reliability of computerized banking (reached a stable status) has been achieved though frequent use, which does not apply to voting.</p>
        <p>There are occasional minor language errors: for example, people not used of computers; miss counted; computer cause mistakes; and the poor syntax of the last sentence (All in all . . . ). Some spelling errors are obviously typos: everyoen. The errors, however, are not at all frequent and do not result in unclear or inaccurate representation of the content.</p>
        <p>The response meets all the criteria for the score of 5.</p>

        <h4><b>Score 4 Essay</b></h4>
        <p>The leture disgreed with the article's opinions. It's not a better solution to use the computerized voting systems.</p>
        <p>Firstly, it might be hard for the voters who don't use the computer so often, or the users who is fear of the technology, even some of voters can not aford a computer. Touch screen may also be hard to use for people who is not familiar with computers. Secondly, computer is  programmed by human beings, which means it can also have errors. Instead of human being's counting error, which only results one or two counting error in number, an errror in the program code could cause tramendous error in number. In case of the computer crash or disaster, it may lost all the voting information. We can not even to make a re-count. Lastly, our daily banking or other highly sensitive infomation system, is actually improved as time goes by. They were also problematic at the beginning. As we use them so often, we have more chances to find problems, and furturemore, to fix and improve them. However, for the voting system, we only use them every 2 years nationally and some other rare events. We just don't use it often enough to find a bug or test it thoroughly.</p>
  
        <h5><b>Comments</b></h5>
        <p>The response selects most of the important information from the lecture and indicates that it challenges the main argument in the reading passage about the advantages of computerized voting systems (it's not a better solution).</p>
        <p>First, the response explains that some people will not find computers to be user-friendly; however, it fails to relate this clearly to the point made in the passage that computerized voting will prevent distortion of the vote. That is clearly an omission, but it is minor.</p>
        <p>Second, the response does a good job of pointing out how programming and errors can cause greater problems than miscounts cause in the traditional voting system.</p>
        <p>Third, the response provides a nice explanation of how the frequent use of systems like the banking system has contributed to such systems' reliability, and then it contrasts that with the computerized voting system.</p>
        <p>There are more frequent language errors throughout the responsefor example, users who is fear; some of voters can not aford; people who is not familiar; it may lost; and can not even to make. Expressions chosen by the writer occasionally affect the clarity of the content that is being conveyed: results one or two counting error in number . . . an errror in the program code could cause tramendous error in number and use them every 2 years nationally and some other rare events. However, it should be noted that in these cases, a reader can derive the intended meaning from the context.</p>
        <p>Due to the more frequent language errors that on occasion result in minor lapses of clarity and due to minor content omission, especially in the coverage of the first lecture point, the response cannot earn the score of 5. At the same time, since the language errors are generally minor and mostly do not interfere with the clarity of the content and since most of the important information from the lecture is covered by the writer, the response deserves a higher score than 3. It meets the criteria for the score of 4.</p>
