          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="7.12" data-time="4.5">[00:04.50]</span>Professor: OK. Another <span class="highlight">ancient</span> Greek <span class="highlight">philosopher</span> we need to discuss is <span class="highlight">Aristotle</span>-<span class="highlight">Aristotle</span>'s <span class="highlight">ethical</span> <span class="highlight">theory</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8.87" data-time="11.62">[00:11.62]</span>What <span class="highlight">Aristotle</span>'s <span class="highlight">ethical</span> <span class="highlight">theory</span> is all about is this: he's trying to show you how to be happy-what true happiness is. <span class="time" data-times="3.58" data-time="20.49">[00:20.49]</span>Now, why is he interested in human happiness? <span class="time" data-times="4.45" data-time="24.07">[00:24.07]</span>It's not just because it's something that all people want or aim for. <span class="time" data-times="1.22" data-time="28.52">[00:28.52]</span>It's more than that. <span class="time" data-times="4.45" data-time="29.74">[00:29.74]</span>But to get there we need to first make a very important <span class="highlight">distinction</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.72" data-time="34.19">[00:34.19]</span>Let me introduce a <span class="highlight">couple</span> of <span class="highlight">technical</span> terms: <span class="highlight">extrinsic</span> value and <span class="highlight">intrinsic</span> value. <span class="time" data-times="9.53" data-time="40.91">[00:40.91]</span>To understand <span class="highlight">Aristotle</span>'s <span class="highlight">interest</span> in happiness, you need to understand this <span class="highlight">distinction</span>. <span class="time" data-times="8" data-time="50.44">[00:50.44]</span>Some things we aim for and value, not for themselves but for what they bring about in <span class="highlight">addition</span> to themselves. <span class="time" data-times="6.89" data-time="58.44">[00:58.44]</span>If I value something as a means to something else, then it has what we will call "<span class="highlight">extrinsic</span> value." <span class="time" data-times="4.97" data-time="65.33">[01:05.33]</span>Other things we <span class="highlight">desire</span> and hold to be <span class="highlight">valuable</span> for themselves alone. <span class="time" data-times="8.69" data-time="70.3">[01:10.30]</span>If we value something not as a means to something else, but for its own <span class="highlight">sake</span>, let us say that it has "<span class="highlight">intrinsic</span> value."</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.22" data-time="78.99">[01:18.99]</span>
            <span class="highlight">Exercise</span>. There may be some people who value <span class="highlight">exercise</span> for itself, but I don't. <span class="time" data-times="6.79" data-time="85.21">[01:25.21]</span>I value <span class="highlight">exercise</span> because if I <span class="highlight">exercise</span>, I <span class="highlight">tend</span> to stay healthier than I would if I didn't. <span class="time" data-times="10.22" data-time="92">[01:32.00]</span>So I <span class="highlight">desire</span> to <span class="highlight">engage</span> in <span class="highlight">exercise</span> and I value <span class="highlight">exercise</span> extrinsically, not for its own <span class="highlight">sake</span>, but as a means to something beyond it. <span class="time" data-times="1.46" data-time="102.22">[01:42.22]</span>It brings me good health.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.19" data-time="103.68">[01:43.68]</span>Health. Why do I value good health? <span class="time" data-times="3.03" data-time="106.87">[01:46.87]</span>Well, here it gets a little more <span class="highlight">complicated</span> for me. <span class="time" data-times="9.4" data-time="109.9">[01:49.90]</span>Um, health is important for me because I can't...do other things I want to do-play music, teach <span class="highlight">philosophy</span>-if I'm ill. <span class="time" data-times="6.17" data-time="119.3">[01:59.30]</span>So health is important to me-has value to me-as a means to a <span class="highlight">productive</span> life. <span class="time" data-times="6.89" data-time="125.47">[02:05.47]</span>But health is also important to me because I just kind of like to be healthy-it feels good. <span class="time" data-times="3.5" data-time="132.36">[02:12.36]</span>It's pleasant to be healthy, unpleasant not to be. <span class="time" data-times="7.68" data-time="135.86">[02:15.86]</span>So to some <span class="highlight">degree</span>, I value health both for itself and as a means to something else: <span class="highlight">productivity</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.1" data-time="143.54">[02:23.54]</span>It's got <span class="highlight">extrinsic</span> and <span class="highlight">intrinsic</span> value for me.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.05" data-time="147.64">[02:27.64]</span>Then there's some things that are just valued for themselves. <span class="time" data-times="5.1" data-time="151.69">[02:31.69]</span>I'm a <span class="highlight">musician</span>, not a <span class="highlight">professional</span> <span class="highlight">musician</span>; I just play a <span class="highlight">musical</span> <span class="highlight">instrument</span> for fun. <span class="time" data-times="2.51" data-time="156.79">[02:36.79]</span>Why do I value playing music? <span class="time" data-times="5.79" data-time="159.3">[02:39.30]</span>Well, like most <span class="highlight">amateur</span> musicians, I only play because, well, I just enjoy it. <span class="time" data-times="2.3" data-time="165.09">[02:45.09]</span>It's something that's an end in itself.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="8" data-time="167.39">[02:47.39]</span>Now, something else I value is teaching. <span class="time" data-times="6.47" data-time="175.39">[02:55.39]</span>Why? Well, it brings in a <span class="highlight">modest</span> income, but I could make more money doing other things. <span class="time" data-times="2.88" data-time="181.86">[03:01.86]</span>I'd do it <span class="highlight">even</span> if they didn't <span class="highlight">pay</span> me. <span class="time" data-times="1.36" data-time="184.74">[03:04.74]</span>I just enjoy teaching. <span class="time" data-times="3.13" data-time="186.1">[03:06.10]</span>In that <span class="highlight">sense</span> it's an end to itself. <span class="time" data-times="6.48" data-time="189.23">[03:09.23]</span>But teaching's not something that has <span class="highlight">intrinsic</span> value for all people-and that's true generally.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.07" data-time="195.71">[03:15.71]</span>Most things that are enjoyed in and of themselves <span class="highlight">vary</span> from person to person. <span class="time" data-times="4.44" data-time="200.78">[03:20.78]</span>Some people value teaching intrinsically, but others don't. <span class="time" data-times="3.29" data-time="205.22">[03:25.22]</span>So how does all this <span class="highlight">relate</span> to human happiness? <span class="time" data-times="10.55" data-time="208.51">[03:28.51]</span>Well, <span class="highlight">Aristotle</span> asks: is there something that all human beings value . . . and value only intrinsically, for its own <span class="highlight">sake</span> and only for its own <span class="highlight">sake</span>?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="9.72" data-time="219.06">[03:39.06]</span>If you could find such a thing, that would be the universal final good, or truly the <span class="highlight">ultimate</span> purpose or goal for all human beings. <span class="time" data-times="2.46" data-time="228.78">[03:48.78]</span> <span class="highlight">Aristotle</span> thought the answer was yes. <span class="time" data-times="1.09" data-time="231.24">[03:51.24]</span>What is it? <span class="time" data-times="9.75" data-time="232.33">[03:52.33]</span>Happiness. Everyone will agree, he argues, that happiness is the <span class="highlight">ultimate</span> end to be valued for itself and really only for itself. <span class="time" data-times="3.39" data-time="242.08">[04:02.08]</span>For what other purpose is there in being happy? <span class="time" data-times="1.62" data-time="245.47">[04:05.47]</span>What does it <span class="highlight">yield</span>? <span class="time" data-times="5.18" data-time="247.09">[04:07.09]</span>The attainment of happiness becomes the <span class="highlight">ultimate</span> or highest good for <span class="highlight">Aristotle</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.01" data-time="252.27">[04:12.27]</span>The next question that <span class="highlight">Aristotle</span> raises is: what is happiness? <span class="time" data-times="3.76" data-time="257.28">[04:17.28]</span>We all want it; we all <span class="highlight">desire</span> it; we all seek it. <span class="time" data-times="2.09" data-time="261.04">[04:21.04]</span>It's the goal we have in life. <span class="time" data-times="1.57" data-time="263.13">[04:23.13]</span>But what is it? <span class="time" data-times="1.51" data-time="264.7">[04:24.70]</span>How do we find it? <span class="time" data-times="4.39" data-time="266.21">[04:26.21]</span>Here he notes, with some frustration, people disagree. <span class="time" data-times="8" data-time="270.6">[04:30.60]</span>But he does give us a <span class="highlight">couple</span> of <span class="highlight">criteria</span>, or features, to keep in <span class="highlight">mind</span> as we look for what true human happiness is.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.38" data-time="278.6">[04:38.60]</span>True human happiness should be, as he puts it, complete. <span class="time" data-times="3.4" data-time="282.98">[04:42.98]</span>Complete in that it's all we <span class="highlight">require</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.7" data-time="286.38">[04:46.38]</span>Well, true human happiness...if you had that, what else do you need? Nothing. <span class="time" data-times="5.06" data-time="292.08">[04:52.08]</span>And, <span class="highlight">second</span>, true happiness should be something that I can <span class="highlight">obtain</span> on my own. <span class="time" data-times="2.82" data-time="297.14">[04:57.14]</span>I shouldn't have to <span class="highlight">rely</span> on other people for it.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.19" data-time="299.96">[04:59.96]</span>Many people value fame and seek fame. <span class="time" data-times="2.19" data-time="303.15">[05:03.15]</span>Fame for them becomes the goal. <span class="time" data-times="7.37" data-time="305.34">[05:05.34]</span>But, according to <span class="highlight">Aristotle</span>, this won't work either, because fame depends <span class="highlight">altogether</span> too much on other people. <span class="time" data-times="3.76" data-time="312.71">[05:12.71]</span>I can't get it on my own, without help from other people. <span class="time" data-times="9.54" data-time="316.47">[05:16.47]</span>In the end, <span class="highlight">Aristotle</span> says that true happiness is the <span class="highlight">exercise</span> of <span class="highlight">reason</span>-a life of <span class="highlight">intellectual</span> contemplation ...of thinking. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="326.01">[05:26.01]</span>So let's see how he comes to that.</p>

              <p>Well, Aristotle asks: is there something that all human beings value . . . and value only intrinsically, for its own sake and only for its own sake? Aristotle thought the answer was yes. What is it? Happiness. According to Dodd's theory, happiness is important. Because of the value of happiness, for all people, it is what they want. Moreover, it is totally worth its own value.</p>

              <p>Second, true happiness should be something that I can obtain on my own. I shouldn't have to rely on other people for it. ...because fame depends altogether too much on other people. Because the text explains that true happiness is forgive me Get through yourself. Should not rely on others. Most people value and pursue reputation, but reputation requires too much of existence and performance. So it can't provide happiness. The reason is that he depends on others.</p>
