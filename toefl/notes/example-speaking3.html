          <h4 class="w3-center">Announcement from the President</h4>
          <p>The university has decided to increase tuition and fees for all students by approximately 8% next semester. For the past 5 years, the tuition and fees have remained the same, but it is necessary to increase them now for several reasons. The university has many more students than we had five years ago, and we must hire additional professors to teach these students. We have also made a new commitment to research and technology and will be renovating and upgrading our laboratory facilities to better meet our students’ needs. </p>

          <p>Man: Oh great, now we have to come up with more money for next semester. </p>
          <p>Woman: Yeah, I know, but I can see why. When I first started here, classes were so much smaller than they are now. With this many students, it's hard to get the personal attention you need . . . </p>
          <p>Man: Yeah, I guess you're right. You know, in some classes I can't even get a seat. And I couldn't take the math course I wanted to because it was already full when I signed up.</p>
          <p>Woman: And the other thing is, well, I am kind of worried about not being able to get a job after I graduate. </p>
          <p>Man: Why? I mean you're doing really well in your classes, aren't you? </p>
          <p>Woman: I'm doing ok, but the facilities here are so limited. There are some great new experiments in microbiology that we can't even do here . . . there isn't enough equipment in the laboratories, and the equipment they have is out of date. How am I going to compete for jobs with people who have practical research experience? I think the extra tuition will be a good investment.</p>

          <p>The woman agrees with the announcement and thinks that the university is right to increase its fees. She thinks the tuition increase is necessary because the university can then hire more teachers. She feels that classes are getting too crowded and more teachers are needed. she has found it hard to get personal attention from her professors. she agrees that the money should be spent to improve laboratory facilities because they are out of date, and that this has made it hard for her to get the practical laboratory experience she feels she needs to get a good job.</p>
