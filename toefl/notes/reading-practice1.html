            <h4 class="w3-center">The Origins of Cetaceans</h4>
            <p>
              <p>It should be <span class="highlight">obvious</span> that cetaceans—whales, porpoises, and dolphins—are mammals. They breathe <span class="highlight">through</span> lungs, not <span class="highlight">through</span> gills, and give birth to live young. Their <span class="highlight">streamlined</span> bodies, the <span class="highlight">absence</span> of <span class="highlight">hind</span> legs, and the presence of a fluke and blowhole cannot <span class="highlight">disguise</span> their affinities with land <span class="highlight">dwelling</span> mammals. However, unlike the cases of sea otters and pinnipeds (seals, sea lions, and walruses, whose limbs are <span class="highlight">functional</span> both on land and at sea), it is not easy to <span class="highlight">envision</span> what the first whales looked like. <span class="highlight">Extinct</span> but already fully <span class="highlight">marine</span> cetaceans are known from the <span class="highlight">fossil</span> <span class="highlight">record</span>.  <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>How was the <span class="highlight">gap</span> between a walking <span class="highlight">mammal</span> and a swimming whale bridged? <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>Missing until recently were fossils clearly <span class="highlight">intermediate</span>, or transitional, between land mammals and cetaceans.</p>
            </p> <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>Very <span class="highlight">exciting</span> discoveries have finally allowed scientists to reconstruct the most likely origins of cetaceans.  <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>In 1979, a team looking for fossils in northern Pakistan found what proved to be the oldest <span class="highlight">fossil</span> whale. The <span class="highlight">fossil</span> was officially named Pakicetus in honor of the country where the discovery was made. Pakicetus was found embedded in rocks formed from river deposits that were 52 million years old. The river that formed these deposits was actually not far from an <span class="highlight">ancient</span> ocean known as the Tethys Sea.</p>
            <p>The <span class="highlight">fossil</span> consists of a complete <span class="highlight">skull</span> of an archaeocyte, an <span class="highlight">extinct</span> group of ancestors of modern cetaceans. Although limited to a <span class="highlight">skull</span>, the Pakicetus <span class="highlight">fossil</span> provides <span class="highlight"><span class="question3">precious</span></span> details on the origins of cetaceans. The <span class="highlight">skull</span> is cetacean-like but its jawbones <span class="highlight">lack</span> the enlarged <span class="highlight">space</span> that is filled with fat or oil and used for receiving underwater <span class="highlight">sound</span> in modern whales. Pakicetus probably detected <span class="highlight">sound</span> <span class="highlight">through</span> the ear opening as in land mammals. The <span class="highlight">skull</span> also lacks a blowhole, another <span class="highlight">cetacean</span> <span class="highlight">adaptation</span> for diving. Other features, however, show experts that Pakicetus is a transitional form between a group of <span class="highlight">extinct</span> flesh-eating mammals, the mesonychids, and cetaceans. It has been suggested that Pakicetus fed on fish in <span class="highlight">shallow</span> water and was not yet adapted for life in the open ocean. <span class="question5">It</span> probably bred and gave birth on land.</p>
            <p>Another <span class="highlight">major</span> discovery was made in Egypt in 1989. Several skeletons of another early whale, Basilosaurus, were found in sediments left by the Tethys Sea and now <span class="highlight"><span class="question6">exposed</span></span> in the Sahara <span class="highlight">desert</span>. This whale lived around 40 million years ago, 12 million years after Pakicetus. Many incomplete skeletons were found but they included, for the first time in an archaeocyte, a complete <span class="highlight">hind</span> leg that features a foot with three tiny toes. Such legs would have been far too small to have supported the 50-foot-long Basilosaurus on land. Basilosaurus was undoubtedly a fully <span class="highlight">marine</span> whale with possibly nonfunctional, or vestigial, <span class="highlight">hind</span> legs.</p>
            <p>An <span class="highlight">even</span> more <span class="highlight">exciting</span> find was reported in 1994, also from Pakistan. The now <span class="highlight">extinct</span> whale Ambulocetus natans ("the walking whale that swam") lived in the Tethys Sea 49 million years ago. It lived around 3 million years after Pakicetus but 9 million before Basilosaurus. The <span class="highlight">fossil</span> <span class="question9">luckily</span> includes a good <span class="highlight">portion</span> of the <span class="highlight">hind</span> legs. The legs were strong and ended in long feet very much like those of a modern pinniped. The legs were certainly <span class="highlight">functional</span> both on land and at sea. The whale retained a tail and lacked a fluke, the <span class="highlight">major</span> means of <span class="highlight">locomotion</span> in modern cetaceans. <span class="question10">The structure of the <span class="highlight">backbone</span> shows, however, that Ambulocetus swam like modern whales by moving the <span class="highlight">rear</span> <span class="highlight">portion</span> of its body up and down, <span class="highlight">even</span> though a fluke was missing.</span> The large <span class="highlight">hind</span> legs were used for <span class="highlight"><span class="question11">propulsion</span></span> in water. On land, where it probably bred and gave birth, Ambulocetus may have moved around very much like a modern sea lion. It was undoubtedly a whale that linked life on land with life at sea.</p>

The other three choices are refuted, either directly or indirectly, by that paragraph. </p>

                <p>2.  This is an Inference question asking for information that can be inferred from paragraph 1. Choice 1 is the best answer because paragraph 1 says that sea otters are unlike early mammals whose appearances are not easy to imagine. By inference, then, the early appearance of sea otters must be easy (or not difficult) to imagine. </p>

                <p>13.    This is a Prose Summary question. It is completed correctly below. The correct choices are 1, 2, and 5. Choices 3, 4, and 6 are therefore incorrect.  </p>
<p>Choice 1, "Recent discoveries of fossils have helped to show the link between land mammals and cetaceans," is correct because it represents the major idea of the entire passage. The bulk of the passage consists of a discussion of the major discoveries (Pakicetus, Basilosaurus, and Ambulocetus) that show this link. </p>
<p>Choice 2, "The discovery of Ambulocetus natans provided evidence for a whale that lived both on land and at sea," is correct because it is one of the major discoveries cited in the passage in support of the passage's main point, that land mammals and cetaceans are related.</p>
<p>Choice 5, "Fossils thought to be transitional forms between walking mammals and swimming whales were found," is correct because like choice 1, this is a statement of the passage's major theme as stated in paragraph 1: these fossils were "clearly intermediate, or transitional between land mammals and cetaceans." The remainder of the passage discusses these discoveries. </p>
<p>Choice 3, "The skeleton of Basilosaurus was found in what had been the Tethys Sea, an area rich in fossil evidence," is true, but it is a minor detail and therefore incorrect. </p>
<p>Choice 4, "Pakicetus is the oldest fossil whale yet to be found," is true, but it is a minor detail and therefore incorrect. </p>
<p>Choice 6, "Ambulocetus' hind legs were used for propulsion in the water," is true, but it is a minor detail and therefore incorrect. </p></div>
