            <h4 class="w3-center">Early Cinema</h4>
            <p>The cinema did not <span class="highlight">emerge</span> as a form of <span class="highlight">mass</span> <span class="highlight">consumption</span> until its technology evolved from the <span class="highlight">initial</span> "peepshow" <span class="highlight">format</span> to the point where images were projected on a <span class="highlight">screen</span> in a darkened theater. In the peepshow <span class="highlight">format</span>, a <span class="highlight">film</span> was viewed <span class="highlight">through</span> a small opening in a machine that was created for that purpose. Thomas Edison's peepshow <span class="highlight">device</span>, the Kinetoscope, was introduced to the public in 1894. It was designed for use in Kinetoscope parlors, or arcades, which contained only a few <span class="highlight">individual</span> machines and permitted only one customer to view a short, 50-foot <span class="highlight">film</span> at any one time. The first Kinetoscope parlors contained five machines. For the price of 25 cents (or 5 cents per machine), customers moved from machine to machine to watch five different films (or, in the case of famous prizefights, <span class="highlight">successive</span> rounds of a single fight).</p>
            <p>These Kinetoscope arcades were modeled on <span class="highlight">phonograph</span> parlors, which had proven successful for Edison several years earlier. In the <span class="highlight">phonograph</span> parlors, customers listened to recordings <span class="highlight">through</span> <span class="highlight">individual</span> ear tubes, moving from one machine to the next to hear different recorded speeches or pieces of music. The Kinetoscope parlors functioned in a <span class="highlight">similar</span> way. Edison was more interested in the sale of Kinetoscopes (for <span class="highlight">roughly</span> $1,000 apiece) to these parlors than in the films that would be run in them (which <span class="highlight">cost</span> <span class="highlight">approximately</span> $10 to $15 each). <span class="question3">He refused to develop <span class="highlight">projection</span> technology, reasoning that if he made and sold projectors, then exhibitors would <span class="highlight">purchase</span> only one machine-a projector-from him <span class="highlight">instead</span> of several.</span></p>
            <p>
              <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A">
              </span>Exhibitors, however, <span class="highlight">wanted</span> to maximize their profits, which they could do more <span class="highlight"><span class="question4">readily</span></span> by projecting a <span class="highlight">handful</span> of films to hundreds of customers at a time (rather than one at a time) and by charging 25 to 50 cents <span class="highlight">admission</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span> About a year after the opening of the first Kinetoscope <span class="highlight">parlor</span> in 1894, showmen such as Louis and Auguste Lumiere, Thomas Armat and Charles Francis Jenkins, and Orville and Woodville Latham (with the <span class="highlight"><span class="question5">assistance</span></span> of Edison's <span class="highlight">former</span> <span class="highlight">assistant</span>, William Dickson) perfected <span class="highlight">projection</span> devices. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>These early <span class="highlight">projection</span> devices were used in vaudeville theaters, <span class="highlight">legitimate</span> theaters, <span class="highlight">local</span> town halls, makeshift <span class="highlight">storefront</span> theaters, fairgrounds, and <span class="highlight">amusement</span> parks to show films to a <span class="highlight">mass</span> <span class="highlight">audience</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p>
            <p>With the <span class="highlight">advent</span> of <span class="highlight">projection</span> in 1895-1896, <span class="highlight">motion</span> pictures became the <span class="highlight">ultimate</span> form of <span class="highlight">mass</span> <span class="highlight">consumption</span>. <span class="highlight">Previously</span>, large audiences had viewed spectacles at the theater, where vaudeville, <span class="highlight">popular</span> dramas, <span class="highlight">musical</span> and minstrel shows, <span class="highlight">classical</span> plays, lectures, and slide-and-lantern shows had been presented to several hundred spectators at a time. But the movies differed <span class="highlight">significantly</span> from these other forms of entertainment, which depended on either live performance or (in the case of the slide-and-lantern shows) the active <span class="highlight">involvement</span> of a master of ceremonies who assembled the final program.</p>
            <p>Although early exhibitors regularly accompanied movies with live acts, the <span class="highlight">substance</span> of the movies themselves is mass-produced, prerecorded <span class="highlight">material</span> that can easily be reproduced by theaters with little or no active participation by the exhibitor. <span class="highlight">Even</span> though early exhibitors shaped their <span class="highlight">film</span> programs by mixing films and other entertainments together in whichever way they thought would be most <span class="highlight">attractive</span> to audiences or by accompanying them with lectures, their <span class="highlight">creative</span> control remained limited. What audiences came to see was the <span class="highlight">technological</span> <span class="highlight">marvel</span> of the movies; the lifelike <span class="highlight">reproduction</span> of the <span class="highlight">commonplace</span> <span class="highlight">motion</span> of trains, of waves <span class="highlight">striking</span> the <span class="highlight">shore</span>, and of people walking in the street; and the magic made possible by trick <span class="highlight">photography</span> and the manipulation of the camera.</p>
            <p>With the <span class="highlight">advent</span> of <span class="highlight">projection</span>, the viewer's relationship with the <span class="highlight">image</span> was no longer private, as it had been with earlier peepshow devices such as the Kinetoscope and the Mutoscope, which was a <span class="highlight">similar</span> machine that reproduced <span class="highlight">motion</span> by means of <span class="highlight">successive</span> images on <span class="highlight">individual</span> <span class="highlight">photographic</span> cards <span class="highlight">instead</span> of on strips of <span class="highlight">celluloid</span>. It suddenly became public-an experience that the viewer shared with dozens, scores, and <span class="highlight">even</span> hundreds of others. At the same time, the <span class="highlight">image</span> that the <span class="highlight">spectator</span> looked at <span class="question11">expanded</span> from the <span class="highlight">minuscule</span> peepshow dimensions of 1 or 2 inches (in height) to the life-size proportions of 6 or 9 feet.</p>

                <p>1.  This is a Negative Factual Information question asking for specific information that can be found in paragraph 1. Choice 3 is the correct answer. The paragraph does mention that one viewer at a time could view the films (choice 1), that films could be viewed one after another (choice 2), and that films were short (choice 4). Prizefights are mentioned as one subject of these short films, but not necessarily the most popular one. </p>

                <p>2.  This is a Rhetorical Purpose question. It asks why the author mentions "phonograph parlors" in paragraph 2. The correct answer is choice 2. The author is explaining why Edison designed his arcades like phonograph parlors; that design had been successful for him in the past. The paragraph does not mention the phonograph parlors to explain Edison's financial success, so choice 1 is incorrect. The paragraph does not directly discuss the situations described in choices 3 and 4, so those answers too are incorrect. </p>

                <p>3.  This is a Sentence Simplification question. The correct answer is choice 3. That choice contains all of the essential ideas in the highlighted sentence. It is also the only choice that does not change the meaning of the sentence. Choice 1 says that Edison was more interested in developing a variety of machines, which is not true. Choice 2 says that the reason Edison refused to work on projection technology was that exhibitors would never replace the projectors. That also is not true; the highlighted sentence implies that he refused to do this because he wanted exhibitors to buy several Kinetoscope machines at a time instead of a single projector. Choice 4 says that Edison refused to develop projection technology unless exhibitors agreed to purchase more that one projector from him. The highlighted sentence actually says that Edison had already reasoned or concluded that exhibitors would not buy more than one, so choice 4 is a change in essential meaning. </p>

                <p>6.  This is a Factual Information question asking for specific information that can be found in paragraph 4. The correct answer is choice 4. Early movies were different from previous spectacles because they did not require live actors. The paragraph states (emphasis added):  "But the movies differed significantly from these other forms of entertainment, which depended on either live performance or (in the case of the slide-and-lantern shows) the active involvement of a master of ceremonies who assembled the final program." So the fact that previous spectacles depended on live performances is explicitly stated as one of the ways (but not the only way) that those earlier entertainments differed from movies. The other answer choices are not mentioned in the paragraph. </p>

This is a simple-pronoun referent item. The sentence says that "It" suddenly became "public," which implies that whatever "It" is, it was formerly private. The paragraph says that the "viewer's relationship to the image was no longer private," so that relationship is the "It" referred to here. </p>

After projectors became popular, Edison lost money, and although he had previously refused to develop projection technology, now he was forced to do so. To place the sentence anyplace else would interrupt the logical narrative sequence of the events described. None of the sentences in this paragraph can logically follow the inserted sentence, so squares 1, 2, and 3 are all incorrect. </p>

                <p>13.      This is a Prose Summary question. It is completed correctly below. The correct choices are 3, 5, and 6. Choices 1, 2, and 4 are therefore incorrect.  </p>
<p>Choice 3, "Early cinema allowed individuals to use special machines to view films privately, "is correct because it represents one of the chief differences between Kinetoscope and projection viewing. This idea is discussed at several places in the passage. It is mentioned in paragraphs 1, 3, 4, and 6. Thus it is a basic, recurring theme of the passage and, as such, a "major idea." </p>
<p>Choice 5, "The development of projection technology made it possible to project images on a large screen," is correct because this is a major idea that is developed in paragraphs 3, 4, 5, and 6. This development was essentially the reason that the cinema "emerged as a form of mass consumption." </p>
<p>Choice 6, "Once film images could be projected, the cinema became a form of mass consumption," is correct because it represents the primary theme of the passage. It is explicitly stated in the passage's opening sentence; then the remainder of the passage describes that evolution. </p>
<p>Choice 1, "Kinetoscope parlors for viewing films were modeled on phonograph parlors," is incorrect because, while true, it is a minor detail. The Kinetoscope parlors are described in paragraph 2, but the fact that they were modeled on phonograph parlors is not central to the "evolution" of cinema. </p>
<p>Choice 2, "Thomas Edison's design of the Kinetoscope inspired the development of large screen projection," is incorrect because it is not clear that it is true, based on the passage. While it may be inferred from paragraph 3 that the Kinetoscope inspired the development of large screen projection, it seems more likely that the pursuit of greater profits is what really inspired large screen projection development. Since this answer is not clearly supported in the passage, it cannot be considered a "main idea" and is incorrect. </p>
<p>Choice 4, "Slide-and-lantern shows had been presented to audiences of hundreds of spectators," is incorrect because it is a minor detail, mentioned only once in paragraph 4 as part of a larger list of theatrical spectacles.</p></div>
