        <p>When someone asks him/herself the question "What do I consider to be the most important thing in my relationship?" the answer depends on a lot of factors such as how his/her earlier relationships were.</p>
        <p>After stating that everyone's opinion can be different about this, for me honesty, in other words, always telling the truth is the most important consideration in a relationship. Opposite of this is inarguably lying and if someone needs to lie, either s/he is hiding something or is afraid of telling me something.</p>

          <p>The statment contains <a title="be verb"><u>is</u></a> "Always telling the truth <u>is</u>...", So you could ask "What is <a title="the rest of the statement"><u>...</u>(the most important consideration in any relationship)</a>", then say I think <a title="the word before 'is'"><u>...(variation of the statement "Always telling the truth is the most important consideration in any relationship"). trait's opposite</u></a></p>
        </div>
  
        <p>In any relationship of mine, I would wish that first of all, the person I'm dealing with is honest. Even though s/he thinks that s/he did something wrong that I wouldn't like, s/he'd better tell me the truth and not lie about it. Later on if I find out about a lie or hear the truth from someone else, that'd be much more unpleasant. In that case how can I ever believe or trust that person again? How can I ever believe that this person has enough confidence in me to forgive him/her and carry on with the relationship from there. So if I cannot trust a person anymore, if the person doesn't think I can handle the truth, there's no point to continuing that relationship.</p>
        <p>Although I would like to see altruistic, understanding, thoughtful and loyal behavior from people, an instance of the opposite of these behaviors would not upset me as much as dishonesty would. Among all the possible behaviors, dishonesty is the only one for me that terminates how I feel about a person's reliability. Therefore honesty would be my first concern and the most important consideration in a relationship.</p>

        <h5><b>Rater's Comments</b></h5>
        <p>In this response the writer first approaches the topic by underscoring that a number of character traits are important to a relationship. The writer then effectively develops an argument that unlike other negative behaviors, dishonesty or unwillingness to fully disclose some bad action cannot be forgiven and can be the most important factor in destroying a relationship. The writer's language is fluent, accurate, and varied enough to effectively support the progression and connection of ideas. There is a variety of sentence structures, including rhetorical questions. The essay is not mechanically perfect, but as long as such errors are occasional, minor, and do not interfere with the reader's understanding, an essay like this one can still earn a top score.</p>

She undertands him and they do not see each other in that weekend, but he goes to the party and has much fun. Suppose on monday, the girl talks to a friend that saw him at the party and asked why did not she go with him. She found out the true and all confidence was lost, the basis for their relation is now gone and what happens next is that they break up or if they do not, he will persist on lyes and someday it will end.</p>

Some may argue that lying once or another will not interfere anything and it is part of a relation, but I strongly disagree, the most important thing is the true, even if it is to determine the end of a relation, it must be told. There are more chances to end something lying than saying what really happened.</p>
        
        <h5><b>Rater's Comments</b></h5>
        <p>This essay earned a score of 4. It clearly develops reasons why lying is a bad thing, with a first paragraph that introduces the writer's position ("truth is the basis for everything"), a hypothetical story in paragraph 2, and a final paragraph that entertains and quickly dismisses a possible counterargument. All this amounts to solid development of the idea. The response displays facility in language use through a variety of sentence structures and the use of clear transitions between sentences. However, sometimes the writer's sentences include noticeable errors in word form ("if the true is ommited," "lying will just help throwing it away," "lying once or another," "persist on lyes"), and in some places the writer extends, or "runs on," a sentence to include many steps in the argument when using two or more sentences would make the relationships between ideas clearer. "Some may argue that lying once or another will not interfere anything and it is part of a relation, but I strongly disagree, the most important thing is the true, even if it is to determine the end of a relation, it must be told..</p>

        <p>Some people believe that it is one of the most important value in many relationships to tell the truth all the time. However, it cannot be always the best choice to tell the truth in many situatioins. Sometimes white lies are indispensible to keep relationships more lively and dilightly. There are some examples to support this idea.</p>
        <p>Firstly, in the relationships between lovers, it is often essential to compliment their lovers on their appearance and their behavior. Even though they do not think that their boyfriend or girlfriend looks good on their new shoes and new clothes, it will probably diss them by telling the truth. On the other hand, little compliments will make them confident and happy making their relationship more tight.</p>
        <p>Secondly, parents need to encourage their children by telling lies. Even if they are doing bad work on studying or exercising, telling the truth will hurt their hearts. What they need is a little encouraging words instead of truthful words.</p>
        <p>Thirdly, for some patients telling them their current state of their desease will probably desperate them. It is accepted publically not to let the patients know the truth. They may be able to have hope to overcome their desease without knowing the truth.</p>

        <h5><b>Rater's Comments</b></h5>
        <p>This essay focuses on explaining why "white lies" are sometimes appropriate. The explanations here are "somewhat developed." Each example supports the writer's main point, but in every case, the writer does not say why the positive effect of the "white lie" outweighs any negative effect. There is inconsistent control of structure and vocabulary, with some errors in both structure and vocabulary obscuring meaning: "keep relationships . . . dilightly," "will probably desperate them," "making peoples life more profusely," "it will lead them more happier not knowing it." These weaknesses and errors earn this essay a score of 3.</p>

        <h4><b>Score 2 Essay</b></h4>
        <p>Recently, there is a big debate on the issue that telling the truth or not is the most important consideration in the relationship between people. For my experience, I think telling a truth is the most important consideration in people's relationship. In the following, I will illustrate my opinion by two reasons.</p>
        <p>First of all, honest make the trust stronger between friends or colleages. As we know, if people tell a lie to others he will not be trusted. When he tell a truth, others will believe that he tells a lie. For example, a person who is honest to others, can get real help and get trust of others.</p>
        <p>Secondly, telling a lie always makes things worse not only in work but also in family life. When somebody do something wrong in his job he should annouce his mistake to his manager. If he don't do that others may continue their jobs base on the mistake. Consequently, the work will be worse and worse.</p>
        <p>On the contrary, sometimes it is better to tell a lie to others, such as telling a lie to a patient. As we know, the sick become worse when a cancer patient know his illness. A good way to protect their life is to tell a lie. So that many doctors will not tell the truth to a dying patient.</p>
        <p>To sum up, people should tell the truth to maintain their relationship with other people, although sometimes people have to tell a lie. People can get trust when they are honest to others.</p>
        
        <h5><b>Rater's Comments</b></h5>
        <p>This essay is quite long; but even though it uses several examples, each idea is only partly developed, and the connections among ideas are weak or contradictory. For instance, in paragraph 2 the first sentence says, "honest make the trust stronger." The next two sentences present a contrast: "if people tell a lie to others he will not be trusted" then "when he tell a truth, others will believe that he tells a lie." Then the last sentence in the paragraph says, "For example, a person who is honest to others, can get real help and get trust of others." But that is not an example of the previous sentence and only confuses the reader. This last sentence does not advance the progression of ideas much beyond the first sentence and certainly is not an example of the point made by the second and third sentences. Thus connections throughout this paragraph are tenuous. Paragraph 3 begins by saying that telling a lie makes things worse at work and at home, but it doesn't follow through at all on the latter. The "On the contrary" paragraph comes as a surprise to the reader since paragraph 1 said that the writer was going to give two reasons why telling the truth was the most important consideration in human relationships. Because of all these weaknesses, this essay earns a score of 2.</p>

        <p>Nowadays, many people think that the people who always telling the true is the most inportant consideration in any relationship between human. but another think that is necessary to tell some lies. It is seldom to reach the same issue.I agree with the first thinking because of the following reasons.</p>
        <p>First fo all, we all live in the realized world , people can respect you unless you want to use correct method to communicate with other people. It is very important, especially in business , if you want to recieve the good resulit ,you must tell the ture about your own so that gain the considement.</p>
        <p>Secondly, if you are honest man/woman, many people may be want to make friend with you. You can have more chance to communate with other people . you may be gain more information from them.</p>
        <p>However,sometimes we must speak some lie.for examlpe, when our relatives have heavy illness such as cancer,we couldn't telling them the ture. because that not good for their health,and may be affect their life.</p>
        <p>In conclusion,tellingthe ture is the people good behavire .we must require most of people to tell the ture.thus,we can see the better world in our life unless we always tell the ture.</p>
        
        <h5><b>Rater's Comments</b></h5>
        <p>This essay contains serious and frequent errors in sentence structure and usage. Paragraph 2 beginning "First fo all" is nearly incomprehensible and contains vocabulary that is either vague at best or non-standard English ("realized world," "considement"). Paragraph 3 is completely vague, and paragraph 4 (actually one sentence), though it mentions a familiar example, is poorly expressed and certainly underdeveloped. For all these reasons, this essay rates a score of 1.</p>
