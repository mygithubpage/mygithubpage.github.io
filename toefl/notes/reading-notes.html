      <h2>Reading</h2>

      <p>All TOEFL passages are classified into three basic categories based on author purpose: (1) <b>Exposition</b>, (2) <b>Argumentation</b>, and (3) <b>Historical</b>.</p>
      <p>Common types of organization of passage you should be able to recognize are</p>
      <ul>
        <li>classification</li>
        <li>comparison/contrast</li>
        <li>cause/effect</li>
        <li>problem/solution</li>
      </ul>

        <section class="w3-section">
          <h4>BASIC PRINCIPLES</h4>
          <ol>
            <li><b>#1: It's in There!</b> The answer to every single question is found in the passage! </li>
            <li><b>#2: The Two-Pass System.</b> Do easy questions first, and save the hard questions for later.</li>
            <li><b>#3: Process of Elimination.</b> POE involves comparing answer choices and finding reasons to eliminate one or more.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>In general, the wrong answers on the TOEFL Reading section fall into one of the following categories:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Not mentioned:</b> This category consists of information that is not found in the passage. On the TOEFL, every correct answer must be found in the passage.</li>
            <li><b>Extreme:</b> These answer choices use wording that is too strong or absolute. These choices usually include words such as <b>all, always, impossible, must, never, or none</b>. Correct answers on the TOEFL do not generally contain such strong language.</li>
            <li><b>Right answer, wrong question:</b> These choices contain information that is mentioned in the passage; however, the information doesn't answer the question.</li>
            <li>Verbatim: Many wrong answers repeat parts of the passage word for word. Unfortunately, the choices use these words in the wrong context or incorrectly. These answers can be especially tempting.</li>
            <li>Beyond the information: Choices in chis category are based on information in the passage, but they go beyond the given information.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>BASIC APPROACH</h4>
          <p>When approaching the Reading section of the TOEFL, follow these steps.</p>
          <ol>
            <li><b>Actively read the passage, looking for the purpose, structure, and main idea.</b></li>
            <li><b>Find the answer to the question in the passage. Use POE to eliminate bad answers.</b></li>
          </ol>

          <section class="w3-section">
            <h5>Work on active reading</h5>
            <ol>
              <li><b>Read the first sentence of each paragraph.</b> State what topic the author is writing about.</li>
              <li><b>Skim the rest of the paragraph for opposite-direction markers.</b> Pay particular attention to opposite-direction markers.</li>
              <li><b>Remember to read both the first sentence of each paragraph in the passage and last sentence of the conclusion.</b> The last sentence will contain the author's final point.</li>
              <li><b>The main idea should connect all the ideas found in the first sentences of the paragraphs and the last sentence of the conclusion.</b> If you're having trouble connecting all of the topics, ask yourself what the purpose of the passage is to help you put all the pieces together.</li>
            </ol>
          </section>

          <p>Here is our general system for dealing with questions on the TOEFL.</p>
          <ol>
            <li><b>Read and rephrase the question.</b> You'll notice that many questions on the TOEFL are not written in a straightforward manner. Before you head back to the passage to find the answer, make sure you understand what the question is asking you to find.</li>
            <li><b>Go back to the passage and find the answer.</b> The question will direct you to the appropriate part of the passage. Go back to the passage and read enough lines (usually 6-10) to get the context of the text. Never answer a question from memory alone because you're more likely to fall for a trap answer.</li>
            <li><b>Answer in your own words first.</b> This is the most important step of all. After returning to the passage and reading the appropriate part of it, you should be able to answer the question in your own words. If you can't, you may be reading the wrong part of the passage or you may need co read more lines.</li>
            <li><b>Use POE.</b> Once you have an idea of the type of answer for which you're looking, return to the question and use POE.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>Our strategy for <b>Factual, Vocabulary, Reference</b> question</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Rephrase the question.</li>
            <li>Use <b>keywords</b> in the question to find the appropriate place in the passage.</li>
            <li>Read a few lines before and after (<b>based on the connection words</b> of the keyword sentence) the keywords.</li>
            <li>State the answer to the question in your own words.</li>
            <li>Eliminate answers that are not mentioned in the passage at all</li>
            <li>Eliminate answers that beyond the specific lines needed to answer the question</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Our strategy for <b>Simplification, Insert</b> question is to eliminate the answer are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Doesn't match:</b> This is one of the easiest ways to eliminate an answer choice. If the information in the choice doesn't match the passage, it's wrong.</li>
            <li><b>New information:</b> Be very suspicious of answer choices that introduce new information. These choices are usually wrong.</li>
            <li><b>Half-right:</b> Read each choice carefully because wrong answers will typically match only half of the information in the passage or answer choice. Make sure all the information corresponds.</li>
          </ul>

        <p>Here are some suggestions for ways to build skills for the three reading purposes covered by the TOEFL iBT test.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <b>Reading to find information</b>
            <ul>
              <li><u>Scan passages to find and highlight key facts</u> (dates, numbers, terms) and information.</li>
              <li>Practice this frequently to increase reading rate and fluency.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Reading for basic comprehension</b>
            <ul>
              <li><u>Increase your vocabulary</u> knowledge, perhaps by using flashcards.</li>
              <li>Rather than carefully reading each word and each sentence, <u>practice skimming a passage quickly to get a general impression of the main idea</u>.</li>
              <li>Build up your ability to skim quickly and to identify the major points.</li>
              <li>After skimming a passage, read it again more carefully and write down the main idea, major points, and important facts.</li>
              <li><u>Choose some unfamiliar words in a passage and guess</u> the meaning from the context (surrounding sentences).</li>
              <li><u>Select all the pronouns and identify</u> which nouns they refer to in a passage.</li>
              <li>Practice <u>making inferences and drawing conclusions</u> based on what is implied in the passage as a whole.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Reading to learn</b>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Identify the passage type</b> (e.g., <b>classification, cause/effect, compare/contrast, problem/solution, description, narration,</b> and so on).</li>
              <li>Do the following to organize the information in the passage:
                <ul>
                  <li>Create an outline of the passage to distinguish between major and minor points.</li>
                  <li>If the passage categorizes information, create a chart and place the information in appropriate categories. Practicing this skill will help you think about categorizing information and be able to do so with ease.</li>
                  <li>If the passage describes the steps in a process, create an outline of the steps in their correct order.</li>
                  <li>Create a summary of the passage using the charts and outlines.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li><u>Paraphrase individual sentences in a passage, and then progress to paraphrasing an entire paragraph.</u> The ability to paraphrase is also important for the integrated tasks in the Writing and Speaking sections of the test.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
