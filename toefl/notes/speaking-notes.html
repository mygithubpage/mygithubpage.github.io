      <h2><b>Speaking</b></h2>

      <p>In the Speaking section you will be asked to speak on a variety of topics that <b>draw on personal experience(1, 2)</b>, <b>campus-based situations(3, 4)</b>, and <b>academic-type content material(5, 6)</b>.</p>
      <p>Although scoring criteria vary somewhat depending on the question, the raters will generally be listening for the following features in your answer:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Delivery</b>: How clear your speech is. Good responses are those in which the speech is fluid and clear, with good pronunciation, natural pacing, and natural-sounding intonation patterns.</li>
        <li><b>Language Use</b>: How effectively you use grammar and vocabulary to convey your ideas. Raters will be listening for how well you can control both basic and more complex language structures and use appropriate vocabulary.</li>
        <li><b>Topic Development</b>: How fully you answer the question and how coherently you present your ideas. Good responses generally use all or most of the time allotted, and the relationship between ideas and the progression from one idea to the next is clear and easy to follow.</li>
      </ul>

          <h5>Question 1</h5>
          <p>For this task, you will be asked to speak about a <u>person</u>, <u>place</u>, <u>object</u>, or <u>event</u> that is familiar to you. You might, for example, be asked about <b>a place you like to visit</b>, <b>an important event in your life</b>, <b>a person who influenced you</b>, or <b>an activity that you enjoy</b>.</p> 
          <p>This question will always ask you both to <b><i>describe</i></b> something and to <b><i>give reasons</i></b> to explain <b>why the event was important</b>, <b>why the activity is one of your favorites</b>, <b>how the person influenced you</b>, etc. Your response should include specific details and/or examples because they will make your description informative and your reasons comprehensible.</p>

        <section class="w3-section">
          <h5>Question 3</h5>
          <p>The general areas from which these topics are typically drawn include <u>university policies, rules, or procedures</u>; <u>university plans</u>; <u>campus facilities</u>; and <u>quality of life on campus</u>.</p> 
          <p>The reading passage could take various forms. For example, it could be <u>a bulletin from the administration</u> of a university regarding a new parking rule, or <u>a letter to the editor of a campus newspaper responding to a new university policy</u> restricting the use of radios in dormitory rooms, or <u>an article from the campus newspaper</u> discussing a proposal to build a new football stadium. </p>
          <p>Therefore as you read the reading passage, you should pay attention to a number of things: <b>the description of the proposal</b>, and the <b>reasons that are given</b> for the proposal. </p>
        </section>
        
        <section class="w3-section">
          <h5>Question 4</h5>
          <p>The reading passage will usually treat the topic in somewhat general and <b>abstract terms</b>, and the lecture will treat the topic more specifically and concretely, often by providing an <b>extended example</b>, counterexample, or <b>application of the concept</b> presented in the reading.</p>

        <section class="w3-section">
          <h5>Question 5</h5>
          <p>Typically, the speakers in the conversation will be <u>students</u>, or <u>a student and a professor</u>, or <u>a student and a university staff member</u> (for example, a teaching assistant, librarian, or administrator). The problems may involve such issues as <u>scheduling conflicts</u>, <u>unavoidable absences</u>, <u>unavailable resources</u>, <u>student elections</u>, <u>financial difficulties</u>, and so forth. </p>

        <section class="w3-section">
          <h5>Question 6</h5>
          <p>The lectures can be about processes, methods, theories, ideas, or phenomena of any typeâ€”natural, social, psychological, and others. If a lecture is about a <u>process</u>, the professor might explain the process by describing some of its <b>functions</b>. In a lecture about a <u>theory</u>, the professor might explain the theory by describing its <b>applications</b>. In a lecture about a <u>phenomenon</u>, the professor might explain it through examples that illustrate its <b>causes</b> or its <b>effects</b>.</p>

        <h3>Core Concept: Speaking</h3>

        <section class="w3-section">
          <h4>PART 1: STATING YOUR PURPOSE</h4>

          <p>For speaking tasks that ask you to present your opinion or to describe something personal to you, use the following introductory phrases(<u>subjective phrases</u>): <span class="phrases"><b>I believe, I think, I feel, My view is, My opinion is, My preference is.</b></span></p>


          <p>For speaking tasks that require you to summarize someone else's opinion or to explain facts, the following introductions are appropriate(<u>objective phrases</u>): <span class="phrases">This person <b>believes</b> that, This person <b>holds</b> that, This person <b>argues</b> that, This person's <b>view</b> is that, This person's <b>point</b> is that, The lecture <b>stated</b>, The reading stated, The reading <b>presented</b>, The lecture <b>offered</b></span>.</p>

          <p>The three points you need to convey in your introduction are</p>
          <ol>
            <li><b>Purpose</b>: Your task.</li>
            <li><b>Thesis</b>: Your topic. The thesis is basically a statement of your position or belief on a topic or your main idea. It will be slightly different based on what you are trying to accomplish in your spoken response.</li>
            <li><b>Why</b>: After introducing the topic, state why you are discussing it. The
              answer to this why question should relate back to the purpose.</li>
          </ol>

        </section>

        <section class="w3-section">
          <h4>PART 2: ORGANIZING YOUR IDEAS</h4>

          <p>A good body paragraph contains the following elements: A <b>topic sentence</b> that introduces the main point of the paragraph. <b>Examples, facts, and evidence</b> that help the author achieve his or her purpose.</p>

          <p><b>Step 1: Provide a Topic Sentence</b></p>
          <p>A good topic sentence does two things: It <u>provides a transition between ideas</u> and <u>clearly states that main idea</u> of the paragraph. A good topic sentence is one that indicates a <b>progression</b> of ideas by using the phrase: <span class="phrases"><b>One reason, Another reason, Additionally, Third, First, Moreover, Second, Furthermore</b></span>.</p>

          <p><b>Step 2: Make Your Case with Examples</b></p> 
          <p>Your examples should be: <b>Specific</b>: They should not be vague or too general. <b>Explained</b>: Make sure you give details to support your examples.</p>

          <p>Use the following <b>template</b> to articulate your examples:</p>    
          <ol>
            <li>Statement 1: State your example and tie it back to your thesis.</li>
            <li>Statement 2: Give one reason why your example is relevant to your thesis.</li>
            <li>Statement 3: Add detail to reason #1.</li>
            <li>Statement 4: Give another reason why your example is relevant to your thesis.</li>
            <li>Statement 5: Add detail to reason #2.</li>
            <li>Statement 6 (optional): Provide a summary of your reasons and relate them to your thesis. </li>
          </ol> 

          <p>Make sure your examples and your structure are organized. Remember to do the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>State the example.
            <li>Explain how the example supports your position.</li>
            <li>Transitions: Provide a topic sentence or transition statement to move from one example to the next.</li>
            <li>Details: Support each example with details.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>PART 3: WRAPPING THINGS UP: THE CONCLUSION</h4>
          <p>A conclusion has to do one thing and one thing only. Restate your thesis.</p>
          <p>Here are some good words and phrases to use for your final paragraph: <span class="phrases"><b>And so, Ultimately, In conclusion, As I've stated, Finally, Clearly, As this essay has demonstrated, Thus, To sum up</b></span>. </p>

              <p>After briefly describing the teacher in whatever way is useful, you could then proceed to explain <u>what it was about the teacher that made you admire him or her</u>. Perhaps it was <b>something specific that he or she did</b>. If so, you should <u>describe what the teacher did and provide details that illustrate why the action was admirable</u>. Maybe the teacher <b>displayed a special personal quality or had a special character trait</b>.

            <p>In this second Independent Speaking Task, you will be presented with <u>two</u> possible <b>actions, situations, or opinions</b>. Then you will be asked to say <b>which of the actions or situations you think is preferable</b> or <b>which opinion you think is more justified</b> and then explain your choice by providing reasons and details.

              <p>In answering a question like this one, it is important that you begin by clearly stating what your opinion is. As for the reasons you give in support of your opinion, they can vary widely and may be based on your own experience and observations.</p>
              <p>For example, if the position you take is that it is better for students to <b>study alone</b>, you might say that <u>when students meet to study in groups, they often waste time discussing matters that have nothing to do with their class work</u>. You might continue this explanation by <b>contrasting the inefficiency of studying in a group with the kind of productivity a student can achieve when studying alone</b>.</p>
              <p>Or perhaps you want to take the opposite position, that it is better for students to <b>study in groups</b>. In that case, you would explain the <u>advantages of group study and the disadvantages of studying alone</u>. Perhaps you think that <u>the more capable students can help the less capable students when students study together</u>. Or perhaps you have found that <u>students who study in groups often share each others' lecture notes, and this way they can make sure everyone understands all the material that has been covered in a course</u>.</p>
