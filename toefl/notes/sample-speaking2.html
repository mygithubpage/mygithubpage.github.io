          <p>I actually only spend time with my friends in restaurants and cafes almost never at home because of my apartment is very small and there is just almost nothing to do arm on the outside and them interface and restaurants it's much more of a more people the atmosphere is usually good and maybe there are some music playing or we usually meet to discuss things and meet other people and meet people we do not know possibly there's always a chance to get to know someone it is always exciting for me this much more exciting than just staying at home armed and in the in the environment that I know what I'm familiar with I think it's boring.</p>

        <div>This response meets the criteria at score level 4. This response is sustained, coherent, and well developed. The speaker states his preference for caffes and begins his explanation by saying why he doesn't meet his friends at home: his apartment is too small and there is almost nothing to do there. He then explains why caffes are better for him: the atmosphere is good, often there is music, and he can meet people there often, people he does not know. At the end of his response, the speaker goes back to talking about his apartment, and when he does so, he does not just repeat what he has already said but instead elaborates on it. The language he uses is direct and simple, and he chooses his words accurately. The flow of speech is very good, and the speaker is very easy to understand.</div>
