          <p>Listen to a conversation between a student and her basketball coach.</p>
          <p>Hi, Elizabeth.</p>
          <p> Hey, Coach. I just thought I'd stop by to see what I missed while I was gone.</p>
          <p>Well, we've been working real hard on our plan for the next game - I've asked Susan to go over it with you before practice this afternoon, so you'll know what we're doing.</p>
          <p>Okay.</p>
          <p>By the way, how did your brother's wedding go?</p>
          <p>Oh, it was beautiful. And the whole family was there. I saw aunts and uncles and cousins I hadn't seen in years.</p>
          <p>So it was worth the trip.</p>
          <p>Oh definitely. //I'm sorry I had to miss practice, though. I feel bad about that.</p>
          <p>/ [meaning: "<stressed_text_2>it's okay</stressed_text_2>"] Family's very important./ //</p>
          <p>Yep. [<stressed_text_2>leaving</stressed_text_2>] Okay, I guess I'll see you this afternoon at practice, then.</p>
          <p>Just a minute. There are a couple of other things I need to tell you.</p>
          <p>Oh, okay.</p>
          <p>Uh - First, everybody's getting a new team jacket.</p>
          <p>Wow. How did that happen?</p>
          <p>A woman who played here about 20, 25 years ago came through town a few weeks ago and saw a game, and said she wanted to do something for the team, so -</p>
          <p>So she's buying us new jackets?</p>
          <p>Yep.</p>
          <p>Wow, that's really nice of her.</p>
          <p>Yes, it is. It's great that former players still care so much about our school and our basketball program... Anyway you need to fill out an order form. I'll give it to you now, and you can bring it back this afternoon. I've got the forms from the other players, so as soon as I get yours we can order. Maybe we'll have the jackets by the next game.</p>
          <p>OK.</p>
          <p>Great. And the next thing is, you know Mary's transferring to another college next week, so we'll need someone to take over her role as captain for the second half of the season. And the other players unanimously picked you to take over as captain when Mary leaves.</p>
          <p>[<stressed_text_2>surprised</stressed_text_2>] Wow. I saw everybody this morning, and nobody said a word.</p>
          <p>They wanted me to tell you. So, do you accept?</p>
          <p>Of course! But Susan's a much better player than I am. I'm really surprised they didn't pick her.</p>
          <p>They think you're the right one. You'll have to ask them their thoughts.</p>
          <p>Okay - I guess one of the first things I'll have to do as captain is make sure we get a thank–you card out to the lady who's buying us the jackets.</p>
          <p>Good idea. I have her address here somewhere.</p>
          <p>And I'll make sure the whole team signs it.</p>
          <p>//Good. That's all the news there is. I think that's it for now.// Oh, let me get you that order form.</p>
