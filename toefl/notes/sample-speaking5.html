          <p>  (Female student) How's the calculus class going? You're doing better?</p>
          <p>(Male student) Not really. I just can't get the hang of it. There're so many functions and formulas to memorize, you know? And the final . . . It's only a few weeks away. I'm really worried about doing well.</p>
          <p>(Female student) Oh . . . You know, you should go to the tutoring program and ask for help.</p>
          <p>(Male student) You mean, in the Mathematics building?</p>
          <p>(Female student) Ya. Get a tutor there. Most tutors are doctoral students in the math program. They know what they're talking about, and for the final test, you know, they'd tell you what to study, how to prepare, all of that.</p>
          <p>(Male student) I know about that program . . . but doesn't it cost money?</p>
          <p>(Female student) Of course. You have to register and pay by the hour . . . But they've got all the answers.</p>
          <p>(Male student) Hmm . . .</p>
          <p>(Female student) Another option, I guess, is to form a study group with other students. That won't cost you any money.</p>
          <p>(Male student) That's a thought . . . although once I was in a study group, and it was a big waste of time. We usually ended up talking about other stuff like what we did over the weekend.</p>
          <p>(Female student) But that was for a different class, right? I've actually had some pretty good experiences with study groups. Usually students in the same class have different strengths and weaknesses with the material . . . if they're serious about studying, they can really help each other out. Think about it.</p>

          <p>The math problems that he takes a calculus class that. He does not do well in the calculus says he's worried about the final. There are 2 possible solutions and the first chance he got the job training program and the second solution is to form a steady grip. I think that the second solution is better than the first for several reasons first reason is that study group that's not. Need money but still get help. Also. I get into this study group take the same class so they can explain each other what the lectures that about. On finally if students concentric under 30 group of they can improve their grades at final exams because they can talk about. The class contests.</p>

        <div>This response meets the criteria at score level 3. The speaker states the man’s problem and efficiently summarizes the two proposed solutions. She recommends one of the solutions—forming a study group—and adequately explains the reasons for her preference in terms of the advantages of study groups: namely, that they are free and also helpful, since students in the group can talk about the content of the class among themselves and explain the lecture material to each other. What mainly prevents this response from being scored at the highest level is the speaker’s imprecise use of language. For instance, the idea expressed in a sentence like “Study group does not need money but still get help” could be formulated much more accurately and effectively. The speaker could have said, for example, “A study group can be helpful, and students don’t need money to form one,” or “Students can get help from a study group without spending money.” Nevertheless, in spite of inefficiencies like this in the speaker’s use of language, she is generally easy to understand and communicates relevant information in a reasonably clear and coherent way.</div>
