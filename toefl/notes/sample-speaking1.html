          <p>Most pleasant and memorable events I had in school was the party my friends gave me when I left my last school when I was in middle school. It is very memorable for me for 2 reasons. The first reason is because, they were my best friends and I still think of them as the most special friends I've ever had. There were my friends and teachers there to say farewell. Secondly they gave me many cards and many presents this was the first time I ever had farewell party with such presents. those are the 2 reasons why that event was the most memorable one to me.</p>

        <div>This response meets the criteria at score level 3. In this response, the speech is very clear and easy to understand. The speaker begins by naming the memorable event she will talk about: a farewell party that was given for her when she left middle school. She provides a simple but good explanation for why this was a memorable event, using simple but accurate vocabulary. This response might have received a higher score <b> if the explanation had been developed further</b> and <b>with greater specificity and clearer connections between the ideas</b>. In spite of those limitations, the response addresses the task appropriately by talking about an event and communicating two memorable aspects of it in a sustained, relevant, coherent, and intelligible way.</div>
