              <td>The response demonstrates limited range and control of grammar and vocabulary. These limitations often prevent full expression of ideas. For the most part, only basic sentence structures are used successfully and spoken with fluidity. Structures and vocabulary may express mainly simple (short) and/or general propositions, with simple or unclear connections made among them (serial listing, conjunction, juxtaposition).</td>

              <td>Range and control of grammar and vocabulary severely limit (or prevent) expression of ideas and connections among ideas. Some low level responses may rely heavily on practiced or formulaic expressions.</td>

It is incomplete if it omits key ideas, makes vague reference to key ideas, or demonstrates limited development of important information.

          <li>A response at level <b>5</b> successfully selects the important information from the lecture and coherently and accurately presents this information in relation to the relevant information presented in the reading. The response is well organized, and occasional language errors that are present do not result in inaccurate or imprecise presentation of content or connections.</li>
          
          <li>A response at level <b>4</b> is generally good in selecting the important information from the lecture and in coherently and accurately presenting this information in relation to the relevant information in the reading, but it may have minor omission, inaccuracy, vagueness, or imprecision of some content from the lecture or in connection to points made in the reading. A response is also scored at this level if it has more frequent or noticeable minor language errors, as long as such usage and grammatical structures do not result in anything more than an occasional lapse of clarity or in the connection of ideas.</li>
          
          <li>
            <p>A response at level <b>3</b> contains some important information from the lecture and conveys some relevant connection to the reading, but it is marked by one or more of the following:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Although the overall response is definitely oriented to the task, it conveys only vague, global, unclear, or somewhat imprecise connection of the points made in the lecture to points made in the reading.</li>
              <li>The response may omit one major key point made in the lecture.</li>
              <li>Some key points made in the lecture or the reading, or connections between the two, may be incomplete, inaccurate, or imprecise.</li>
              <li>Errors of usage and/or grammar may be more frequent or may result in noticeably vague expressions or obscured meanings in conveying ideas and connections.</li>

            <p>A response at level <b>2</b> contains some relevant information from the lecture, but is marked by significant language difficulties or by significant omission or inaccuracy of important ideas from the lecture or in the connections between the lecture and the reading; a response at this level is marked by one or more of the following:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The response significantly misrepresents or completely omits the overall connection between the lecture and the reading.</li>
              <li>The response significantly omits or significantly misrepresents important points made in the lecture.</li>
              <li>The response contains language errors or expressions that largely obscure connections or meaning at key junctures, or that would likely obscure understanding of key ideas for a reader not already familiar with the reading and the lecture.</li>

              <li>The response provides little or no meaningful or relevant coherent content from the lecture.</li>
              <li>The language level of the response is so low that it is difficult to derive meaning.</li>
