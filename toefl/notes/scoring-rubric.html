              <td>The response demonstrates limited range and control of grammar and vocabulary. These limitations often prevent full expression of ideas. For the most part, only basic sentence structures are used successfully and spoken with fluidity.

              <td>Range and control of grammar and vocabulary severely limit (or prevent) expression of ideas and connections among ideas. Some low level responses may rely heavily on practiced or formulaic expressions.</td>

It is incomplete if it omits key ideas, makes vague reference to key ideas, or demonstrates limited development of important information.

The response is well organized, and occasional language errors that are present do not result in inaccurate or imprecise presentation of content or connections.</li>
          
          <li>A response at level <b>4</b> is generally good in selecting the important information from the lecture and in coherently and accurately presenting this information in relation to the relevant information in the reading, but it may have minor omission, inaccuracy, vagueness, or imprecision of some content from the lecture or in connection to points made in the reading. A response is also scored at this level if it has more frequent or noticeable minor language errors, as long as such usage and grammatical structures do not result in anything more than an occasional lapse of clarity or in the connection of ideas.</li>
