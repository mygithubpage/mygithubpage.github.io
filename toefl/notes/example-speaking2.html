          <p>I actually only spend time with my friends in restaurants and cafes almost never at home because of my apartment is very small and there is just almost nothing to do arm on the outside and them interface and restaurants it's much more of a more people the atmosphere is usually good and maybe there are some music playing or we usually meet to discuss things and meet other people and meet people we do not know possibly there's always a chance to get to know someone it is always exciting for me this much more exciting than just staying at home armed and in the in the environment that I know what I'm familiar with I think it's boring.</p>

        <div>This is a mid-level response. The speaker has good pronunciation but speaks at a very slow and awkward pace. He pauses often, perhaps to think about what to say. He has a fairly good command of grammar and vocabulary and is able to express ideas fairly easily. He does provide some relevant information but in general, the topic is not sufficiently well developed to score at the highest level. In general, the slow, choppy pace affects his overall fluency and his ability to communicate sufficient information in the time allotted.</div>
