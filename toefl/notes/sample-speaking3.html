            <b>Good News for Movie Fans</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
    The Student Association has just purchased a new sound system for the Old Lincoln Hall auditorium, the place where movies on campus are currently shown. By installing the new sound system, the Student Association hopes to attract more students to the movies and increase ticket sales. Before making the purchase of the new equipment, the Student Association conducted a survey on campus to see what kind of entertainment students liked best. Going to the movies ranked number one. "Students at Northfield College love going to the movies," said the president of the Student Association "so we decided to make what they already love even better. We're confident that the investment into the sound system will translate into increased ticket sales."

          <p>  (Male student) I really think the Student Association made a bad decision.</p>
          <p>(Female student) Really? Why? Don't you like going to the movies?</p>
          <p>(Male student) Sure I do. But this new purchase is just a waste of money.</p>
          <p>(Female student) What do you mean? It's supposed to sound really good.</p>
          <p>(Male student) Yeah, well, I'm sure it does, but, in Old Lincoln Hall? I mean that</p>
          <p>building must be 200 years old! It used to be the college gym! The acoustics are terrible.</p>
          <p>(Female student) So you're saying there'll be no improvement?</p>
          <p>(Male student) That's right. And also, I seriously doubt that going to the movies is the</p>
          <p>number one social activity for most students.</p>
          <p>(Female student) Yeah, but that's what students said.</p>
          <p>(Male student) Well, of course that's what they said. What else is there to do on campus?</p>
          <p>(Female student) What do you mean?</p>
          <p>(Male student) I mean, there isn't much to do on campus besides go to the movies. If there were other forms of, uh recreation, or other social activities, you know, I don't think most students would have said that going to the movies was their first choice.</p>

          <p>This is not a good idea that the colleges decided to purchase the new sound system for idiots taller Atari and of because he thing although he likes movies. He thinks the decision if that's the way the money because the old link a hole through old. That. There will be not much improvement even though the new sound system will be installed. In addition he had some doubts about what they're going to the movies is disputed favorite activity he thinks if they are many students have a theory that going to the movies is their favorite activity simply because there is not much activity they can do within the campus. Those he thinks there that. There might be a better alternative to the colleges decision.</p>

        <div>This response meets the criteria at score level 4. The clarity of this high-level response is not affected by the speaker’s occasional hesitations and minor difficulties in pronunciation. Her speech is very easy to understand, the response is coherent and fully developed, and the details she provides are appropriate and relevant. She begins by stating the man’s opinion: he is opposed to the decision to purchase a new sound system for the auditorium. Then, in her own words, she accurately explains his two reasons: first, he feels the auditorium is so old that the new sound system won’t result in an improvement, and second, he thinks that the survey results are questionable because the students may have answered as they did only because for students there are not many activities on campus other than going to the movies. </div>
