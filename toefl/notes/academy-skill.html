        <p>The headings and subheadings in textbooks help you anticipate the purpose of the chapter or the sections within a chapter. For example, a heading includes only one noun will probably be a definition or a description of the atmosphere. A heading has plural noun implies that several points will be discussed and further implies that this will be a classification or perhaps a comparison and contrast. Verb in noun form introduces a process and could anticipate a sequence or even a cause and effect. Problems in Predicting Weather is a heading that contains the purpose in the word problems. You know that this is a problem and solution section. Persuasion can usually be identified because of words like should and must as well as subjective or judgmental phrases like better or worse, whereas evaluation contains both sides of an issue.</p>

        <p>Some professors will use verbal pauses, for example, uh and um, as well as words like now, so, okay, well. Other professors will use repetition or restatement as a way to gather their thoughts or to clarify a previous point. In repetition, the professor will use the same words or phrases several times. In restatement, the professor will say the same thing in a slightly different way. <u>Since repetition and restatement do not add to the meaning, you can ignore them</u>.</p>

        <p>Signals in conversations In a conversation, there are several signals, or markers, you can listen for that indicate important ideas. These include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>One speaker asking the other speaker for an explanation</li>
          <li>One speaker agreeing with a point made by the other speaker</li>
          <li>One speaker adding details to a point made by the other speaker</li>
          <li>One speaker disagreeing with a point made by the other speaker</li>
          <li>One speaker presenting information that conflicts with a point made by the other speaker</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You will also need to listen for a speaker's attitude and degree of certainty - the use of intonation and stress patterns. </p>

        <p>In a lecture, there are several ways in which a speaker can indicate an important point. These include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Saying it slower and louder, sometimes with a pause or repeating it</li>
          <li>Using signals words or transitions and connecting words.</li>
