            <b>Animal Domestication</b>
          </h4>
          <p>For thousands of years, humans have been able to domesticate, or tame, many large mammals that in the wild live together in herds. Once tamed, these mammals are used for agricultural work and transportation. Yet some herd mammals are not easily domesticated.</p>

          <p>So we've been discussing the suitability of animals for domestication . . . particularly animals that live together in herds. Now, if we take horses, for example . . . in the wild, horses live in herds that consist of one male and several females and their young. When a herd moves, the dominant male leads, with the dominant female and her young immediately behind him. The dominant female and her young are then followed immediately by the second most important female and her young, and so on. This is why domesticated horses can be harnessed one after the other in a row.</p>
          <p>They're “programmed” to follow the lead of another horse. On top of that, you often find different herds of horses in the wild occupying overlapping areas-they don't fight off other herds that enter the same territory. </p>
          <p>But it's exactly the opposite with an animal like the uh, the antelope . . . which . . . well, antelopes are herd animals too. But unlike horses, a male antelope will fight fiercely to prevent another male from entering its territory during the breeding season, OK-very different from the behavior of horses. Try keeping a couple of male antelopes together in a small space and see what happens. Also, antelopes don't have a social hierarchy-they don't instinctively follow any leader. That makes it harder for humans to control their behavior. </p>

          <p>Herd animals can be easily domesticated if they have a hierarchical social structure and are not territorial, and that this is why it is easier to domesticate horses than antelopes. Their hierarchical social structure makes them willing to follow one another and thus allows a human being to act as their leader. Because horses are not territorial, they can be harnessed together without fighting.  Horses’ behavior with that of antelopes, which are territorial. Male antelopes fight if they are together, and that because antelopes do not have a social hierarchy, humans can’t control them by acting as their leader.</p>

        <div>This is a low-level response. Pronunciation is a particular problem for the speaker. Several key words and phrases are unclear. This requires considerable listener effort and, at times, causes some confusion about meaning. The speaker is very slow getting started and he makes numerous false starts. Eventually, he is able to talk about some of the key information from the reading and listening material but he struggles to convey the information correctly.</div>
