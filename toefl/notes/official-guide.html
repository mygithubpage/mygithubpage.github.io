      <h3><b>Writing</b></h3>

      <h4><b>Integrated Writing</b></h4>
      <h5><b>As you read:</b></h5>
      <ul>
        <li>The main idea often has to do with some <b>policy</b> or <b>practice</b> or some <b>position</b> on an issue. Or it may have to do with <b>proposing</b> some overall <b>hypothesis</b> about the way some <b>process</b> or <b>procedure</b> works.</li>
        <li>See how this main idea is <b>evaluated</b> or <b>developed</b>: <b>Arguments</b> or <b>explanations</b> are presented that support/doubt the main position. Policy or practice will (not) be <b>beneficial</b> or <b>prove useful</b> or <b>advisable</b>.</li>
      </ul>

      <h5><b>As you listen:</b></h5>
      <p>Listen for <b>information</b>, <b>examples</b>, or <b>explanations</b> that make points in the reading passage seem <b>wrong</b> or <b>less convincing</b> or even <b>untrue</b></p>

      <h5><b>As you write your response:</b></h5>
      <p>Your response should contain the following:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The <b>specific ideas</b>, <b>explanations</b>, and <b>arguments</b> in the lecture that <b>oppose</b> or <b>challenge</b> points in the reading.</li>
        <li><b>Coherent and accurate presentations of each point</b> that you make; that is, the language you use should make sense and should accurately reflect the ideas presented in the lecture and the reading.</li>
        <li><b>A clear, coherent structure</b> that enables the reader to understand what points in the lecture relate to what points in the reading.</li>
      </ol>

      <ul>
        <li>The <b>main point is in the end or middle of the first parargrah</b>, rarely in the beginning of it.</li>
        <li><b>Sub point is the first or last sentence</b> of the supporting paragraph.</li>
        <li><b>Using Reading passage sub point details to focus</b> on the listening passage.</li>
        <li>Try to write down as many <b>detail keywords in the listening passage</b> as possible.</li>
        <li>Noticed the <b>Proper Nouns</b> in the Reading Passage.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4><b>Independent Writing</b></h4>
      <p><b>Development</b> is the amount and kinds of support (<b>details</b>, <b>examples</b>, <b>reasons</b>) for your ideas that you present in your essay.  The raters will judge whether you have addressed the topic and how well your <b>details</b>, <b>examples</b>, <b>reasons</b> support your ideas.</p>
      <p><b>Organization</b> is something that raters notice-when you fail to organize. Writing in paragraphs and <b>marking transitions from one idea to another in various ways</b> usually helps the reader to follow your ideas. But be aware that just using transition words such as first or second does not guarantee that your essay is organized. The <b>points you make must all relate to the topic</b> of the essay and to the main idea you are presenting in response.  To earn a top score, you need to <b>avoid <del>redundancy</del></b> (repetition of ideas), <b><del>digression</del></b> (points that are not related to your main point, that take away from the “unity” of your ideas), and <b><del>unclear connections</del></b> (places where it is hard for the reader to understand how two ideas or parts of your writing are related).</p>
      <p><b>Language</b> use is the third criterion on which your essay will be judged. There should be <b>a variety of sentence structures</b>, and <b>word choice should be appropriate</b>. If your essay includes a few minor lexical or grammar errors, you can still get a high score.</p>
