          <h4>CRACKING THE LISTENING SECTION: BASIC APPROACH</h4>

          <section class="w3-section" id="main-idea">
            <h5>Basic Principle #1: Find the Main Idea or Purpose</h5>
            <p><b>Lectures</b> are designed around a <b>main idea</b>, whereas <b>conversations</b> are centered on a <b>purpose</b>.</p>
  
            <p>In <b>lectures</b>, the speaker will typically introduce the main idea at the very beginning of the talk. Listen for phrases similar to the following: </p>
            <p><b>Main Topic Introduction Phrases</b></p>
            <p><span class="topic-phrases"><b>talk about</b></span>, <span class="topic-phrases"><b>look at</b></span>, phrases indicate present: <span class="topic-phrases"><b>today</b></span>, <span class="topic-phrases"><b>tonight</b></span>, <span class="topic-phrases"><b>now</b></span>;</p>
  
            <p>In a <b>conversation</b>, the beginning sentences will reveal the speaker's purpose. Listen for the purpose to appear after an initial greeting</p>
  
            <p><b>Main Topic Introduction Phrases</b></p>
            <p><span class="topic-phrases"><b>can I do for you</b></span>, <span class="topic-phrases"><b>can I help you</b></span></p>
  
          </section>
    
          <section class="w3-section">
            <h5>Basic Principle #2: Focus on the Structure</h5>
  
            <p><b>Types of Lecture Structures</b></p>
            <ol>
              <li><p><b>Compare/Contrast</b>: This type of lecture involves <u>finding similarities and differences between two or more things</u>. Listen for the speaker to introduce this <u>framework</u> by using one of the following phrases: "<b>several theories</b>" "<b>possible explanations</b>" "<b>many different views</b>". After the framework is introduced, the speaker will list each item to be discussed and mention its characteristics. Listen for words that indicate <u>compare/contrast</u>, such as: "<b>In contrast</b>" "<b>on the other hand</b>" "<b>similarly</b>" "<b>however</b>" "<b>additionally</b>" "<b>also</b>"</p></li>
              
              <li><p><b>Cause-and-Effect</b>: Some lectures attempt to explain why a certain situation occurs. Listen for the speaker to introduce this type of <u>framework</u> with the following phrases: "<b>Why would this happen?</b>" "<b>What is the reason for this?</b>" "<b>How could this happen?</b>" "<b>What leads to this?</b>". A speaker will often use the following phrases to introduce the <u>cause</u> x: "<b>x causes y</b>", "<b>x results in y</b>", "<b>x produces y</b>", "<b>x leads toy</b>", "<b>x brings about y</b>", "<b>x is responsible for y</b>". After identifying the cause, look for the speaker to detail the <u>effects</u> y with a phrase similar to the following: "<b>y is caused by x</b>", "<b>y results from x</b>", "<b>y is due to x</b>", "<b>y can be blamed on x</b>", "<b>y is attributable to x</b>", "<b>y happens because of x</b>".</p></li>
              
              <li><p><b>Abstract Category/Specific Examples</b>: Another common lecture structure involves moving from an abstract category to a specific example. A lecture may also sometimes begin with specific examples and end with a more general interpretation of the examples. A speaker may introduce an <u>abstract concept</u> with one of the following phrases: "<b>one approach ... </b>" "<b>one theory ... </b>" "<b>the idea is ... </b>" "<b>the concept ... </b>" "<b>the basic premise is ... </b>". Next, the speaker will move to the <u>examples</u>, typically using the following: "<b>for example ... </b>" "<b>one instance of this is ... </b>" "<b>consider ... </b>" "<b>we see this in/with ... </b>" "<b>this is illustrated by/with ... </b>".</p></li>
              
              <li><b>Sequences</b>: A lecture may present a series of steps or stages. Listen for the lecturer to mention the following <u>clues</u>: "<b>process</b>" "<b>development</b>" "<b>stages</b>" "<b>transition</b>". The <u>steps</u> or parts will typically be introduced with clear transitions, such as: "<b>first ... second ... third ... </b>" "<b>next. .. </b>" "<b>then ... </b>" "<b>initially ... </b>" "<b>finally ... </b>".</li>
            </ol>
  
            <p><b>Types of Conversation Structures</b></p>
            <ol>
              <li><p><b>Problem/Solution</b>: <u>One student has a problem, and another student offers advice or a possible solution</u>. Listen for the first student to introduce the <u>problem</u> by mentioning one of the following: "<b>problem</b>"  "<b>issue</b>"  "<b>difficulty</b>"  "<b>trouble</b>". After describing the problem, the other person will offer some sore of advice or <u>solution</u>. Listen for the following phrases: "<b>why don't you ... </b>" "<b>if I were you, I'd ... </b>" "<b>maybe you should ... </b>" "<b>have you tried/thought of..</b>"</p></li>
              
              <li><p><b>Service Encounter</b>: In this encounter, a student will <u>discuss a problem with a professional</u>-usually a <b>professor</b>, a librarian, or an <b>office worker</b>. The service professional will usually explain exactly what the student needs to do to solve the problem. The solution may involve several parts. Listen for the following words to indicate the <u>steps</u> the student muse cake: "<b>requirement</b>" "<b>application</b>" "<b>form</b>" "<b>recommendation</b>" "<b>prohibited</b>".</p></li>
              
              <li><p><b>Significant Event</b>: This could be <u>a meeting, an announcement, or a social event</u>. Usually, the first speaker will introduce the <u>event</u> with one of the following phrases: "<b>have you heard about ... </b>" "<b>did you see ... </b>" "<b>let you know about ... </b>" "<b>program/event/opportunity/chance</b>". After noting the event, listen to any details about it. Also note what the speaker's plans are concerning the event. Listen for the following key words: "<b>participate</b>" "<b>plans</b>" "<b>open co</b>" "<b>free" or "busy</b>".</p></li>
            </ol>
  
          </section>
        
          <section class="w3-section">
            <h5>Basic Principle #3: Listen for Tone and Attitude </h5>
            <p>The tone of most <b>lectures</b> is fairly straightforward. Because the speaker is teaching a class, the tone will usually be similar to one of the following types: </p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Objective</b>: The speaker is simply listing facts or providing information. The speaker is an authority on his or her subject and so will not be unsure or uncertain about the topic. This type of tone can appear in <b>any of the four</b> common lecture types.</li>
              <li><b>Subjective</b>: In some cases, the speaker will be presenting a position or making an argument. The speaker will try to convince the listeners about a certain view. This type of tone is more likely to appear in <b>compare/contrast and cause-and-effect</b> lectures.</li>
              <li><b>Inquisitive</b>: There are also classroom discussions on the TOEFL. During a discussion, the professor leads the class through a number of questions, so the tone is inquisitive. The professor considers and responds to the students' questions as the lecture progresses. <b>Abstract category/specific example</b> lectures typically involve discussion, although other lecture types may as well.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Conversations tend to have slightly more personal tones. You can expect the tone to be similar to one of the following types:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Excited</b>: This tone is typical of the <b>significant event</b> conversation. The speaker is interested in the event and may be trying to influence others about it.</li>
              <li><b>Disappointed/upset</b>: In this case, the speaker is not happy about the situation. He or she may express dissatisfaction with things or events. This usually occurs during the <b>problem/solution</b> encounter, although it can appear in other conversations too.</li>
              <li><b>Uncertain or confused</b>: Sometimes the speaker is uncertain or confused, especially in <b>service encounters</b>. The speaker will be unsure of what action to take or how to proceed.</li>
            </ul>
          </section>
  
          <section class="w3-section">
            <h5>Basic Principle #4: Pay Attention to Transitions</h5>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p><b>Reversal Transitions</b>: Often, speakers on the TOEFL will reverse the direction or logic of the conversation or lecture. Here are some phrases for which to listen. "<b>you know what?</b>" "<b>we'll come back to that in a moment</b>" "<b>actually, let's</b>" "<b>instead</b>" "<b>better yet</b>" "<b>I don't want to get into that now</b>"</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><b>Negation Transitions</b>: Also, speakers will sometimes use a positive word to indicate a negation. Look for phrases like the following, where the negation words are italicized: "<b>I don't have to explain that, right?</b>" "<b>You guys are okay with this, correct?</b>" "<b>We don't need to go into that now, okay?</b>" In each case, the speaker uses a positive word to express a negative statement. When used in this way, the positive words indicate that <u>the speaker assumes the listener knows what the speaker is talking about and no further discussion or explanation is needed</u>.</p>

        <h3 class="my-color w3-padding">Basic Strategies for the TOEFL iBT Listening Section</h3>
        <p>Here are some ways you can strengthen skills for the three listening purposes tested on the TOEFL iBT test.</p>
        <li>When listening to a lecture, pay attention to the new words or concepts introduced by the professor. These will often be tested.</li>
        <li>When listening to a lecture, pay attention to the way the lecture is organized and the way the ideas in the lecture are connected.</li>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <b>Listening for Basic Comprehension</b>
            <ul>
              <li>Increase your vocabulary knowledge, perhaps by using flashcards.</li>
              <li><u>Anticipate what the speaker is going to say</u> as a way to stay focused, and <u>adjust your predictions when you receive additional information</u>.</li>
              <li>Stay active by asking yourself questions (e.g., What main idea is the professor communicating?).</li>
              <li>Copy the words "main idea," "major points," and "important details" on different lines of paper. Listen carefully and write these things down while listening. Listen again until all important points and details are written down.</li>
              <li>Listen to a portion of a lecture or talk and write a brief summary of important points. Gradually increase the amount you listen to and summarize. Note: Summarizing skills are not tested in the Listening section, but they are useful for the integrated tasks in the Writing and Speaking sections.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>
            <b>Listening for Pragmatic Understanding</b>
            <ul>
              <li>Think about what each speaker hopes to accomplish; that is, what is the purpose of the speech or conversation? Is the speaker apologizing, complaining, making suggestions?</li>
              <li>Notice the way each speaker talks. Is the language formal or casual? How certain does each speaker sound? Is the speaker's voice calm or emotional? What does the speaker's tone of voice tell you?</li>
              <li>Notice the degree of certainty of the speaker. How sure is the speaker about the information? Does the speaker's tone of voice indicate something about his or her degree of certainty?</li>
              <li>Listen for <b>changes in topic or side comments</b> in which the speaker briefly moves away from the main topic and then returns (digressions).</li>
              <li>Watch television or movie comedies and pay attention to stress and intonation patterns used to convey meaning.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>
            <b>Listening to Connect Ideas</b>
            <ul>
              <li>Think about how the lecture is organized. Listen for the <b>signal words</b> that indicate the introduction, major steps or ideas, examples, and the conclusion or summary.</li>
              <li>Identify the relationships between ideas in the information being discussed. Possible relationships include: cause-and-effect, compare-and-contrast, steps in a process.</li>
              <li>Listen for words that show connections and relationships between ideas.</li>
              <li>When you listen to recorded material, stop the recording at various points and try to predict what information or idea will be expressed next.</li>
              <li>Create an outline of the information discussed while listening or after listening</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
