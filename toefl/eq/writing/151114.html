          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>In modern society, the stressful workloads make parents busy with their work and distract them from taking good care of their children. Under this circumstance, many parents turn to send their children either to child-care center where plenty of children are taken care of together. Meanwhile some parents would choose to send their children to an individual caregiver so that their children could receiver care. In my opinion, the child-care center would be a better choice.</p>
          <p>Admittedly, an individual caregiver might seem to be better. The main reason why some parents choose individual caregivers is that they would <b>give children more considerations due to less children there</b>. They might feed that children themselves, rather than let the children eat themselves. They might help the children with their homework when the children meet some hard questions. Also they could play games with children so that they could get a temporary escape from school work. However, if viewed from a different angle, these activities might raise children’s dependence on others, especially these caregivers. Once they are absent from the children, the children might feel uneasy about their meals, homework or even entertaining activities. To avoid the side effects, to send children to a child-care center would be more appropriate.</p>
          <p>To begin with, a child-care center could give children <b>more security</b>. In other words, the facility might be equipped with some specialized equipment to avoid children from being get hurt. For example, a child-care center in Zhongguancun changes all their dishes and plates into stainless steel. What makes them to make such a change is that if the glass breaks into pieces, they might cut children’s fingers or legs. Meanwhile, to protect the children from dangers, the center install some iron nets outside the window in case some children would fall down from the window. Most importantly, strangers are carefully checked if they want to get access to the center. The security would ask about the name, occupation and even address so that dangerous people would not get into the center to harm these children. As a result, children could happily and securely play in the center.</p>
          <p>In addition, a child-care center where hold many children might <b>cultivate children’s ability to get along with others</b>. That is to say, <b>giving children an environment to play with others allow children to communicate with each other</b>. According to a survey conducted by behaviorists from Stanford, after polling hundreds of primary students who are kept in child-care center after school, a significant percentage of them appear to be emphathic. After a long observation, the scientists find out that during their stay in the child-care center, they are given quite a lot of space to play with each other. When one feels upset, others might give him he comforts either by giving him his favorite fruits or giving him encouragement to get rid of the negative emotions, both of which can make the children understandable when dealing with others. In this case, the center plays a great role in helping the children getting along with others.</p>
          <p>To sum up, although children who are taken to individual caregivers might receive more considerations, this would not be safe. On the contrary, a child-care center would be a better candidate because it could offer children more security and even the environment to make friends with other peers.</p>
