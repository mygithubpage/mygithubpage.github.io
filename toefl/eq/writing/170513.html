          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>Childhood is the golden age of people’s lives because it is a time of physical growth and great leaps forward intellectually and socially. Being helpful, honest and well organized are values that parents and educators try to instill in children from a very young age, <b>but I would argue that among these</b> values, honesty <b>would be the most important one to</b> share with a young child.</p>
          <p>First and foremost, honesty is the cardinal principle of conducting oneself. Imparting honesty into children can hold them accountable for their behavior and teach them how to distinguish right from wrong from a young age. Unlike adults, children are normally unaware of the consequence of telling lies, and teaching them the value of honesty can help them realize how to act with integrity and confidence. For example, <b>children who are conscious of being honest are more likely to contribute positively to the whole society in the future</b> and will never defraud their clients and customers in workplace. In contrast, <b>students who are dishonest may plagiarize other people’s thesis and fail to achieve success even though they perform well at school</b>.</p>
          <p>Besides, <b>being honest can help us win the trust and respect from others</b>, even from those who are unfamiliar with us. It is widely known that childhood is an important period for children to learn lifelong social and emotional skills they need. <b>Therefore, making them capable of being honest helps children learn how to behave in a more socially acceptable way</b>. Just imagine, <b>an honest child always gets along well with everyone at school</b>,<b> with a bunch of good friends around him</b>. <b>When he grows up, people are more willing to collaborate with him as well as to give him a hand when he gets into troubles</b>. On the contrary, <b>a dishonest child will be looked down upon by others and be regarded as a public enemy</b>.</p>
          <p>Undeniably, being helpful and well organized <b>are both important qualities, which do benefit children in their own way</b>. The young generation can learn responsibility and find enjoyment in helping others. <b>But the fact is</b>, 5 to 10-year-old children are too young to be able to take care of themselves, <b>not to speak of giving a hand to other people</b>. As for the organizational skill, it just makes little sense since kids of that age are naturally active and naughty. Overemphasis on children’s organizational ability would have an adverse impact on their growth. If children are required to be well organized at any time, their creativity and imagination will be stifled.</p>
          <p>To sum up, I’m not saying that being helpful and well-organized are of no use, but compared to the importance of honesty, these two values can be crossed off the priority list. (456 words)</p>
