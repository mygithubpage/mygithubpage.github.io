          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>People tend to have to different expectations out of a job, like personal satisfaction, higher pay, respect, and social recognition. Some people prefer to work long hours to pursue a higher salary while others tend to hold on an average paying job with normal work hours. If I have to face these two choices, I tend to choose to take a job with normal pay but more free time based on the following reasons.</p>
          <p>Admittedly, monetary reward is indeed one of primary motivation to pursue a career, one needs money to cover daily expenses like room and board, utility bills, buy medical insurance, without money it is impossible for someone to live a decent life. However, it is not monetary benefit that gives an individual great personal satisfaction. Research that is done by lots of well-established professor in psychiatry has shown that the freedom to allocate your time and your intimacy with friends and families guarantee great personal happiness and satisfactions.</p>
          <p>First off, spending too much time and working overtime can add more pressure and stress to one personal life and jeopardize their health. Lots of jobs are sedentary, like secretaries, lawyers, clerks, which pose great threat to their physical healthy. They might get dizzy, backache, and lack of energy. Other professions are even more competitive and intense, like stock broker, financial analyst who have to stare at a computer screen for more than 10 hours a day. It is not surprising to hear someone who has worked for 14 hours a day and several days in a row and eventually suffer from cardiac sudden death. It is clear that working overtime pose great threat to employees' healthy, which leads to sloppy working habits and negative attitude. The most unwanted scenario is the lack of morale in a professional environment. On the other hand, working normal hours makes the individual employee happier in their personal life and more productive in the working place.</p>
          <p>Additionally, working overtime means that the individual will have to sacrifice much of their spare time devoted to boring and repetitive work. There are more meaningful stuff to do than working day and night, for instance, by choosing working normal hours one can develop a new skill or hobby, like learning how to play piano, play golf with a friend. Besides, working normal hours makes it possible for individuals to spend some quality with their families and maintaining a harmonious bond with families can be very important. Not only does good to the individual's mental health, but also it will make one more productive in a professional setting.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, it is more advisable to work average hours with normal pay than otherwise since more flexibility in working schedule means more quality time with families and friends, great personal satisfaction and productivity in working place and lower risk of physical and mental problems.

          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>In the current society full of fierce competition, we can readily observe that landing an ideal job has become increasingly difficult, which forces us to a concession in the requirement of the job we want. When it comes to which is more appealing, a higher pay job with longer work time or an average pay job with normal work time, people varying in backgrounds and personalities may view the same issue from different angles. From my perspective, towards such a long-running tug-of-war, my choice will depends on what age I am.</p>
          <p>On the one hand, during my twenties and thirties, my preference will be a higher pay job with longer work time. For one thing, as for young adults wrestling with various bills in daily life, the high salary will help them to relieve their financial pressure and thus meet their basic need of life. To be specific, the extremely high price of house in China has been beyond the affordable range of most people. In order to pay the rents or afford a house, young people needs desperately a large sum of money which can be earned in a decent job. For another, longer work time is not a big deal for the young, because they are so energetic and vigorous that a sound sleep can help them to restore their vitality. A good case in point is the experience my friend, Andy. As a broker in an Stock Exchange Company in Beijing, he has to deal with large quantities of data and keep close track of any events which may cause the fluctuation of stock price. Although the heavy pressure brought by his job often require him to work overtime and even around the clock, he never makes complaints because the exciting and adventurous experience from selling or buying stocks appeals him a lot.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, n the other hand, when I am at the middle age or old age, an average pay job with normal work time will be much better. After accumulating fortunes in the early years of life, old-age people do not suffer from huge financial pressure so that low income will not affect their life greatly. As we know, the old have owned their own houses and are not interested in pursuing the latest electronic devices or fashionable clothes, thus decresing their living cost to a large extent. As a result, they can lead a relatively high-quality life without high wage. Also, older people are usually those who have got married or even have children, so spending more time accompanying their family members is of great significance. Undoubtedly, the job with normal work time can better satisfy the need of staying longer with their kids or spouse. During the stay, the emotional bond between them will become closer and more intimate.</p>
          <p>Judging from what has been discussed above, we can draw the conclusion that my preference for a job varies according to what age group I am at.</p>
