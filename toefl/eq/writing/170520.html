        <h4>Question</h4>
        <p>At some universities, students take part in making decisions about the issues that affect daily life of everyone on campus, such as how many hours that the libraries should be open each day or what kinds of food should be served in the cafeteria. But at some universities, experts are hired to make these decisions, students almost never involved. Which approach do you prefer and why.</p>

          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>Even though overprotective education has been opposed for most modern educational theories, some parents, even some universities authorities, still keep the students out of decision-making. As a college student, I strongly fight against those so-called protect and ask for being the master of my own school life.</p>
          <p>I think the worst consequence is that students may lose their ability to make decision alone if they are not allowed to arrange their college events. College students are almost at the age over 16 and most of them are persons of full age and capacity, whose rights approved by laws. At the end of school time in their life, they have been taught how to make right decision for many years and of course, they have learned how to be responsible for their own behaviors. However, if this chance is deprived, they will feel frustrated after graduation due to the lack of certain ability to arrange their work and life, let alone being the principal of the whole working project. Since the laws have already recognized their ability, there is no reason for the school to object.</p>
          <p>Apart from the capacity-building, enrollment rate is another factor that can't be ignored. According to the recent survey conducted by National Education Sector, only 30% of universities whose student unions are authorized to make the daily decision, while the number of applicants who claim that they took the decision-making program into consideration when submitting applications tops 80%. That means the amount of ideal universities cannot meet the need of those strongly-desired applicants. Therefore, letting students to make own decisions on school events is absolutely a good way for those university who want to attract more students.</p>
          <p>Some may worry that decision given by students may have one or two downsides. For instance, some students might take it personally by considering their own benefit rather than public interest. However, in light of above-mentioned possibility, I suggest that the school authority to build up a supervisory mechanism, and make a rule that those important events should be publicly displayed and encourage other students to get involved in supervision. Thus, this practice will leave nothing to be worried about.</p>
          <p>Therefore, even though many jobs came together to make a school a school, but a school becomes a promised land only when students who study in it try to make themselves the owners.</p>
