          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>The past five decades have witnessed tremendous economic and technological changes in China, which leads many people tend to hold the view that the advice given by grandparents is not viable to their grandchildren. However, as far as I am concerned, grandchildren <b>can still benefit a lot from the advice from</b> their grandparents.</p>
          <p>　　First, the advice from grandparents <b>can guide and rectify the direction of our life</b>. <b>Having lived for much more years, crossing much more bridges and experiencing much more things</b>, grandparents <b>definitely have much more insight and foresight than the young kids</b>. With those valuable ‘treasure’, <b>advice received from grandparents can play a crucial role when we have to make a decision in the crossroad of life</b>, such as whether we should take on a job which at the first sight is intractable, or whether we should give up a thing which has not had any significant consequence yet after a period of effort. What’s more, when we are in the low ebb, our grandparents’ advice can help revive our spirits; when we are in the peak of life, our grandparents’ advice can keep our feet on the ground.</p>
          <p>　　Second, the advice from grandparents can <b>teach us the principles to conduct ourselves</b>, to put it simple, how to be a good man. I firmly uphold that no matter how enormous changes take place in the society, there is something that can stand the test of time, just like gold washed out of sand. Virtues like honesty, integrity, fidelity, kindness and tolerance are qualities we should inherit from grandparents. In addition, having gone through so many ups and downs, goods and evils in their life, our grandparents have a more incisive and thorough understanding of human nature, which can help us judging people. For example, our grandparents often warns us <b>not to trust people who never turn up when you are in adversity, but to trust those who always stand by you whatever happens</b>. Misfortune tests the sincerity of friends.</p>
          <p>　　Admittedly, under some circumstances, advice from grandparents seems to be out of date. Taking the case of choosing majors before entering university as an example, the majors of today indeed differ a lot from those of fifty years ago. We almost could not find the vestige of majors like computer science and finance in universities fifty years ago. Also grandparents may be confused at the question of which cellphone to buy, Apple or Samsung. However, we should not take for granted that our grandparents are like a pool of stagnant water, for they can also keep pace with the times. Many of our grandparents today are as fashionable as we are.</p>
          <p>　　Based on the above analysis, advice from grandparents is always worth considering for grandchildren whenever the era is, for grandparents with abundant experience and profound insight can benefit us a lot in coping with affairs and people.</p>
