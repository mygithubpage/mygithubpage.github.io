          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>Knowledge and experience both can give us precious advice in problem-solving. Life is full of unexpected events. When we get stuck in a dilemma, what should we do? To ask others for help or just deal with the problem by our own effort, it’s a Gordian knot. Someone thinks that we should always count on ourselves. Someone would argue that getting advice from others would be the quickest and wisest way. From my perspective, getting advice from others may be more efficient and time-saving.</p>
          <p>　　Experience and knowledge learned from others contribute greatly to efficiency for a happening. <u>Not all experience and knowledge related to problem-solving can be obtained by personal effort alone due to limitations of mind and capabilities of each individual</u>. A single thought in someone’s mind is far less shining compared with group’s wisdom. That explains the famous old saying that one sees further when standing upon the shoulders’ of past great giants; that explains why a great leader is always with greater minds; that also explains why teamwork in corporation is highly emphasized in the 21st century. Brainstorm and exchange of ideas between different thoughts never fail to enhance capabilities of each individual involved, a team, a company, an institution, a country, or even the entire global village.</p>
          <p>　　Asking others’ advice instead of getting everything done on one’s own promotes democracy and communication too. In terms of democracy, it is necessary to give others rights and chances to speak since the problem may concern them in different ways, and their saying in turn reflects our respect toward freedom of speech as well as their wisdom. In terms of communication, idea exchange sometimes focuses more than solutions, and hereby better mutual understanding about perspectives, principles, practicalities and personalities of each other.</p>
          <p>　　Admittedly using one's own knowledge and experience to solve problems can foster our dependence and responsibility, asking advice from others can broadens our mind, enlarges our vision, enhances more effective and efficient brainstorm, which undoubtedly gives rise to better, if not the best solutions. There is little we cannot do while divided, there is little we can do.</p>

          <p>People tend to respond to problems differently given the fact that personalities may vary among different individuals. When it comes to the question of whether or not to solve the problem based on one's own experience and knowledge or solicit others advice, I tend to believe that it really depends on the nature of the problem and we can not draw a definitive line here.</p>
          <p>On the one hand, a rookie without any experience in a particular field can learn a great deal of knowledge and develop useful skills when learning from an experienced individual. For instance, when my father taught me how to ride a bike, I remember his experience and knowledge were extremely useful. My father sat me on the paddle with one feet hanging in the air, and I hold the handlebar straight and bent my arms a little bit so that I could keep balance. After my dad's instruction and guidance，eventually I learned how to ride a bike. Also, in a working environment, the knowledge and experience of senior employees can be very helpful for someone who hold junior positions in the company. The expertise of senior workers have proven from time to time that a certain strategy of business operation cannot be paralleled by any other approach. Indeed, a recent study done by the National Society of Organizational Behavior indicates that one enjoys a better chance to be successful in his professional life if he gets intensive coaching and training from senior managers during the first two years of his job. Consequently, we can conclude that on some occasions it is beneficial for someone to capitalize on others' experience and knowledge.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, for problems, setbacks or major decisions that have a significant impact on the individual's life, it is not rational to be influenced by others' opinions and perspectives. For example, when you have big decisions like which university to attend or whether or not taking on a new career path, it is far better for you to figure it out and sort it through by yourself other than solicit the advice from others. Above all, nobody knows you better than yourself. You are the one who needs to live with the decision and other people won't be the ones with the consequence. Frankly, it takes a lot of courage to stand up and take personal responsibility for your own decision. Any decision made out of assertiveness and confidence should be respected, however, nobody shows any respect to those who are wishy-washy and hesitate to make their own decisions.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, we cannot readily draw a definitive line on question of is it better to use your own knowledge and experience than ask others' knowledge and experience to solve problems since it has has to be examined case by case.</p>

          <p>With the society becoming increasingly complicated, we find that everyone will inevitably encounter countless problems throughout his or her whole life. When it comes to how to address these problems, the senior strongly recommend that it is better to use one’s own knowledge or experience rather than to ask others for advice, while the young adults may view the issue from the opposite angle. As far as I am concerned, the latter stance is more reasonable, with the reasons as follows.</p>
          <p>　　First, one conspicuous benefit of seeking suggestion from others is that people can solve the troubles or problems more efficiently. As is common sense, the knowledge and experience owned by any individual is limited to some extent so that it may take longer time to work out a complex problem without help from others. By contrast, asking others for advice is a totally different picture. My own experience is a good case in point. Back to my high school life, the chemistry class was a disaster for me because I had great difficulties in memorizing the chemical elements. Given the above situation, I asked my chemistry teacher, an experienced expert in chemistry, for help. According to his suggestions, I had a thorough review of the table of chemical elements and learned the internal relation between each element, thus gaining a satisfactory score in the midterm test.</p>
          <p>　　Secondly, what also cannot be neglected is that turning to others for advice can help to enlarge our social network. For one thing, the course of seeking and receiving suggestions from others is one of the most typical form of communication, which can make us grasp the important principles and skills of establishing close relation with other people. To illustrate, it is of great necessity to maintain humble and modest when you want others to do a favor for you. For another, while being asked to give some advice, people will feel that they are valued and recognized by advice-seekers so that they are more likely to have a soft spot for those who seek counsels. Obviously, one’s humble personality and the mutual appreciation will definitely contribute to the enhancement of interpersonal relationship. Nevertheless, working on a problem individually will greatly reduce our opportunities to communicate with others and thus weaken our social ability, with the worst consequence of isolating ourselves from the whole society.</p>
          <p>　　Factoring what has been discussed above, we can draw the conclusion that asking others for advice is a better choice, in order to tackle the problems in a more efficient way and enlarge social circle. </p>
