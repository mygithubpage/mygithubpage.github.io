        <h4>Question</h4>
        <p>Sometimes we are assigned to work in a group on a project. Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? The group will be helped more by person who will be willing to do what other group members want than by person who often strongly insists that things should be done in a way that is different from what the group wants to do.</p>

          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>As the core power of a group, the group members are obliged to spare no efforts to push forward the project in progress. However, the members of a group encompass people of different characteristics, divergent way of thinking and working styles, as a result of which, someone may unconditionally follow the group's orders, while someone maybe always critical about them. <u>As far as I am concerned, the former is more favorable</u> when considering benefiting the whole group.</p>
          <p><u>Primarily and undeniably</u>, <b>a higher working efficiency</b> <u>could be achieved if the</u> group members could comply with the whole group’s rules and targets. During the process of accomplishing a project, team cooperation is of great significance, which could be realized by the wholehearted dedication of all members with their divergence being eliminated. Evidently, team cooperation is in direct proportion to the working efficiency of the group. By contrast, if a group member, when assigned tasks, always goes against the whole group’s progressing direction and working targets, a bunch of time will be wasted. What’s worse, direct conflict may arise, which brings forth great obstacles standing in the way before the project is started. It is due to such a disagreement within the group that exerts side effects on the working efficiency.</p>
          <p>Apart from working efficiency, another important benefit of choosing a compliant group member is all team members will work with greater impetus. Compared with harmony, disagreement never fail to fuel bias and possibly discrimination, hence creating a negative state of mind. Under such circumstance, almost everyone loses the impetus and motivation to struggle in the group, no matter how ambitious and aggressive they are before. Just imagine, an English association is going to conduct an English speaking contest. Every member of the group is allocated with certain assignment like purchasing required necessities, site layout, selecting the contestants and so on, with the purpose of guaranteeing the smooth progression of the contest. If someone of them refuses to accept the assignment by arguing that things should be arranged in another way, it may turn out to be great hazard to the morale of the group especially when others are in agreement with the plans. Needless to say, morale is to a group what soul is to humankind.</p>
          <p>I tend to concede that some novel ideas and inspirations may turn out to be new blood for the whole group, but that should not be an excuse for not obeying what the majority of the members insist. Just as an old saying goes: the minority is subject to the majority. Those bearing different considerations should put the collective in the first place.</p>
          <p>From what has been discussed above, it is safe to draw the conclusion that a member willing to do what other group members want is more favorable for a group, not only for a higher working efficiency but also for a greater impetus.(480 words)</p>
