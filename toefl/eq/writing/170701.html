          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>People have suffered from so many natural disasters in the past decades and all of them bring huge loss financially as well as take many lives. Accordingly, protect the environment is not only the matter of our current lives, but our children’s. <b>As for me, I choose to</b> take bicycle or on foot instead of taking transportation as long as I can.</p>
          <p>We all know that one of the mainly sources of atmospheric pollution is vehicle exhaust, and bicycle is the one which release zero flue gas. I still remember the public service ads that describe the bicycle as a transportation with panorama sunroof, natural wind, low parking fee and more importantly, zero release. As a result, taking the good living habit both for oneself and environment <b>is a trend that influence each individual</b>. Thus, <b>I don’t think there is anything much</b> healthier and environmental-friendly than taking the bicycle for transportation or exercise.</p>
          <p>As to the recycling products, I take the conservative attitude. Waste goods are always with some harmful materials such as batteries, plastics and poisonous metal. The Apple Inc., which is the top developer in environmental protection material, didn’t stop using mercury, lead and arsenic in their display screen until they set up the project of Green Chemistry Advisory Board in 2013, let alone those companies and factories which still know nothing about the hazardous substance. Clearly, professional events suit those professionals. We ordinary beings should stay away from those we cannot handle safely.</p>
          <p>Some may claim that organic food largely reduce negative influences to the soil, water and air because of the natural planting environment and non-pesticide cultivation, which they are willing to pay for. <b>However, the fact is far from their belief.</b> According to the recent report from Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, the amount of heavy metal in the soil of organic spinach is nearly 10% less than that of inorganic spinach. However, the organic spinach is double than inorganic spinach in selling price. Under this circumstance, buying organic food is not a good deal.</p>
          <p>To conclude, in view of all those situations I have stated above, low-carbon traveling is the best choice.</p>
