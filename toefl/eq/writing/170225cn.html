          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>When we meet some new friends, we are always very anxious to know about them yet afraid of asking a lot of questions. In this case, we actually have other ways to know about their personality or character by some indirect methods. Apart from the books a person likes to read or the movies a person likes to watch, the way he or she dresses will tell us a lot about his or her personality and character.</p>
          <p>First, the color of one’s dress can tell us about this person’s character. According to color science, especially color psychology, people’s color preference reflects parts of their characteristics. For example, people who are normally in black, white or grey suits have a steady touch in dealing with things. People who tend to wear bright-colored clothes are comparatively outgoing and have good ability to get along well with others. On the other hand, if a person always wears the same one or two colors, he or she might be more introversive; and a sociable person’s wardrobe may have all colors in.</p>
          <p>Second, the style of one’s dresses is also a good indication of his or her personality. Take the teachers in my school as examples. My history teacher is very strict and never plays jokes with us. He always wears suit and leather shoes. My English teacher, who is very easy-going and intellective but never shares her private life with us, wears dresses in classic styles all year around. My art teacher is eloquent and has distinct opinions about things. She once expressed her counterview about our headmaster’s decision face to face with him. She now wears sport suit and sneakers like a student, then wears fashionable clothes and high heels like a super star. So, a person wears what kind of clothes tells us what kind of person he or she is to some degree.</p>
          <p>Admittedly, we cannot fully rely on the way a person dresses to know about his or her personality or character. Sometimes, people’s taste in clothes changes as time goes by while their personality or character remains the same. Sometimes, they like many colors and styles, which makes it hard to conclude a certain type of their clothes. Anyway, we can still have some prediction about their personality or character according to the way they dress at that moment, then verify it by long-term interaction.</p>
          <p>To conclude, we cannot deny that the way a person dresses is an indication of his or her personality or character. But, we should never jump to hasty conclusions about others’ personality and character merely by what they wear nor judge them by their dresses.(441 words)</p>
