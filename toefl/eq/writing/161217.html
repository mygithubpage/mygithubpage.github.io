          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>Currently, it has become a common phenomenon that an increasing number of young adults are blamed for lacking any living skills, which has aroused deep social concern. Therefore, some educators and parents propose that high school students should do some house chores after school. As far as I am concerned, the above proposal is acceptable.</p>
          <p>Firstly, making housework mandatory for children can help them <b>pick up practical skills and develop valuable traits</b>. As we all know, in the course of completing various house chores, essential living skills and certain qualities will be required. So with these abilities and virtues, high schoolers will be more capable of take good care of themselves in their future life. To be specific, while making real contributions to running the household, they're actively learning how to cook, launder, clean, make repairs, maintain a vehicle, budget expenses, and other tasks which are essential for living an independent life once they're adults. The experience of freshmen in college in China is a good case in point. Due to overemphasis of parents on the academic performance, high school students are required to devote most of their time and energy in learning compulsory subjects such as English, math and physics. The consequence is that most of college students have great difficulty in adapting to the campus life because they have to do everything in person, most of which are usually done by their parents.</p>
          <p>Secondly, requiring kids to do house chores will relieve parents stress. As is common sense, under such a society full of competition, parents, the breadwinner of the whole family, have to spend most of their time on their work in order to support the whole family, which makes them under heavy pressure. Undoubtedly, cleaning the floor, doing laundry and cooking consume lots of energy and time of already exhausted parents, with the result that they will suffer from more physical and psychological fatigue. However, if children become proficient at the jobs necessary to sustain their families, the burden of the parents will be alleviated a lot, which is definitely conducive to the health of parents.</p>
          <p>Factoring what has been discussed above, it is safe to conclude that students should be required to do housework in order to improve their own practical skills and lessen the pressure of their parents.</p>

          <p>It is a quite strange phenomenon that some parents require students to spare no eﬀort on their academic study, regardless of others ﬁelds like health, personalities and values. Contrary to their statement, I insist that children will be the beneﬁciaries if they are allowed to take part in household chores. </p>
          <p>Some basic living skills are needed for children’s future life. A cousin of mine, Peter, whose mom allowed him to do little, if any, housework in his childhood. Unfortunately, not until 30 did he know how to use the microwave oven. The number of children like my cousin are increasing in this time and age, thus causing the reasonable worry how they could live independently in future. Accordingly, the children would not need to learn the independence if their parents were to serve them for their whole lives. </p>
          <p>Aside from the independence, the sense of responsibilities is brought from doing household chores. As the member of family, it is of great necessity for children to help their parents with some basic work like cleaning the room or trim the garden. Under this circumstance children know how to contribute the whole family rather than care about themselves only. Besides, they also learn that they should wash their own dishes after the meal and cleaning the dirty if they break something inadvertently. After all, a house become a home only when children make it a place where they truly contribute. </p>
          <p>Undoubtedly, allowing children to do housework may lead to one or two downsides. For instance, some children may get hurt when they are doing some cooking or cleaning. However, as to the above-mentioned possibility, I suggest the parents to give the direction about how to do the job in right way and how to avoid injuries. They also need to look after their children when they are doing some dangerous work. Hence, there is nothing to be worried about. </p>
          <p>In conclusion, given the independence and responsibility, I totally disagree with that parents pay all attention to their studying and playing. Rather, household chores is another even more important “skills” that they need to take.</p>
