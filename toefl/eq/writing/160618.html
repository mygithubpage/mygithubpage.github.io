          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>Everyone is longing for success; therefore, everyone eagerly searches for every method to reach that end. Having an inclusive and open would definitely serve as a good panacea for everyone who wants to achieve something in the life. Nevertheless, it is not the only way toward one’s heyday, for one’s success derives from the combined factors, like tenacity and resilience.</p>
          <p>　　Admittedly, a man with an open mind for new ideas is half way for success, for these innovative ideas and philosophies offer one with another outlook when facing a deadlock or dilemma. What’s the most important, new idea brings about creation to our life. The modern society has witnessed the rapid and pervasive changes of technologies along with subtle social reforms. It is the new ideas from other people and other places that lead James Dyson, the inventor if G-force vacuum cleaner, to a great success; it is embracing the new method from the excellent athletes that helps Jimmy Li create his special set “Jimmy Li Jump”.Furthermore, changing our mind and listening to the new ideas from others is conducive to cooperate with other people. A man cannot succeed without the assistance from others. An open mind for new ideas and thoughts are easy for people to share different ideas, therefore, it is beneficial for cooperating within certain groups or teams. A cooperative people would certainly get more help, thus to succeed in a more earlier way. However, an open mind for outside ideas is surely the only way for one to succeed, for there are a lot of other people gaining success through other ways!</p>
          <p>　　Being tenacious and persistent represent a continuous effort in one’s specific career. The secret to happiness is hard work and effort, not “quick-fixes”. Great ideas only cannot guarantee one’s efforts and actions. Only by the down-to-earth efforts and hard work can the final success gained! If James Dyson did not experiment for over 5200 times after he got a new idea from others, we would not have witnessed the birth of this new and highly efficient vacuum cleaner. Therefore, tenacity and persistence provide a sure way to one’s success.</p>
          <p>　　Furthermore, a positive and optimistic attitude towards failure can also serve as a facilitator for one’s success. A lot of people failed because they feared the new challenges or feared to fail again. People with negative attitudes may be loath to take action even if they embrace new ideas from others. A positive mindset can serve as a catalyst for one’s success. If James Dyson didn’t hold hopes for his production promotion and give up during his experiment, we would have seen his products prevail the global market. Thus, a sound mindset and positive attitude propels one to success.</p>
          <p>　　In a nutshell, a successful person is not made just in one day. A lot of factors contribute to a successful people, like new ideas, tenacity and a positive mind, to name just a few. Only in this way can a person expect success as soon as possible!</p>

          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>Under the current society full of intense competitions, how to achieve success has never failed to arouse deep concern and interest among the general public. Thereof, a good deal of accomplished businessmen and elites are strong believers of the claim that to be a successful person, one must be open to new ideas and willing to change his or her mind.Towards such a complicated issue, I am in favor of the above claim for the following reasons.</p>
          <p>In the first place, <u>being receptive to new ideas can help people to better adapt to the constantly changing environment and thus become successful</u>. As is common sense, no matter what fields or areas you are engaged in, change has become the perpetual topic, which means that what you held firmly onto before may become outdated and even misleading overnight. In other words, only those people with open mind towards new things can keep pace with the changes of time and are more likely to achieve success. <b>By contrast, rejecting any new ideas and never changing one's mind, people will be gradually surpassed or even replaced by other competitors</b>. A good case in point is the collapse of Nokia Company, the once most famous cell phone brand. On account of showing no acceptance to the new operating system Android, the Nokia has announced bankruptcy and has been acquired by Microsoft Company. The same logic can apply to any individuals who are stubborn.</p>
          <p>Besides that, embracing new ideas can help people to build harmonious rapport with more people, leading to the higher likelihood of becoming successful. More scrutiny has made it conspicuous that an attitude of open-mindedness is strongly correlated to one's popularity among others, especially in a work team. <b>The underlying reason is that anyone who has a willingness to listen to new thoughts tends to leave a good impression and thereof gains help or assistance from others when faced with troubles in the path to success.</b> Also, being open-minded helps you work through interpersonal or intra-team conflicts that arise when people work in close quarters. <b>By contrast, insisting on one' own view stubbornly usually not only build a barrier for establishing the friendship but also serves as the origin of quarrel or conflicts with other people</b>. Put it another way, people without a spirit of listening and cooperation have difficulty in completing any projects, let alone, become successful.</p>
          <p>Indeed, accepting new ideas may make people feel uncomfortable, because they are forced to get out their comfort zone. However, the above reasoning does not bear deep analysis. To illustrate, it is an indisputable fact that success relies on nothing but innovation driven by constantly taking in original and creative ideas and thoughts. Consequently, factoring what has been mentioned above, we can conclude that showing acceptance to new ideas and changing one's mind accordingly are of great necessity for the sake of achieving success.</p>

          <p>Nowadays, people are facing ﬁerce competition in schools and at work, which makes it more difficult for people to with the past. Some people argue that in order to achieve success, people should be open-minded and accept new ideas whereas others prefer to stick to the existing plan and refuse to make a change. Based on what I have learned about this topic, it is better to accept new ideas and take some risks to become successful. </p>
          <p>To begin with, accepting new ideas enables people to seize the opportunity. With the development of modern technology and the advancing of new industries, people now have increasing new opportunities when choosing their future career. Inspired by new ideas and innovations, many people become successful after they started a career that is unprecedented in history. Jack Ma\'s story serves as a perfect example in this case. Jack Ma, the founder of Alibaba, was an English major student in college and became an English teacher after graduation. Soon he learned from a friend that a new type of business referred to as “e-commerce" sprung up in Western countries, and he believes that this online-based business will be promising in the world market. Therefore, he started his own business and founded the company, namely Alibaba. With his strong leadership and the ability to foresee the trends in the ﬁeld of ecommerce, he now becomes one of the most successful businessmen in this century. His example clearly shows how rewarding it is to accept new ideas and make a change. </p>
          <p>Moreover, our visions will be limited if we are too stubborn to change our mind. This is not only true in business but also in the ﬁeld of scientiﬁc research. As a student majored in linguistics, I have learned the importance of conducting interdisciplinary research. However, some professors prefer to stick to their own ﬁeld of research and refuse to cooperate with professors in other subjects. As a result, it becomes extremely diﬃcult for this group of professors to propose new hypotheses or theories, let alone to make a breakthrough in the ﬁeld of linguistics. </p>
          <p>To sum up, being willing to accept new ideas is an essential factor than contributes to our success. And I believe that in diﬀerent ﬁelds, it is always necessary for us to take some risks and be creative.</p>
