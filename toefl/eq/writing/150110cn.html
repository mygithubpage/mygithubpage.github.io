          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>The increasing attention being paid to education has led to the rise of  university education's status all over the world. A problem comes with it in the  process of promoting university education is how to complete a high-quality  advanced education. One of the ideas of pursuing all-rounded education of  students calls for all the students to receive classes in a number of subjects  that are within or beyond the scope of their major field. Is this requirement  reasonable and effective? I don't think so. Though there are certain merits  being brought by learning science classes, some students get more disadvantages  in carrying out such policy.</p>
          <p>　　At first, we can't denigrate the advantages of learning basic sciences  during college time. To be a knowledgeable and well-round person, one must have  access to both arts and science knowledge. And the university phase is exactly  one of the most important learning periods in one's life. If receiving education  on basic science during the four years study in universities, students can have  more understanding of the world, which helps them live more wisely and happily.  Many theories and principles they got are able to explain things happening  around them, like the change of moons and stars and how computer works. They  can, subsequently, solve many problems by themselves and also help others find  solutions. Besides, integrating the basic knowledge of science and the knowledge  of other fields that university students concentrate on is going to shape  talents with full grasp of a variety of disciplines. However, not all students  can benefit from such requirement and should take basic science courses in  universities.</p>
          <p>　　For example, for students who are not into science, this action will bring  more harm to them. It's widely believed that interest is the motivation of  study. And it is also true that the attitude students take toward each subject  has mutual effect on one another. That is to say, if students have an aversion  to one subject, it is more likely that they have negative motion in learning  other subjects. Therefore, their overall attitude towards study will be  adversely affected. So if students who are not fascinated about, or even hate  science are required to take courses of it, in the end, an resistance or  aversion motion will arise and prevent them from learning what they originally  are supposed to learn. Hence, not all students should learn basic science.</p>
          <p>　　Besides, it is also not a good choice for those who already don't have good  command of their majors to learn extra courses in basic science. For some  students, classes and large amount of assignments of their major courses have  already take most of their time and energy. They almost immerse in books, papers  or experiments related to their own fields all day long, but might still be  completed troubled by these contents and have no energy to be distributed to  other items. Imposing new pressure of learning other subjects to them will push  them to collapse, and also affect their efficiency of learning their major  courses by distracting their energies. As a result, the performance of students  who can't deal with their field's knowledge will become worse. Thus, such  students shouldn't learn the extra science classes.</p>
          <p>　　To conclude, requiring all university students to learn basic science  courses is not a good idea and students should learn these courses according to  their own study conditions—whether they can harness the advantages of learning  more from science classes or they may be negatively affected by the extra  courses.</p>
