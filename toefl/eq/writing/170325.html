          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>During the Renaissance, in many European countries, universities were only available to those who were born with silver spoon in their mouth and most of children had to work up to almost 19 hours a day in dingy factories. But now even the children in poverty can get access into universities and all kinds of support and help are aim to help students perform better in their college life. Given the choice, I would prefer the help and support from my families and friends.</p>
          <p>We all believe that <b>family members and friends are always in our position and know us better than</b> tutors and high-school teachers. For those high-school students who are preparing for the university, parents give everything they have to provide their children with a better learning condition. Especially in Asian countries, the college entrance exam is a totally stiff competition that needs everyone to struggle through, during which the parents and friends act comprehensively as the tutors, the psychologists, the financial patrons even the servants for their daily life. Even though there is something wrong with those who are too dependent on parents and friends, the encouragement and supports from parents and friends can be adopted to some degree.</p>
          <p>In comparison, helping from high-school teachers are not suitable at all. It is undeniable that there are huge difference between high schools and colleges, including learning skills, lifestyle and the way you get along with others. In terms of learning skills, the teacher-oriented schooling is popular in high school class, <b>which means what the students need to do is just to</b> sit in silence, listen carefully to teachers and take the practices in and after class. But <b>this pattern is totally inapplicable in university</b>. The professor <b>leaves large space for class discussion</b> and further team work outside the school, <b>which is actually a better and flexible way for students to get in touch with new knowledge</b>. I don't think a high-school teacher with rooted habit of class domination can bring the directions that meet the need of college education.</p>
          <p>Some may claim that tutors are the better choice than parents and high-school teachers because they are professionals. The individual directions and pertinent advices are their specialties. Nevertheless, it is just suitable for kids. As an adult, being independent is the most important characteristic, or they will be at a loss in the occasion that no one helps them. The parents and friends also provide help but the difference is, they just provide help in materials, not directions in decision-making and project-planning. Thus, no matter what your age, independence in personality should not be overwhelmed by utilitarian goals.</p>
          <p>All in all, there is nothing wrong with the help of high-school teachers and tutors. For the best possible learning, though, families and friends are the biggest help you can have. (470 words)</p>
