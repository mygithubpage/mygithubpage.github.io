        <h4>Question</h4>
        <p>Do you agree or disagree with the following statement : Sometimes people think nowadays the media (TV, newspaper, Internet) are less concerned about the accuracy of news than in the past, and the incorrect information may cause more problem to the public.</p>

          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>It was recorded that the amount of information in recent two decades took up 70% of that in human history, but simultaneously, the number of people who claim that the news are far from truth also tops 70%. Contrary to their statement, my opinion lies in the fact that today’s information from new medias are quite reliable and the contemporary are not as blind as they are regarded.</p>
          <p>Large ranges of medium do not provide so much fake information as the accuracy one due to the inter-contradiction. The distorted details from certain journalist about the battles in Libya may be soon clarified by the news agency in another part of the earth. The amount of incorrect coverage and even the fabricated affairs may easily be in the spotlight but before long, repudiated by factual accounts. In this situation, something misleading and bogus cannot survive awhile.</p>
          <p>Apart from the self-cleaning capacity of the press, those who want to break the code of conduct will also be stifled in the cradle by censors. The sound laws and stricter ethics limit the space for news outlets to blow things out of all proportions. According to the annunciation of SARFT (The State Administration of Radio Film and Television), 15 well-known newspaper offices and more than 17 copywriters were charged for they fabricated some gossip that sway negatively among the public in first half of 2017. That is, whether medium or individuals need to restrain themselves and have no possibility to achieve attention by virtue of media hype.</p>
          <p>Granted, some experts insist that the abundant news contain large proportion of inaccurate news that may misrepresent the public. Nevertheless, they, to a large extent, look down on the present education. People today are well-educated enough to tell right from wrong, thereby, in fact, coming up with more suspicious question about the information. That is about the details, the cause and effect and anything apocryphal. Time and time again, a news who want to be the headlines must tell the truth.</p>
          <p>To sum up, given the rules of press circles, supervision of authorities and intelligence of human, the information in new medias is largely believable.</p>
