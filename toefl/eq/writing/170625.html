          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>Fresh graduates <b>are facing the challenge of</b> job-seeking and a large amount of them try to <b>take the short cut that</b> their family can offer some job opportunities for them, whether they suit these position or not. However, they are too shortsighted to realize the opposite consequence. Given the choice, I wouldn’t take this kind of job which is under the influence of my family.</p>
          <p>Firstly, they can’t be sure whether what their family do is their own favorite. If not, the rest of their career lives will very likely be a suffering. My cousin, who was worried about finding job after graduation and eventually employed by the company owned by his uncle, suffers from the depression due to boring and hopeless working day. I don’t think there is anyone who would sit idly by while their offsprings are all but dead in workplace. Thus, for the true meaning of work, don’t compromise and choose the job just to avoid being a temporary “loafer”.</p>
          <p>Even if the job fit their interest like a glove, it’s hard for them to make achievements due to the limitation from stereotype of their family. People always expect more from those who have built-in advantages but when those people don’t perform well enough, the great disappointment appear. Similarly, when all others think you should be the first because of the so-called relations of family bond, you are not allowed to make any mistake, otherwise you will be regarded as a failure. Since there are double difficulties to be successful than working in other companies, they are not supposed to be the prisoners in a small jail with no top.</p>
          <p>As a rule, everyone dreams to work in a company whose boss is your father, and because of this, he or she can get rid of the office rules and behave freely. However, a company with unfair leaders will stop to go because of the unfair management and suspicious working relations. Would anyone like to stay in a sinking ship without expectation and hope? Accordingly, whether their father provide them with “convenience” or not, I don’t think it is the job that they truly want.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, in view of the own interest, unlimited working place and bright career lives, young people should be vigilant when they are thinking of the company where the family members work.(411 words)</p>

          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>Nowadays, as a great number of graduates finish their universities, they elbow their ways through the crowds in the job market. Although some hold the idea that facing with such a tough competition, it is better for graduates to work for family business to enjoy the royal roads that have paved for them, I believe that working for others plays a vital role to the development of students’ future careers.</p>
          <p>　　First of all, it is working for others that enhances our ability to communicate, a skill critical for career development. In the workplace, people spare no effort to communicate directly with high efficiency and the supervisors give advice to candidates candidly so that employees are able to follow the leaders the commands to increase the productivity afterwards. More often than not, for the sake of the company, the leaders may yell at candidates because they have expressed ideas ambiguously, resulting in the loss of profits. Lectured by the bosses, we are easy to gradually gain the approach to communicate with main points, ignoring the irrelevant parts and delivering the relevant sections, the way that better improve the communicative efficiency in the company.</p>
          <p>　　In addition, by working for others, we are easy to explore our potential. Making profits is the first step of the commercial activity for the company, while hiring the fewest employees to work on the most jobs provides such a shortcut. If we work in the company, we have penchant to carry out more than one jobs, work around clocks, all of which constantly challenge our limits. But it is these challenges that upgrades ourselves rapidly. Being able to survive in this critical moment at the younger age, we are more likely to live in any other harsh condition, like what Darwin in his theory survival of the fittest, thus increasing our chance of survival in the growing ferocious job markets.</p>
          <p>　　According to the reasons that I have mentioned above which are working for other explores our potential and enhancing our ability to communicate, I am able to draw up the conclusion that working for others motivates people, triggers people’s passion and enthusiasm. Therefore I would strongly recommend working for others instead of working in the family business.</p>
