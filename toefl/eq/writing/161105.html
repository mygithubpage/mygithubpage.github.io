        <h4>Question</h4>
        <p>University students are often encouraged to study fields in which significant job growth (a large increase in job opportunities) is expected; these fields currently include science, technology, engineering, and math, do you believe students should consider studying fields related to these subjects even if they are more interested in other subjects? Why or why not?</p>

          <p>Those elders in my family often care whether I would get a great job after graduation. They totally believe that what we learn in school is just for job hunting while any interest subject is of no use. Contrary to their thought, I suggest students to choose the interesting subject in addition to those basic ones.</p>
          <p>In light of comprehensive development, schools ought not to be so attached to utilitarian subjects. To young people, the interest is too important a part to ignore and most of them vary in different hobbies, which may become or contribute to their final jobs at least. On the contrary, if they only spend time in subject that is required by the employers, there will be no possibility to realize their potential. It may be a big loss if they miss their favorite job opportunities. Thus, attending interesting courses is another way to find a good jobs.</p>
          <p>Aside from job hunting, establishing some interest is also a way that promote their basic subjects. We all know that Einstein is a physicist who raise the theory of relativity. While he was troubled by some difficulties in his working area, he just played violin for relaxation and it wouldnâ€™t take long time before he found out the proper solution. It is the gentle melody that motivated his creativity that is beyond average people, thereby making it reasonable that do something people like may be another to solve many problem that seems unrelated. In other words, raising a hobbies will be vital stimulation in our career.</p>
          <p>It cannot be denied that taking these courses may reduce the time they spend in basic lessons, which leave a wrong impression that students are not allowed to waste their time on hobbies. However, as to the above-mentioned downside, I suggest students to make their annual schedule that clearly assign the time they spend in basic or extra course. In addition, schools could also make some suggestion about the selective courses that students could take into consideration according to their own needs. In this way, there is no need to worry about the time problem.</p>
          <p>The interest class are a valuable part of campus life and deserve to be treated as such, not to be put in somewhere ignored by peoples because they think they are a burden. Those courses are designed to lead a colorful and productive lives. (397 words)</p>

          <p>The question of "what is the most important subject or skill the schools should teach?" has never failed to attract attention from educators, school administrators and even politicians especially when it comes to subjects like technology, engineering and math. Some argue that students should be encouraged to take such classes rather than the ones they are interested in since they give them a better shot to find jobs. However, personally, I am not in favor of this position based on the following reasons.</p>
          <p>Admittedly, it is true that courses like technology, engineering and math are very</p>
          <p>technical, most of which can be applied in solving real world issues. However, the exposure that students have to apply these theories are very limited in class. Taking technical oriented classes will not give students a competitive edge to ensure future jobs opportunities, on the other hand, there are enormous benefits for students to take courses that they are interested in.</p>
          <p>First off, taking courses that students are interested in can be a great motivation for them to achieve higher goals. Old saying "interest is the best teacher" remains relevant as it did a century ago. Interest serves as the internal motivation for students to explore in the area that they are interested, on the contrary, if they are forced to take courses for a utilitarian purpose, they might not keep their interest for a long time thus have a lower learning efficiency. Recent study conducted by the Society of Developmental Psychology shows that students will be more enthusiastic and passionate about learning when given the freedom to make their own choices to take classes. Also, giving students the opportunity to choose the classes they are interested in can help them to explore their real interest, thus their potential can be fully tapped before heading off for career options.</p>
          <p>Additionally, taking courses students are interested in have enormous practical purposes and they can be a great source of leisure and relaxation. For instance, lots of students like art and music but seldom do they have a chance to learn. Actually, taking art and music classes help to develop creativity and make the students more imaginative. Actually, lots of scientific research in the psychological field shows that early exposure to art and music not only boosts academic achievement but also promotes creativity, self-confidence and school pride. Students who spend more time in learning art and music end up having higher analytical thinking and reasoning skills than those who don't.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, taking courses that students are interested in can be a great motivation for them to achieve higher goals and it can also be a great source of leisure and relaxation.</p>
