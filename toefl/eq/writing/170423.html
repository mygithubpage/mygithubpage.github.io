          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>Holidays with bright sunshine and golden beach are always the best image in our mind, but for young people, when they are facing the choices between part-time jobs, learning to play sports or musical instruments, most of them may feel confused. As to me, I suggest to grasp the opportunities to accumulate my working experience, <b>which have already made a mass of students great beneficiaries</b>.</p>
          <p>The first benefit is to <b>make them well-prepared for future challenges in workplace</b>. Without the experience of part-time jobs or internship, <b>students are restricted by schooling where they just learn about the theoretical knowledge</b>, regardless of how much these books are related to their future career. Clearly, <b>those fresh graduates will get a strong sense of frustration</b>. On the contrary, <b>if experiencing this gap in advance</b>, <b>they are trained to combine what they have learnt from books with the social practice</b>, <b>which eventually makes them easy when facing the realities after graduation</b>. Compared with the future benefits, the current pain, clearly, doesn’t matter.</p>
          <p>Aside from good preparation, <b>interpersonal skill is another necessity that everyone needs to attain before they entry the workplace</b>. According to the survey conducted by Academic of Social Science, those graduates who have experienced the working environment during college time for more than 3 month are triple likely to be employed than those who have never got trains before for the reason that they clearly perform much better in cooperation and leadership. We have seen too many cases how the experienced graduates avoid communication problems and push up the teamwork efficiency. I don’t think they are born with such ability, so if students want to make themselves more outstanding over their rivals, they need to take part-time job in their free time.</p>
          <p>When I talk with some parents about this issue, they think that since their kids have interest in that, it is reasonable to arrange sport and music time in their holiday. How much do they know about their school life? Actually, the students make full use of their pieces of time at school in such activities but, they hardly have chances to take part-time jobs, which usually need whole day or whole week. Accordingly, only during the holiday and vocation can they concentrate on their work.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, it is significant to encourage them to take part-time jobs. Only in this way can students really experience the huge distance between school and office and, more importantly, be well-developed into individuals.(410 words)</p>
