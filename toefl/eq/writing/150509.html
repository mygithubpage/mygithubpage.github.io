          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>Now we live in a modern world in which the competition between people and people is becoming so strong that people’s ability and knowledge are getting increasingly important. Some people think we would better master more and more knowledge in order to defeat the competitors but others take exception to it. There is a thorny debate on whether students should take history courses whatever field they study in. Although some people argue that it is not necessary to study the additional course for it will increase the burden of students' study work. However, they fail to see that history have a positive impact on their study as wellas their whole life. I am always one of those who believe that history not only can reflect culture of onecountry but also be considered as precious experience for us.</p>
          <p>Learning history could help students to <u>comprehend all- round culture of one country</u>. The Great Wall, the symbol of Chinese culture, it is not just one of Eight Wonders <b>in the world people appreciate</b>. What is more important, we are astonished and impressed by the fact that the Great Wall is the production of millions of industrious Chinese workers. It is the Great Wall that symbolizes the bravery and wisdom of Chinese people. Not only could we foster nation pride by learning history, but also we tend to appreciate the foreign cultures and value. For example, when we talk about Statue of Liberty, it could easily associate with American Revolution, which American colonies struggle for civil liberty leading to the foundation of a new nation.</p>
          <p>These are fairly precious experiences that learn from history when people deal with complex problems. Since neglecting the environmental pollution during economic development had punished human beings, a number of countries begin to focus on pollution and take efficient measures to protect the environment. For instance, Great Smog, a notable event of air pollution, caused the death of at least 4,000 Londoners and compelsthe governments to make regulations restricting the use of dirty fuels in industry and banning black smoke.Only when people really realize the importance of historical experiences and lessons can people better solve complex problems efficiently.</p>
          <p>Admittedly, by maintaining that history is significant for us, I do not attend to ignore the disadvantage of being addicted to history that it can make you lose yourself. However, if we let history guide us and learn lessons from it, a lot of problems will be solved easily.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, students would be beneficial to learning history with profound understanding of the cultureof one country as well as obtaining abundant experience for their problems-solving skills.</p>

          <p>Being the cradles of knowledge, universities courses lay an extremely solid foundation for the future development of college students. In order to help students better informed about country’s past, some educators claim that history courses should be made compulsory to all university students. Personally, I agree.</p>
          <p>Firstly, taking history courses provides students with great opportunities to see the world’s glorious and profound culture. By getting a closer look at the American revolution, a student can be enlightened, knowing the importance of equality and democracy. By learning about the history of renaissance, a student will be inspired by the core concept of humanism and precursors’ innovative spirit in terms of painting, sculpture and architecture. By understanding the four great inventions of ancient China, a student will be familiar with the traditional arts. If they only focus on their own major, they would definitely miss out on such great treasure。</p>
          <p>Secondly，taking history courses <u>promotes other subjects</u>. Imagine a literature student. His transcript was dissatisfying in the past. However, things became to change after he took the history seminar. For one thing, celebrated individuals in ancient times inspired his writing. <b>These celebrities’ qualities and achievements have a great influence on his works</b>. For another, Comprehending the historical events, he became more insightful and thoughtful. It seems clear to me that it is the history courses that enable this student to make a great progress.</p>
          <p>Admittedly，history courses, to some extent, exert more academic pressure on students. On the one hand, College students have already had to study many theories and professional subjects closely related to their majors. <b>In this case, taking history courses makes their schedules tighter</b>. On the other hand, A required histories courses would put extra financial burden on students, especially on those students who are from underprivileged families. However, this view is too nearsighted. In the long run, the benefits of taking history courses far outweigh its demerits. Just as an old Chinese saying goes, taking history as a mirror, one can judge the things form their pros and cons.</p>
          <p>Based on the above analysis, taking history courses benefits students a lot.</p>
