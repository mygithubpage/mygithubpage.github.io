          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>Education is a perpetual topic in our times. In order to make sure that children can totally focus on their schoolwork, most parents are inclined to cut their kids’ connection to any entertaining products like video games. But, when it comes to whether it’s a good way to add some lessons with video games for young students, different people hold different opinions. As far as I’m concerned, a lesson with videos games is not a good choice for those kids, since it’s a threat for both kids’ study and health.</p>
          <p>On the one hand, it would <b>distract students’ attention from study</b> that the school gives some lessons with video games. As we all know, kids are born to be curious about everything around, especially games. So, <b>it’s not surprising to observe that they’d be easily attracted by</b> those video games shown in the classroom, <b>thus getting addicted to them in their daily life</b>. <b>In this case, their priority in the school would be shifted from study to games</b>. Take my young cousin Tim as a case in point. He was 7-year-old at that time and it was his first year in the primary school. One day, for the purpose of teaching them what the racing car really was, Tim’s teacher showed them a video game on it named Need for Speed. Of course, all students were appealed to such a class. Unfortunately, most of them, including Tim, got so interested that they downloaded this game and spent lots of time playing it and even talking about it in the school. Anyway, when the academic report of that semester came out, my uncle was really pissed off. So, offering young students such a kind of lesson does bring damage to their academic performance.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, apart from affecting young kids’ study negatively, a lesson with video games also exerts detrimental effects on their health, their eyesight in particular. As we discussed a moment ago, kids could possibly get addicted to those video games and thus spend tons of time on them. What’s even worse is that staring at the screen for a long time when they play games could greatly harm young students’ eyesight. According to a survey conducted by Education Ministry of China, approximately 30% of students in the primary school in 2015 wore glasses. However, this figure in the end of last century, when the the Internet and video games just started getting popular in China, was only 8%. Therefore, the great difference between these 2 figures clearly indicates that spending too much time on games or the screen is not friendly to young kids’ health.</p>
          <p>Judging from what we’ve discussed above, I can safely draw the conclusion that it’s not a wise choice to offer young students some lessons with video games, on account of the negative effects they bring to kids’ study and health.</p>

          <p>With the constant reforms of education for young kids, the courses set for them has become an issue of concern and interest among the mass. Therefore, parents and teachers are strongly against the practice of offering video games course to young students, whereas students, the receivers of education, hold the opposite viewpoint. In my eyes, the latter opinion is my preference, with the following reasons.</p>
          <p>For starter, video game class will make teaching material more vivid and thus cultivate students’ interest in study. Just as a saying goes, interest is the best teacher, which is particularly true of younger kids. Given the indisputable fact that children aged 5 to 8 are susceptible to distractions such as chirping of birds and any noise made by other kids from the outside of class, the subjects offered to them are supposed to funny and attractive. As a result, their motivation and passion for study can be stimulated. The video game course can fulfill the above function due to its recreational nature. To be specific, the colorful images and music can be appealing to young students. Otherwise, a course full of boredom and monotony will do nothing but put a damper on the enthusiasm of students and even make them misbehave like taking a nap and wisphering in the process of teaching.</p>
          <p>Besides improving the effect of teaching, taking video game course can teach the young kids something about real life. As is common sense, the virtual world in the games are based on the real life. In the course of playing games, many useful knowledge and practical skills can be acquired. A good case in point is a group game titled League of Legends. While playing the LOL, players are divided into two groups , with each group consisting of five members. In order to achieve the common goal of winning the game, each player have to cooperate with each other by excellently fulfill their own mission. Gradually, the conception of “All for one, One for all” is instilled in players unconsciously, which does a better job than any lecturing from teachers.</p>
          <p>Admittedly, some opponents may assert that taking video game courses may make young kids become addictive, due to their week self-discipline. However, the above assertion is far from the truth. As long as students are required to take this course under the strict supervision of teachers and parents, the problem mentioned above can be solved. Consequently, taking all the factors into account, we can draw the conclusion that the benefits of offering video games classes to young kids far outweigh its demerits, especially in the aspect of fostering their interest in study and in imparting some valuable things in life.</p>

          <p>Many parents with young children fret about the addictiveness of computer games these days. While the negative effects ranging from addiction, increased aggression and various health consequences such as strain injuries get far more media coverage than the positives, there is now a wealth of research which shows that video games can actually be put into educational use and affect the brain's development.</p>
          <p>Firstly, games that are designed to help teach and "brain training" have long and enormous popular appeal. According to an experiment conducted by the University of California, game players show improved performance in perception, attention and cognition. One of the redeeming qualities of all games, even those with violent content, is enhanced information-processing, logic-thinking and problem-solving abilities in novel contexts. In fact, while playing game, your brain is in the learning mode constantly, to move to the next level, you are vigorously improving your hand-eye coordination, enhancing split-second decision making and boosting auditory perception. Moreover, other carefully-designed studies have shown that video games improve several aspects of brain activity, including multitasking. Considering Pac-Man as an example, in that game, you must navigate your character through a spatial layout while monitoring the separate paths of four additional objects, while keeping the overall goal of clearing the small pellets in memory, as well as keep track of the remaining large pellets.</p>
          <p>Secondly, games that convey positive social messages never fail to boost the children's confidence, encourage cooperation and teamwork. Games help children feel a sense of achievement, through those puzzles, exploration and discovery, players learn to succeed in ways that our brains actually prefer. Most games are designed to introduce a new concept and then provide players with an opportunity to master it. Children are then free to explore and utilize and achieve success with this new skill, growing in confidence all the while. Besides, many games today emphasize the cooperative aspects of game play, in which two or more players need to work together to reach a common goal. Taking a game called "World of Warcraft" as an example, children as young as 10 years old are learning to delegate responsibility, promote teamwork and steer groups of people toward a common goal. As video games themselves are not created by just one person, it is essential for the game players to pool everyone's talents together in order to require the desired product.</p>
          <p>Admittedly, it is worth to consider the real concerns that today's parents have with video games, but it is also worthwhile to consider the benefits and positive aspects that contemporary interactive entertainment choices provide. Digital media such as computer games could inspire young children's interest, grow their intelligence and offer them a chance to escape from the mounting academic stress, as long as coupled with strong parental and teacher involvement.</p>
          <p>From all the discussions mentioned above, we may safely draw the conclusion that today's young students should be allowed to play computer games for the tremendous benefits they bring.</p>
