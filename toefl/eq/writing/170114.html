          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p><b>There is large quantity of students who spend their spare time to do volunteer work mainly as a consequence of</b> the requirement of credit or some working experience. Still, that totally makes no sense. Even though I am not a university students now, given the choice, I would choose to learn some knowledge that different from my own major.</p>
          <p><b>Wide range of social circle</b> is the first benefit when they learn various subjects. All what we do in the society like starting a business and <b>fulfill the ambition in career depend on abundant social resources</b>. <b>The social circle, which provides the greatest help in promoting our work and life, needs to be set up</b> when we are in the university. Various classes <b>are exactly the way that create chances for us to</b> meet friends in various fields. On the contrary, if restricted in own world, we get along with small range of friends who share the same skills and knowledge. When we meet some trouble in future career, it’s merely impossible to cooperate with them. <b>For the sake of future development, making friends through this way is a great opportunity to</b> expand our pool of companions.</p>
          <p><b>Aside from making friends</b> who are separate from our core social circle, <b>another advantage is that</b> what we learn in other fields may <b>have great contributions to our original major</b>. <b>There is no such subject that can establish without any other field.</b> I am a sociological students, who were asked to learn some statistics that seems irrelevant but actually, help me a lot when I do some social researches. I might not finish my thesis before graduation if the professor had not ask us to take statistics courses. I really don’t see anything wrong with the students taking the courses that have no connection with their major <b>whether they are truly interested in it or just for the sake of</b> annual paper or examinations.</p>
          <p>Two years ago, I interviewed some of those students why they took volunteer work in holidays, I found the leading reason was that they wanted to accumulate working experiences. <b>It sounds reasonable but actually</b>, most students apply for the job that is far away from what they did voluntarily before. According to a recent survey conducted by my professor, who is a specialist in research of employment, no more than 7% involved students choose their final job as what their social practice did and most of them have totally different ideas from their original thoughts when they were in campus. Since the working experience from volunteer <b>has no business to</b> their final career, <b>what is the rationale behind this choice?</b></p>
          <p>There is nothing wrong with doing volunteer work in holiday. For the best future development, though, learning different knowledge and skills is the better way to enrich our life. (469 words)</p>
