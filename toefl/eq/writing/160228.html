          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>For parents, how to well plan their children’s development has been a huge problem. While some children are given more time on technological gadgets, others are more inclined to choose some activities, such as going camping or traveling. For me, the former option would be a better one.</p>
          <p>Admittedly, playing simpler toys or playing outside might be good choice for children. Simpler toys, namely Lego, are a good way to develop children’s thinking on solving the problem through block by block. By assembling the pieces for different blocks, children could assemble an even big piece, such as the classic London Tower Bridge. Also, playing sports or even solve problems. However, on balance, both of these ways are limited in helping children. Toys and outdoor activities are restrained to their actual forms: parents need lots of money to buy different toys to help children develop, and they pay a great amount of money on helping their children for different activities. For those parents who suffer from financial burden, these are not effective ways for children’s development. Comparatively, technology would be a more effective way for children.</p>
          <p>Firstly, Internet via computers and smartphone <u>are essential for their development</u>. In other words, Internet provides students with vast amount of information. According to a recent survey conducted by Gallup, after poling thousands of students from local high schools, most respondents claim that Internet is the NO. 1 helper fro them to finish homework. When they have problems, they would search reference on Internet. Websites such as Google Scholar would be a wonderful tool for them to find some papers or academic reference for their homework. Meanwhile, Internet is a wonderful place for them to entertain as well. They could watch movies on Youku.com. They could even find interesting stories on sina.com. All funny experiences are available on Internet without causing children too much money.</p>
          <p>In addition, video games are also necessary for children’s growth. When children are playing video games, they might learn some strategic thinking. For example, when I am playing FIFA 2016, I have to manage my team members according to their physical strength so that I could beat other teams. For those who run quickly, it would be a good idea for them to play forward; for those who are tall and strong, they would be better playing middle field. Because of this team management strategy, I have achieved many titles in the game. Learning from this, I would allocate my time in finishing homework according to my energy level. When I am energetic, I might choose the most difficult homework; if I am tired, I might choose some easy-to-do task, which would not cost me much time.</p>
          <p>To conclude, while playing toys or spending time on outdoor activities is a good way for their development, technology would be a better way.</p>
