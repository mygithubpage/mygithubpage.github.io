          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>With the society becoming increasingly complex, we make numerous decisions every single day, some of which are simple while others of which are more complex. The issue whether Spending a long time in making an important decision is often considered as a good quality has triggered a hot debate. Personally speaking, my answer towards this question is negative, that is, making quick decision is good, for the following reasons.</p>
          <p>First of all, making quick decisions can help people grasp the precious opportunities. As is known to all, change is the permanent topic in nearly every area of life including day-to-day life and business world. In other words, the opportunities may vanish in the blink of an eye. As a result, people who spend much time pondering different paths for the fear of making errors may end up missing out the chances. On the contrary, quick decision making will boost the likelihood of seizing the opportunities, which makes his or her have an edge over other competitors. This is especially true of the business competition. In the commercial world, To illustrate, a decisive leader will not block subordinates from getting things done and thus. For example, if an entrepreneur finds changes in the needs of customers, there is a need of quick decisions to satisfy their new demand. Without quick response to the appeals of the clients, competitors around the same business may take the initiative to make headway in these emerging markets.</p>
          <p>Apart from that, making quick decisions reflects the strong ability of analysis of a person. As is common sense, analytical skills is a basis for quick decision making. As you can see, an analytical skill is the ability of a person to draw conclusions and to make quality decisions based on incomplete information. Put it in another way, the characteristic of analytical people is to address all of the critical elements needed for a successful outcome more quickly than average persons can do. Consequently, these decisive people will leave a good impression on others and thus improve their charisma. By contrast, spending too much time in making decisions means that you can only make up your mind after collecting all the information. This practice may make others feel that you are hesitant in doing things.</p>
          <p>Admittedly, some opponents may assert that it is a good quality to spend a long time in decision-making, because the quality of the decision certainly depends on the speed of making it. However, the above claim has overlooked a fact that no matter how much time you spend making a decision, there is always a chance that it wonâ€™t turn out the way you had envisioned. In this case, the quick decision making can help you more timely fix the wrong decisions.</p>
          <p>In a nutshell, spending long time in decision making is anything but a good quality, because people will let opportunities slip off and leave an indecisive impression on others. (488 words)</p>
