          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>Some people think that teenagers are supposed to try various activities such as musical classes and sports classes besides compulsory school courses. Whereas others hold a different view that it is very important for teenagers to train their concentration ability by focusing on one activity. I totally agree with the former idea for the following reasons.</p>
          <p>Firstly, participating in a wide array of activities can promote students’ ability in all aspects. Besides of acquiring knowledge in one particular field, the most important thing students should learn is the capability they apply in these activities, which cannot be provided by one single class. In sports classes like football and basketball, students learn to communicate and cooperate with others properly. And in math interest groups, teenagers enhance their ability to solve tough problems and think from different angles to find the best solution. Each class cultivates teenagers in a different way, which encourage students to have well-rounded development.</p>
          <p>In addition, taking part in all kinds of classes is <b>one of the best ways for students to locate their interest and personal development directions</b>. As the saying goes, interest is the best teacher, and it is the interest that can really inspire and encourage children to explore one particular field constantly and profoundly on their own. <b>Without trying various activities, one can never know what they are truly interested in and good at</b>.</p>
          <p>However, people who hold the opposite view argue that concentration is one of the vital traits one should be equipped and it is best to be developed during adolescent period. In fact, concentration is not equal to focusing on only one thing, in means that one can be focused on the job he is currently doing and at the same time, have the ability to transfer quickly from one task to another. What’s more, it is true one should have their study directions but that should be carried out in the university. As for teenagers, they are supposed to experience all kinds of activities before they make up their mind to concentrate on one particular area.</p>
          <p>To conclude, students should look for their interest and develop their ability in all aspects through various activities during their adolescence, and focus on one direction several years later in the university. (378words)</p>

          <p>In their free time, young people (age14-18) spend time taking part in  different activities such as music lessons or competitive sports. Some young people devote their time in other kinds of activities. But other young people will spend most of their time focusing on one activity that is important to them. Which approach do you think is better?</p>
          <p>　　The old saying “all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy” still remains relevant as it did centuries ago. The question of what kind of extra curriculum activities should kids do after school has never failed to attract spotlight. Should they focus on one single activity or is it better for them to devote their time to various activities. Personally, I think it is in the kids’ best interest to get involved in multiple kinds of activities based on the following reasons.</p>
          <p>　　First off, doing various activities makes the kids bored and more extra curriculum activities mean that they enjoy a better chance to try different things and find their real interest. For instance, playing sports all the time will probably drive the kids crazy since they can be very energy consuming and it might lead to injuries in their bones and joints. One’s meat might be others’ poison, indeed nobody really knows what their preference lies in unless they are given the opportunities to do different activities. Actually switching from one activity to another gives the kids the opportunity to explore their real interest and tap their unknown potential. A kid who lacks of flexibility and coordination when doing sport might be talented in playing chess while one who cannot concentrate in the classroom might be very gifted in playing sports. Trying out different activities can help kids to find something they are really interested in and eventually they can develop and build up confidence.</p>
          <p>　　Additionally，students can develop lots of useful skills and release their pressure in life and study if they do different activities. For example, playing group sports can help them to get comfortable teaming up with others and develop cooperation awareness. This kind of experience and awareness can help them get prepared for future jobs since willingness to cooperate and coordinate is regarded as a very valuable quality and working together with others are necessary for the future working environment. Plus, learning music and how to play piano can help someone to develop a taste in music. Music can serve as a source of comfort and love, at the same time it is conducive to release negative emotions like sorrow, depression and even anger.</p>
          <p>　　In conclusion, it is more advisable for kids to do various activities since it helps kids to explore their interest and tap their potential, more importantly it can help kids to develop useful skills and get them prepared for future jobs.</p>

          <p>Everyone is longing for success; therefore, everyone eagerly searches for every method to reach that end. Having an inclusive and colorful experience from multiple activities would definitely serve as a good panacea for children who want to achieve something in the life. However, there are people who hold the opposite opinion, believing that mastering only one and mastering it well would bring more benefits than being engaged in multiple activities.</p>
          <p>　　Admittedly, a kid participating in multiple activities may guarantee the comprehensive development of kids. Music classes may teach students how to appreciate music; arts classes may teach kids to depict the beautiful world with their hands; sports classes may help shape a strong body, etc. However, it may put much pressure on kids;besides, children may gain nothing real ability instead of mastering a true ability. This is not beneficial to the sustainable development of students in a long term.</p>
          <p>　　On the one hand, participating in just one activity can cultivate students to be tenacious and persistent. Students are at a crucial stage to form and shape their value and attitude toward themselves and the world at large. Participating one major activity helps them to have a clear goal and exert efforts on it, during which they may learn to deal with all kinds of frustrations and hardships. With the trials and errors, students get to know what to expect for their future. For example, a lot of famous and successful people in the world are all devoted to one activity at their young age. Mozart, the genius musician in particular, only practiced the piano during this young age and became famous thereafter. Thus, participating in one major activity can train and cultivate students' tenacity and persistence.</p>
          <p>　　On the other hand, one may become more professional by engaging just in one major activity. Participating in one activity can help one get the knowledge and experience in depth. Being professional in a certain field. Instead of taking part in many activities, focusing on one major activity provides a time for one to get close to it and absorb the essence. Students will become more focusing on other things, like study. According to a survey conducted by World Youth Association, the students perform better in most aspects of life who participate in one major activity for a long time than those who are not. Therefore, it is conducive to cultivate students' concentration and professionalism.</p>
          <p>　　In a nutshell, although taking part in multiple activities may offer some benefits, it is the single activity that cultivate the tenacious character and professionalism.</p>
