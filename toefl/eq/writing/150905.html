          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>Nowadays, for the economic development of a city, the government place undue emphasis on how to boost its tourism industry. While some experts show their enthusiasm on selling their cities to outside tourists by publicizing good social security via recruiting more police, <b>I hold a different opinion</b>, from my perspective, improving old buildings and streets is a better alternative.</p>
          <p>Admittedly, hiring more police might be useful in attracting tourists. When government is focusing on recruiting more policemen, these new recruiters would be helpful in improving social security standards. Thanks to the improved standards, more visitors might be relieved about the city when paying a visit to the city; hence the cityâ€™s reputation would be enhanced. However, on balance, only focusing on police while not improving building places of interests is not enough. Without places about culture or places for amusement parks, visitors still would not come even if social security is good. To attract more visitors, a more effective way would be to improve old buildings.</p>
          <p>To begin with, improving old buildings helps preserve old cultures. In other words, more visitors would love to visit places cultural value so the maintenance of old buildings is attractive to them. For example, when Beijing government begins to repair the Great Wall, the symbol of diligence of ancient Chinese people, the experts pay great attention to building the wrecked walls and restoring some stone relics. Meanwhile, they reshape some broken bricks for the steps so that visitors could step onto the Great Wall. As a result, an increasing number of visitors from foreign countries come to Beijing to watch the marvelous Great Wall building on top of piles of mountains. On the contrary, if hiring more police, though government would again reputation for their good management in social security, it would not add to any cultural attraction.</p>
          <p>In addition, improving the streets makes it convenient for tourists. That's is to say, tourists would love to visit places with convenient facilities. According to a survey conducted on Sina Weibo, after polling hundreds of tourists from the National Holiday, a significant percentage of them claim that when deciding a place as their touring destination, they are more likely to choose a city with broader streets. In their minds, when the city is built with convenient streets and beautiful auxiliary facilities, this urban planning would give tourists a sense of modernism and make them feel go into colorful metropolitan life. With these perfect streets, public transport would be convenient for them to visit both in city and around city.</p>
          <p>To sum up, due to the reasons I lost above, I would regard that by perfecting streets and maintaining old buildings, government would be more likely to attract tourists to visit the city.</p>
