        <h4>Question</h4>
        <p>Imagine that a professor requires students to learn as much as possible about a subject in a short period of life. Is it better for the professor to require students to work together in a group or is it better to require students to work alone?</p>

          <p>There is quite a strange phenomenon that students who work in team will be regard as “free riders”: They do nothing but when their team get a good job, they will be honored and rewarded as well. However, that is truly a ridiculous idea. Heroes like Avengers could not finish their tasks without team members, let alone our average students. In my point of view, students should be allow to conduct their project by virtue of cooperation.</p>
          <p>First off, a group of students <b>has a wider range of knowledge, expertise and skills, thereby truly shortening the time</b> they otherwise spend individually. Division in work enables everyone to work on certain fields that they are good at. I still remember the time when my team and I conducted a survey in sociology class. Fortunately, we finished the task ahead of time because we are respectively assigned by several work like information collection, questionnaire design and data statistics. Everyone has their own advantages and shortcomings, so working in a team allows students to full play their superiorities and eventually, increase the efficiency.</p>
          <p>Aside the efficiency, <b>group working is a good opportunity to develop interpersonal skills</b>. It is not uncommon that many students lack the ability to get along with others. While the internet brings abundant information to children that makes their study more productive, it simultaneously creates a kind of people called “Otaku”: they are less social and afraid to get alone with others. Still, working in group is a way to push them out of their inner world. They need to share some ideas and thoughts with others as well as listen to others’ opinion, during which they have to face the situation that they otherwise avoid. Given such opportunity, teachers could make great progress in helping students to open their mind.</p>
          <p>At last, some may claims that team working may have one or two downsides. For example, they may give priority to something trivial rather than academic, thereby decreasing the teaching efficiency. However, in light of the above-mentioned possibility, I suggest teachers to make a detailed schedule to rule what topics to include or exclude in class and make the deadline for students to attract their concentration. That way we can make sure that students will finish their team work on time.</p>
          <p>All in all, teachers should truly persuade students to attend the team working. All what they do in group will bring unimaginable benefits, of which the reasons above is just a tip of the iceberg.</p>

          <p>Educators and researchers have never stopped the examination of the importance and relevance of collaborative learning that are encouraged by middle schools. When compared with studying alone, I personally believe that it is far more beneficial to students when working in groups for the following reasons.</p>
          <p>First off, working in a group finishing group projects can be very conducive for students since they can help students to study more effectively and get exposure in real-world issues. If teachers categorize students and organize them in small study groups, chances are that they would solve complex issues together, like research the history of the city, examine the water quality of the local town, so on and so forth. Students can develop critical thinking skills as well as learn to collect and analyze information from multiple sources. A recent study conducted by the University of Minnesota backed up the claim that study teams, collaborative learning and group projects are far more effective in helping students to develop useful skills than traditional teacher-led teaching approach. In fact, when learning in groups, students have to do some research about the topic they are expected to discuss beforehand, which helps them to clear up some misunderstandings and boast their enthusiasm of academic exploration.</p>
          <p>Additionally, as the saying goes: "many hands make light work", actually it remains as relevant today as it did a century ago. Working in groups has much deeper implications beyond students' academic experience, to be more specific, it helps to develop skills like cooperation, organization and leadership. When learning in a group, every single student gets a chance to contribute their knowledge to the group, they can learn to appreciate the work of other simultaneously. What's more, they have to work closely with others for the same goal otherwise they might not be able to compete with other study groups. More importantly, students will get exposure to distinctive perspectives and at the same time learn how to accept different points of view and find common ground in this process. Such an educational experience will not only be helpful for their future study but also beneficial to them when they have to deal with coworkers, clients, and teammates in a professional setting in the future. Numerous studies have shown that students who have prior experience working with others enjoy a better chance to be successful in their future career.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, working together in a group has far more meaningful implications than working alone since collaborative learning helps students to learn much more effectively and develop important skills that are vital for their future study and career.</p>

          <p>Nowadays, people are facing ﬁerce competition in schools and at work, which makes it more difficult for people to with the past. Some people argue that in order to achieve success, people should be open-minded and accept new ideas whereas others prefer to stick to the existing plan and refuse to make a change. Based on what I have learned about this topic, it is better to accept new ideas and take some risks to become successful. </p>
          <p>To begin with, accepting new ideas enables people to seize the opportunity. With the development of modern technology and the advancing of new industries, people now have increasing new opportunities when choosing their future career. Inspired by new ideas and innovations, many people become successful after they started a career that is unprecedented in history. Jack Ma\'s story serves as a perfect example in this case. Jack Ma, the founder of Alibaba, was an English major student in college and became an English teacher after graduation. Soon he learned from a friend that a new type of business referred to as “e-commerce" sprung up in Western countries, and he believes that this online-based business will be promising in the world market. Therefore, he started his own business and founded the company, namely Alibaba. With his strong leadership and the ability to foresee the trends in the ﬁeld of ecommerce, he now becomes one of the most successful businessmen in this century. His example clearly shows how rewarding it is to accept new ideas and make a change. </p>
          <p>Moreover, our visions will be limited if we are too stubborn to change our mind. This is not only true in business but also in the ﬁeld of scientiﬁc research. As a student majored in linguistics, I have learned the importance of conducting interdisciplinary research. However, some professors prefer to stick to their own ﬁeld of research and refuse to cooperate with professors in other subjects. As a result, it becomes extremely diﬃcult for this group of professors to propose new hypotheses or theories, let alone to make a breakthrough in the ﬁeld of linguistics. </p>
          <p>To sum up, being willing to accept new ideas is an essential factor than contributes to our success. And I believe that in diﬀerent ﬁelds, it is always necessary for us to take some risks and be creative.</p>
