          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>People get sick and people go to see a doctor. However, being hospitalized in a public hospital in my country may not be a rosy picture. So when my friend Cherry’s mother-in-law got sick, I just offered my time to help with some errands. Like other patients, that old lady got a little scared and bored in the ward. That’s why she needed to talk with someone all the time. When Cherry went out to deal with some paperwork, I stayed there and listened to the old lady’s talk. I showed up and was there to help. That’s my way of being comforting when my friend’s family member was sick. (110 words)</p>

          <p>Well, I think I would do the following things to comfort him: first, have a long conversation with him; coz companion is the best therapy for a distressed person; and listening to his worries and anxiety patiently surely helps alleviate his bad energy. Second, I will encourage him to ask for a leave and go back to see his family. If that is inconvenient, I would then suggest him attend some special activities, like joining parties or taking a short trip abroad, coz those activities will help to divert his attention and boost up spirit.</p>

          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>Some people claim that high school graduates should enter the university immediately after commencement. However, I believe that a gap year between high school and the university should be inspiring, that students can use the time to figure out what they want with their lives. Take my friend Calvin as an example. Before he went to college, he flied to Africa to be a language trainer for children of the locals. Born a bilingual, his knowledge of both English and Chinese made him the most popular trainer among the children. He was inspired and found his true interest in education which became his major one year later. (107 words)</p>

          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>Well, I agree that senior students take a gap year before entering college. First, the good thing about a gap year is that you can slow down, and think over what you want to achieve in your 4-year college. In China, students are usually burned out especially after the fiercely competing national college entrance exam; so one gap year will definitely help them to unwind and adjust to the upcoming college life in a better way; second, during the one year, they can travel abroad, take some internship or part time, any of those experiences can help them to have a much clearer goal about future and ensure a better performance in college.</p>
