          <p>One feature of my country China I’d like to talk about is the astonishingly large population. Though the economy benefits a lot from the labor market, there are troubles in our daily life. Like when the spring festival is APproaching each year, millions of people working in more developed areas, like Guangdong, will have to travel back to their hometowns by train. That’s a whole lot pressure on the national public transportation system. No wonder so many people have a vivid memory about how you have to elbow your way through the crowded waiting rooms, trying to get to the checking points and restrooms.</p>

          <p>Well, I don't think there is any cuisine as delicious as the Chinese cuisine. China boasts one of the world’s greatest cuisines and Chinese food is famous all over the world. So I think it is the thing that makes China different from other countries. There are two main different points. The first point is Chinese people’s pursuit of culinary excellence. I bet you will be shocked by the surprising range and variety of ingredients of Chinese cuisine. Compared with other countries, China has countless delicious and fantastic dishes, such as Kung Pao Chicken, Mapo Tofu, and Beijing Roast Duck. And the second point is Chinese people’s attitude towards food. As old Chinese saying goes “Food is the first necessity of the people” which shows that food occupies a decisive position in the Chinese people’s life. Food have become an integral part of Chinese culture, and we Chinese are proud of our food culture. (154 words)</p>

        <h4>Question</h4>
        <p>Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: It is easier to teach students in primary school than it is to teach students in university?</p>

          <p>　For me, having youngsters aged over 18 as students is definitely more challenging. As a college teacher, you will face much more pressure on your academic performance and teaching methodology, since these students have pulled through national entrance examination. In other words, they are equipped with better knowledge input and have high expectation for you. For example, in order to get well prepared for an American fiction selected reading class, a teacher should get highly familiar with related materials and try to predict pointed questions raised by the students, making sure you can deliver a smooth lecture.</p>

          <p>Personally, I couldn't agree more with this statement, college students are easier to teach. To begin with, they have laid a solid foundation in lots of subjects already, like math, physics, and chemistry. Primary school students don't have the basic knowledge in these subjects, thus they are hard to teach. Additionally, college students tend to have the motivation to learn, they can learn conscientiously and finish their assignment on time, like group project, presentations, research papers and stuff. On the contrary, primary school kids lack of the desire to learn more and they are a handful, so they might interrupt the teacher, walk around the classroom.(106 words)</p>
