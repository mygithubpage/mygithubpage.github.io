          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>If my school is making any improvements on school facilities, I'd go for swimming pool. To begin with, I always liked swimming, but my school’s swimming pool wasn't exactly what I wanted. It's outdated and dirty, and they don't refresh the water frequently, I'd like to swimming there more if they made any improvement to the pool. Another point I'd like to indicate is: it would encourage students to do exercise, especially in summer. We all know that students now all lack exercise, we got to admit that major part of the reasons why people don't like it is that it's too hot to do sports, we get sweaty after playing basketball, football. But when we know that we have a nice swimming pool, we'd jump right in!</p>

          <p>From where I stand, I think the university should build a cafeteria with a lot features to attract more to come to rest. Firstly, cafeterias on campus are places for students to rest legs and study most of the time. Students sit together in a circle having sandwiches while talking about the assignments and experiments, in which the atmosphere would be quite harmonious. As a result, a cafeteria will give students one more place to stay during the break of two classes either on the daytime or at night.</p>

        <p>Which one of the two patterns would help people to know each other better, meeting at the first sight or through long-term relationship?</p>

          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>　I personally think people will get to know each other better through long-term relationship. There are several reasons I would like to mention. Firstly, it seems impossible for us to know a person at the first time. There are so many uncertainties left to discover. Take personality for example, people would naturally behave themselves or becoming stressed at the very first time of meeting. Secondly, if two individuals cannot build a bond between them, they wouldn’t give or show the true self to each other. Then they will not understand each other.</p>

          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>　Well, personally, I think it is more advisable to get to know a person by long time observation. As the saying goes time tries all, and I think this is also true with regard of getting to know someone. One might not be able to learn the real characteristics or personalities of that person on the first sight since the person might be a little shy and he or she might not behaving in the way they normally do, and it is not very reliable since that person might have a bad day and he is kind of grumpy on that day, so you cannot conclude that he is a unhappy person. He was just angry because of the bad things happened on that day.</p>
