            <h4>Sample Response</h4>
            <p>I think my friend can just get rid of the worries. First, living cost in most cities in China is not that high as western countries. Take my hometown as an example, five to six thousand yuan is sufficient for monthly living expenses including the rental fee and other living expenses, which is not a huge financial burden. If my friend has a really tight budget, I will suggest him or her to keep eyes on some part time jobs to gain extra income, like teaching English to Chinese students, she will definitely make enough bucks to afford this trip.</p>

            <h4>Sample Response</h4>
            <p>I would convince her to forgo the worries; first, compared with western countries, living cost in most cities of China is negligible like if he doesn't have a big purchase plan, around 10,000 yuan is sufficient for living in BJ comfortably for a whole month, so it wouldn't be a huge financial burden; second, if my friend is really suffering from a tight budget, I will offer my help, like provide accommodation and meals for her, if she is interested in staying in China for a longer period of time, I would suggest her to keep eyes open on some part time jobs, like teaching English to Chinese students, in that case, she will definitely make enough bucks to afford this trip.</p>

          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>I think it’s not cool to use cellphones on dinner tables. If you are having dinner with your friends just being with them instead of focusing on your phones, or your friend will feel less respected. For example, last Saturday when I was having dinner with one of my friends Chloe and she was keeping answering the phone and texting messages I felt so ignored and disrespected and not be willing to hang out with her any more. Also, people nowadays are always connected; we rarely get a chance to have a face-to-face conversation with friends and families. Dinner tables are the ideal place for us to talk with our loved ones.</p>

          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>I think it’s indeed impolite to make calls or send text messages on a diner table. Last Friday, my friend Daniel asked me out to dinner together, after we sat down, he kept answering phone calls like a hundred times and was busy staring at his phone and sending numerous text messages, I felt awful, sitting there like an idiot! That was how I felt, totally ignored, disrespected and belittled. I thought he just didn't respect my feelings and time!! What is the purpose of asking me out, while keeping answering phone calls? I will never ever go outside to dinner with him again!</p>
