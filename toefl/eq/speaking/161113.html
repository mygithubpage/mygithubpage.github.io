          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>Well I think being friendly is the most valuable. Coz first, I am an introverted person and busy with my study, and I really don't know, nor do I want to spend a lot of time, wondering how to deal with someone who is indifferent, aggressive, or even hostile; complicated interpersonal relationship is simply too time and energy consuming for me; considering you have to live together under the same roof for at least one semester, a good relation is really crucial; second, I think being friendly means a smooth and open communication between us; that would be a blessing, we could treat each other like siblings, have fun together, learn from each other and help each other if any of us is in trouble.</p>

          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>I think being friendly is the most important quality for a roommate. Primarily, a friendly person is no wonder much easier to communicate, thus some arguments and quarrels can be avoided. We can set rules at the very beginning and talk to each other when having disagreement. What’s more, a friendly roommate will be really helpful when we are far away from our parents and friends. Just like my roommate Alice, she’s so kind and always willing to give a hand when I’m in trouble. For example, I sprained my wrist last weekend and it is she who took me to the hospital and took care of me for the whole week until I felt better. I’m so lucky to have a friendly roommate like her.</p>

          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>Frankly speaking, I prefer to buy used books. Firstly, it is more economical. I remember when I was in the university, the textbooks are really expensive and even a single book can cost me a quarter of my life allowance, so I chose to get them from the students who have already taken the courses with quite reasonable prices and I passed on the books through to other students who need them. Though I am working now and earning quite decent salary, I still prefer to go to the second-hand bookstores or get some used books from my friends. I believe what matters is the content of the book instead of the appearance. And buying used books is definitely more friendly to our environmental.</p>

          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>　I would prefer to use second-hand books. Coz first it is environmental-friendly; considering the increasingly severe environmental pollution, if all of us began to use second-hand books, numerous trees or timber could be saved; second, we could learn much from a second-hand book, coz its previous owner may have noted down a lot of important theories or explanation on the pages, so that would help you to learn faster; for example, last semester, I bought a second-hand chemistry book, with a really thorough and meticulous notes system, which helps me to master the course quickly, and eventually I got an A in the final exam.</p>

          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>I would say I prefer to buy used books. As a college student, professors sometimes require students to buy textbooks, and most of the time, the textbooks can be really expensive, and you might easily spend over $100 on a single book. My top priority is to budget my money effectively and try to make ends meet, after all，I have to cover living expense, buy textbooks and pay my tuitions and stuff. Additionally, used books have notes on it; by referring to these notes I think it is easier for me to understand some complicated ideas and concepts. So based on these reasons, I find it more reasonable to buy used books.</p>

          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>For me, I would prefer to work for a company first. When I just get started, just after graduation, what I lack must be experience. I need years of practice and observation to understand how the market works and to acquire basic skills. And maybe if there's a chance in the future, after learning what I should about the business I'm interested in, I would consider opening up my own business. Besides, I'm not a very confident person to take all the risks in the market, running a company means both freedom and responsibility. In this case working for a company just seems safer. So chances are, I mostly choose to be an employee rather an employer. </p>
