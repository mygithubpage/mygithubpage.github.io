          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>As far as I’m concerned, I’m interested in taking the course of science history due to the following reasons. Firstly, I’m fond of science and good at learning this subject. In order to know more about science, I think it’s necessary to acquire some information and knowledge about the history of science. So taking this course will definitely help answer the questions in my mind efficiently. Besides, science history will also give me some directions based on which I will be able to decide what specific major I’d better take in the university.</p>

          <p>I choose to take the art history. At first, the reading, listening, and even the integrated writing part of TOEFL focus a lot on this topic. If I could take this course, I could increase my background knowledge of this subject, which in turn would help me to better understand the context and then gain a good grade. Another reason I wanna take such a course is that I’m really interested in arts and want to have some common topics while talking with those art majors. Because of my interest, I took part in the arts club in my university. But most members are from the art department. So, my lack of expertise always made myself awkward when invited to discuss on a certain topic.</p>

          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>Personally, I would like to learn art history. First and foremost, art is a big part of our lives, it is the expression of the humanity. Without it, we would have no hope, no aspirations, no joy, just nothing meaning and enlightening. Additionally, in a art history class, I get a chance to appreciate the famous art work created by great artists, and thus I can develop my artistic taste. Plus, by appreciating these beautiful art work, I will get a break from the stresses of work and study.</p>

          <p>　I prefer to make a plan in advance. By doing so, we could possibly attract more people to join us and have more fun. Since we’re required to discuss on how to arrange this activity, it’s possible for us to turn to other friends for help. And there is a good chance that some of our friends who’re not invited or supposed to join us could get interested. In other words, we may have more people on our team and have fun together. For example, one day some of my classmates decided to hold a badminton match. When I tried to borrow some rackets from my friends in another class, surprisingly, he showed great interest and even brought some of his friends to join us. Anyway, we had a really great time together.</p>

          <p>　Well, personally, I prefer to make plans about social activities. To begin with, if I don't make plans ahead of time, there will be obvious drawbacks. It might throw me off my tight schedule, you know, as a college student, sometimes, I am overwhelmed with all kinds of assignment, like presentations, group projects and stuff. Additionally, if I don't make a plan, things might not work in a way I want it to be. For example, if I just randomly decide to travel together with my friends without careful planning, we might not even have a hotel to live in since it might be booked out. So, we'd better make a plan, book the hotel and then figure out the itinerary.</p>
