        <h4>Question</h4>
        <p>If you are a teacher of a tutor group and you are going to take students to a study trip, where would you take them to? A science museum, a local farm, or a theatre performance?</p>

          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>If I were the teacher, I’d take my students to a local farm for sure. With the great leap forward of urbanization, most kids lose the opportunity to learn about our mother nature unwittingly. As a teacher myself, I couldn’t remember how many times I threw out the question “tell me about your favorite animal” with uncomfortably long pauses. My students find it tough to answer the question from direct experience. They aren’t able to list typical features of those animals or their living habits or anything! What a shocking fact! So I’d love to provide my students a chance to get closer to those warm creatures and soft grasslands than to cold machines and concrete streets.</p>

        <p>Agree or disagree that students should take some additional courses so that they can get their credits more quickly?</p>

          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>Personally speaking, taking additional courses shouldn't be encouraged at school. To begin with, the purpose of attending school is not only limited to obtaining credits and degrees, but also taking time to ponder on the moment of truth and take pleasure to swim in the sea of knowledge. Extra time and energy could spill over better places like reading extensively as well as intensively on areas of interest, and participating in all sorts of seminars to learn from established professors and curious peers. Besides, school is a wonderful place to meet like-mind souls and appreciate the attractiveness of differences. Spending more time learning from people around you is much more valuable than getting lost in the hustle and bustle of earning credits.</p>
