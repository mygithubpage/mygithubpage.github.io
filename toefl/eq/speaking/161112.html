          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>Personally speaking, I think the class of film studies is the most attractive. Coz first, movies are really popular among students, and watching movies is actually a great way for us to unwind and blow off steam after a long day study; so taking movie classes can actually help us to better appreciate them, like we could learn different movie genres, the professional use of lenses or shade and light, the style of different directors and their best pictures; it also offers us a different perspective about movies, like what did the critics say about them, and what are the stories behind the scene. I think the class would be really fascinating.</p>

          <p>Well，I would like to choose film study for sure. For one thing, film is something that can attract most of the students rather than the other two options because they watch films as an entertainment often. Sound history and history of rock music are more professional and they really sounds a little bit boring actually. To be more specific, take me as an example, as an English major, I chose a movie appreciation class in my university, those wonderful films such as Forrest Gump really impressed me a lot with its perfect story and the American history background. Films can really teach you not only serious knowledge but also the truth about life which I consider students would like to treat seriously. (124 words)</p>

          <p>Well, personally, I would say adding rock and roll class is the best option. I am a big fun of rock and roll, and it is very interesting to learn its origin and history. In this class, students might get a chance to appreciate different kinds of rock and roll, this is gonna be very cool. Rock and roll involves lots of thrashing guitars, insane lyrics and even frenetic drumming, and listening to rock and roll is a great way to release pressure and destructive emotions, like sorrow, depression and even anger. All in all, adding rock and roll is the best option among these three.</p>

          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>I would recommend the film studies class. Sure, many students enjoy music, but both recording and history Of music seem a bit tedious, maybe too professional for lots Of students. On the other hand, I'm certain film study is a serious course - but film classes always include showing movies and telling stories behind them, which most students like! For example, I remember when I was in college, one Of my professors opened an optional course named European Film Studies. At first he worried that not a lot would sign up for it, but it turned out to be a big class held in a lecture hall. I mean, people always enjoy stories. And form my experience, a bit Of professional and academic opinions provided in courses never seem to bore the audience. </p>

          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>Personally, I would like to start up my own business instead of working for others. First off, I am a very sociable and easygoing person, and this is a very good quality, which can help me to stay connected with lots of people and they are definitely going to be very helpful for my business. Besides, I have a natural instinct of a entrepreneur and my business acumen will surely help me to spot the best deal. However, working for others is boring and one doesn’t have lot of freedom, actually I will be under a lot of constraint like career glass ceiling, rigid working hours and lots of time commitment.</p>

          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>I definitely choose to work in a company as a young people. As you know, experiences are the most important thing for students just graduated. So working in a company you can learn from those experienced people as well as those projects. You may learn the basic knowledge about how to run a company such as finance, accounting and the law. Also, working with a lot of people in a certain field helps you to have a better social circle witch may be a vital factor if you run your on business someday. Furthermore, you will get communication skills efficiently in a company since you have so many people to deal with. So being an employee first will be my choice. (121 words)</p>

          <p>I would prefer to work for others’ompany. First, right now I am a college student; I have neither sufficient social experiences nor adequate funding to set up my own business, and I think it is just too risky and unnecessary for me to rush into a business of my own now; second, working in others’ company offers me a lot of advantages, like I can learn systematically in a big company; its operation mode and management system are supposed to be mature; even though I have less freedom in putting my ideas into reality, collaborating with other senior workers helps me to accumulates needed social and work experience.</p>

          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>For me, I would prefer to work for a company first. When I just get started, just after graduation, what I lack must be experience. I need years of practice and observation to understand how the market works and to acquire basic skills. And maybe if there's a chance in the future, after learning what I should about the business I'm interested in, I would consider opening up my own business. Besides, I'm not a very confident person to take all the risks in the market, running a company means both freedom and responsibility. In this case working for a company just seems safer. So chances are, I mostly choose to be an employee rather an employer. </p>
