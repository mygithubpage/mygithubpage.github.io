          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>Well, for me, I think the most beneficial function of a smart phone is to record lectures. As a college student, I have many classes to attend. Besides five compulsory courses, I also have to take four optional courses. But sometimes the professor speaks so fast that I can’t catch up with him very well. Now with my smart phone, I can record lectures and write up notes after class. I don’t need to worry if there’s no time for me to take notes in class, so I can concentrate more on the lecture. Also, the recordings will be useful for review at exam time. Last semester, I recorded all the lectures of my economics course and I reviewed these audio recordings before the exam. Finally I got an A+ on the test. (133 words)</p>

          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>I think listening to music can benefit students most. There are two reasons to illustrate my idea. Firstly, students are under heavy academic pressure, we have to take classes for 8 hours a day and do homework after class, so we are desperate for relaxation and listening to music during class breaks can certainly help us to unwind and blow off steam; second, music is magical, which offers us a lot of inspiration, like every time if I am stuck in math, a short period of immersion in piano tunes can help to calm down my nerves and crack the problem.</p>

          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>In my point of view, listening to music is most beneficial to students when they use their smart phones. The reasons are as follows. First, listening to the music is an effective way for students to relax themselves. It is the fact that nowadays students are quite busy with their schoolwork for nearly whole week. So in their limited spare time, it really helps students release their stress from study by choosing some sweet and beautiful songs or music to listen and allowing them to forget their heavy study tasks for a little while. Besides, music can please almost everyone, but not all the students like taking photos and it s unnecessary for most of them to record lectures with their smart phones.</p>

          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>I think it depends. If the company is small, and the people were already familiar with each other before they teamed up to work in the company, then a close friendship can be motivational and guarantee efficiency and competitiveness; but if the company is large, like a conglomerate listed in the stock market, in that situation, it is neither possible nor necessary for the boss to keep a close friendship with employees. The boss has too many fish to fry and the employees just need to follow the rules and be professional.</p>

          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>Well, I disagree with the statement. Because managers who try to be friends with their staff run into all sorts of problems. A manager’s job is to evaluate staff’s work, give them feedback and make decisions. If the boss makes friends with a certain employee. Others will think the employee has an unfair advantage at performance review time, thus resentment will start to build up. What’s more, when it comes time for promotions, an employee may have expectations that as a friend, the boss will promote him or her. While the boss should choose the best person for the job, not a friend. This could create tension in and out of the workplace.</p>

          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>Personally, I think a boss should form close friendship with employees.  Obviously, a deep friendship encourages team cohesion and staff motivation. When employees get difficulties in their works, managers will offer guidance and support to them. On the other hand, employees will also give sincere suggestions to their managers. Besides, employees and their bosses can learn from each other and seek common progress. For example, my boss is always strict with himself on his work, and he keeps a working log of what to do every day. I think it’s a good way to improve the work efficiency. So I learn the importance of time management and I also keep a working log now.  (114 words)</p>
