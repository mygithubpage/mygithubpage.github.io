          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>Apparently, eating a meal with a group of people would be my choice. The most important reason for that is I am totally a foodie. Eating with others means I could enjoy more types of food comparing with eating alone. For example, I like to find the new restaurant with my friends and coworkers on weekends in the downtown to try some new and yummy stuff, like my favorite hot pot. That is really the best time during the whole week. On the other hand, doing homework and listening to music seem like more private things to me. That is to say, I prefer to concentrate on both of these two things all by myself. For homework, it is more efficiently and with independent mind. As to say music, I could put all myself into the atmosphere and have a complete release.(142 words)</p>

        <p>Do you agree or disagree that it is important for young people to learn some domestic skills like cooking, sewing and taking care of children?</p>

          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>I totally agree with the idea that it is important for young people to learn some domestic skills. For one thing, it can help them to be more flexible and concentrated. Take me as an example, my mom taught me some simple sewing skills when I was like 12 years old so that my fingers become flexible and at the same time I began to calm down and concentrate on one thing for a rather long time. Later on, I became interested in some handcrafts making and painting, which really made my childhood happier and colorful. Moreover, doing something like taking care of baby and cooking could do great help for the parents, to release their pressure. Furthermore, those skills can make young people’s independent life easier in the future like they can cook for themselves homeland food when they study abroad.(142 words)</p>
