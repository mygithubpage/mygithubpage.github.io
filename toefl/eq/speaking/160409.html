          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>As far as I amconcerned, Leaving some time for group discussion in class has much benefit. Firstof all, it enables us to exchange ideas directly after teacherâ€™s instruction,which helps improve our learning efficiency and producing new ideas during thecourse of class. If we get confused, we can have someone to ask or discuss withat once. Moreover, when we discuss and argue with our partners, groupdiscussion also provides us a way to reduce negative emotions and improveinterpersonal communication skills. Talking with others, exchanging ideas,discussing and even debating has been proved as efficient ways to reducenegative feelings.</p>
