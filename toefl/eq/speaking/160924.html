          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>In my point of view, many events held at school are positive. Only a few of them are negative at first but later on positive. In my school, all the students are required to take an very difficult English exam called CET Band Six, without that certificate, students won’t be able to graduate from the school. Initially, we felt frustrated and rebelled towards the requirement because we were art students, most of whom are not good at language learning. But we had no choice, we had to study much harder for it, months or even years later, most of us passed the exam. We got a stong sense of accomplishment and felt very proud of ourselves.</p>

          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>A few weeks ago, the dormitory service center announced a declaration that the power supply will be restrict from Monday to Friday and they would turn off the power in our room at 11 o’clock in the evening, instead of supplying the power the whole night. At first, almost everyone did not agree with this decision, because it brought us a lot of troubles. For example, we can’t charge our mobile phone any more. Sometimes, we can’t learn and do the assignments of our courses until midnight. However, after I get used to this new rule, I’ve never left my homework to the midnight. Furthermore, I go to bed earlier every night and get up early for exercising ever morning. (119 words)</p>

          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>I prefer to take exercise or go to gym when I have free time. First, a lot of people, including myself, can’t leave a specific period to exercise each day. From Monday to Saturday, I have to spend five to eight hours on my courses, with a few hours more on my assignments. Second, taking exercise each day will place my body and my health under great pressure, so I think the amount of exercise exceeds my body capability. Third, I always walk or ride a bike to attend a class instead of driving, and I think of these two ways a type of exercise. At last, I always play basketball with my friends on Sunday and I think I take enough amount of exercise. (125 words)</p>

          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>Well,I prefer to take exercise when I have free time. Because first of all, I am very busy studying all kinds of courses. I want to strengthen my body but I really have no regular time for it. So working out when I am free becomes the only choice when it comes to the issue of exercise. Second, some sports field like swimming pool , tennis court and so on are not available everyday, we can only choose several days a week to do the sports. Besides, playing sports too frequently makes people tired easily, I think exercising three times a week and one hour per time is enough and better.</p>
