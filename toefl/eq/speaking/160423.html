          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>From my own perspective, I consider the sense of self-respect as the most important thing for parents to deliver to their children. There are several reasons. Firstly, we people need to learn to love ourselves and respect ourselves before showing respect and sympathy to other. It is a natural sequence for us to follow. Only in this way, can we enjoy our lives thoroughly with wisdom and richness. The second point that praises self-respect is that the world around us is quiet chaotic to tell good from bad and we have to find answers in every stage of life so as to keep going on. It is then we start to realize that respect for ourselves is what makes us us.</p>

          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>I would spend a lot of money on traveling to place of interests for entertainment and study. Firstly, entertainment, the multicolored world is a place worth digging for treasures. What we haven’t seen and what we haven’t taste or witness are all to discover. Imagine that when you are standing among the ancient or modern spectacular sights fully immersed into the cloud, it is what the real enjoyment stands for. Besides, during the journey of the trip, the culture background and other travelers’ experiences are worth learning. Basically, we travel while grow along the way.</p>
