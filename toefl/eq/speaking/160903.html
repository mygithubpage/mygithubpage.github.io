          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>For me, attending Italian lectures or classes is the best way to get to know Italian culture, cuz I can learn a whole lot from the lecturer. I mean, usually the lecture is given by a learned professor or some well-known expert who's been studying a certain field for like decades. I'm sure I can get some insightful ideas from them. Plus I can choose to attend whatever lectures I am interested in, like I can attend an Italian history lecture if I want to learn something about the past of Italy, or I may just join an art class if, say, I want to know something about the famous paintings by some Italian artist like Da Vinci.</p>

          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>Well, I prefer to wait for a while before I finally decide whether to purchase a newly-released e-product or not. I guess it's a more rational choice since, well, sometimes the newly-released e-product may turn out not as good as I have expected. I mean, I can get some comments or feedback from those who buy the new product immediately when it's released about how well the new product can perform. The thing is, chances are the new product may not function very well, like if it's a new cellphone, it may get pretty slow when the user is playing games, and that's a drag. In that case, I won't buy it, cuz it's not worth the money.</p>
