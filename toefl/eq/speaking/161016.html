          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>For me, open discussion about the conflict or disagreement would be a nice try, since it can help me and the friends involved to clarify our ideas at first, especially when it comes to misunderstandings caused by lack of communication. My roommate and I had a disagreement about the location of the new place we tried to rent. While I favored its distance to my workplace, my roommate didn’t like its environment. To solve this problem, what we could do was to share our thoughts, like what advantage of the community might have been overlooked, trying to compromise for the other’s sake a little bit.</p>

          <p>I think it better to choose the future career before entering the university. First, I think it is worthy to make every effort to take specialized courses and obtain certificates for the future career, by which students are busy learning rather than wasting time in the university. Second, university is the best place to enlarge a person’s vision so that they can get well prepared for future career physically and psychologically. Third, you can do many useful things in the university. You can attend many campus activities and volunteer in many organizations. These are helpful to raise a person’s consciousness of cooperation, in turn, it is a kind of improvement for future career. (113 words)</p>

          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>　To take some lessons before choosing one’s major seems wiser to me. The selection of one’s major is a huge decision, which should be backed with one’s first hand experience. The example of my brother would be a convincing example speaking of the bad influence caused by blind choices of major. He jumped into the area of Computer Science simply because it was a hot major. Soon after he started his studies did he find he was not for those intelligent machines. That is the reason why he now keeps telling me that taking lesson beforehand may give a better sense of what that major is really like.</p>
