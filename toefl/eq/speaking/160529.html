          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>The prohibition of using cellphone has both positive and negative effects on students. Merits are that cellphone is a useful tool for students in many aspects of their daily lives. The multifunction of a cellphone can be a lot help to them when it comes to checking new vocabularies and learning extra curriculum online. However, One the other hand, the misusage of this tool can be a disaster for students’ study and health. When they obsessively cling to it and get distracted by the information considered negative for students, chances are that their performance in study and also physical condition will both heading downward.</p>

          <p>I think there would be the following effects if mobile phones were forbidden; first, students study might be affected to some degree, coz they may lose a handy study tool, like when they come across a new terminology or English word, they wont be able to check them out as conveniently as before on their phones; also, if any emergency occurred, it might be difficult for students to get in touch with their families or friends for help, like when they got injured or lost in a new place. It could be dangeours.</p>

          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>From what I know, I would agree with the statement that students should get praised when their parents have a positive feedback of them from school. There are several reasons that I would point out here. Firstly, the motivation for students to continue to work hard as before or even harder than before, I would assume that the award is a stimulus to students who have a remarkable performance at school. It makes perfect sense for parents to do so. Secondly, the satisfaction for students to be happy, the tedious process of studying is really hard for students to take at school. If they can receive any kind of gift as the encouragement for their hard work, it will really make them feel relieved.</p>

          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>　I don't agree with the statement. First, it is true that kids might be tempted to behave well in school for getting money to buy whatever they want, but this kind of mechanism simply leads to pure money worshipping; who pays the money for kids born into poor families? What if one day the incentive no longer exists any more? Second, I think there are other alternatives to achieve this goal, like kids could be rewarded with interesting books or given certain honors if they behave well. In certain cases, money might be a magical expedient, but it is crucial for kids to be instilled with correct values.</p>
