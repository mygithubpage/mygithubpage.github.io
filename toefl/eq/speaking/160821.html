          <p>Life gets harder as you grow. It is when I started to make a living by myself that my awareness of the pressing status arouses. All concerning of life is coming like a torrent overwhelming my head. I was totally at a loss about handling these issues. Little did I know, that money comes from hard work, which is unknown to me when I actually got every cent from my parents during school time. Now, I have to learn the ways of standing up to life.

          <p>　I think adulthood is the most difficult period in one’s life. First,children and teenagers’ major tasks are to have fun and learn well in school. Those are basically all they need to fulfill. But for adults, they have to shoulder more responsibilities. For example, they need to make money to support their family, spend time to educate kids while take care of their aging parents at the same time. They also have to compete fiercely in workplace for promotion or a pay rise. Thus, they have little time for themselves. Especially in the cosmopolitan cities like Beijing, where the living standards are exorbitant, and the living pressure for adults is overwhelming.</p>

          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>I would support the statement by the following points. Firstly, business is partially about interacting with people, in which interpersonal skill plays a real critical role. For a negotiation between two firms, the process of getting to know each other’s needs is on the top of the list. In order to get to that point, the languages and behaviors the head of the firm use matter a lot to show its kindness and respect to the counterpart. Being friendly and out going is one of the keys during the whole process. Secondly, for the harmonious phenomenon in the firm. You personality, to some extent, substantially affects the connections among these departments, like the manufacturing department and marketing. If the leader uses his charm in getting two of the departments cooperate in a project. Chances are high for the firm to succeed.</p>

          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>I do agree with the statement. Coz first, in workplace, those personality traits help to build up a good relation with others, like your clients, business partners, and employees, which means efficiency and sometime potential business opportunities; but if a person is too introverted, arrogant or bossy, others may feel discouraged to exchange ideas with him, that will lead to misunderstandings and even a strained relationship; second, those features also help to maintain a happy and harmonious family atmosphere, successful businessmen are usually very busy, so they should be more patient, caring and outgoing when dealing with family members who they love the most; a happy family life is just the precondition for a successful business career.</p>
