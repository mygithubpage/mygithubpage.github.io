          <p>Well, nowadays online shopping has become a popular shopping method. Of course it saves people time and money, but I think there are still some disadvantages. Firstly, many customers like to touch and see the products when they do shopping in order to test the quality of products. But shopping online doesn’t allow people to do so. For example, sometimes the product description and photos of the merchandise seem to be wonderful, but finally we find that the real product is of poor quality. Secondly, unlike buying at retail stores, online shopping requires people to wait for the items to arrive at home about 2 to 3 days or even longer. So people are unable to use the product instantly after they buy it.</p>

          <p>Although thought convenient to many people, shopping online could mean quite a lot of trouble. First, as a matter of fact, we can’t really feel and examine the product we are seeing. The result could turn out okay, also it could turn out far worse than our expectation. And instead of enjoying the moment of receiving a package in the morning, it could lead to the trouble of negotiating with the on-line store, sending back the package, and getting refund, etc. Hence, shopping on line could be as inconvenient as one can imagine. Besides, it’s easy to get addicted when there’re always sales and promotions on line. Some people think it saves money, but to my experience, a lot of my friends just end up buying tons of stuff that they don’t even need. So sometimes it’s just better to step in a real supermarket or department store. </p>

          <p>Truth be told, I do admit shopping on the Internet saves people money and time, but I am not addicted to it, and I think there are the following disadvantages, first, you cant guarantee the quality of the goods you purchased, a lot of times, what have been shown on the website are totally different from what you get later on. Like last year, I ordered a ski jacket online, coz it looked so nice, but when I got the real one several days later, it was shabby and of extremely low quality, it took me one week to return the goods and get refund, which was really troublesome. Second, I think shopping in a big fancy shopping mall brings us a lot of fun, like we can hang out with friends there, enjoy some nice food or even watch a movie after shopping, which is totally relaxing</p>

        <h4>Question</h4>
        <p>Do you agree or disagree the following statement? Older doctors are more knowledgeable than young doctors? Use specific details and examples to explain why.</p>

          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>I agree with the statement. Firstly, experienced doctors are more reliable, coz they have seen so many different cases in the past, so the chances that a new patient's syndrome be misdiagnosed are slim, the doctor may just prescribe the right doze of medicine for the patient, and heal the wounded and rescue the dying in time; second, though young doctors also have a lot of merits like they are quite knowledgeable and responsible, compared with senior doctors, they have more book theories than real life practice, and fewer working experiences, so if they haven't conducted enough surgeries in the operation room, how can they guarantee they are qualified for any emergencies popping up during in the treatment.</p>

          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>I think the statement it’s not necessary true. Sure, generally speaking, doctors need years of practice to be skilled, to be able to diagnose fast and cure terrible diseases. But for most of us, when we have minor discomfort and go to a hospital, we just want to be properly tended to. And young doctors can also do a good job. I remember one time my grandma had a severe stomachache and some of my family members took her to hospital. It was late at night, there wasn’t any high-ranked experienced doctors around, just a young doctor on duty. He was patient, nice, professional, and took quite good care of my grandma. In many cases like that young doctors are just as good as experienced ones. </p>
