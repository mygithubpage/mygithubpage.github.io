          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>Among the three presentation choices, I would choose to act out a play with my partner. As a literature major, I have been deeply entranced by dramas, accordingly, I'd rather consider acting as a form of amusement than regarding it as a job. To illustrate, I remember the first year in college, I made a rather unusual decision to deliver a performance on Shakespeare's Drama-Hamlet at New Year’s party instead of participating in student’s choir in singing. As a result, the decision paid off since I was granted an acting position at city's drama club, as a reward for my authentic and impressive performance. Ever since then, acting has become part of my daily ritual for my passion and adoration for it never dies out. (125 words)</p>

          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>I am in favor of working in a large corporation rather than a small firm because large corporations often are ruled and governed by stable regulations whereas small firm often undergoes management transformations in which causing employees time to adjust and adapt to the new leaderships. Take my brother Jim as an illustration, he used to work as a high-tech personal in a petite firm which was specializing in virtual reality technology. Initially he was so passionate about the job that he barely took any weekends off for his own pleasure, he was so determined that he'd be promoted with such exceptional skills and professionalism. But he was wrong, after a few years, he was spiritually and psychically worn out because the management seats were constantly going through changes and his promotions were never brought up on the agenda because the new supervisors always bring their own personals to take charge in company affairs. Consequently, Jim had no choice but to quit the old firm and join an elite corporation that has business dealings nationwide, his excellent work has soon to be spotted by the management and he was granted promotion in a short term. Therefore, I'm inclined to listen to my brother Jim and work in a large company with stable leadership. (213 words)</p>
