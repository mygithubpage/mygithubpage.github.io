          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>I believe many changes will take place in five years. To name a few, well first, as a high school senior, if things panned out, after five years, I would have finished my college education as a business graduate from UCSB. Not like what I am now - unequipped with any academic knowledge of the field I'm interested in - that time, I might already be working in a renowned company in Hangzhou, China. Second, I've always wanted to keep a pet but my mother doesn't allow that. Five years from now however, I think I would have my own apartment and I would finally be able to get a Dalmatian and two tortoises.</p>

          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>I think there would be the following differences, first my identity may has changed; right now I am a junior college student, majoring in marketing, in 5 years, I would have finished my post graduate study in my dream school, and initiated my career, perhaps in a big company in the US hopefully; second, I guess I would have become thinner, healthier and more attractive, coz I am taking a relentless work out plan and following a strict diet to lose weight and build up a better figure. I think only a healthy body could guarantee a wonderful performance in all areas of your life.</p>

          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>I think it’s better that the employer only checks on the employees occasionally. I mean, sure, the staff may make mistakes or dawdle or act in other inappropriate ways sometimes, but that’s only being human. What an employer needs to do is to make business plans, set rules and standards to let the employees follow. If anything needs attention or goes wrong, there should be managers of different purposes to directly supervise and take control. However, if an employer always appears in the workplace of his/her staff, that might put too much pressure on the employees which may in turn decrease their working efficiency and creativity. It’s also not a good way to maintain the employer’s image of authority. I think a bit distance is always good.</p>

          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>　I disagree with the statement, coz employees are adults already not kids, they could tell what is right and what is wrong, and know the importance of behaving well in workplace; the only reason they don't work hard enough or get slack is a lack of motivation or respect, so strict supervision only encourage resistance instead of efficiency, after all you cant treat your employees like slaves; so I think a great boss should really consider creating a good work environment for employees, like picking the right person, designating work load wisely, providing a level play field, giving them sufficient freedom and trust, that is the smart way to win in this throat-cutting society.</p>
