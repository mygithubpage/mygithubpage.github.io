          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>Well, I would choose to work as a librarian in summer vacation. First, I have an intimate feeling for books since I was a little girl; Books are always my best pastime, and my favorite place on campus is always the school library. Thumbing through those novels, poems, and magazines after finishing schoolwork brings me the most joy and pleasure. Second, I am quite introverted, and I really admire a quiet work environment. If I can work as a librarian, I could have the ideal working environment and at the same time, helping others to check out books certainly makes me proud.</p>

          <p>I would go for the second choice personally. Firstly, I am majored in mechanical engineering. So this is a perfect chance for me to test these theories that I learnt in classes. Like I was looking forward to working with one of the experienced teacher in our department to adjust the pressure in the cylinder. One the other hand, I think this job is much cooler than the rest of the alternatives. Desk front is kind of stupid. All you are doing is sitting and answer the questions and only get soreness after a day of work. Painting a wall is not my thing.</p>

          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>Among these three choices, I fancy working as a librarian the most. To start off, as you see, I can’t actually draw or swim well enough to save people from danger and I do love reading books. In other words, this is a practical option for me, since I can handle everything involved being a librarian, like helping people to locate the volumes they want, checking out and stacking books, or just offering any information people are trying to find out. Plus, as a bookworm, I am quite omnivorous. I guess I can grasp some valuable editions on different subjects to enjoy some reading while I’m free.</p>

          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>　I would try to start a project as early as possible. Because an early-start leaves us sufficient time and energy to improve and revise, so the quality of the project could be better guaranteed; an early start also allows us to follow a systematic plan and enjoy an unhurried schedule. Actually, I used to procrastinate a lot, and a lousy time management only leads to bad consequence. I remember I was once invited to attend a high-level school presentation contest. So many things were distracting me at the time and I waited until the night before the deadline to start writing my speech, and the result was a nightmare. My mind went blank automatically when I was on the stage, which was totally embarrassing.</p>

          <p>　　I prefer to get my assignments done right before the deadline. I had ever watched a TED video, which is about procrastinating and being lazy. Submitting the assignments just before the finishing line is not a sign of being slothful, while it is another way of being perfect. You actually spent more time than those who turned their work long before the dead line. I usually spend much time in preparation and thinking before I get started. Of course I will hand in my final draft late than the rest of my class.</p>

          <p>　My preference goes to starting my project the minute I get it. This would help me to make sure that I have adequate time to finish it with high quality. I develop my routine from my own experience, like working on my papers. To be frank, I used to procrastinate until the approaching due day. And you can picture how disastrous it got, with all those work of searching for information, on and off line, deciding on the topics, talking to the supervisor, and the like. So it is natural that I got terrible feedbacks from my teachers. Now I’ve learnt the lesson, to ensure high quality, you must embark on your job as soon as possible.</p>
