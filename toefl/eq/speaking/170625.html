          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>Personally I would like to have an interview with a successful businessman. Coz it seems <b>they have some special characteristics that are worthy of learning</b>. Like, <b>they have an insight into</b> what the market is demanding in the near future, so they will be able to act in advance and make a good fortune. For example, in 1998, Mr. Ma Hua teng, the current Tecent CEO, foresaw the great popularity of instant messenger in mainland China market, so he established Tecent Co. with a bunch of partners, and invented the most popular software QQ. It turned out to be one of the greatest successes that Chinese people have ever witnessed. So if I have a chance to interview him, I’d like to ask how he analyzes the market and makes breakthrough decisions.</p>

          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>I prefer to write report about a popular professor. The main reason is that people read about businessmen <b>every day and it's usually the same old rags-to-riches stories</b>. <b>In addition, not all people are interested in arts so they aren't very attracting to readers</b>, whereas professors have different expertise and <b>sometimes the information they provide can be useful to students who aren't majored in that field</b>, so most students might want to read about them, especially when students are not sure which elective courses to take. By providing some info on the professors, students can better know whether to take this professor's classes or not.</p>

          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>Personally, I agree that children born with talent should be treated in a different way. Because they are the potential experts in various fields in the future, so they should be put together in a specific institute for special training, which <b>will inspire their potential to the best</b>, thus <b>people can make fully use of it in the hope of</b> making breakthroughs in some fields. I remember that my younger cousin showed a talent in drawing when she was little, so her father, my uncle, sent her to a school that focus on enhancing the ability of painting. Although her academic performance was not very excellent all along, her technique of drawing has been perfecting. Now she became a famous interior designer in Guangzhou and has created some brilliant projects.</p>

          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>Generally I believe every child is different from one another in certain ways, and they should all be dealt with accordingly in order to become whatever they want to be in the future. But at the same time there's a set of fixed rules and principles for all ways of education to stick to so that kids can make use of what they have in the right way and understand the social structure they are in so that their behavior will be accepted by the people around without any problems. So I think what education should be focusing on here is not how to be different but how to do it right!</p>
