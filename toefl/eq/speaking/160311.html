          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>Well, totell you truth, as a student, my biggest problem should be having too muchhomework to do and having no time for myown hobbies. Especially when I entered the senior high school, nearly every dayI am overwhelmed in piles of papers and exercises in order to get a good gradein the College Entrance Exam. My holidays and weekends are always spent ingoing back and forth to the various tutoring classes. As you know, there’s notime left for me to do anything I like, such as painting and sightseeing. But Inever complain about my life. In my opinion, everyone meets difficulties andfrustrations in his or her life. We should take an active attitude towards thehardship and say “It is verygood”, because we seize the opportunity to trainourselves. When finding someone in trouble, we should say with concern “Do you have any difficulty? Let me help youout!”</p>

          <p>From where I stand, I think the university should build a cafeteria with a lot features to attract more to come to rest. Firstly, cafeterias on campus are places for students to rest legs and study most of the time. Students sit together in a circle having sandwiches while talking about the assignments and experiments, in which the atmosphere would be quite harmonious. As a result, a cafeteria will give students one more place to stay during the break of two classes either on the daytime or at night.</p>

          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>I agree that it is moreimportant to maintain good relationship with family members due to thefollowing reasons. First of all, family members are not alternative. Forexample, we only have one mother, whether you can get on well with her or not,you can’t deny the fact that she is your mom whom no body else in this worldcan take the place of her. The wise way to deal with the relationship betweenyou and your mom is to cherish and love the time with her .On the contrary, ifwe don’t have a good relationship with some friends, we also feel depressed,but the sad feeling won’t last long. Maybe just because we are not reallysuitable to be friends. But we still have other choice to make new friends whohave much in common with us.</p>

          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>　Well, personally, I think it is more advisable to get to know a person by long time observation. As the saying goes time tries all, and I think this is also true with regard of getting to know someone. One might not be able to learn the real characteristics or personalities of that person on the first sight since the person might be a little shy and he or she might not behaving in the way they normally do, and it is not very reliable since that person might have a bad day and he is kind of grumpy on that day, so you cannot conclude that he is a unhappy person. He was just angry because of the bad things happened on that day.</p>
