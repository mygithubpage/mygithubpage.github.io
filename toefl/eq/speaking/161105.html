          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>I think that the Smartphone has the greatest impact on students’ life. First, it helps us to learn much more efficiently; smart phones are kind of indispensable, like very time when I come across a new word or terminology, I always take out my phone to look it up from e-dictionary or get connected online to search for its background information; second, it helps us to unwind in a better way, like after long classes, we always take out our phones to listen to some music or watch some interesting video clips to have fun and blow off steam, so when we get back to study, we could have much higher efficiency.</p>

          <p>　From my point of view, I think smart phones influence our lives the most. For the starter, I use my phone so often that I would even assume that I couldn’t live without it for a day. I use it to call for a taxi, order food on line during the breaks and entertain myself with music and video players. Besides, I have to contact my friends and colleagues on my phone in Wechat and other social apps, so I actually cannot live without it concerning the possibilities that we may miss something to talk.</p>

          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>According to my own experience I believe smart phones have had the biggest impact on my life as a student because I use it most frequently and it helps me to have easier communication with people, and for the other two, frankly I don’t use them that often. Let me give you an example. I go to a school far away from my hometown and to commute daily or weekly between the school and my home would be an impossibility. Therefore, the phone becomes almost the only means I have to keep in touch with my family and I can tell you that it help me a great deal to combat the hardship living away from home just by myself.</p>

          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>I would consider smartphones to be the most influential and conducive technological invention among all as it not only facilities communication also promotes information exchange. On a global scale, number of people using smartphones will surpass 2 billion this year that constitutes more than one-quarter of global population. In China, almost all college students have been provided with the access to smartphones which enables us to correspond with families and friends instantly and smoothly regardless of distance and time differences. Considering smartphone is a diminutive, handy and portable object with a platform which offers all verities of apps specializing in social networking, news broadcasting, distance learning and so on, it has transcended laptop to be the most frequently used hi-tech product in terms of information acquisition as well as exchange. （130 words）</p>

          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>I am absolutely in favor of the statement that the most effective way of learning about a country’s culture is through watching television shows. TV show is a work of art that not only depicts the character’s behaviors and perspectives from all walks of life, also acts as vehicle delivering dramatists’ ideology. The production of TV shows is designated to combine visual elements and sound effects together serving as attraction for viewership which makes the process of learning as an amusing and entertaining approach that lasts for a longer period. In addition, the context and the setting of TV programs are diversified, delivering all verities of messages ranging from romance to science fiction, action to legal procedure which guarantees the audiences’ learning process to be comprehensive and fulfilling.

          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>I agree that watching a country’s TV shows is one of the best ways to learn about it. First, by watching its TV news programs, we learn what are the hottest issues in the country, regarding politics, military force, economy or culture, like who is the country’s current leader or what are its major party’s political strategies etc; Second, by watching its popular entertainment programs or soap operas on TV, we got the chance to have a closer look on common people’s preferences, like what are their likes and dislikes, and what is in fashion in the nation.</p>

          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>　I personally would not agree with this statement for the following reasons. Firstly, I would choose to travel to know a country and I think it’s a better choice than watching the local programs. I prefer to talk to the local people to know their daily lives and customs. It’s a more efficient and natural way to know a place. While when you are watching a TV program, sometimes it’s hard to get sense in the program when the context and the language are unfamiliar to you. With the gesture and the picture you see in front of me, I can incorporate all the elements into my understanding towards the place.</p>

          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>Certainly I would think watching the TV shows from a certain county is among the best ways of getting to know its culture because as far as I am concerned, TV shows are mostly based on people’s authentic experiences and it can surely serve as a kaleidoscope to observe into a culture. I remember spending several months in Istanbul a few years ago and I found it was actually quite difficult to really peep into the lives of ordinary Turkish people but then I stumbled across a Turkish TV drama about a typical local family and it quickly became my primary source of understanding the stories between ordinary people that were not told to the tourists.</p>
