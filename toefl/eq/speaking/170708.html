          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>I would definitely think that being a detective is the most exciting thing in the world. I got my favorite detective book series, The Adventure of Sherlock Holmes, as a gift of my 12th birthday, and I got fascinated with Mr. Holmes’s science of deduction. It’s like magic that he can deduce marvelous conclusions just out of tiny leads. So later on, I began to read more detective books and in recent years, I fell in love with the American TV series Elementary. When I imagine that I am a world renowned private detective and got invited to every crime scene in the world to assist CIA, or FBI, to solve tricky cases and put criminals behind bars, I just can’t resist the excitement of the fantasy.</p>

          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>　From the perspective of a female university-student-to-be, I disagree with this statement. The first thing is that, <b>university students are already adults and have the rights to enjoy</b> the sweetness of a relationship. Now with the male and female students living in the same hall, <b>they would have more chances to build up</b> strong relations <b>by having parties and social gathering events</b> in the lounge in dorms. If they are in separate halls, most of the time we can only see parties having merely girls or boys, which is boring. Additionally, girls sometimes need boys to help them with some heavy work like moving, carrying luggage, or providing labor when emergency happens. Just like the saying, a mix of Jacks and Jills makes a tough job a breeze.</p>
