          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>I was six when I started attending school. I was curious about everything, eager to learn. It was quite different from kindergarten,courses began and teachers were serious. It took me some time settling in but basically it was all fun and I never cried like many other kids did especially on Monday mornings. I enjoyed Chinese class the most, the teacher would encourage us to act out the stories we’ve learned. It was a good experience of learning and also making friends. Because you see we had to cooperate and rehearse,it was more of a game for us rather than just words and textbooks.</p>

          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>　I can tell you that the feelings are mixed, but I like it. First, there is this of sense of familiarity. Actually my parents were all teachers and I’ve been living there for several years before I started my kindergarten life. So everything was just normal for me, I don’t even have to adapt to it, I mean, the campus was quite familiar to me, the teachers were acquaintances of me and I’ve had loads of experiences of being in classes, of course not attending classes, just being there, don’t get me wrong. And then, there were these kinds of excitement, the feeling of getting text books of your own, being surrounded by a bunch of unfamiliar kids that were of the same age, and maybe also kind of funny, you know, looking at those teachers whom I knew of from quite young addressing from the podium.</p>

          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>Though I have no problem working in isolation, I think working in groups can offer more benefits. In work, it’s common to meet problems. If there’s no colleague to discuss with and to together come up with a solution, my work efficiency my decrease. Besides, in groups, I would learn about teamwork. It’s a spirit not only important in a work setting but also in quite a lot of aspects in life. What’s more, working independently may mean an alone personal life. Well that’s not like me, I like making friends. So working in groups provides me with far better chance to expand social network.</p>

          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>Some would argue that group work would expose us to different kinds of perspectives and thus help to spark some genuine thoughts out of us, but that’s often not the case, in fact, it blocks production, simply put, we could not talk all at once, and as a result, some ideas and some people won’t get heard, and there is ego threat, people who are afraid of looking stupid or foolish would get could feet, so they hold back on their most genuine ideas, and then, conformity, every group member wants to jump on the majority bandwagon as oppose to bringing in some radical, different ways of thinking, if one or two ideas tend to be popular than others. In short, working with others startles authenticities and smothers originalities. Therefore, I am in favor of working alone.</p>
