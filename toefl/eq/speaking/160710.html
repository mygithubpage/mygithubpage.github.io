          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>I personally would say that the government regulation is more crucial, essential and effective than individual effort. Reasons are as follows: Firstly, the environmental contamination is no small task for individuals to face up to. Though we can try hard to behave ourselves in many ways to contribute petty distribution to protect the environment, we still cannot change the current situation in a macro scale. Besides, government regulation has proven to be effective in our time. For instance, UN's framework convention on climate change had changed - emission status. </p>

          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>From my perspective, I consider learning the background of the city you live in is critical for a citizen. There are several reasons. Firstly, city attachment is sort of something we cannot live without as the sense of belonging to a country. You live and feel everything going on in the city and It gives you everything to grow and face up to the world. The other reason is that learning the history of a city you live in is a fun thing to do. It is like you are doing a research on something reachable and you actually help yourself to adapt to the place when you start to know every •p off So, it's pretty meaningful. </p>
