          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>Well, I would like to give him advice from several aspects. Firstly, he could be stressed mentally to some extend. I may suggest him to go for a walk after work everyday before going to finish or prepare stuff as often to refresh his mind, like pressing the reset button on him. Secondly, his daily routine could be a factor that causes his exhaustion after or during work. I would more likely to accompany him to workout in a gym to see if he can strengthen his muscle groups to be resistant to his painstaking job.</p>

        <p>Some people believe that it is the innate talents make a person an artist. While others think that it is the efforts a person put in that make the person an artist. Which do you prefer and why?</p>

          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>　In terms of the nature or nurture problem, I may say it’s the mutual influence that makes a person an artist. However, I think the inborn talent is more crucial than that of the effort. Firstly, art appreciation requires an advanced value and an appreciation system, which are not frequently seen among the public and it is different from other tasks that the experiences could be accumulated over the course of lifetime. Secondly, the primitive attitude toward art and ability in approaching an art piece cannot be acquired in a systematical learning.</p>
