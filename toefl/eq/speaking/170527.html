          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>Well, the first suggestion is that she can participate in some local activities like community service, voluntary work and stuff. Because <b>it is a great chance for her to meet nice people and perhaps they will become her friends later</b>. Like she can volunteer at the animal shelter and make friends with people who also love animals, and are as caring as her. Additionally, she can also <b>join an interest club</b> to not only <b></b>, but <b>also meet new people with the same interest as hers</b>. And since she can <b>do something she’s good at in the club</b>, I believe she <b>will have more confidence in socializing with strangers</b>.</p>

          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>　Well, I would definitely choose to study less and get a full night’s sleep. Primarily, I am a person who always pays attention to classes and finishes all my assignments and tasks on time with high quality. By that I mean I don’t necessarily need to bone up on books. What I need to do is just briefly reviewing some key points and concepts to evoke my memory. Additionally, having a high-quality sleep <b>is crucial to good performance on exams</b>, coz my brain will be charged with full energy by a good night’s sleep, which <b>enables me to focus on the exams and think thoroughly</b>, whereas having not enough rest will make my mind slow and dull.</p>
