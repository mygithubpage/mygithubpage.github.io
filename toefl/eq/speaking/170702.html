          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>I personally would like to get involved in the writing activity for some reasons. I remember I got my favorite detective book series, The Adventure of Sherlock Holmes, as an award when I won the third place of the elementary school’s composition competition, and I got fascinated with Sir Arthur’s brilliant narrative and context. So back then, I made up my mind to improve my writing ability and create some great stories later. I think writing is a process of exposing ourselves to extensive readings, and enhancing our abilities of organizing, analyzing, language using, etc. So attending the writing activity would be an effective way for me to improve writing techniques, and probably realize my childhood dream one day, you know, being a writer or something.</p>

          <p>I cannot agree more with this statement. Actually I am a fan too,and I have my own idol Leif, who is a renowned actor in China. Because he has been a hot discussion for years, he is envied by a whole lot other counterparts. The malevolent people hire paparazzi to follow him and take pictures of his private life, like when he is with his friends, his family, and even his girlfriend, and then they would make up negative news about him so as to ruin his public reputation, which has been constantly annoying him. There is a saying among us fans: stay close to his works and stay away from his life. We should not deprive the popular people’s right to have a little privacy.</p>
